Georgetown's student athletes have a 94% graduation success rate, and over one-hundred have gone on to play professionally.\nThe school's teams are called \"Hoyas\", a name whose origin is uncertain. Sometime before 1893, students invented the mixed Greek and Latin chant of \"Hoya Saxa\", translating roughly as \"what (or such) rocks.\" The school's baseball team, then called the Stonewalls, began in 1870, and football in 1874; the chant likely refers to one of these teams. By the 1920s, the term \"Hoyas\" was used to describe groups on campus, and by 1928, campus sports writers started using it instead of the older team name, the \"Hilltoppers.\"The men's basketball team is particularly noteworthy as it won the NCAA championship in 1984 under coach John Thompson. The team has the record for the most Big East conference tournament titles with eight, and has made thirty NCAA tournament appearances. Georgetown's NBA alumni are collectively among the highest earners from a single program.The sailing team has won fourteen national championships since 2001, as well as one World Championship in match racing.

The rugby club team also made it to the Division II Final Four in 2005 and 2009. In 2019, Georgetown won the women's team championship at the United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association national tournament held at Syracuse University.Former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon \"Gordie\" Ernst, one of several people implicated in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, is alleged to have facilitated the admission to Georgetown of as many as 12 students through fraudulent means while accepting bribes of up to $950,000. Ernst had relocated to the University of Rhode Island, where he was placed on administrative leave after he was charged and arrested. He later pled guilty to conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery, three counts of federal programs bribery, and to filing false tax returns for failing to report many of the bribery payments.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Muntz Street ground was adequate for 1880s friendly matches, and the capacity was gradually raised to around 30,000, but when several thousand spectators scaled walls and broke down turnstiles to get into a First Division match against Aston Villa, it became clear that it could no longer cope with the demand.Director Harry Morris identified a site for a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile (1 km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies are known to have camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.\n\nThe original capacity of St Andrew's was reported as 75,000, with 4,000 seats in the Main Stand and space for 22,000 under cover. By 1938 the official capacity was 68,000, and February 1939 saw the attendance record set at the fifth round FA Cup tie against Everton, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the Chief Constable ordered the ground's closure because of the danger from air raids; it was the only ground to be thus closed, and was only re-opened after the matter was raised in Parliament. It was badly damaged during the Birmingham Blitz: the Railway End and the Kop as a result of bombing, while the Main Stand burnt down when a fireman mistook petrol for water.\nThe replacement Main Stand used a propped cantilever roof design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators' view of the pitch. Floodlights were installed in 1956, and officially switched on for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in 1957. By the early 1960s a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, roofs had been put on the Kop and Tilton Road End, and the ground capacity was down to about 55,000.Resulting from the 1986 Popplewell Report into the safety of sports grounds and the later Taylor Report, the capacity of St Andrew's was set at 28,235 for safety reasons, but it was accepted that the stadium had to be brought up to modern all-seated standards. After the last home game of the 1993\u201394 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolished \u2013 fans took home a significant proportion as souvenirs \u2013 to be replaced at the start of the new season by a 7,000-seat Tilton Road Stand, continuing round the corner into the 9,500-seat Kop which opened two months later. The 8,000-seat Railway Stand followed in 1999; ten years later, this was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club's appearance record-holder and former manager, but the Main Stand has still to be modernised. In 2021, the club website listed the stadium capacity as 29,409.In 2004 a proposal was put forward to build a \"sports village\" comprising a 55,000-capacity City of Birmingham Stadium, other sports and leisure facilities, and a super casino, to be jointly financed by Birmingham City Council, Birmingham City F.C. (via the proceeds of the sale of St Andrew's) and the casino group Las Vegas Sands. The feasibility of the plan depended on the government issuing a licence for a super casino, and Birmingham being chosen as the venue, but this did not happen. The club have planning permission to redevelop the Main Stand, but club and council continued to seek alternative sources of funding for the City of Birmingham Stadium project.In 2013, the Birmingham City Supporters' Trust's application for listing St Andrew's as an Asset of Community Value (ACV) \u2013 a building or other land whose main use \"furthers the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community\" and where it is realistic to believe it could do so in the future. \u2013 under the Localism Act 2011 was approved by Birmingham City Council. This requires any proposed sale to be notified to the council, and provides for a six-month moratorium on that sale to allow the Trust and other community groups to submit their own bid. In 2018, the club's owners agreed a three-year sponsorship deal under which the name became St Andrew's Trillion Trophy Stadium.The lower tiers of the Tilton and Kop stands were closed for asbestos-related repairs for approaching three years, reopening fully in November 2023. In 2024, the stadium was renamed St. Andrew's @ Knighthead Park for sponsorship reasons, as \"step one in [the owners'] plan to create a world-renowned 'Sports Quarter' in Birmingham.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Russia House doesn't sweep you off your feet; it works more insidiously than that, flying in under your radar. If it is like any of its characters, it's like Katya. It's reserved, careful to declare itself but full of potent surprises. It's one of the year's best films.\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote: \"At its best, The Russia House offers a rare and enthralling spectacle: the resurrection of buried hopes.\" Time Out less enthusiastically wrote: \"Overtaken by East-West events, and with an over-optimistic ending which sets personal against political loyalty, it's still highly enjoyable, wittily written, and beautiful to behold in places, at others somehow too glossy for its own good.\"Tom Stoppard's adapted screenplay was criticised by Vincent Canby in The New York Times: \"There is evidence of Mr. Stoppard's wit in the dialogue, but the lines are not easily spoken, which is not to say that they are unspeakable. They are clumsy.\" Roger Ebert held a similar view in the Chicago Sun-Times: \"What's good are the few emotional moments that break out of the weary spy formula: Connery declaring his love for Pfeiffer, or the British and Americans getting on each other's nerves. But these flashes of energy are isolated inside a screenplay that is static and boring, that drones on lifelessly through the le Carr\u00e9 universe, like some kind of space probe that continues to send back random information long after its mission has been accomplished.\"Sean Connery was praised for his portrayal of Barley, \"bluff, incorrigible, jazz-loving... his finest performance in ages.\" Variety wrote: \"As the flawed, unreliable publisher, Connery is in top form.\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone thought he captured \"the 'splendid quiet' that le Carr\u00e9 found in Blair.\" Hal Hinson in The Washington Post wrote: \"This may be the most complex character Connery has ever played, and without question it's one of his richest performances. Connery shows the melancholy behind Barley's pickled charm, all the wasted years and unkept promises.\" Desson Howe, also in The Washington Post, wrote: \"Sean Connery, like Anthony Quinn, takes a role like a vitamin pill, downs it, then goes about his bighearted business of making the part his idiosyncratic own.\" However, he received criticism from the New York Times, who thought that the \"usually magnetic Mr. Connery... is at odds with Barley, a glib, lazy sort of man who discovers himself during this adventure. Mr. Connery goes through the movie as if driving in second gear.\"Michelle Pfeiffer also garnered critical plaudits for delivering \"the film's most persuasive performance... Miss Pfeiffer, sporting a credible Russian accent, brings to it a no-nonsense urgency that is missing from the rest of the movie,\" according to The New York Times. Desson Howe in The Washington Post wrote: \"As Katya, a mother who risks her love to smuggle a document and falls for a Westerner in the process, her gestures are entirely believable, her accent (at least to one set of Western ears) is quietly perfect.\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote that \"Pfeiffer, who gets more subtle and incisive with each film, is incandescent as Katya.\" Hal Hinson in The Washington Post congratulated her for portraying a rounded character: \"Her triumph goes beyond her facility with the Russian accent; other actresses could have done that. She's great at playing contradictions, at being tough yet yielding, cloaked yet open, direct yet oblique. What's she's playing, we suspect, is the great Russian game of hide-and-seek. But Pfeiffer gives it a personal dimension. Katya holds herself in check, but her wariness, one senses, is as much personal as it is cultural -- the result, perhaps, of her own secret wounds. It's one of the year's most full-blooded performances.\" However, Pfeiffer also had her detractors. Variety thought that her \"Russian accent proves very believable but she has limited notes to play.\" Time Out wrote that \"Pfeiffer can act, but her assumption of a role for which her pouty glamour is inappropriate \u2013 a Russian office-worker seen rubbing shoulders in the bus queues \u2013 is a jarring note.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The oak tree is a symbol of England: the Royal Oak symbol and Oak Apple Day commemorate the escape of King Charles II after his father's execution, when he hid in an oak to avoid detection by the parliamentarians before safely reaching exile.\nThe Royal Arms of England, a national coat of arms featuring three lions, originated with Richard the Lionheart in 1198. It is blazoned as gules, three lions passant guardant or and it provides one of the most prominent symbols of England. England does not have an official national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has God Save the King. However, Jerusalem, Land of Hope and Glory (used for England during the 2002 Commonwealth Games), and I Vow to Thee, My Country are often considered unofficial English national anthems. England's National Day is 23 April which is Saint George's Day: Saint George is the patron saint of England.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He wants his party to be amazing, but that might not happen because his parents are splitting up as his father starts to fall in love with a stewardess, causing his mother to file a divorce against her husband (\"Thirteen/Becoming A Man\"). Just as Evan thinks that maybe things will be fine, his mother calls to tell him they are moving to Appleton, Indiana. Once there, Evan finds a friend in his neighbor, Patrice, who develops a crush on Evan while telling him about Appleton, Indiana (\"The Lamest Place in the World\").\nLater that month, Evan meets Brett Sampson, the most popular kid in school, along with his goons, Malcolm and Eddie, and tells Brett and his friends to take Kendra, a very pretty girl whom Brett wants to date, to a scary movie where Brett can do \"The Tongue\". Brett nicknames Evan \"Brain\" because of his idea. Later, Brett asks out Kendra, but Lucy, her jealous friend who has a crush on Brett, tries to tell Kendra she can't go (\"Hey, Kendra\"). When Brett tells Evan that the idea seems to have worked, Evan is thrilled; this means that Brett will come to his Bar Mitzvah party, and if Brett comes, everyone else will come. Patrice, however, is displeased. If she goes to the Bar Mitzvah party, nobody else will go because the other kids don't like her and Evan will be viewed as \"uncool\" for hanging out with her. Evan does not think that it will be that bad, but when he hands out the invitations, he sees that Patrice is right, and in a moment of panic, rips up her invitation so the popular kids will come (\"13 (Reprise)\"). As the other kids express their excitement over Evan's party, Archie, a boy with muscular dystrophy, enters and introduces himself. He is upset at Evan for humiliating Patrice \u2013 his best and only friend \u2013 but promises to help make it up to her if Evan gets him a date with Kendra. When Archie's attempts to use his degenerative illness to guilt Evan into getting him the date do not work, Archie tries to convince him that Evan is the only one who can get Archie the date and if he doesn't, Archie will show up to Evan's Bar Mitzvah party and ruin it (\"Get Me What I Need\"). Evan finally relents. Later, at cheerleading practice, Kendra teaches a new cheer while Lucy resolves to make Brett her boyfriend (\"Opportunity\"). Archie tries to talk Patrice into giving Evan a second chance, especially since she has a crush on him, but she has lost faith in him and is still upset at what he did to her (\"What It Means To Be A Friend\").\nIn class, Brett tells Evan to get his mother to buy them all tickets to \"The Bloodmaster.\" Evan protests that his mother will not buy them tickets to an R-rated movie, but Brett points out that if she doesn't, nobody will go to his Bar Mitzvah party and Evan will be uncool. Evan cycles through possible plans, eventually realizing that he will have Archie use his illness to guilt Evan's mother (\"All Hail the Brain/Terminal Illness\"). To make things better with Patrice, Evan asks her to go to the movie with him as a date. He then realizes that he \"just set Brett and Archie up to be on dates with the same girl, on the same night, in the same place....\" Evan makes Archie promise to do nothing more than sit next to Kendra so as not to screw up Brett's date. Archie agrees, and everyone prepares for Friday night (\"Getting Ready\").\nEveryone gets to the movie and Brett prepares for \"The Tongue.\" Lucy is on \"Tongue Patrol\" and Kendra waits for it along with Eddie and Malcolm. Amidst it all, Patrice is upset because Evan is not sitting with her; he is saving a seat for Archie (\"Any Minute\"). When Archie gets there, he pokes Brett with a crutch, and panic ensues: Archie squeezes his face, closes his eyes, and goes in to kiss Kendra, while Brett at the same time, turns his head, sticks out his tongue, and goes in for the kiss. Evan sees, and as he mouths \"Nooooo!\", reaches to pull Kendra back, while Lucy reaches for Kendra, too, but only so she can stop Kendra from getting the tongue. When Brett and Archie don't realize that Kendra is out of their way, their mouths meet. Kendra knees Brett in the crotch, trying to stop him from hurting Evan or Archie, after Archie reveals how Evan set him up on a date with Kendra. Brett breaks up with Kendra, and Lucy asks if Brett's \"tongue is still available.\" Meanwhile, Evan is left alone by Patrice (\"Good Enough\").\nAs Lucy and Brett begin dating, she forces him to spend more time with her. Brett's friends recognize that Lucy is good neither for Brett nor for them at all (\"Bad News\"). Evan promises to help to get Brett and Kendra back together so that he can get back on everyone's good side. Archie, fearing that this is a lost cause, begs Patrice to help Evan. She tells Archie she is not going, but he knows she's lying. When Patrice gets there, she surprises Evan by helping him help Brett, but instead of telling Brett what to say to Kendra, they end up telling each other that they are sorry, but Brett is oblivious (\"Tell Her\"). Brett takes their advice, and when he learns that Lucy and Kendra are fighting over him, he interferes and makes a feeble attempt to get Kendra back, and to his surprise, she forgives him. Meanwhile, Lucy learns of it and won't take the hit. She spreads a rumor that Kendra is cheating on Brett with Evan, and then gets Evan and Kendra in the same place so that Brett can catch them (\"It Can't Be True\"). Her plan works, and Brett lashes out at Evan. Evan, finally having enough of Brett, stands up to him and says that Archie and Patrice are his real friends. After Brett insults Archie and Patrice, Evan shoves him, and Brett punches him in the nose, giving him a nosebleed. Patrice immediately rushes to Evan's aid. Kendra shows kindness towards Archie before running after Brett. Evan wants to call off the Bar Mitzvah party because it would only be him, Patrice, and Archie, but Patrice and Archie point out it that won't be that bad, and Evan starts to agree. He surprises Patrice with a kiss, and she surprises him back (\"If That's What It Is\"). Evan has his Bar Mitzvah party after all; he is starting to understand what growing up means, and the characters tell of what surprises turning thirteen brought for each of them (\"A Little More Homework\").

Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up three to five yards behind the line of scrimmage and the defensive linemen.  They are the \"middle ground\" of defenders, playing closer to the line of scrimmage than the defensive backs (secondary), but farther back than the defensive linemen.\nAs such, linebackers play a hybrid role and are often the most versatile players on the defensive side of the ball; they can be asked to play roles similar to either a defensive lineman (such as stopping the runner on a running play) or a defensive back (such as dropping back into pass coverage).  How linebackers play their positions depends on the defensive alignment, the philosophy of the coaching staff, and the particular play the offense may call.\nLinebackers are divided into middle linebackers, sometimes called inside linebackers, and outside linebackers.  The middle linebacker, often called \"Mike\", is frequently the \"quarterback of the defense\".  His central role on the field means he is in the best position to call defensive plays and direct shifts and changes based on what the offense is doing.  Outside linebackers are often in a position to blitz, a defensive maneuver where the player rushes into the offensive backfield to disrupt a running play or sack the quarterback on passing plays.  Besides \"Mike\", other nicknames such as \"Sam\", \"Will\", or \"Jack\", are commonly used to refer to various linebacking roles.\nHistorically, some of the most impactful defensive players, such as Pro Football Hall of Fame members Chuck Bednarik, Dick Butkus, Jack Lambert, Ray Lewis, Ray Nitschke, Mike Singletary, Brian Urlacher, and Lawrence Taylor, were linebackers.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "560_157", "question": "What sport does Anderson play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_35325", "text": "The Guardian reporter Robin Denselow wrote that the album's lyrics are tougher than Anderson's \"distinctive ramblings on the mystic fringe\", and named \"Machine Messiah\" and \"Into the Lens\" as tracks that made Drama a distinctive album. Bill Carlton wrote in The New York Times that with Drama, Yes \"didn't take any chances alienating the faithful\" fans with a new wave or punk direction and \"news more like Yes than Yes\". Carlton wrote the album is \"full of their tried-and-true brew of orchestral, dramatic, art-rock extrapolations\" and is just as \"daring and fanciful\" as their previous albums. Carlton picked \"Tempus Fugit\" as his favourite. In the Los Angeles Times, John Mendelssohn wrote that Drama is \"infinitely more accessible\" than earlier Yes albums, \"still highly demanding listening\". In the same publication reviewer Steve Pond compared Dean's \"kitschy, dramatic land-and-seascape\" artwork on the album's sleeve to the music on it.\nPond considered Drama the most traditional Yes album in several years, proving to \"anxious fans\" about the line-up change that the new group can sound \"just like the old model\". He described Horn's vocals as at times \"uncanny\" to Anderson's. A review in The Philadelphia Inquirer gave Drama three stars out of four. With the new line-up, \"the results are quite pleasing\" with the band displaying greater vitality and strength than their more recent albums, with \"generally superb\" material. The review picked \"Machine Messiah\", \"Does It Really Happen?\" and \"Tempus Fugit\" as highlight tracks. George Kanzler in Tallahassee Democrat wrote that Yes still retained their \"patented group sound\" despite Anderson and Wakeman's departure, with high tenor vocals, \"rhapsodic\" solos, and \"brisk\" tempo changes. He picked out Howe's guitar work as the band's \"invaluable asset\" but said the lyrics \"are pretentious as always\" which focuses mostly on a mixture of light and dark imagery. Rolling Stone picked out \"Machine Messiah\", \"Tempus Fugit\", and \"Into the Lens\" as stand out tracks. It noted the addition of Horn and Downes in the band \"has not substantially altered the Yes sound, image or presentation. The high vocals, symphonic arrangements, and quasi-mystical lyrics are still there\". It pointed out the \"fresh new spirit\" of the group's playing, though commented that the Buggles' hit single \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" is more memorable than the album itself.Joe Konz, in The Indianapolis Star, wrote Downes is an \"adequate\" replacement for Wakeman but pointed out that Horn's voice does not work as well in certain sections, such as \"Into the Lens\". He picked out that track with \"Machine Messiah\" and \"Tempus Fugit\" as highlights, the latter containing what Yes \"does best\" with harmony singing, playing their instruments \"rampantly\", and making \"vigorous rock and roll\". On \"Machine Messiah\", the band \"assembles every kind of artillery that it can unload\" with its heavy metal opening and duel between guitar and vocoder which Konz compared to \"Dueling Banjos\" from the film Deliverance. He concluded with Drama being Yes's best in years. In a review written in the Fort Lauderdale News, Cameron Cohick thought Drama \"sounds exactly like Yes has always sounded. Frighteningly so\". The opening to \"Machine Messiah\" is compared to Black Sabbath fashion with its \"ponderous, droning riff\" and keyboard lines from Downes that he compared to Wakeman. He compared the overall mood of Drama to Fragile and Close to the Edge (1972) with \"relatively simple\" song structures, most with at least one good riff. Though he considered the lyrics are \"the usual quasi-cosmic tripe\", Cohick picked \"Run Through the Light\" as the album's best track which he compared to \"The Battle of Evermore\" by Led Zeppelin.Music critic Rick Johnson thought the group came up with a consistent album, summarising it as \"fairly solid stuff\". In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Paul Collins rates the album three stars out of five, writing: \"It rocks harder than other Yes albums\" and a \"harbinger of Yes and Asia albums to come\" throughout the 1980s. He points out Squire's \"emboldened\" and \"aggressive\" bass playing with White's drums, and Howe's \"more metallic\" approach. Collins picks out \"Machine Messiah\" and \"Tempus Fugit\" as the album's best tracks within an album of promising material.Former (and later) Yes singer Jon Anderson felt the album was \"not my idea of Yes\" and did not represent what the band \"truly is\", but was open to rehearsing songs from the record during his later tenures in the group, though his suggestions were declined.In 2014, Prog readers voted Drama the 100th best progressive rock album.Seven years later, in his memoirs, Howe recalled that \"Drama stands out in my estimation as a true classic Yes album. It speaks oceans about Yes music and the melodic adventures that we loved, a kind of accumulation of the previous decade, I'd say.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In particular, the pain is connected to Britt-Marie, the daughter of a vicar. Britt-Marie is still a virgin at 20, and she is engaged to a man named Jonas. Satan fears Britt-Marie may serve as an example to her friends to remain virgin, and opts to send Don Juan to seduce Britt-Marie. Don Juan is enduring what he considers a boring punishment: Repeatedly, a woman comes to him threatening to kill him, and he seduces her and takes her to bed. However, before any sex occurs, a demon emerges to say the \"show is over\", and the woman disappears. Satan comes to Don Juan, telling him he can go to Earth and if he seduces Britt-Marie, Satan will allow Don Juan to have a dreamless sleep, a relief from his punishment.\nDon Juan accepts the challenge, accompanied by his servant Pablo.

{"id": "560_162", "question": "What sport does penalty play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_4931", "text": "In the NHL, infractions that result in penalties include:\n\nAbuse of officials\nArguing with, insulting, using obscene gestures or language directed at or in reference to, or deliberately making violent contact with any on or off-ice official. This generally is issued in addition to other penalties or as a bench penalty against a coach or off-ice player, and is grounds for ejection under a game misconduct or match penalty in most leagues including the NHL.\nAggressor penalty\nAssessed to a player who engages in a fight with an unwilling combatant. This is independent of the instigator penalty, and both are usually not assessed to the same player at one time (in that case the player's penalty for fighting is usually escalated to attempt to injure, a match penalty).\nAttempt to injure\nDeliberately trying to harm an opponent, in any manner. This type of infraction carries an automatic match penalty.\nBiting\nCarries a major penalty (5:00) and Game Misconduct.\nBoarding\nPushing, tripping or checking an opposing player violently into the boards.\nButt-ending (or Stabbing)\nJabbing an opponent with the end of the shaft of the stick. It carries an automatic major penalty and game misconduct.\nBroken stick\nEngaging in play while holding a broken stick.\nCharging\nTaking more than three strides or jumping before hitting an opponent.\nChecking from behind\nHitting an opponent from behind is illegal. It carries an automatic minor penalty and misconduct, or a major penalty and game misconduct if it results in injury. See checking. This is generally allowed in the NHL unless it's covered by another infraction such as boarding or illegal check to the head.\nClipping\nDelivering a check below the knees of an opponent.  If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nCross-checking\nHitting an opponent with the stick when it is held with two hands and no part of the stick is on the ice.\nDelay of game\nStalling the game (for example, shooting the puck out of play from the defensive zone, holding the puck in the hand, refusing to send players out for a faceoff, or repeated deliberate offsides).  Starting in the 2004\u201305 AHL season and advanced to the NHL in the a year later, an automatic delay of game penalty is charged to goaltenders that go into the corners behind the goal line (outside a trapezoid-shaped area just behind the net) to play the puck. Some delay of game offenses, such as taking too long to send players to take a faceoff, are not punished with a penalty: instead, the official may choose to eject the centre of the offending team from the face-off circle and order him replaced with another player already on the ice. An unsuccessful coach's challenge will result in a minor penalty for delay of game for the first unsuccessful challenge and a double-minor penalty for each additional unsuccessful challenge.\nDiving (or \"embellishment\")\nFalling to the ice after a hit, exaggerating the effect of the hit in an attempt to draw a penalty for the opposing team.\nElbowing\nHitting an opponent with the elbow. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nEye-gouging\nCarries a major penalty and often a match penalty.\nFighting\nEngaging in a physical altercation with an opposing player, usually involving the throwing of punches with gloves removed. Minor altercations such as simple pushing and shoving, and punching with gloves still in place, are generally called as roughing.\nGoaltender interference\nPhysically impeding or checking the goaltender. Visually impeding the goaltender's view of the play with the body, called \"screening\", is legal; but at no time may a goaltender be hit or checked.\nGoaltender leaving the crease\nA goaltender may not leave the vicinity of his crease during an altercation. Once he has left the crease during an altercation, he may be given a penalty.\nHead-butting\nHitting an opponent with the head. A match penalty is called for doing so.High-sticking\nTouching an opponent with the stick above shoulder level. A minor penalty is assessed to the player. If blood is drawn, a double-minor (4 minutes) is usually called.  A common (yet false) belief is that blood drawn automatically warrants a double-minor. There is no such rule; this is, however, the precedent that has been in place for years.  Referees may use their discretion to assess only a minor penalty even though blood was drawn.  They may also assess a double-minor when blood is not drawn, if they believe that the player was sufficiently injured or that the offending player used excessively reckless action with his stick.  If a player, while in the action of \"following through\" on a shot, strikes an opposing player in the head or face area with his stick, high sticking is not called unless the referee can determine that the player taking the shot was deliberately aiming to strike the opposing player. A penalty is also not called when the puck is hit by a high stick, but play will be stopped and the ensuing faceoff will take place at a spot which gives the non-offending team an advantage. Also, a goal that is scored by means of hitting the puck with a stick above the height of the crossbar will not be counted unless it is done by a player of the defending team. (Note that the requirements for high-sticking the puck for purposes of allowing/disallowing goal is different from the other forms of high-sticking.)  NHL referees can use on-ice video review to confirm or overturn a double-minor high sticking call.\nHolding\nGrabbing an opponent's body, equipment or clothing with the hands or stick. Generally a minor; USA Hockey rules call for a major and a game misconduct for grabbing and holding a facemask or visor.\nHolding the stick\nGrabbing and holding an opponent's stick, also called when a player deliberately wrenches a stick from the hands of an opposing player or forces the opponent to drop it by any means that is not any other infraction such as Slashing.\nHooking\nUsing a stick as a hook to slow an opponent, no contact is required under new standards.\nIllegal check to the head\nAs of the start of the 2010\u201311 NHL season, any form of \"a hit to an opponent, where the player's head is targeted and/or the principal point of contact\" is punishable with a combination five-minute major penalty and game misconduct, due to the increasing concern following concussion injuries to NHL players following incidents such as David Booth and Marc Savard's concussions in the 2009\u201310 NHL season. A second incident of this type caused by the same player in a season (or post-season playoffs) results in an automatic suspension for the following game their team plays, with the potential for increasing durations of suspension from active play, for any subsequent checks to opposing players' head areas. The following season, it was changed to any hit to an opposing player's head that is targeted and the principal point of contact. An illegal check to the head is punishable with either a two-minute minor penalty or a match penalty. In the 2013\u201314 NHL season, the rule was clarified to \"A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head was the main point of contact and such contact to the head was avoidable is not permitted (known as illegal check to the head). As mentioned before, that is punishable with either a two-minute minor penalty or a match penalty.Rule 48 \u2013 Illegal Check to the Head\nIllegal equipment\nUsing equipment that does not meet regulations, either by size (length, width) or number (two sticks) or other guidelines (e.g. a goaltender's facemask can no longer be the \"Jason Voorhees\"-style form-fit mask, a skater may not have a stick with a curve exceeding 3/4\" (19 mm), nor may they play with a goaltender's stick (a goaltender may play with a regular player's stick). If a player (non-goaltender) breaks a stick, it is mandatory to drop the stick immediately and play without it until getting a replacement from the bench. Otherwise a penalty will be assessed to the offending player (some game summaries call this \"playing with a broken stick\"). In addition, in the NHL a player may not pick a broken stick up off the ground after it has been dropped (they can only receive a stick from another player or from the bench; goaltenders may not go to the bench but must have a stick carried out to them). This rule is generally not enforced in amateur leagues except for broken sticks or egregiously out-of-spec equipment, as the cost of acquiring gear that meets NHL specifications since a 2005 (and further in 2013) rule change is prohibitive, especially for goalies. Goaltenders will now receive a two-game suspension for the use of oversized equipment. Their teams will also be fined $25,000, the trainer will be docked $10,000, the coach and general manager fined $50,000 and the owner fined $100,000.\nInstigator penalty\nAn instigator of an altercation is a player who demonstrates any of the following actions: distance travelled; gloves off first; first punch thrown; menacing attitude. A player deemed an instigator will receive an instigating minor penalty. A player who instigates a fight in the final five minutes of a game (or in overtime in the regular season) will instead be charged a game misconduct and given an automatic one-game suspension. The length of the suspension would double for each additional incident. The player's coach will be fined $10,000, a penalty that would double for each recurrence.\nInterference\nImpeding an opponent who does not have the puck, or impeding any player from the bench. No contact is required under the new standards.\nJoining a fight\nAlso called the \"third man in\" rule, the first person who was not part of a fight when it broke out but participates in said fight once it has started for any reason (even to pull the players apart) is charged with an automatic game misconduct in addition to any other penalties they receive for fighting.\nKicking\nKicking an opponent with the skate or skate blade. Kicking carries a match penalty if done with intent to injure, but otherwise carries a major penalty and a game misconduct. (Under Hockey Canada rules, kicking or attempting to kick an opponent always carries a Match Penalty regardless of intent.)\nKneeing\nHitting an opponent with the knee. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nLeaving the penalty bench\nA penalized player who leaves the penalty bench before his penalty has expired, whether play is in progress or not, shall incur an additional minor penalty after serving his unexpired penalty. Any player who, having entered the penalty bench, leaves the penalty bench prior to the expiration of his penalty for the purpose of challenging an official's ruling, shall be assessed a game misconduct penalty. He shall also be automatically suspended for at least the next three regular league or playoff games of his club. A player exiting the penalty bench, or player's bench, during an altercation or for the purpose of starting an altercation will be given a game misconduct, and suspended the next 10 games.\nParticipating in the play beyond the centre red line (goaltender)\nA rare infraction, carries a minor penalty and is only assessed against the goaltender.\nPlaying with too many sticks\nWhen a player plays with more than one stick. For example, if a goaltender were to lose his stick and a player from his team skates over to pick up the goaltender stick and then, while skating back to the goaltender with both sticks, attempts to touch a live puck with either stick, will be called for Playing with too many sticks.\nRoughing\nPushing or shoving after the whistle has been blown or when it takes place away from the play (often called against a player from each team, resulting in a coincidental minors situation, but can also be called on a single player); also called when the hands make contact with an opponent's head/face on an otherwise legal check; called in non-checking leagues when a body check is made. Non-checking leagues may also refer to this as simply 'body checking'. In the NHL, a minor penalty for roughing is assessed when a player intentionally removes the helmet of an opponent. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nSecondary altercation\nThis infraction is not listed in the NHL Rulebook, but it is prevalent in the Central Hockey League (United States) and other minor leagues. It is most commonly issued when players engage in or attempt to engage in fight after the original fight (between two separate players). This infraction carries an automatic game misconduct penalty.\nSlashing\nSwinging a stick at an opponent, no contact is required under new standards. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nSlew footing\nThis occurs when a player uses his feet or knees to knock an opponent's skates out from under him with a kicking or leg dragging motion from behind. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result. Slew footing as a separate infraction does not exist in the USA Hockey rulebook as of 2005-2006.\nSpearing\nStabbing an opponent with the stick blade. It carries an automatic major penalty and game misconduct.\nStarting the wrong lineup\nThis very rare bench minor penalty is assessed when the offending team's starting lineup contains any player not listed in the lineup submitted before the game. For this to be called, the captain of the non-offending team must bring this breach of the rules to the referee's attention immediately at the first stoppage of play. Also the penalty may be assessed if a player is not put on the scoresheet at the beginning of the game and plays. The only way for this to be called is if the official scorer notifies the referee of this oversight.\nSubstitution infraction (Illegal Substitution)\nThis rare bench minor penalty is assessed when a substitution or addition is attempted during a stoppage of play after the linesmen have signaled no more substitutions (once the face-off is set) or if a team pulls its goaltender and then attempts to have the goaltender re-enter play at any time other than during a stoppage of play. Too many men on the ice and/or starting the wrong lineup can also simply be called a substitution infraction.\nThrowing the stick/Throwing stick/Throwing equipment\nOften accompanied by a penalty shot. If any player on the ice who throws his stick or any part thereof or any other object (i.e. equipment) in the direction of the puck or an opponent in any zone, except when such act has been penalized by the assessment of a penalty shot or the awarding of a goal then a minor penalty will be assessed. Should any player, coach, or non-playing person on the players\u2019 bench or penalty bench throw anything on the ice during the progress of the game or during a stoppage of play, a bench minor penalty unsportsmanlike conduct shall be assessed. Can be upgraded to game misconduct or match penalty depending on severity.\nToo many men on the ice\nHaving more than the allowable number of players (six, including the goaltender, if not already short handed) on the ice involved in the play at any given time. \"Involved in the play\" is key; players that are entering the ice as substitutes for players coming off (line changing) may enter the ice once the player returning to the bench is less than five feet from his team's bench (Rule 74.1); at that point the returning player is considered out of the play, even if the play passes in front of the bench, unless he actively makes a move for the puck. Players entering the ice are part of the play as soon as their skates touch the ice.\nTripping\nUsing a stick or one's body to trip an opponent, no contact is required under new standards. If injury results, a major penalty and a game misconduct will result.\nUnsportsmanlike conduct\nArguing with a referee, fan, opponent or teammate; using slurs against an opponent, teammate or fan; playing with illegal equipment; making obscene gestures or abusing an official, fan, opponent or teammate. Can carry either a minor, major, misconduct, game misconduct or match penalty, depending on the gravity of the infraction (for instance, using obscene language to a referee initially results in a minor, but making an obscene gesture to an opponent, teammate, fan or official carries a game misconduct.) Also, in some leagues the penalty progression is different for players and team officials (for example, in the USA Hockey rulebook players get a minor for their first infraction, a misconduct for their second and a game misconduct for their third, whereas the option of a misconduct is removed for coaches; in addition, after each penalty for  a team official, the penalty count resets itself). Unsportsmanlike conduct may also be called if a player drops gloves and stick in preparation for a fight, but the non-offending player does not drop the corresponding equipment and has committed no action (verbal or physical harassment) to attempt to instigate a fight. Since 2008, the NHL has ruled that standing in front of an opposing goaltender and engaging \"in actions such as waving his arms or stick in front of the goaltender's face, for the purpose of improperly interfering with and/or distracting the goaltender\" will draw a minor unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, a rule interpretation inspired by the play of Sean Avery against Martin Brodeur.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At the house, Pablo becomes enamoured with the vicar's wife, Renata. Don Juan meets Britt-Marie and attempts to seduce her, questioning her relationship with Jonas. She agrees to kiss him. The demon also stokes quarrels between Britt-Marie and Jonas, and Jonas leaves. During the night, Pablo seduces Renata. The demon appears to the vicar to tell him Renata is committing adultery, and gives him the key to Renata's bedroom. Instead of entering the bedroom, the vicar instead uses the key to lock the demon in his cupboard. The next morning, the demon tells the vicar he dreamed that while Renata slept with one of the vicar's guests, his daughter slept with the other.\nConcerned, the vicar runs to Britt-Marie's bedroom, but finds her alone there. Don Juan has fallen in love with Britt-Marie and is unable to seduce her in his usual fashion; Satan laments his defeat. After Don Juan returns to hell, Satan learns Britt-Marie has married Jonas, and he takes her virginity on their wedding night. This alone does not cure Satan's eye. However, Britt-Marie lies to Jonas, claiming she had never kissed another man; the lie heals Satan, giving him a minor victory. Satan decides to put Don Juan to sleep, decreeing he will dream of love, a cruel punishment.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The company set up to run the side entered administration before a game had been played, and as a compromise the word \"Newport\" was added to the team name in a double-sized font, whilst \"Gwent\" was reduced. This addition and choice of kit added a greater Newport emphasis to the region and polarised the regions' fan base: some supporters of Ebbw Vale, Pontypool, Cross Keys and Newbridge turned their backs on the regional side, claiming that Gwent was no longer being equally represented. This debate continued, with the Dragons being accused of favouritism towards their Newport feeder club rather than the other feeder clubs.The Newport Action Group, among others, claimed the side has lost more supporters by including the name \"Gwent\" in its title.

A Miss Walsh walks into the offices of Sally Lockhart's office (Sally is now working as a financial consultant) about some poor business advice Sally gave her; as a result Miss Walsh has lost her life savings. Sally vows to get the money back and investigate Anglo-Baltic, the company Miss Walsh lost all her money from. We also learn that Sally has a huge but lovable black dog called Chaka and that Frederick Garland (Sally's friend from The Ruby in the Smoke) is in love with Sally but that she is unsure of her feelings and so continuously refuses to decide on whether to marry him. Sally's friend Jim Taylor (now working as a stagehand in a local theatre) helps stage magician Alistair Mackinnon escape two men Mackinnon is certain plan to kill him. Jim takes Mackinnon to Frederick and Frederick's uncle Webster at their photography shop/private investigations office in Burton Street where Mackinnon proves to Jim, Webster and Frederick that he has spiritual abilities (he can see things having to do with an object by touching it) and tells them of a murder he saw by touching a man's cigar case. Mackinnon tells them that he believes that the man knows that he (Mackinnon) knows about the murder, and is therefore terrified for his life. Jim and Frederick go to a spiritualist seance as part of their work as private detectives. The seance involves the table shaking from side to side and objects being thrown across the room; the medium (a Mrs. Nellie Budd) also has trance during which she says things that connect to a mysterious business tied up to Anglo-Baltic called North Star. Frederick manages to get a photograph of Nellie's arms during the seance. Later, Frederick tells Sally what he has learnt. She tells him what she knows about the former owner of Anglo-Baltic and current owner of North Star, Axel Bellmann. Sally suspects that Bellman has manufactured Anglo-Baltic's collapse to fund North Star; she believes him to be very vicious.\nLater that week, Mackinnon is to perform at a charity event. He asks Frederick to come with him for protection. Frederick asks his aristocratic friend Charles to come with him as Charles can tell Frederick who the people at the event are. While performing, Mackinnon sees the man he believes to be after him in the audience. He gets the message to Frederick leading Frederick to find out that this man is Axel Bellmann. Frederick and Charles also come across Lord Wytham and his ethereally beautiful daughter Lady Mary. Mackinnon disappears, much to Frederick and Charles's annoyance. At Sally's office the next morning, Mr. Windlesham, an employee of Bellmann, tries to intimidate her and so stop her investigations into Bellmann but she refuses. In the meantime, we learn that Bellmann has made a deal with the almost-bankrupt Lord Wytham: if Bellmann marries Lady Mary Wytham, Lord Wytham's debts will be paid off. Wytham, repulsed by the deal, sees no option but to accept: if he does not, he will go to debtors' prison. Meanwhile, Frederick goes to Nellie to show her his photograph from the seance: it shows her using fake arms as well as wires to cause the table to move and the objects to be thrown. She responds cheerfully, but agrees to tell him more about her trances (which she claims are genuine). She cannot remember what happens during them; she has had them since she was young; she used to have them while her identical twin sister Jessie Saxon never did. Frederick tells her what she said during her trance. She says it sounds like nonsense and is surprised that he takes it seriously. Sally visits Bellmann and orders him to pay her Miss Walsh's lost money but he refuses. Unfortunately for Nellie, Sally drops Nellie's business card in Bellmann's office. Jim goes to look for Mackinnon and meets a woman called Isabel Meredith. She tells Jim that she is desperately in love in Mackinnon but knows he cannot be with her. She also tells Jim where Mackinnon is. Meanwhile, Charles discovers that Bellmann and Lady Mary Wytham are engaged. When investigating, Jim meets Lady Mary and immediately falls in love with her. She tells him that she cannot marry Bellmann and he gives her his card. Later, Isabel's room is ransacked by Bellmann's henchmen. Frightened, she tells them where Mackinnon will be performing but Frederick, Sally and Jim are able to save him by allowing him to get away from that venue so he is not harmed. Before he escapes, Sally demands he tell her the real reason Bellmann is after him. He tells her that he is Nellie Budd's son by Lord Wytham but then runs away from her (as well as the henchmen) before she can find out more. Isabel comes to stay in Burton Street.\nFrederick goes to see Nellie again but finds she has been attacked. She is taken to a hospital for treatment; there is doubt over whether she will survive. Windlesham pays a hitman to kill Sally. Meanwhile, Sally finds out that North Star is a weapons company that plans to build a massive \"Steam Gun\" capable of shooting thousands of bullets at once. Frederick learns how the Steam Gun works and comes across Nellie's sister Jessie in the north of England. He tells Jessie about Nellie's injury and Jessie tells him that Mackinnon is not Nellie's son but Nellie's lover. Jessie decides to go to Nellie. Frederick learns from a hostel owner that Mackinnon is married to Lady Mary Wytham. It becomes clear that Bellmann knows this and that is why Bellmann is trying to kill Mackinnon. It becomes clear that Nellie was not Mackinnon's lover and that it was Nellie who made Mackinnon's and Lady Mary's marriage possible. Windlesham's hitman tries to kill Sally but, unbeknownst to him, the woman he tries to kill is really Isabel and his knife gets stuck in her underclothing. He kills Chaka instead (and is himself killed) and Sally is devastated by Chaka's loss. Next day, Sally goes into her office to find it ransacked. Neither her landlord nor the police are helpful. Sally asks Frederick to help; Frederick and Jim manage to retrieve the stolen files from Bellmann's house. Sally realises that the Steam Gun is for use against one's own population. Jim (now aware of Lady Mary's marriage) meets Lady Mary in Hyde Park; they talk and, on impulse, briefly kiss. He advises her to make her marriage to Mackinnon public and she tells him where Mackinnon is hiding. Sally tells Isabel that Mackinnon is married, leaving Isabel quietly devastated. Jim and Frederick go to see Mackinnon and find him being attacked by Bellmann's henchmen. Jim and Frederick fight, with a moment of instrumental help from Mackinnon, against the henchmen, eventually knocking them out. They tie them up and send them in a cab to a police station. Mackinnon comes back to Burton Street. After everyone but Sally and Frederick are left alone together (with a brief interruption). Sally tells Frederick that she loves him and takes him upstairs whispering \"Not a word - not a word.\"  They sleep together, and afterwards Sally lets Frederick ask her to marry him, and agrees. Meanwhile, Windlesham and Bellmann have set fire to the building. Jim smells it and warns everyone else. Everyone climbs out of the window (Jim falls and breaks his leg) apart from Isabel who refuses to leave her room. Frederick climbs back up to save her but she refuses to move and the ceiling collapses, killing them both.\nAfter Frederick's body is found after the fire, Sally walks around in a daze. Unknowingly, she goes to the North Star headquarters and tells Bellmann that she is there to see him. Back in London, despite Jim's broken leg, he manages to walk to where Mackinnon is staying. Mackinnon sees where Sally is using his psychic powers and Jim makes him come to the North Star headquarters. Back at the North Star, Sally tells Bellmann that she loved Frederick and that Bellmann killed him. Bellmann tells Sally that he wants power and that he believes the Steam Gun will give it to him. He asks her to marry him, telling her that he thinks her a better match for him than Lady Mary would have been. At that moment, Mackinnon comes in to bring Sally to Jim. Sally tells Mackinnon to wait before agreeing to marry Bellmann in exchange for the money Miss Walsh lost from the collapse of Anglo-Baltic. Bellmann gives the money to Sally who tells Mackinnon to take it to Miss Walsh. Mackinnon takes the money to Jim and Jim suspects Sally has a plan. At Sally's request, Bellmann takes her to see the Steam Gun. While chiding Bellmann for his failure to understand people like Frederick, Sally sets the Steam Gun off, killing Bellmann. Sally survives and is rescued by Jim and Mackinnon from the rubble. Bellmann's death is reported as a tragic accident; Miss Walsh gets her money and insists in investing it in Garland & Lockhart (the photography firm Sally helped set up); it transpires that Jim will walk with a limp for the rest of his life thanks to his efforts to rescue Sally when his leg was broken; Nellie Budd recovers and decides to go back to the north with Jessie; and Mackinnon and Lady Mary leave England to go to America. In the spring of the next year, Charles shows Sally, Webster and Jim a possible new location for Garland & Lockhart after the fire. It is beautiful and spacious with a large orchard; the only drawback being that it is apparently haunted. They decide to take it and Charles gives Sally a photograph he had taken near the beginning of the novel of Frederick. The novel closes with Sally's announcement that she is pregnant with Frederick's child.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At Haven, Dr. Bain uses lenient security methods, except with the third-floor patients, whom he keeps contained with an electric security door. Among them are former POW Frank Hawkes, pyromaniac evangelist Byron \"Preacher\" Sutcliff, obese child molester Ronald Elster, and a shy serial killer John \"the Bleeder\" Skagg, who refuses to show his face. Angered by Dr. Merton's departure, the third-floor patients irrationally blame Dan, believing he has murdered Merton and taken his place. The four men make plans to kill Dan, and retrieve his address from Dr. Bain's office.\nDan's younger sister, Toni, who has recently suffered a nervous breakdown, arrives to visit. Dan, Nell, and Toni go to a local rock club, while Lyla is left with babysitter Bunky. A regional power outage occurs.

{"id": "560_199", "question": "What sport does tight end play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_5050", "text": "The tight end (TE) is an offensive position in American football, arena football, and Canadian football. It is a hybrid that combines the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a receiver. As part of the receiver corps, they play inside the flanks (tight), contrasted with the split end who plays outside the flanks (wide). Like offensive linemen, they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers. On the other hand, unlike offensive linemen, they are eligible receivers and potent weapons in a team's offensive schemes. A good tight end is designed to be a mismatch in one of two ways-  due to their larger size to a regular receiver an opposing team may allocate a defensive lineman to block a tight end for run  plays, but that lineman would be unable to keep up with a tight end on a passing play. Conversely, an opposing team may allocate a  smaller and faster safety or cornerback to guard a tight end in case of a pass play, but then that safety will be in danger of being overpowered by the tight end in a run play. \nThe tight end's role in any given offense depends on the preferences and philosophy of the head coach, offensive coordinator, and overall team dynamic. In some systems, the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman, rarely going out for passes. Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver, frequently taking advantage of the tight end's size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary. Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in passing situations.\nOffensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time.", "hasanswer": true}]}

That same year, he was one of 30 players elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, The Athletic ranked Williams at number 6 on its \"Baseball 100\" list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski. In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, The Sporting News named Williams on their \"Boston Mount Rushmore of Sports\", along Boston Celtics basketball player Bill Russell, Boston Bruins hockey player Bobby Orr, and New England Patriots football player Tom Brady.Williams was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 1966. In his induction speech, Williams included a statement calling for the recognition of the great Negro leagues players: \"I've been a very lucky guy to have worn a baseball uniform, and I hope some day the names of Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson in some way can be added as a symbol of the great Negro players who are not here only because they weren't given a chance.\" Williams was referring to two of the most famous names in the Negro leagues, who were not given the opportunity to play in the Major Leagues before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947. Gibson died early in 1947 and thus never played in the majors; and Paige's brief major league stint came long past his prime as a player. This statement from the Hall of Fame podium was \"a first crack in the door that ultimately would open and include Paige and Gibson and other Negro league stars in the shrine.\" Paige was the first inducted in 1971.

From each response (Ru: (about Vi), \"Does she not realise?\" Vi: (about Flo), \"Has she not been told?\" Flo: (about Ru), \"Does she not know?\") it is not unreasonable to assume that each, perhaps, is in fact terminally ill but unaware of the fact. \"The unspoken nature of the condemnation in the final version is more powerful [than in Human Wishes (see below)] precisely because it is less explicit. For while it leaves a mystery unresolved, it also tends to lead one beyond the particular illness of an individual woman to embrace the fate of all mankind.\" Other possibilities include a yet to be made public death or some other tragedy involving a personal connection to whatever is whispered for the absent character being whispered about.\nThe play might be seen as a coming of age situation. Vi yearns for the \"old days\", presumably when there were no awful secrets to tell but, at the same time, to which all three characters know there is no return. On one level \"there is a sense of loss in the play, that the women will never regain the intimacy they once had together\". Brenda Bynum, who has directed the play, feels the opposite, however: \u2018Why does it have to be that they have lost something, why can it not be Beckett's longing for intimacy that they have and he can\u2019t?\u2019\" Anthony Roche agrees: \"[T]hey assert a strength through their interdependence which makes this play one of the most perfect theatrical ensembles ever devised.\"The joining of the hands evokes the symbol for infinity. \"The ritual gesture of clasped hands allows them to keep their secrets from each other, but the feeling of the rings evokes the cycle of time. Twice turned upon itself, the bond of the three women (forever linked in their untold secrets) is never again what it was, never again what it seems to be. Something is the same, and everything is different.\" \"Superficially they make us think of the Three Graces as they link hands, but, more precisely, they resemble in appearance the three mothers in Fritz Lang's M, a film much loved by Beckett.\"Whereas at the start of the play there is a reluctance to talk of the past, after each of the shocking revelations the three women willingly drift off into nostalgia as a means of coping with the present.\nThe rings that Flo says she feels \"may be imagined a symbol of the frustrated hopes of youth, of marriages that never occurred [or failed] or equally their eternal union\" that has kept them together throughout their personal tragedies. Or, perhaps, these women meet/exist outside of time and whatever rings they might have once worn have disappeared along the way.\n\"Ethereal though the women of Come and Go might be, they are substantial personae in comparison with the wraith-like beings of the \u2018supplication plays.\u2019 And painful though the shock to their sensibilities has been, they have the comforting presence of each other to offset their sadness. They comprise a community, and are therefore not wholly reliant on memory to remedy or sedate. No such comfort is available in the later dramaticules, however, where night after night alienated beings implore their loved ones to make their presence felt.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up three to five yards behind the line of scrimmage and the defensive linemen.  They are the \"middle ground\" of defenders, playing closer to the line of scrimmage than the defensive backs (secondary), but farther back than the defensive linemen.\nAs such, linebackers play a hybrid role and are often the most versatile players on the defensive side of the ball; they can be asked to play roles similar to either a defensive lineman (such as stopping the runner on a running play) or a defensive back (such as dropping back into pass coverage).  How linebackers play their positions depends on the defensive alignment, the philosophy of the coaching staff, and the particular play the offense may call.\nLinebackers are divided into middle linebackers, sometimes called inside linebackers, and outside linebackers.  The middle linebacker, often called \"Mike\", is frequently the \"quarterback of the defense\".  His central role on the field means he is in the best position to call defensive plays and direct shifts and changes based on what the offense is doing.  Outside linebackers are often in a position to blitz, a defensive maneuver where the player rushes into the offensive backfield to disrupt a running play or sack the quarterback on passing plays.  Besides \"Mike\", other nicknames such as \"Sam\", \"Will\", or \"Jack\", are commonly used to refer to various linebacking roles.\nHistorically, some of the most impactful defensive players, such as Pro Football Hall of Fame members Chuck Bednarik, Dick Butkus, Jack Lambert, Ray Lewis, Ray Nitschke, Mike Singletary, Brian Urlacher, and Lawrence Taylor, were linebackers.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They define the area within which the batsmen and bowlers operate. The term crease may refer to any of the lines themselves, particularly the popping crease, or to the region that they demark. Law 7 of the Laws of Cricket governs the size and position of the crease markings, and defines the actual line as the back edge of the width of the marked line on the soil, i.e., the edge nearest to the wicket at that end.\nFour creases (one popping crease, one bowling crease, and two return creases) are drawn at each end of the pitch, around the two sets of stumps. The bowling creases lie 22 yards (66 feet or 20.12 m) apart, and mark the ends of the pitch. For the fielding side, the crease defines whether there is a no-ball because the wicket-keeper has moved in front of the wicket before he is permitted to do so. In addition, historically part of the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride was required to fall behind the bowling crease to avoid a delivery being a no-ball. This rule was replaced by a requirement that the bowler's front foot in the delivery stride must land with some part of it behind the popping crease (see below).", "hasanswer": true}]}

Baseball traditionalists, in particular some scouts and media members, decry the sabermetric revolution and have disparaged Moneyball for emphasizing sabermetrics over more traditional methods of player evaluation. Nevertheless, Moneyball changed the way many major league front offices do business. In its wake, teams such as the New York Mets, New York Yankees, San Diego Padres, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Red Sox, Washington Nationals, Arizona Diamondbacks, Cleveland Guardians, and the Toronto Blue Jays have hired full-time sabermetric analysts.\nWhen the Mets hired Sandy Alderson \u2013 Beane's predecessor and mentor with the A's \u2013 as their general manager after the 2010 season, and hired Beane's former associates Paul DePodesta and J.P. Ricciardi to the front office, the team was jokingly referred to as the \"Moneyball Mets\". Like the Oakland A's in the 1990s, the Mets had been directed by their ownership to slash payroll. Under Alderson's tenure, the team payroll dropped below $100 million per year from 2012 to 2014, and the Mets reached the 2015 World Series\u2014en route defeating MLB's highest-payroll team, the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nIn the 2019 and 2020 seasons, the Tampa Bay Rays were considered masters of Moneyball, reaching the 2020 World Series with a payroll prorated at US$28.2 million, third-lowest of Major League Baseball's 30 teams.Lewis has acknowledged that the book's success may have hurt the Athletics' fortunes as other teams accepted sabermetrics, reducing Oakland's edge.Since the book's publication and success, Lewis has discussed plans for a sequel to Moneyball called Underdogs, revisiting the players and their relative success several years into their careers, although only four players from the 2002 draft played much at the Major League level.\nMoneyball has also influenced and been influenced by other professional sports teams including European club association football (soccer). Beane has regarded Arsenal's former manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger as a personal idol. Beane has held discussions with Wenger, former Manchester United F.C. manager Alex Ferguson, and Liverpool F.C. owner John W. Henry.

The next year Fr\u00f6s\u00f6 IF also joined the project. The newly formed club started out their existence in the third tier in 1997 and \u00d6stersund/Torvalla FF ceased to exist as a consequence. IFK \u00d6stersund, Ope IF och \u00d6stersund/Torvalla FF (\u00d6TFF). In 2000 a fifth club, F\u00e4ltj\u00e4garnas IF, was also merged into the club.\nDuring the 2000s the club started taking on an English flavour and in 2007 the director of football Daniel Kindberg used his friendship with coaches Roberto Mart\u00ednez and Graeme Jones to start a cooperation with Swansea City where \u00d6stersund would loan young players from the club. Swansea also came over to \u00d6stersund to play the inauguration game at the newly built stadium. After a poor 2010 season the club was relegated to the fourth tier for the first time ever.\nIn 2011 Daniel Kindberg returned to the role as director of football and increased financial backing from local companies which enabled the hiring of more full-time staff. Following Jones' recommendation the club also brought in young English manager Graham Potter who was working at an English university at the time. Through several successful signings, some coming from Potter's connections at Nike Football Academy, the club was able to win both the fourth tier and then the third tier immediately the year after.

Those players would be taught English and computer skills in addition to sports theory and football training. The deal was expected to raise \u00d6stersund FKs yearly profits by over 50%.

Two goals by Saman Ghoddos in a win against PAOK on 24 August saw them qualify for the group stage at the first time of asking, at the same time making them the only Swedish representative in the season's UEFA competition and making Graham Potter the only British manager in the Europa League group stage. After losing only one game in their campaign, they finished second in a group featuring Athletic Bilbao and Hertha Berlin, becoming the first Swedish club to progress beyond the Europa League group stage.

{"id": "560_285", "question": "What sport does Slower ball play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_5261", "text": "In the sport of cricket, a slower ball is a slower-than-usual delivery from a fast bowler.   The bowler's intention is to deceive the batsman into playing too early so that he either misses the ball completely or hits it high up in the air to offer an easy catch. It is analogous to a changeup in baseball.\nThe slower ball, also known as the 'Wandi ball' technique was popularised in response to the demands of limited-overs cricket, not only to get wickets but also to slow down the scoring rate, as a slower ball will not carry to the boundary as easily as a normal fast delivery if it is hit square or behind the wicket. It is especially used in the last ten or so overs as variation in speed, in addition to line and length, is the key to preventing a late flurry of runs from the batsmen.\nTo be effective, the slower ball must be directed at or near the stumps in order to force the batsman to play, and the bowler's action must appear entirely normal. There are various tricks that the bowler can employ to slow the ball down:\n\nBowling from the back of the hand, effectively a fast googly\nBowling with split fingers: the fingers are placed either side of the seam of the ball, and the ball is bowled full-length; when done correctly the delivery will appear to be a full toss until it suddenly drops.  A similar technique is used to throw the split-finger fastball in baseball. Sri Lankan Dilhara Fernando holds the ball between the index and middle finger, and just fits it in the webbing between the two. This leads to the delivery of a slow loopy ball\nBowling a knuckleball, where the ball is held on the knuckles of the index and middle fingers. To a batsman, it resembles a stock ball due to it appearing as if the bowler was holding the ball in a regulation manner\nOff cutter: instead of placing the index and middle fingers in the orthodox position together on the seam, the middle finger is moved round the ball slightly and then pulled down as the ball is released.  The ball will tend to \"break\" or \"cut in\" from left to right as it pitches, as it does with off spin bowling. It can be effective to only bowl this ball with a single finger on top and it typically rests to the right hand side of the seam\nLeg cutter: the same as an off cutter except that the fingers go the other way and the ball will tend to cut from right to left.  Harder to keep straight than an off cutter\nPalm ball: the ball is held in the palm instead of the fingers; this can be effective but is hard to disguise\nHolding the ball deeper in the fingers. Typically, quick bowlers hold the ball at their fingertips. Holding the ball deeper within the fingers slows the release of the ball. Brett Lee is an exponent of this method\nReduction in the speed of the action: Can be quite effective as a \"different\" type of change of pace. Effectively you change only the rotation of your arm and retain your action\nCross-seam: This type of slower delivery is also popularly employed by medium pacers wherein the bowler holds the ball across the seam instead of holding it on the seam thereby the pace of delivery is reduced when the ball hits the ground. New Zealand medium pace bowler Gavin Larsen used this effectively in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. This can be coupled with a \"split fingers\" style release to result in a delivery which dips sharply at the end of its trajectory or spits from a pitched-up length\nZero rotation: Using a specific type of grip & release it is possible to impart little or no rotation on the ball. This lack of rotation causes an instability in air pressure, which makes the ball move erratically through the air\nSingle finger: Using a variation on the in-swinger grip where the index finger and thumb are both fully on the seam of the ball and the second finger barely touches it. Less force on the ball at the point of release results in reduced pace\nThumb ball: Bowled using the same grip as a stock delivery, barring the palm position, which is facing up instead of down, so that it looks like a back of the hand grip. This can be an effective delivery, but it is hard to produce", "hasanswer": true}]}

In its wake, teams such as the New York Mets, New York Yankees, San Diego Padres, St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Red Sox, Washington Nationals, Arizona Diamondbacks, Cleveland Guardians, and the Toronto Blue Jays have hired full-time sabermetric analysts.\nWhen the Mets hired Sandy Alderson \u2013 Beane's predecessor and mentor with the A's \u2013 as their general manager after the 2010 season, and hired Beane's former associates Paul DePodesta and J.P. Ricciardi to the front office, the team was jokingly referred to as the \"Moneyball Mets\". Like the Oakland A's in the 1990s, the Mets had been directed by their ownership to slash payroll. Under Alderson's tenure, the team payroll dropped below $100 million per year from 2012 to 2014, and the Mets reached the 2015 World Series\u2014en route defeating MLB's highest-payroll team, the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nIn the 2019 and 2020 seasons, the Tampa Bay Rays were considered masters of Moneyball, reaching the 2020 World Series with a payroll prorated at US$28.2 million, third-lowest of Major League Baseball's 30 teams.Lewis has acknowledged that the book's success may have hurt the Athletics' fortunes as other teams accepted sabermetrics, reducing Oakland's edge.Since the book's publication and success, Lewis has discussed plans for a sequel to Moneyball called Underdogs, revisiting the players and their relative success several years into their careers, although only four players from the 2002 draft played much at the Major League level.\nMoneyball has also influenced and been influenced by other professional sports teams including European club association football (soccer). Beane has regarded Arsenal's former manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger as a personal idol. Beane has held discussions with Wenger, former Manchester United F.C. manager Alex Ferguson, and Liverpool F.C. owner John W. Henry. His friendship with ex-Arsenal scout Damien Comolli and Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke allowed him to delve deep into the world of English football. According to El Pa\u00eds, Liverpool F.C. co-owner John W. Henry did not trust public opinion so he looked for a mathematical method similar to the one used for the Boston Red Sox (in guiding them to three World Series wins) which he also owns via Fenway Sports Group. The mathematical model turned out to be that of Cambridge physicist Ian Graham, which was used to select the manager (J\u00fcrgen Klopp) and players essential for Liverpool to win the 2018-19 UEFA Champions League.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The elder Sam Loxton was an electrician who played second grade cricket for Collingwood. The younger Sam started his education at Yarra Park State School, where he learned to bat, using a pine tree in the schoolyard as the stumps; the same tree was used for the same purpose years earlier by Test players Vernon Ransford and Ernie McCormick, and long-serving Victorian batsman Jack Ledward. The family moved to Armadale, and young Loxton attended Armadale Public School before completing his secondary education at Wesley College, Melbourne, an elite private boys\u2019 school. One of his colleagues at Wesley College was Ian Johnson, a future teammate for Victoria and Australia. The boys\u2019 school coach was P. L. Williams, a renowned mentor of teenagers who had earlier coached Ross Gregory and future Test captain Lindsay Hassett. Away from his sporting commitments at school, Loxton played district cricket for Prahran's third grade team when he was just 12. The young cricketer's parents were stalwarts of the club; Sam Sr. was the scorer and served as a transport man, driving the matting and equipment to matches, while Annie made cucumber sandwiches for 25 years\u2014due to the economic difficulties caused by the Great Depression and World War II, meat catering for players was a luxury even at first-class and international matches. The elder Sam was a member of the club committee from 1941 until his death in 1974, and was a vice-president for the last 17 years of his life. At the age of 16, the younger Loxton was selected in the Victorian Cricket Association Colts team that played in the first grade competition in 1937\u201338; he played three seasons with the outfit, which was effectively a state youth team. The squad was coached by Bert Cohen and former Test batsman and captain Jack Ryder, and Loxton credited the latter as the biggest influence on his career, saying\n\nHe was an inspiration so far as I was concerned. He had so much to do with my early grounding. Old Jack never had a drink and never smoked a cigarette in his life and nobody walked so tall as that man. He was my cricket father, no doubt about that at all.\nLoxton improved significantly in his third season with the Colts, scoring his first century and taking 21 wickets, having managed only seven scalps in the two previous summers. In 1940\u201341, aged 19, he moved back to Prahran to play in their first grade team after the Colts were disbanded, and he became more productive over the next few years, taking 46 wickets in one season.Loxton also played Australian rules football, and in 1942, he made his debut in the Victorian Football League (VFL)\u2014the highest tier of competition at the time\u2014playing for St Kilda. One of his teammates was Keith Miller, a future Invincibles colleague. Loxton played as both a forward and a defender, and the pair sometimes played together in attack. The recruit from Prahran played in only six matches in his first year, kicking 15 goals. Debuting in round six, he started his career brightly, kicking five and four goals in his first two matches against Melbourne and Collingwood respectively, helping his team to two victories. However, the goals and victories began to dry up and Loxton managed only six goals and one win in the remaining four matches. St Kilda came second to last and did not make the finals.During World War II, Loxton served with the 2nd Armoured Division. He enlisted on 31 July 1942 at Oakleigh, Victoria and was discharged on 7 November 1945 with the rank of sergeant, having spent most of his time at the division headquarters. The war ended Loxton and Miller's partnership at St Kilda. Miller was deployed to South Australia for training before becoming a fighter pilot in England, while his St Kilda colleague served in a reserve unit in Melbourne, enabling him to continue his football career when granted leave. In 1943, Loxton played in only the last four matches of the season, all of which were lost, kicking seven goals, and St Kilda finished last with a solitary victory from ten games. He managed three goals each against Essendon and South Melbourne but was held goal-less against Melbourne. The following year, Loxton played in all 18 matches and topped St Kilda's goal-kicking aggregates with 52. After making a slow start to the season, aggregating only four goals in the first four matches, including two goal-less outings, he began to score more heavily. The St Kilda forward registered a six-goal haul against Geelong in round eight, helping to secure an away win, and scored 23 goals in the last six matches, including five in each of the last three matches. However, St Kilda won only one of these three matches. Loxton's efforts helped his club to finish ninth out of 12 teams, and he came second in the club Best and Fairest. He played a solitary match in 1945, which St Kilda lost, and went goal-less.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The sprawl is performed by scooting the legs backwards, so as to land on the upper back of the opponent attempting the takedown. The resultant position is also known as a sprawl or sprawling position.\nIdeally, the sprawling combatant should create safe hip extension as much as possible and keep his knees off the floor. His options from the sprawl include attempting to gain leverage on the lower back by hooking underneath the elbows, throwing in a headlock, and grabbing his opponent's ankles and trying to get behind his opponent. Keeping the knees off the ground creates more weight pushing down on the opponent.\nIn mixed martial arts, sprawling is an important aspect of the sprawl-and-brawl strategy, while it is also used by numerous other wrestlers and mixed martial arts stylists.\nThe sprawl is also used in some forms of exercise, and commonly confused with the burpee. The sprawl is generally seen as a bad exercise for the lower-back, this is however not true as the sprawl, when performed correctly by athletes that are conditioned and flexible, is just as safe as the burpee. The important thing is to create hip extension rather than arching the back. Proper hip extension is created by squeezing the glutes, this in turn pulls the pelvis back upon which the spine safely follows.", "hasanswer": true}]}

One account of the scandal called for Canton to win the first game and Massillon was to win the second, forcing a third game\u2014with the biggest gate\u2014to be played legitimately, with the 1906 Ohio League championship at stake. Another account accused Wallace and East of bribing Massillon players to throw a game in the series. Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to damage the club's reputation. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had indeed thrown the second game and it remains unknown if there was ever a match-fixing agreement, the scandal tarnished the Bulldogs name and reportedly helped ruin professional football in Ohio until the mid-1910s.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Jay (Ed O'Neill) sold the general manager of Mandalay Bay, Burt Tanner (Ray Laska), some closet space and Burt gave him free access to the three main adult contingents at the hotel's platinum level rooms in return.\nMitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) runs into an ex-boyfriend of his, Langham (Fred Armisen), who is there with his partner Tim (Jeffrey Nicholas Brown) for their bachelor party. The two of them invite Mitchell and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) to their party but Mitchell declines the offer since he just wants to spend some time at the spa relaxing. Cam goes to the spa with Mitchell but when Mitchell has his massage, he leaves to go to Langham and Tim\u2019s pool party and gets back in time so Mitchell won't notice his absence.\nGloria (Sof\u00eda Vergara) and Jay take a walk at the hotel\u2019s mall when Gloria sees Rebarka, the female version of Barkley, the butler dog that Jay bought from Las Vegas on a previous trip of his and she hates. She knows that when Jay sees it, he will want to buy it so she does everything she can to obscure Jay\u2019s view of it. She manages to send Jay to their room to bring her a sweater while she pops into the store to buy Rebarka so they will take it out of the store window. On his way to the room, Jay discovers that their rooms are not on the top floor as Burt initially told him and he becomes intent on moving all of them to the \"Excelsior Plus\" floor.\nPhil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) wanted to go to Las Vegas for their own reasons. Phil wants to attend an underground magic society meeting that is headed by Ducky (Patton Oswalt) so he can perform his magic trick of \"metamorphosis\", while Claire wants to gamble so she can recoup the money she had lost on a previous trip to Las Vegas a few years back. Phil's appointment does not go as expected and he returns disappointed to the hotel while Claire manages to win the money she wanted, leaving her satisfied.\nGloria and Jay return to their room as Jay tells Gloria that they have to convince Burt to give them rooms at the \"Excelsior Plus\" floor. Gloria opens the door and finds Rebarka there (the store delivered it instead of holding it for her as she asked them). She immediately convinced Jay to order some fine cigars for Burt and sends him away again so she can get rid of the dog. She takes it to Phil and Claire's room that is right next to theirs.\nIn the meantime, Claire takes Mitchell to play blackjack. At the beginning he is doubtful of the idea, but he eventually likes it and wins some money. Langham sees him, and while they are talking, Mitchell accidentally leaves his room key at the table before he leaves. Langham thinks that he did it on purpose and takes it so he can join Mitchell in his room later. Mitchell gets to the room and orders the butler, Higgins (Stephen Merchant), to prepare a special bath for him and Cam while he goes to get some ice. Langham comes into the room while Mitchell is not there and Higgins, who thinks that he is Mitchell's partner, sends him to the bathroom while telling him that Mitchell is waiting for him.\nAll the family members are back on the floor and a sequence of events takes place leading to hilarious misunderstandings. Higgins believes that when Phil talks about his wife, he means Rebarka the dog; Mitchell tells Cam that he prepared something special for the two of them but when Cam finds Langham in the tub he misunderstands Mitchell's intentions; Langham shares Cam\u2019s sentiments but still asks them to join him in the tub while also revealing that Cam was at their bachelor party; Claire comes into the room while Mitchell and Cam fight and tells them she has a surprise for them; Langham steps out of the bathroom in a robe, making Claire think she interrupted something, and Mitchell sends Langham to Jay's room because Langham's fianc\u00e9 is knocking on the door; Jay sees Langham and believes he is Burt, but Gloria tells him that he is not Burt; Langham leaves and goes to Phil's room, where Higgins sees him and believes that he is the \"Claire\" that Phil is waiting for; Phil escorts Langham out of the room while Gloria enters from the mid-room door to borrow Claire\u2019s hair products, but the towel she is wearing gets snagged in the door; Phil runs into Ducky, who came to tell him that he would like to give him a second chance for his magic trick, but before they get into the room, Gloria runs to the bathroom naked to hide; Phil takes Rebarka in the bathroom before he performs his trick while Jay meets with Burt next door; Ducky is not impressed with Phil's trick but when Gloria gets out of the bathroom dressed as a maid (she took and wore Rebarka's clothes), he believes that the transformation of the fake dog to a hot maid was part of the trick and he gets excited; Gloria returns to her room dressed as a maid at the exact moment when Jay tells Burt that he ordered him a Cuban (meaning a cigar, not a woman); Claire reveals her surprise to Mitchell and Cam, the \"Kilty Pleasures\" (an all-male revue of half-naked men dressed in kilts reminiscent of the Chippendales dancers), but instead of going to Cam and Mitchell's room, the dancers went into Jay's as he is in mid-conversation with Burt.\nAmused at Jay\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d, Burt gives him what he wanted: rooms at the \"Excelsior Plus\" floor, only for Jay to discover a little while later that there is one more floor above the \"Excelsior Plus\u201d, which is the \"Excelsior Ultra\u201d.", "hasanswer": false}]}

With a fluid mixture of clever dialogue, quick fire jokes, sight gags, witty repartee backwards and forwards with the audience and even slapstick routines the pair ripped the original script to shreds. The rest of the cast struggled manfully to keep the play on track and constantly suffered light heartedly at the hands of the two main stars.\nJimmy Edwards played Price-Hargreaves in his trademark blustery harumphing way, that was easily recognised from his role as the headmaster in Whack-O!. Sykes played Bloome, the eponymous mouse of the show's title. Throughout the show the one ability that marked the boss's dominance in the office was his practised skill in picking up his phone handset by chopping with his hand, causing the handset to leap off the cradle into his waiting hand. Bloome, trying to emulate this, would always fail with the trick, either hurting his hand or sending the handset spinning into a waste paper basket. Only when he has gained confidence after being accused does he succeed, grinning widely at the audience.\nAt one point, during what is supposed to be a serious solo scene by Sykes, Edwards could be seen by the audience in his shirtsleeves and braces relaxing in the wings on an armchair. He is smoking a cigarette, flicking over pages of the play's script and making occasional wry faces at Sykes's performance, while Sykes feigns puzzlement at the audience's laughter. During the mid-play interval the cast joined the audience in the bar, remaining in character and performing several hilarious set piece conversations in between chatting with theatre goers.\nThe office secretary, Miss Spencer, who works for both men, starts the play as a shy drab and dowdily dressed spinster, but when Bloome gains his undeserved reputation and she herself is smitten by him, she also starts to blossom seemingly unnoticed. In the classic Sykes-Edwards production, the young actress playing the part endured endless ad-libs and delays in the action and still resolutely hit her cues and scripted lines. She became the stable point of reference around which the anarchic comics wove their magic. In the final act, having confessed her love for Bloome while wearing a drab ankle-length dress with a high lace collar, she next appears in a sexy red leather mini-skirt and boots, much to the delight of the audience who have appreciated her professional contribution to the performance.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jordan Leigh-Jensen, showering at the time, sees that the boys are peering at her and enlists Chris and Betsy's help to drive them away; the three boys fall off the side of the building. In response to being disturbed, the roommates light a bag of horse manure on fire and put it in front of Jordan's door.\nLater that night, at a co-ed dance, Chris reveals that Jim is her boyfriend; as the couple dance, Chris tells Jim that she has decided she wants to surrender her virginity to him. After a speech by headmistress Miss Dutchbok, the band plays a slow song while Jordan dances alone and conspires against Chris. Bubba, sporting an erection from slow dancing, sneaks off to the headmistress's office with Betsy to drink and have sex; however, the two are caught in the act by the headmistress and her friends. The following day, after morning aerobics and a sex education class, Chris books a hotel for Jim and herself.\nAfter another period of time, students of the two schools are riding horses together. Jordan trots past where Chris and Jim are talking and flashes her breasts at Jim. In revenge, Betsy steals Jordan's shirt, forcing the latter to ride topless in front of the headmistress et alumni. That weekend, Jim goes to buy condoms, but is confused by the pharmacist and ends up buying dental hygiene products; when Chris goes to buy the protection herself, she is distracted and eventually seen by Miss Dutchbok.\nAfter playing video games for a while in the arcade, Jim is embarrassed to talk romantically over the phone to Chris, while Jordan swears greater revenge. During the night, Betsy retaliates against Jordan and her roommate Rita by snipping the stitches of their cheerleading uniforms. The next day, Coach Whelan accidentally grabs Jordan's top and during a cheer routine Rita and the coach are embarrassed when they each expose a breast to the laughter of their classmates and the catcalls of the boys' football team. As punishment for the prank, an angered Miss Dutchbok confines Jordan, Rita, Betsy, and Chris to campus for a week. That night, Jim, Bubba, and another friend dress as women and sneak into the girl's dorm. Jim is caught by Jordan, who teases him with a cold bottle and forces him to give her a massage. Meanwhile, Bubba meets up with Betsy for a tryst, but he leaves to smoke a cigarette before they have sex. As Bubba is on the ledge outside of Betsy's bathroom, he peers into Jordan's dorm room where Jim is massaging her on the bed. When Betsy goes to look for him, he is startled and falls off the ledge. Meanwhile, after Jim confesses to Jordan that he is in fact really a boy (which was already known to Jordan), she pretends to scream and kicks him out of the room, leading to Chris finding out about their indiscretion. Chris leaves the girl's sorority house, embarrassed and heartbroken.\nAfter several days of unsuccessfully trying to get Chris back, Jim asks Chris's father for his help in the matter during parent visitation day. After he and Betsy tell Chris to take Jim back, she does. Meanwhile, Jordan's father has sex with her new stepmother while the chauffeur Chauncey listens in. Not long afterward, Miss Dutchbok, who has mistaken Chauncey for Mr. Leigh-Jensen (Jordan's father), has sex with him in the back of Leigh-Jensen's car. Bubba and Betsy, looking to have another tryst, climb into the front seat and turn on the loudspeakers, ensuring that the chauffeur and Ms. Dutchbok's indiscretion is known by everyone present at the program. Upon realizing what Bubba has done, Miss Dutchbok lunges at him, eventually resulting in the car rolling out of control down a hill and going into the pool. Chris and Jim then leave for their night of romance at the hotel. After failing to have sex that night because Chris finds the hotel too kitschy, as well as getting sick from the room-service food and champagne, they have sex on the beach in the morning.

{"id": "560_379", "question": "What sport does Indianapolis 500 play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_5518", "text": "The Indianapolis 500 is held annually at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a 2.5-mile (4 km) oval circuit. The track is a rounded rectangle, with four distinct turns of identical dimensions, connected by four straightaways (two long straightaways and two \"short chutes\"). Traditionally, the field consists of 33 starters, aligned in a starting grid of eleven rows of three cars apiece. Drivers race 200 laps, counter-clockwise around the circuit, for a distance of 500 miles (800 km). Since its inception in 1911, the race has always been scheduled on or around Memorial Day. Since 1974, the race has been specifically scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. The Sunday of Memorial Day weekend is widely considered one of the most important days on the motorsports calendar, as it is the day of the Indianapolis 500, the Coca-Cola 600, and (usually) the Monaco Grand Prix. Practice and time trials are held in the two weeks leading up to the race, while miscellaneous preliminary testing is held as early as April.\nThe race is the most prestigious event of the IndyCar calendar, and one of the oldest and most important automobile races. It has been reported to be the largest single-day sporting event in the world. Likewise, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway itself is regarded as the world's largest sporting facility in terms of capacity. The total purse exceeded $13 million in 2011, with over $2.5 million awarded to the winner, making it one of the richest cash prize funds in sports.\nSimilar to NASCAR's Daytona 500, the Indianapolis 500 is typically held early in the IndyCar Series season. That is unique to most sports where major events are usually at the end of the respective season. Currently, the Indy 500 is the sixth event of the 17-race IndyCar schedule. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Indianapolis was often the second or third race of the season, and as late as the 1950s, it was sometimes the first championship event of the year. Due to the high prestige of the Indianapolis 500\u2014rivaling or even surpassing the season championship\u2014it is not uncommon for some teams and drivers to focus heavily on preparing for that race during the early part of the season, and not focus fully on the championship battle until after Indy.\nDue to safety issues such as aquaplaning, the race is not held in wet conditions. In the event of a rain delay, the race will be postponed until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race itself, officials will halt the race (red flag) and await safe conditions. The officials can end the race and declare the results official if more than half of the scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed. If less than half the distance has been completed, the race must be resumed and achieve at least the 101-lap distance in order to be official. A primary limiting factor is available daylight, as the track does not have lighting. If the race is halted and cannot be resumed before sunset, the resumption will be scheduled for the next possible day.\nThe Indianapolis 500, as well as other IndyCar Series races, does not utilize the green\u2013white\u2013checker finish in case of a late-race yellow. The race can be (and has at times) finished under caution. However, officials may call for a late-race red flag (in lieu of a lengthy yellow) to provide an opportunity for a green-flag finish, an option that was used in 2014, 2019, 2022, and 2023. The circuit lacks lights, therefore lateness can become a factor in the cases of lengthy delays.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mary befriends a woman named Sharon, an alcoholic who seems well-meaning to the na\u00efve Mary until she prostitutes her for money. After enduring painful sex, Mary smashes the man's mouth in once he passes out. She flees, coming into contact with a policeman named Prince, who knows about Mary's past.\nMary lives for a while with Sharon's parents, also alcoholics, but eventually she moves into a shelter for \"fallen women.\" She receives a letter from Prince that includes a newspaper clipping concerning her before she lost her memory. Mary learns that her real name is Amy Hide and that her past was quite dark, a fact which causes Mary a great deal of distress. During her stay at the shelter, she gets a job as a waitress in a seedy caf\u00e9. With one exception, all of the male employees sexually harass her, but she does not understand the significance of their actions. The exception is Alan, a meek and highly insecure man who is deeply infatuated with Mary but does nothing to ward off the attentions of others. Mary meets Prince again, and she learns that Amy had asked someone to kill her. According to Prince, the failed killing was what had caused her amnesia. The man who did it is behind bars but due to be released.\nWhen Alan and another co-worker, the cocksure but illiterate Russ, find out where Mary lives, they are appalled and ask her to join them at their squat. Alan appears tortured by her presence and by the continued kisses and fondling she receives from other men, particularly Russ. To comfort him, Mary begins sleeping with Alan. This does not seem pleasant for either of them, and after a while Mary decides to break their relationship off. In response, Alan hangs himself.\nMary goes to see a man named Michael, whom she finds out she had dated before she lost her memory. Pretending to be Amy's cousin, she asks Michael about the things that Amy did to him. Amy, according to him, was abusive, vindictive, and unfaithful. She is escorted out of Michael's office by his assistant, Jamie, who takes pity on the shabby-looking Mary and invites her to live with him. Jamie is extremely wealthy, and he squanders his wealth largely on drugs and alcohol. Mary becomes infatuated with Jamie and is crushed when he does not return her affection. The two eventually begin a sexual relationship, but it is clear that Jamie does not return Mary's love.\nAfter their relationship ends, Mary moves in with Prince and begins going by Amy.

One night, Prince informs Amy that her would-be killer has been released, and that she must confront him. It is never directly revealed who the killer is, although it is implied to be Prince.

Other professional sports teams include the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA)'s Seattle Storm, the National Women's Soccer League's Seattle Reign FC; and Major League Rugby (MLR)'s Seattle Seawolves.\nSeattle's professional sports history began at the start of the 20th century with the PCHA's Seattle Metropolitans, which in 1917 became the first American hockey team to win the Stanley Cup.\nIn 1969, Seattle was awarded a Major League Baseball franchise, the Seattle Pilots. Based at Sick's Stadium in Mount Baker, home to Seattle's former minor-league teams, the Pilots played in Seattle for one season before relocating to Milwaukee and becoming the Milwaukee Brewers. The city, alongside the county and state governments, sued the league and was offered a second expansion team, later named the Seattle Mariners, as settlement.The Mariners began play in 1977 at the multi-purpose Kingdome, where the team struggled for most of its time. Relative success in the mid-to-late 1990s saved the team from being relocated and allowed them to move to a purpose-built baseball stadium, T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field), in 1999. The Mariners have never reached a World Series and only appeared in the MLB playoffs five times, mostly between 1995 and 2001, but had Hall of Fame players and candidates like Ken Griffey Jr., Randy Johnson, Ichiro Suzuki, and Alex Rodriguez. The team tied the all-time MLB single regular season wins record in 2001 with 116 wins. From 2001 to 2022, the Mariners failed to qualify for the playoffs\u2014the longest active postseason drought in major North American sports, at 20 seasons.The Seattle Seahawks entered the National Football League in 1976 as an expansion team and have advanced to the Super Bowl three times: 2005, 2013 and 2014. The team played in the Kingdome until it was imploded in 2000 and moved into Qwest Field (now Lumen Field) at the same site in 2003. The Seahawks lost Super Bowl XL in 2005 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Detroit, but won Super Bowl XLVIII in 2013 by defeating the Denver Broncos 43\u20138 at MetLife Stadium. The team advanced to the Super Bowl the following year, but lost to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX on a last-minute play. Seahawks fans have set stadium noise records on several occasions and are collectively known as the \"12th Man\".Seattle Sounders FC has played in Major League Soccer since 2009, as the latest continuation of the original 1974 Sounders team of the North American Soccer League after an incarnation in the lower divisions of American soccer. Sharing Lumen Field with the Seahawks, the team set various attendance records in its first few MLS seasons, averaging over 43,000 per match and placing themselves among the top 30 teams internationally. The Sounders have won the MLS Supporters' Shield in 2014 and the U.S. Open Cup on four occasions: 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2014. The Sounders won the first of their two MLS Cup titles in 2016, defeating Toronto FC 5\u20134 in a penalty shootout in Toronto, before finishing as runners-up in a rematch against Toronto in MLS Cup 2017.\nIn 2019 the Sounders made their first-ever home-field appearance in MLS Cup, once again against Toronto FC, and won the game 3\u20131 to earn their second MLS Cup title in front of a club-record attendance of 69,274. The stadium also hosted the second leg of the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League Final, played in front of 68,741 to break the tournament attendance record. The Sounders became the first MLS team to win a continental title since 2000 and the first to win the modern Champions League.Seattle's Major League Rugby team, the Seattle Seawolves, play in nearby Tukwila at Starfire Sports Complex, a small stadium that is also used by the Sounders for their U.S. Open Cup matches. The team began play in 2018 and won the league's inaugural championship. They successfully defended their title in the 2019 season and finished as runners-up in the 2022 championship game.From 1967 to 2008, Seattle was home to the Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A frequent playoff participant, the Sonics were the 1978\u201379 NBA champions, and also contended for the championship in 1978 and 1996. Following a team sale in 2006, a failed effort to replace the aging KeyArena, and settlement of a lawsuit to hold the team to the final two years of its lease with the city, the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder ahead of the 2008\u201309 season. An effort in 2013 to purchase the Sacramento Kings franchise and relocate it to Seattle as a resurrected Sonics squad was denied by the NBA board of governors.The Seattle Storm of the Women's National Basketball Association have also played their games at KeyArena (now Climate Pledge Arena) since their foundation in 2000. The WNBA granted Seattle their expansion side following the popularity of the recently folded Seattle Reign, a women's professional basketball team that played from 1996 to 1998 in the rival American Basketball League. The Storm began as a sister team to the now-defunct Sonics of the NBA, but sold to separate Seattle-based ownership in 2006. Tied for the league record, the Storm have claimed the WNBA championship on four occasions, winning in 2004, 2010, 2018, and 2020. The team also won the first-ever WNBA Commissioner's Cup in 2021.\nThe Seattle Thunderbirds hockey team has represented Seattle in the Canadian major-junior Western Hockey League since 1977. Originally playing in Mercer Arena and the Seattle Center Coliseum (which had hosted previous minor-league hockey teams), the Thunderbirds have been based at the ShoWare Center in the suburb of Kent since 2007, and have won one WHL championship in 2017. In 1974, Seattle was awarded a conditional expansion franchise in the National Hockey League; however, this opportunity did not come to fruition. In 2018, a new Seattle-based group successfully applied for an expansion team in the NHL, which was named the Seattle Kraken and began play in 2021. The SuperSonics' former home arena, KeyArena (now Climate Pledge Arena), underwent major renovations from 2018 to 2021 to accommodate the new NHL team. The NHL ownership group reached its goal of 10,000 deposits within 12 minutes of opening a ticket drive, which later increased to 25,000 in 75 minutes.Seattle Reign FC, a founding member of the National Women's Soccer League, was founded in 2012, holding their home games in Seattle from 2014 to 2018 and again since 2022. The team name was chosen to honor the defunct women's basketball team of the same name. The club played at Starfire Sports Complex in nearby Tukwila for the league's inaugural 2013 season before moving to Seattle Center's Memorial Stadium in 2014. Under new management, the team moved to Tacoma's Cheney Stadium in 2019, before moving to Seattle's Lumen Field in 2022. In 2020, OL Groupe, the parent company of French clubs Olympique Lyonnais and Olympique Lyonnais F\u00e9minin, became the team's majority owner and rebranded the club as OL Reign. The Seattle Reign name was restored in 2024.Seattle has also been home to various minor-league professional teams, of which currently Ballard FC and West Seattle Junction FC of USL League 2 in soccer remain. Representing the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard, Ballard FC was founded in 2022 as an independent, semi-professional soccer team in the fourth-division USL League 2. The team is owned by a group led by former Sounders player Lamar Neagle and won its first national title in 2023. Ballard FC's primary home is the 1,000-seat Interbay Soccer Stadium (also home to Seattle Pacific University's and Ballard High School's soccer teams), but during that field's renovations in the 2024 season, Ballard will play out of Memorial Stadium at the Seattle Center. Starting in 2024, Ballard FC's division will be joined by a new cross-town rival, West Seattle Junction FC representing the neighborhood of West Seattle.The short-lived Seattle Sea Dragons, originally the Dragons, of the XFL played at Lumen Field in the league's inaugural season in 2020 prior to its suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sea Dragons returned alongside the XFL in 2023 after the league's re-launch under new ownership. The team folded prior to the 2024 season during the XFL's merger with the United States Football League to form the United Football League.Seattle also boasts two collegiate sports teams based at the University of Washington and Seattle University, both competing in NCAA Division I for various sports. The University of Washington's athletic program, nicknamed the Huskies, competes in the Pac-12 Conference, and Seattle University's athletic program, nicknamed the Redhawks, mostly competes in the Western Athletic Conference. The Huskies teams use several facilities, including the 70,000-seat Husky Stadium for football and the Hec Edmundson Pavilion for basketball and volleyball. The two schools have basketball and soccer teams that compete against each other in non-conference games and have formed a local rivalry due to their sporting success.The Major League Baseball All-Star Game has been held in Seattle three times, once at the Kingdome in 1979, and twice at T-Mobile Field in 2001 and 2023. The NBA All-Star Game was also held in Seattle twice: the first in 1974 at the Seattle Center Coliseum and the second in 1987 at the Kingdome. Lumen Field hosted MLS Cup 2009, played between Real Salt Lake and the Los Angeles Galaxy, as a neutral site in front of 46,011 spectators. Seattle will be one of eleven US host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with matches played at Lumen Field and training facilities at Longacres in Renton, Washington.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jennings Trophy in a row from 1986 to 1989. As a result, Racicot's first season was spent largely on the Sherbrooke Canadiens farm team, but he finally made his NHL debut on December 9, 1989, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, when he allowed three goals on six shots in just less than 13 minutes before being replaced. It was his only NHL appearance of the 1989\u201390 NHL season. He shared the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Award for fewest goals allowed in the AHL in 1990 with fellow understudy Jean-Claude Bergeron.\nThe 1990\u201391 season saw regular understudy Hayward's traded to the Minnesota North Stars. As a result, Racicot split time with the Fredericton Canadiens and Montreal, as he battled with Jean-Claude Bergeron and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chabot for second string duties.\nThe following 1991\u201392 season saw Roland Melanson brought in as an experienced backup, reducing Racicot's opportunities significantly as he again spent a large portion of the season with Federicton. In his 9 appearances for Montreal he was winless, while Roy appeared in 67 games to earn another Jennings Trophy.\nIn 1992\u201393 Racicot had his most successful season for Montreal. While Roy appeared in the majority of games (62 of the 84 possible) Racicot saw action in 26 games, winning 17. The Canadiens made their way to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals. Racicot saw only 18 minutes of action in the playoffs as Roy backstopped the unfancied Montreal to their first Stanley Cup win since 1986.\nThe following year Racicot again faced competition for his second string position, with Ron Tugnutt and Les Kuntar splitting playing time. His performances dipped, and ultimately he was released at the end of the 1994 season.\nRacicot left the NHL after the 1994 season, spending several seasons with various teams in the AHL, International Hockey League, and East Coast Hockey League. The 1999\u20132000 season saw Racicot move to Russia, playing in 20 games with HC Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk before returning to North America for another five seasons of minor-pro hockey.

When U.S. General Carlson refuses to go along with the plot, he is assassinated outside the chalet by killers posing as German hikers \u2013 who slipped through the chalet's perimeter.\nGallagher is blamed for the disaster, and assigned as punishment to escort an Army sergeant named Walter Henke back to the United States for court martial. After landing at Dulles International Airport, Gallagher is ambushed by an undercover team, who spirit Henke away. Gallagher tracks down Henke's wife and is surprised when she shows a photo of a different man as her husband. Gallagher realizes that the man that he brought into the country is an imposter. After he leaves, the same undercover team kills Mrs. Henke and phones in an anonymous tip, identifying Gallagher as the killer, who is then detained. Meanwhile, the real Walter Henke is approached in Germany by Colonel Glen Whitacre, who tasks him with a top secret assignment to infiltrate a Neo-Nazi gang in his hometown of Chicago, who they believe are plotting to assassinate the President.\nWith the help of his ex-wife, Lt. Colonel Eileen Gallagher, and her assistant, Lt. Ruth Butler, Gallagher identifies the man he brought back from Germany as Thomas Boyette, a long-service Army veteran with a history of covert operations. The trio deduce that impersonating a prisoner allowed Boyette to enter the country without a passport, meaning there is no record of his entry and no way to track his movements.\nWhen the same undercover team kills Butler and attacks Eileen, Johnny rescues her and escapes the base with the help of a friend. The Gallaghers investigate the conspiracy on their own, starting with trying to find the real Walter Henke in Chicago, where the next phase of the planned peace talks will take place. Johnny approaches his military friend, Chicago Police detective Milan Delich, who allows the Gallaghers to hide at his house. At a diner, the same undercover team attempts to kill Delich, leaving him wounded in the ensuing shootout and the team is killed. As Delich is taken away by ambulance, conspirators dressed as cops capture Johnny, who is then held in the basement of the safe house where Boyette is staying.\nAfter Boyette leaves for his assignment, Gallagher escapes and speeds toward downtown Chicago, using Boyette's surveillance photos from the basement as a guide to the planned assassination site. Meanwhile, the real Walter Henke is lured into an office building overlooking the site and killed by Boyette, the intention being to frame Henke for the assassination and make it look like he was killed later.\nFollowing a hotel luncheon, the Soviet Press Secretary, one of the conspirators, convinces the General Secretary to make an unplanned stop just outside the hotel's garage for a photo op with \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian families. Before the US Secret Service can secure the site, Boyette takes aim at the General Secretary with a sniper rifle, but Gallagher bursts into the room and shoots Boyette dead.\nOutside the room where he found Boyette, Gallagher confronts Whitacre and accuses him of trying to start a war for no reason. Angrily, Whitacre says that nuclear weapons are the only thing preventing war, and he and his Soviet counterparts are just smart enough to realize that mutual disarmament would be disastrous for both countries. Gallagher promises to expose the conspiracy and storms away, ignoring Whitacre's threats. On the street, Gallagher reunites with Eileen and hugs her gratefully.\nAfter his confrontation with Gallagher, Whitacre enters a limousine with his Soviet counterpart, who asks him what their next step is.

All the clowns, including Cam, are dressed up to their clown clothes and make-up to give their mentor the final farewell. At the funeral, Cam meets his former clown partner Lewis (Bobby Cannavale) who's mad at Cam because Cam left him alone after his decision to settle down and have a family with Mitchell.\nCam and Lewis decide to reconnect again and perform a show together, much to Mitchell's dismay. Just before the performance, Cam clarifies that the performance is only a \"one-time thing\", something that makes Lewis mad and leads their performance to a disaster.\nMeanwhile, Phil (Ty Burrell) gets ready for a big real estate opportunity. He is confident and before he leaves home he tries to teach the kids that they always have to play by the rules and everything will go just fine. Unfortunately, he bumps into his nemesis, Mitzi Roth (Ellen Barkin), who steals his new potential clients by using dirty tricks.\nPhil gets back home upset and when Luke (Nolan Gould) proposes that he play dirty too, he instantly forgets his \"play by the rules\" rule and decides to listen to him. The trick of recording Mitzi admitting she was lying does not go really well, so Luke and Phil play the \"sympathy card\" at an encounter with Mitzi at the grocery store and this time it pays off.\nIn the meantime, Claire (Julie Bowen) decides to make a Facebook page and she is upset because Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) did not accept her friend request. The girls lie that they did not get any friend request from her so Claire sends one again. The reason the girls do not want their mom as a friend on Facebook is because they do not want her to know everything they do and because they do not want her to embarrass them in front of their friends. After Claire's second request, they do not have a choice than to accept her and they use other methods to make her quit Facebook.\nAt the Pritchett house, Manny (Rico Rodriguez) invites a friend, Griffin (Dash Dobrofsky), to come over. This surprises Jay (Ed O'Neill) because Griffin is one of the school's cool kids and it is strange that Manny hangs out with him. Jay believes that Griffin wants to hang out with Manny because of him since he dropped off Manny at school on his motorcycle, something that is cool. Gloria (Sof\u00eda Vergara) does not agree with Jay since she believes Manny is capable of having cool friends. However, she realizes that she is the reason Griffin hangs out with Manny when Griffin arrives and he can not stop staring at her.\nJay and Gloria try to tell Manny the truth of why Griffin hangs out with him and they are surprised to hear that Manny also hangs out with him to get closer to his sister and now that he knows that Griffin is also using him, he feels less guilty.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jeremy Boyer, the Blues organist, plays a Glenn Miller arrangement of W. C. Handy's \"St. Louis Blues\" in its entirety before games and a short version at the end of every period, followed by \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\" Boyer also plays the latter song on the organ after Blues goals, with fans replacing the word \"Saints\" with \"Blues.\" On October 1, 2018, it was reported that, for the upcoming season, a new goal song recorded by St. Louis-based band The Urge, \"The Blues Have The Urge,\" would be played after Blues goals, immediately following the traditional organ music.At the end of the national anthem before every home game, the words \"the home of the brave\" are drowned out by fans with \"the home of the Blues.\"Starting in 2014, the team introduced a win song in the form of Pitbull's \"Don't Stop the Party\", but from 2016 to 2018, the win song was \"Song 2\" by Blur after public backlash against using a Pitbull song. Beginning in 2018, the win song has been the aforementioned song recorded by The Urge. However, during the 2019 playoffs, Laura Branigan's \"Gloria\" was played first before The Urge song.The Blues were one of the last teams to add a goal horn, doing so during the 1992\u201393 season at the St. Louis Arena. All of these traditions carried over to the Kiel Center (now known as Enterprise Center) in 1994. After each goal, a bell is rung and each of the goals are counted by the crowd. Since 1990, Ron Baechle, also known as the \"Towel Man\" or \"Towel Guy,\" has celebrated each goal by counting with the bell and throwing a towel into the crowd from section 314.The team also has a long tradition of fan-produced programs, sold outside the arena and providing an often biting, sarcastic, humor-filled alternative to team- and League-produced periodicals. The longest-running fan publication, Game Night Revue, was created by a group of fans in the mold of the Chicago Blackhawks' Blue Line Magazine. It operated for over 10 years, from 1994 to 2005, when its owner decided not to resume the magazine after the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout (one final oversized \"goodbye\" issue was distributed the first two home games of the 2005\u201306 season). After hockey resumed in 2005, a few months after GNR's final issue, a new publication, St. Louis Game Time, was formed by several former GNR staffers.Starting after a couple of players heard \"Gloria\" by Laura Branigan, after their win in Philadelphia on January 3, 2019, the team started to use the song after every home win, and lasted all the way up to their Stanley Cup win. The song has since been retired; the last time they played it was during the raising of the Stanley Cup Championship banner ceremony on October 2, 2019.\nOn February 9, 2019, another tradition was born. During the 3rd Period, The Blues were winning by a large margin against the visiting Nashville Predators. The Enterprise Center was electric and buzzing with excitement with anticipation of the win. Blues Director of Entertainment, Jason Pippi, commented that they played Country Roads by John Denver, \"was a bit of an mistake... because people love to sing along to that song\". The mistake was that play resumed before the chorus was over and the music had to stop. However, despite the music stopping, the loyal Blues fans in attendance continued to sing loudly. It was loud enough, TV cameras picked up the song loud and clear. Fox Sports Midwest color commentator, Darren Pang, exclaimed he \"just loved the crowd, they're singing!\". Country Roads has been played during every Home game since, at approximately the 15:00 minute mark of the 3rd Period, regardless of the current score. Jason Pippi stated \"its just a testament to the passion Blues fans bring each and every night... to the Cup (Stanley Cup) maybe?\" And it did take them to the Stanley Cup. The St. Louis Blues won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history later that season.\nAfter each Home win, the entire St Louis Blues team skates to center ice and in unison, raise their sticks and clap while the goal horn blares, to thank the Blues fans in attendance and watching on TV. It has been called the \"Fan Salute\" by some.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The art direction and design were done by Kevin Reagan. The artwork depicted Madonna as a cowgirl, wearing pink and blue stetsons and embroidered jeans, among hay bales and 1950s cars. The images and typographical style paid homage to the iconography of the western United States, relishing Americana culture while at the same time satirizing it. Mondino had the idea of the western themes for the album; Madonna was not sure at first, but was convinced by the photographer and eventually appreciated the final result. Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez, author of Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches to Her Subcultural Transformations, described the visual as \"a complete celebration of camp\", which was highlighted by Madonna's combination of western clothing with expensive shoes such as bright red high heels. He also thought it was inspired by Miss Rodeo America and the photo book Rodeo Girl (2000) by Lisa Eisner, and also defined it as an evocation of Judy Garland. Madonna also used her cowgirl style during her public appearances to promote the album, including jeans, shirts and cowboy hats, and eventually became one of her most recognized reinventions.\nOn August 22, 2000, a month before the album's official release, all tracks from Music were leaked online through Napster. Maverick and Warner Bros. Records first published it on September 18, 2000, in regions including Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom, containing two bonus tracks, \"American Pie\" and \"Cyber-raga\", in the first two countries. It was released a day later in the United States. A limited edition was also released, which contained a 24-page booklet about the album, a copper brooch with the album's logo and two stickers, wrapped in a linen cloth available in four different colors. Additionally, the international version included \"American Pie\" as a bonus track, a decision Madonna later regretted, explaining it was \"something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing\". As a result, it was not added as a bonus track in the United States and Canada. The album was also made available on digital download through Madonna's website on Apple's QuickTime format, including exclusive access to two remixes of \"Music\". The edition released in Mexico contains as bonus tracks the Spanish version of \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\", titled \"Lo Que Siente la Mujer\", and a remix of the song by Above & Beyond. A special edition was released to promote the Drowned World Tour with a bonus CD with remixes and the video of \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\".Madonna chatted with fans through her first live chat on AOL on the day of Music's release in the United Kingdom. In order to celebrate the album's release, she had a release party at dance emporium Catch One in Los Angeles, on September 20, 2000. The \u00a31.4 million party was attended by 600 selected guests who received special invitations. The invitations were sent out in white leather boxes, lined with black fur. A gold necklace was inside with letters spelling out the album's title, and only those wearing the necklaces would be allowed into the club. More than a dozen strippers were in attendance as a reference to the music video for \"Music\". She sported a five-carat diamond ring Ritchie gave her for her birthday, and a black T-shirt that read \"Snatch Coming Soon\" promoting Ritchie's film, while he promoted Madonna's album wearing a T-shirt with the word Music emblazoned on it.

The team sold the first 5,000 season ticket deposits 48 hours after they became available to the public. Remaining season tickets were made available to season ticket holders for the USSF 2 Whitecaps before becoming available to non-season ticket holders.In preparation for its first MLS season, the Whitecaps brought in executive talent from around the world. On November 24, 2009, Paul Barber, former Tottenham Hotspur F.C. executive, was announced to join the club as CEO. Others joining him included former D.C. United head coach Tom Soehn as Director of Operations and Dutch national Richard Grootscholten as the Technical Director and head coach of the residency program.As the head coach of the USL and later USSF Division 2 Vancouver Whitecaps, former Iceland international Teitur Thordarson was confirmed as head coach on September 2, 2010, for the inaugural MLS season. He was subsequently relieved of his duties on May 30, 2011, after the Whitecaps won just one of their first twelve matches. Tom Soehn, the Whitecaps director of soccer operations, replaced Thordarson on an interim basis.The Whitecaps began playing in the 2011 MLS season with their first match on March 19, 2011, against rival Canadians Toronto FC, which they won 4\u20132. The first goal in the Whitecaps' MLS era was scored by Eric Hassli. After their winning start the Whitecaps struggled, and failed to secure another victory in their next 11 MLS games, drawing six and losing five. In the aftermath of their 1\u20131 draw with the New York Red Bulls on May 30 head coach Teitur Thordarson was fired. Tom Soehn took over coaching duties for the remainder of the 2011 season, while Martin Rennie was announced as the new permanent head coach on August 9, taking over officially on November 2.

They were not able to qualify for the post season, in the playoffs as they had accomplished in the season prior. Two days after the end of the 2013 MLS regular season, Rennie's contract was not renewed sparking a search for the next head coach. In their off-season, the Whitecaps were in the midst of controversy with one of their then players, Camilo, who had played for the team since their inaugural campaign, after the Brazilian went on to join Liga MX club Quer\u00e9taro.  The Mexican club believed that he was no longer under contract, while the Whitecaps reported that he was still on a contract with Vancouver. The scandal was resolved with the Liga MX club paying a transfer fee from Vancouver to acquire the Brazilian forward.In October 2014, the Whitecaps qualified for the 2015\u201316 CONCACAF Champions League for the very first time as a result of becoming the highest ranked Canadian team in the 2014 MLS season and due to a reformatting of the Canadian Championship in the following season. A week later they qualified for the MLS playoffs for the second time, an achievement unmatched by any Canadian team.In 2015, the Whitecaps would go on to have their best-ever regular season, finishing the season with 53 points.

However, despite recording their first-ever playoff win against the San Jose Earthquakes in the knockout round, they were eliminated by Seattle Sounders FC in the conference semi-final.\nIn 2018, the Whitecaps would record the fourth-worst defensive record of the season, conceding 67 goals. As a result of poor form in the regular season, coach Carl Robinson was relieved of his duties on September 25, 2018. He was replaced by interim Craig Dalrymple for the remainder of the regular season. The Whitecaps finished the season with 47 points and would miss the playoffs for the second time in three seasons.\n2019 saw a new-look squad for the Whitecaps, as key players like Alphonso Davies, Kendall Waston, Kei Kamara, and Cristian Techera had all departed following the 2018 season.

However, they would once again go on to miss the playoffs, finishing the season last place in the Western Conference. They were also eliminated by Cavalry FC in the 2019 Canadian Championship, becoming the first MLS team to get eliminated by a Canadian Premier League side in Canadian Championship history.\n2020 was the club's 10th season in Major League Soccer. However, on March 12, 2020, after only two games played, Major League Soccer suspended their season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Whitecaps' season resumed on July 15, 2020, when they played the San Jose Earthquakes in their first match of the MLS is Back Tournament. Despite losses to the San Jose Earthquakes and Seattle Sounders FC, a 2-0 win against the Chicago Fire was enough for the team to qualify to the round of 16. However, the Whitecaps would ultimately lose to Sporting Kansas City 3-1 on penalties after a scoreless 120 minutes. From August 18 to September 16, 2020, the Whitecaps would play six matches against fellow Canadian MLS teams Toronto FC and Montreal Impact, that would serve as both regular season matches as well as qualifiers for the 2020 Canadian Championship. The Whitecaps would not qualify for the Canadian Championship, finishing at the bottom of the qualification table with only 6 points from 6 games. From September 19, 2020 until the end of the season, the Whitecaps would play the rest of their home matches at Providence Park in Portland, Oregon. They would finish the season with 27 points from 23 matches played, missing the playoffs for the third season in a row.\n2021 saw much greater success for the Whitecaps. The season did not start off well initially, with head coach Marc Dos Santos being relieved of his duties on August 27, 2021 as a result of his team sitting below the playoff line after 20 games, as well as once again getting eliminated by Pacific FC in the 2021 Canadian Championship. However, under interim head coach Vanni Sartini, the team would go unbeaten in 12 of their last 14 games to finish the season, making the playoffs for the first time in four years. In the playoffs, the Whitecaps were eliminated in the first round by Sporting Kansas City, losing by a scoreline of 3-1. On November 30, 2021, Vanni Sartini was named as the club's new head coach.\nIn 2022, the Whitecaps would go on to have mixed success. They missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five years, finishing the season with 43 points. However, they won the 2022 Canadian Championship, beating Toronto FC 5-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw following regulation and extra time. It was the first time that the Whitecaps won the Canadian Championship since their first victory in 2015. The Canadian Championship victory also meant that the Whitecaps would qualify for the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League.\nIn the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League, the Whitecaps defeated Real C.D. Espa\u00f1a to advance to the quarterfinals, but were ultimately eliminated by Los Angeles FC. In the regular season, the team would finish with 48 points, qualifying for the playoffs. They were once again eliminated by Los Angeles FC. In 2023 Leagues Cup, their inaugural appearance in the competition, the Whitecaps advanced to the Round of 32, but were eliminated by Tigres UANL. For the second consecutive season, the Whitecaps won the Canadian Championship for the third time, beating CF Montr\u00e9al 2-1 in the final. As a result, they qualified for the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup.\nThe 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup saw the Whitecaps face Tigres UANL, a team that the Whitecaps previously lost to 4-1 on aggregate in the 2016-17 edition.

Their spoiled willful and beautiful daughter Margaret (Olivia de Havilland) refuses to go and storms out of the house. Impetuously commandeering a modest car belonging to her father's valet, she soon notices the car is low on fuel and stops at an auto court gas station. The attendant, Bill Davis (Dick Powell), fills its tank and requests the $3.50 payment. With no money on her, Margaret tries to charge the amount to her father's account, but, doubting her identity, Bill matter of factly refuses. Instead, he offers to let her work off her debt by serving for the day as a housekeeper cleaning the auto court's bungalows. Outraged by this suggestion, Margaret attempts to drive off, but backs into a truck preventing her from leaving. When a police officer arrives, Margaret is forced to comply with Bill's offer and spends the next few hours making beds and cleaning rooms.\nMargaret returns home vowing revenge on Bill for his treatment. At first she asks her father\u2014who is on the board of the oil company that owns the station\u2014to have Bill fired. After listening to her story, however, her father agrees with the way Bill handled things and tells her she'll have to find her own way of getting even. The next day, Margaret returns to the gas station and apologizes to Bill, pretending instead to be the wealthy family's maid, \"Maggie\".  Impressed by her change in demeanor, and attracted again by her obvious charms, Bill asks her on a date and she accepts.\nThat night, Bill sneaks them into a banquet for a free dinner, then takes her up the Empire State Building, where he tells her about his dream of building a string of upscale auto courts across the country. Margaret tells him she thinks it's a great idea and sends him to her father to get financing for his plan\u2014even providing him her father's old oilfield nickname \"Spouter\" so the secretaries will think he is one of Ben's old friends. Margaret knows that when her father learns that Bill used the nickname to pretend he was an old friend, he will make his life miserable.\nAs Margaret planned, Bill is given the runaround by Ben, who sends him off for even more by promising the support of his venture capitalist friend and business associate Atwater\u2014neither of whom know that Margaret is behind the whole thing. When Ben discovers that his daughter planned the revenge pretending to be his maid, he invites Bill over to dinner for some fun at their expense. Maggie turns the tables by inducing the real maid to masquerade as Ben's daughter. Still believing that Ben wants to help him, Bill shortly after sneaks into a party given by Atwater, where he finally discovers that Margaret, Ben, and Atwater have been making a fool of him. After telling them all off, Bill storms out of the party, not knowing that Margaret has fallen in love with him.  Hoping to square things, she goes to the auto court but learns that as a result of all the time he has spent away from his job Bill has been fired from his position and dropped out of sight.\nRealizing that Bill's national auto court plan has great potential, Ben and Atwater fight over who will finance the project. They converge on the high-rise construction site where Bill is now working and agree to be partners and pay Bill a substantial fee to serve as their architect. Bill accepts the offer. Sometime after, seeking forgiveness for what she's done, Margaret visits the original auto court, which is being transformed into his new vision. Playing Cupid, Ben soon arrives with a judge who is prepared to marry them. Ben's wife appears and tries to prevent the wedding, but Bill rebuffs her and professes his desire to marry Margaret.  The movie ends with the newly wed couple pulling down the shade on one of the auto court bungalows to begin their honeymoon post haste.\nPowell, still deep in his crooner era, sings four tunes. Comic relief is provided by the running gag of Ben being bested in a wide variety of one-on-one sports competitions with Case, his valet, and some exaggerated flower fanciers at the banquet Bill and Maggie crash for a free meal.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "560_461", "question": "What sport does grip play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "560_5261", "text": "In the sport of cricket, a slower ball is a slower-than-usual delivery from a fast bowler.   The bowler's intention is to deceive the batsman into playing too early so that he either misses the ball completely or hits it high up in the air to offer an easy catch. It is analogous to a changeup in baseball.\nThe slower ball, also known as the 'Wandi ball' technique was popularised in response to the demands of limited-overs cricket, not only to get wickets but also to slow down the scoring rate, as a slower ball will not carry to the boundary as easily as a normal fast delivery if it is hit square or behind the wicket. It is especially used in the last ten or so overs as variation in speed, in addition to line and length, is the key to preventing a late flurry of runs from the batsmen.\nTo be effective, the slower ball must be directed at or near the stumps in order to force the batsman to play, and the bowler's action must appear entirely normal. There are various tricks that the bowler can employ to slow the ball down:\n\nBowling from the back of the hand, effectively a fast googly\nBowling with split fingers: the fingers are placed either side of the seam of the ball, and the ball is bowled full-length; when done correctly the delivery will appear to be a full toss until it suddenly drops.  A similar technique is used to throw the split-finger fastball in baseball. Sri Lankan Dilhara Fernando holds the ball between the index and middle finger, and just fits it in the webbing between the two. This leads to the delivery of a slow loopy ball\nBowling a knuckleball, where the ball is held on the knuckles of the index and middle fingers. To a batsman, it resembles a stock ball due to it appearing as if the bowler was holding the ball in a regulation manner\nOff cutter: instead of placing the index and middle fingers in the orthodox position together on the seam, the middle finger is moved round the ball slightly and then pulled down as the ball is released.  The ball will tend to \"break\" or \"cut in\" from left to right as it pitches, as it does with off spin bowling. It can be effective to only bowl this ball with a single finger on top and it typically rests to the right hand side of the seam\nLeg cutter: the same as an off cutter except that the fingers go the other way and the ball will tend to cut from right to left.  Harder to keep straight than an off cutter\nPalm ball: the ball is held in the palm instead of the fingers; this can be effective but is hard to disguise\nHolding the ball deeper in the fingers. Typically, quick bowlers hold the ball at their fingertips. Holding the ball deeper within the fingers slows the release of the ball. Brett Lee is an exponent of this method\nReduction in the speed of the action: Can be quite effective as a \"different\" type of change of pace. Effectively you change only the rotation of your arm and retain your action\nCross-seam: This type of slower delivery is also popularly employed by medium pacers wherein the bowler holds the ball across the seam instead of holding it on the seam thereby the pace of delivery is reduced when the ball hits the ground. New Zealand medium pace bowler Gavin Larsen used this effectively in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. This can be coupled with a \"split fingers\" style release to result in a delivery which dips sharply at the end of its trajectory or spits from a pitched-up length\nZero rotation: Using a specific type of grip & release it is possible to impart little or no rotation on the ball. This lack of rotation causes an instability in air pressure, which makes the ball move erratically through the air\nSingle finger: Using a variation on the in-swinger grip where the index finger and thumb are both fully on the seam of the ball and the second finger barely touches it. Less force on the ball at the point of release results in reduced pace\nThumb ball: Bowled using the same grip as a stock delivery, barring the palm position, which is facing up instead of down, so that it looks like a back of the hand grip. This can be an effective delivery, but it is hard to produce", "hasanswer": false}]}

Jonnie played guard for West's college team, the West Virginia Mountaineers and married professional golfer Michelle Wie in 2019.As a person, West was often described as an introverted and nervous character, but who also drew the highest praise for his uncompromising work ethic. Regarding his shyness, WVU roommate Jody Gardner testified that West never dated in his entire freshman year, and Lakers coach Fred Schaus once recalled two weeks when his guard never said a word. Apart from being shy, West was always restless: Schaus described him as a \"bundle of nerves\", Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy as \"always on the move\", and fellow Laker and Mountaineer Rod Hundley testified that during bar visits, West would quickly squirm and demand to go elsewhere before everybody else had settled. His first wife Martha Kane recalled that her husband often had difficulties opening up to her. After a big loss, the Wests would drive home and she would try to console him, but West would say \"get out\" at the home porch and drive away\u2014an experience that \"killed\" her as a wife.Early in his career, West's West Virginian roots made him a target for some mild jeering. He spoke with a high pitched voice that became even shriller when he became excited so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West \"Tweety Bird\". His Appalachian accent was so thick that one coach interrupted him and asked him to speak English. Baylor once commented: \"Rumors are safe with you, Tweety Bird. You pass them on, but nobody can understand you.\"West was also regarded for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic. The NBA described West as \"obsessive perfectionism, unabashed confidence, and an uncompromising will to win... a level of intensity so high it could melt lead\". Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said: \"He took a loss harder than any player I've ever known. He would sit by himself and stare into space. A loss just ripped his guts out.\" Even before his sole championship in 1972, the Lakers held a \"Jerry West Night\", and eleven-time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said: \"Jerry, you are, in every sense of the word, truly a champion... If I could have one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy.\"In 2011, West and bestselling author Jonathan Coleman wrote a memoir entitled West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life. The book has had tremendous critical acclaim and became an instant  New York Times bestseller.

The project began as a straight remake of \u201cCurse of Frankenstein\u201d. Sangster declined until Hammer sweetened the deal by allowing him to re-write the script, produce and direct the project. Sangster rewrote the script as a black comedy. As Jonathan Rigby points out in the documentary \u201cGallows Humor\u201d included with the Blu-ray that the opening opened with a credit sequence that made clear what Sangster\u2019s intentions were; using what appears to be a felt tip pen (an anachronism) to mark off the body parts in a picture of a woman that would be needed for one of Frankenstein\u2019s creations.Budgeted at \u00a3200,000, Hammer sought independent financing and only had domestic distribution arranged at the time of production. This film was, along with \u201cScars of Dracula\u201d (the other film that EMI financed also at \u00a3200,000) the first pair of films where Hammer had ever sought independent U.K. financing.

The role was never offered to Peter Cushing, who had played the role many times previously for Hammer. This was part of an attempt to build Bates into a new star for Hammer.

Nicknamed \"Teddy Ballgame\", \"the Kid\", \"the Splendid Splinter\", and \"the Thumper\", Williams is regarded as one of the greatest hitters in baseball history and to date is the last player to hit over .400 in a season. His .482 on-base percentage is the highest of all time.\nWilliams was a nineteen-time All-Star, a two-time recipient of the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player Award, a six-time AL batting champion, and a two-time Triple Crown winner. He finished his playing career with a .344 batting average, 521 home runs, and a 1.116 on-base plus slugging percentage, the second highest of all time. His career batting average is the highest of any MLB player whose career was played primarily in the live-ball era, and ranks 8th all-time.\nBorn and raised in San Diego, Williams played baseball throughout his youth. After joining the Red Sox in 1939, he immediately emerged as one of the sport's best hitters. In 1941, Williams posted a .406 batting average; he is the last MLB player to bat over .400 in a season. He followed this up by winning his first Triple Crown in 1942. Williams was required to interrupt his baseball career in 1943 to serve three years in the United States Navy and Marine Corps during World War II. Upon returning to MLB in 1946, Williams won his first AL MVP Award and played in his only World Series. In 1947, he won his second Triple Crown. Williams was returned to active military duty for portions of the 1952 and 1953 seasons to serve as a Marine combat aviator in the Korean War. In 1957 and 1958 at the ages of 39 and 40, respectively, he was the AL batting champion for the fifth and sixth time.\nWilliams retired from playing in 1960.

An avid sport fisherman, he hosted a television program about fishing, and was inducted into the IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame. Williams's involvement in the Jimmy Fund helped raise millions in dollars for cancer care and research. In 1991, President George H. W.

The team has won 19 National League pennants, third-most of any team behind the Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers. St. Louis has also won 15 division titles in the East and Central divisions.\nIn 1881, entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased the Brown Stockings barnstorming club, renamed it the St. Louis Browns, and made it a charter member of the American Association baseball league. The team won four league championships, qualifying them to play in the era's professional baseball championship series, a forerunner of the modern World Series. In two of these championships, the Browns met the Chicago White Stockings, now the Chicago Cubs, launching the enduring Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry.\nIn 1892, the Browns \u2013 also called the Perfectos \u2013 joined the National League. In 1900, the team was renamed the Cardinals.

{"id": "560_532", "question": "What sport does Christian Lee play?", "ctxs": [{"id": "257_49092", "text": "Lee was trained from a young age by his father Bruce Lee in martial arts. During this time, martial artist Bob Wall, a friend and collaborator of Bruce, observed that Lee hit with power and had good footwork. At age eight, after his father's death, Bruce's disciple Dan Inosanto trained Lee. According to Jeff Imada who at the time was helping with children's classes at Inosanto's Kali Institute, the fact that he was the son of one of its founders was kept quiet; Lee had difficulty focusing due to seeing his father's photos taking so much space in his studio. Imada said Lee stopped training in his mid-teens to play soccer. Richard Bustillo also trained Lee during his teens and said that Lee worked hard and was always respectful. Lee said that with his training Arnis with Inosanto he specialized in both Kali and Escrima and lasted three to four years.In 1986, Lee said that he was training in Yee Chuan Tao, a relaxation-based martial art, with a trainer named Mike Vendrell. Lee said that it consisted of exercises such as slow sparring, Chi sao practice; they also worked on a wooden dummy, as well as Vendrell swinging a staff at him while he would duck or jump over. He said later that the exercise helped him be less tense.Also in the 1980s, Lee returned to Dan Inosanto's Academy. Lee said he did a few amateur fights but did not seek to compete in tournaments. He would bring a camera to Inosanto's studio, both would choreograph fights for Lee's films and would allow him to see how various moves played out on screen. During this time, Lee also trained in weapon-based martial arts such as Eskrima and Silat. In 1991, Lee was certified by the Thai Boxing Association. While his main goal was dramatic acting, he credited his skill in martial arts to have helped him to get roles that require it.During the filming of The Crow, Lee said he did cardiovascular exercises to the point of exhaustion using a jump rope, running, riding a LifeCycle, or using a StairMaster, after which he would train at Inosanto's academy where he took Muay Thai classes.According to Lee's mother, years prior to his death Lee became consumed with his father's written philosophy, taking lengthy notes. When asked which martial arts he practiced, he responded:\n\nWhen people ask me that question, I usually say that my father created the art of Jeet Kune Do and I have been trained in that. However, that's a little too simple to say because Jeet Kune Do was my father's very personal expression of the martial arts. So I always feel a little bit silly saying I practice Jeet Kune Do, although I certainly have been trained in it. It would be more accurate to say that I practice my own interpretation of Jeet Kune Do, just as everyone who practices Jeet Kune Do does.\nIn August 1992, Bruce Lee biographer John Little asked Brandon Lee what his philosophy in life was, and he replied, \"Eat\u2014or die!\" Brandon later spoke of the martial arts and self-knowledge:\n\nWell, I would say this: when you move down the road towards mastery of the martial arts\u2014and you know, you are constantly moving down that road\u2014you end up coming up against these barriers inside yourself that will attempt to stop you from continuing to pursue the mastery of the martial arts. And these barriers are such things as when you come up against your own limitations, when you come up against the limitations of your will, your ability, your natural ability, your courage, how you deal with success\u2014and failure as well, for that matter. And as you overcome each one of these barriers, you end up learning something about yourself. And sometimes, the things you learn about yourself can, to the individual, seem to convey a certain spiritual sense along with them.\n...It's funny, every time you come up against a true barrier to your progress, you are a child again. And it's a very interesting experience to be reduced, once again, to the level of knowing nothing about what you're doing. I think there's a lot of room for learning and growth when that happens\u2014if you face it head-on and don't choose to say, \"Ah, screw that! I'm going to do something else!\"\n\nWe reduce ourselves at a certain point in our lives to kind of solely pursuing things that we already know how to do. You know, because you don't want to have that experience of not knowing what you're doing and being an amateur again. And I think that's rather unfortunate. It's so much more interesting and usually illuminating to put yourself in a situation where you don't know what's going to happen, than to do something again that you already know essentially what the outcome will be within three or four points either way.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A resurgence in the second half of the season saw the club pick up more points than most of the clubs above it to finish in 5th place. The major achievement was winning the 2014 Dockerty Cup, beating South Springvale in the final through a 121st-minute goal from captain Tomislav Uskok. On the way to the final, Melbourne beat rivals South Melbourne in the quarter-finals in a riveting contest. The club also qualified for the inaugural 2014 FFA Cup through their progression in the Dockerty Cup, but were knocked out by Olympic FC in the Round of 32 in a contentious affair.\nThe 2015 season saw the club qualify for the newly re-introduced league finals series after a strong league showing, finishing in 4th place. The Knights exited the finals series at the first stage, though, going down on penalties to Hume City FC. In the penalty shoot-out, Hume City keeper Chris Oldfield saved all four of Croatia's penalty kicks. At the club's end of season awards night, talismanic striker Stipo Andrija\u0161evi\u0107 took out the 2015 Best & Fairest and 2015 Top Goalscorer awards. Andrija\u0161evi\u0107's incredible long distance volley into the top corner against Green Gully SC on 18 July was voted as the best goal in the NPL Victoria.Wth youth product, captain and fan-favourite Tomislav Uskok signing for A-League side Central Coast Mariners in November, 2015 Knights re-signed the majority of their players from the previous season. Established goalkeeper Chris May and long serving full back Anthony Colosimo departed and in came young talents like 18-year-old Nick Glavan and 17-year-old Nikola Jurkovi\u0107 from Melbourne Victory Youth and sister-club North Geelong Warriors respectively. Melbourne Knights finished the NPL Victoria season in ninth place, missing out on a finals spot. However, the Somers Street-based side qualified for the national stage of the 2016 FFA Cup following a 2\u20130 victory over Port Melbourne SC. Knights drew Western Australian side Cockburn City SC, defeating them 2\u20131 at Knights Stadium. In the Round of 16, at home once more, Melbourne Knights lost 3\u20131 to Green Gully in front of 2,472 fans.\nAfter a disappointing first half of the 2017 season, head coach Andrew Marth and assistant Frank Juri\u0107 were relieved of their coaching duties with the club languishing in third-bottom place and out of the FFA Cup in the qualifying stages, losing to NPL Victoria 2 side Dandenong City. Former Port Melbourne coach Eric Vassiliadis was announced as the new head coach on 21 May 2017. Vassiliadis lasted just 35 days in the role before he was relieved of his duties, gaining one point in five matches in his time as head coach. Croatia finished in 12th place with 24 points, its lowest points total since returning to Victorian state football in 2005. The 12th-place finish meant Knights had to play in the promotion-relegation playoff match, coming up against fellow Croatian-backed side Dandenong City for the second time that season. A Kym Harris hat-trick secured a 3\u20132 win for Melbourne Knights on the day and survival in the NPL Victoria.In the post-season, a change in board saw a change in senior team management, with Knights securing former Croatian international Aljo\u0161a Asanovi\u0107 as the head coach, with Dean Ra\u010dunica his assistant. The appointment of Asanovi\u0107, a World Cup bronze medal winner in 1998, and Ra\u010dunica, was hailed as arguable the biggest coaching coup in the history of the NPL Victoria. Uskok also returned to the club. Knights finished the 2018 National Premier Leagues Victoria season in ninth place, four points adrift of a finals spot. Marijan Cvitkovic, Nate Foster and Uskok all finished the season with eight goals. Croatia won the 2018 Australian-Croatian Soccer Tournament, hosted by Gold Coast Knights, beating North Geelong 3\u20130 in the final. After the conclusion of the season, Asanovi\u0107 and Ra\u010dunica departed the club to take up an opportunity in Saudi Arabia, joining Slaven Bili\u0107 at Al-Ittihad.The club promoted Micky Colina, the club's u20s coach, to take over the senior head manager role for 2019. On 25 May 2019, the club announced that it had parted ways with Micky Colina as head coach of the first team along with his assistant Steve Gojevic.
