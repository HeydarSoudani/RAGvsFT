Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Meanwhile, police captain Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Karas defuses a hostage situation by killing the hostage-takers. Afterwards Karas is given the job of solving the mystery surrounding Ilona's disappearance. Karas begins by contacting Dr. Jonas Muller, a former Avalon scientist familiar with her.\nMuller had been working to cure progeria, a genetic condition which affected his brother. Muller worked for Avalon as their top scientist but left after he failed to find a cure and his brother died. He took up new work at a free clinic. Muller tells Karas that \"No one ever leaves Avalon\", throwing the corporation under suspicion. Karas visits Paul Dellenbach, one of Avalon's CEOs and questions him about Ilona. On suggesting he may have been sleeping with her, Dellenbach replies \"I sleep with my wife, I sleep with my secretary, I even sleep with my sister-in-law but I would never sleep with one of my researchers\".\nAfter following a series of dead ends, control tells Karas they are tailing Illona's car through Paris. Eventually he captures the driver after a chase which ends at the Eiffel Tower. The man turns out to be a henchmen of Farfella, an Arab Muslim mobster and a childhood friend of Karas. The police captain returns the criminal to Farfella who in return gives him security footage of Illona's kidnapping; it shows her car being stolen by an incredibly old man.\nKaras asks Ilona's sister, Bislane, who works for Avalon to break into the company's Archives to discover what Muller was researching. Bislane discovers that a Dr. Nakata worked with Muller in a quest to find a cure for progeria. But they destroyed all evidence of their work when some of the children they were testing on started to mutate. Karas and Bislane then escape because accessing the closed file has alerted Avalon security.\nLater Karas opens up to Bislane and tells her that he and Farfella were raised in the casbah where they worked with gangs. After a drug run went wrong, they ended up in a holding cell. Farfella escaped but Karas was left to the mercy of the other gang. Karas puts Bislane under false arrest to protect her from Avalon. Meanwhile, Ilona is shown confined in a cyber ball which is being controlled by the old man.\nEventually Karas tracks down Muller. He explains that he took Ilona because through her research she has discovered the secret to eternal life (as he himself did 40 years ago); but knowing what the consequences would be if Avalon acquired such knowledge, he kidnapped her. Karas tries to encourage the old scientist to hand himself in but Muller is mistakenly shot by a police marksman. Karas then deduces that the mysterious old man is Muller's younger brother: now immortal but trapped in an elderly body.\nKaras calls on Farfella who hides Bislane from Avalon while also getting a fake passport for Ilona. However the mega-corporation's security are also closing in on the Parisian sewer where Ilona is being held captive. After a short battle, Karas is mortally wounded rescuing Ilona. However she refuses to take the fake passport to start a new life. Instead she tells Karas she wants immortality by giving her discovery to Avalon. Reluctantly Karas shoots her in the back as she walks back towards Avalon security. CEO Dellenbach watches all this happen through a live feed from one of his men's helmet camera.\nAs Karas lies dying, he imagines himself apologising to Bislane for killing her sister, for which she forgives him. Muller's little brother, living as a tramp, throws his picture of him and Muller into a burning bin.

He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States, and of American literature. Poe was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story, and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction. He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. He attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with John Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under an assumed name, he published his first collection, Tamerlane and Other Poems, credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan.\nPoe switched his focus to prose, and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, but she died of tuberculosis in 1847. In January 1845, he published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal The Penn, later renamed The Stylus. But before it began publishing, Poe died in Baltimore in 1849, aged 40, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of his death remains unknown, and has been variously attributed to many causes including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide.Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums.

AllMusic's Steve Huey states that \"Nine Inch Nails were the most popular industrial group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience\". Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as Throbbing Gristle and Test Dept. Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term \"industrial\" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. Reznor acknowledged in Spin magazine that \"Down in It\" was influenced by early Skinny Puppy, particularly the band's song \"Dig It\"; other songs from Pretty Hate Machine and With Teeth have been described as synth-pop.:\u200a35\u200a Reviewing The Fragile, critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in \"The Frail\" and drum and bass elements in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" Ambient music has been featured in some of Nine Inch Nails' music, including on Ghosts I\u2013IV (which is specifically dark ambient), Hesitation Marks, The Downward Spiral, The Slip, and The Fragile.\n\nSongs such as \"Wish\" and \"The Day the World Went Away\" exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" and \"Burn\". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in \"The Collector\" from With Teeth and concert favorite \"March of the Pigs\". Reznor uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song \"Hurt\", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word \"I\" every time the B/E# dyad is played. \"Closer\" concludes with a chromatic piano motif: the melody is debuted during the second verse of \"Piggy\" on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of \"Heresy\", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout \"A Warm Place\", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on \"The Downward Spiral\".On The Fragile, Reznor revisits the technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument with a transposed harmony or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on Year Zero contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire second half of the three-minute long \"The Great Destroyer\". Allmusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: \"Guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken.\" Lyrical themes found in Nine Inch Nails songs are largely concerned with dark explorations of the self ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, and nihilism. Occasionally, the lyrics depart from their introspective nature to deal with a topic like politics, which is the focus of Year Zero. Three Nine Inch Nails albums are concept albums: The Downward Spiral, The Fragile, and Year Zero. The album With Teeth was originally set to be a concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its story begins when Dark Matter invades Ripple Star, a planet populated by fairies. The fairy Ribbon flees with a sacred crystal, but Dark Matter shatters it and spreads it across the galaxy. Ribbon lands on Pop Star and meets Kirby, who agrees to help retrieve the shards and defeat Dark Matter. Along the way, they enlist the help of artist Adeleine, King Dedede, and Dedede's minion Waddle Dee, after each of them stumble upon a crystal shard and end up being possessed by Dark Matter, forcing Kirby to battle each of them in order to free them from the Dark Matter's influence.Similar to contemporary platformers such as Pandemonium! (1996) and Klonoa: Door to Phantomile (1997), Kirby 64 is a 2.5D platformer; although environments and characters are rendered in 3D computer graphics, gameplay is restricted to a 2D plane. Players control Kirby using the Nintendo 64 controller's D-pad. Like earlier Kirby games, Kirby can walk or run, crouch, jump, and inhale enemies or objects to spit them out as bullets. He can fly for a limited time by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, though he can release a weak puff of air. By eating certain enemies, Kirby can gain one of seven copy abilities, power-ups allowing him to take on the properties the enemy possessed. In certain levels, Kirby will ride on King Dedede's back, allowing him to clear certain obstacles with Dedede's hammer; in other levels, Kirby rides a minecart or log flume piloted by Waddle Dee.Kirby 64 introduces Power Combos, the option to combine Kirby's copy abilities. Power Combos can be created by inhaling two enemies at once, by throwing one ability at another, or by spitting an enemy at another. The latter two methods create a colored star that can be collected to obtain the Power Combo. There are 28 possible combinations, which are stronger than normal copy abilities or have added effects. For instance, by combining the \"Burn\" and \"Needle\" abilities, Kirby can shoot fire arrows. Players can also mix two of the same abilities, which will increase their power.The game takes place across six worlds, which are split into several levels. After the player selects a level, they must navigate it while avoiding enemies and obstacles. If Kirby or King Dedede touches an enemy or hazard, he loses health. Health can be replenished by eating food scattered across levels. If the character loses all their health, falls off the bottom of the screen, or gets crushed, the player loses a life. Losing all lives results in a game over. Players can earn lives by collecting stars or 1-ups.

He crossed the sounds of house with hip hop breaks to create a more energized and popular sound that was able to reach commercial success outside the underground house scene. His productions extensively used samples that blend the sounds of classic disco, the Chicago house sound, and elements of hip-hop.Terry began his career in the 1980s, DJing at parties in New York. At first, he played Italo disco and hip-hop. Later he concentrated on house music upon its mid-'80s emergence. He debuted as Masters at Work with the 12-inch \"Alright Alright\" (1987, Fourth Floor) and an edit from this was then included on the Chicago house vanguard compilation Jackmaster 1 (1987, D.J. International/Westside UK).Much of Terry's early work in the late 1980s is considered a milestone in the development of house and rave music. He was responsible for releasing two of the house era's most respected crossover remixes: \"I'll House You\" by the Jungle Brothers (summer 1988) and \"Missing\" by Everything but the Girl as a re-release in October 1995. His music was a driving force within the \"acid house\" scene in the UK with many tracks such as \"Back to the Beat\", \"Can You Party\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Weekend\", \"Party People\", \"Yeah, Buddy\" and \"Dreams of Santa-Anna\", released under multiple aliases including the Todd Terry Project, Royal House, Black Riot, Swan Lake and Orange Lemon. In the summer of 1988 at the peak of the UK acid house movement, \"Can You Party\" under his Royal House moniker reached No. 14 in the UK.Terry's notable releases during the 1990s include \"Something Goin' On\" and \"Keep on Jumpin'\", which were UK top-ten hits, with the vocals on both provided by Jocelyn Brown and Martha Wash.\nFreestyle artist Shannon was the featured vocalist on the UK top 20 hit \"It's Over Love\" in 1997, which topped the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs chart in the US, as did \"Just Wanna Dance / Weekend\". An album, Ready for a New Day, was also released in 1997, featuring \"Something Goin' On\", \"Keep on Jumpin'\" and \"It's Over Love\". It reached No. 84 on the UK Albums Chart.In 1996, he remixed \"Stranger in Moscow\" for Michael Jackson.\nIn 1999, inspired by the drum & bass genre, Terry released Resolutions on Astralwerks Records. He also worked on the albums One Half of a Whole Decade and Live & Remastered.Throughout his career, Terry has used several aliases including Hard House, Swan Lake, Orange Lemon, Royal House, and Black Riot. As Black Riot, \"Warlock/A Day in the Life\" was released as a single on the Champion label and entered the UK Singles Chart on December 3, 1988, reaching a peak position of number 68. He also recorded under the monikers CLS, Masters at Work (with Kenny \"Dope\" Gonzalez and \"Little\" Louie Vega), Dredd Stock, House of Gypsies, Limelife, Tyme Forse, and the Gypsymen (scoring a number-one Billboard Hot Dance/Club play hit in 1992 with \"Hear the Music\").Terry co-produced the song \"Shake\" on P.M.

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Breen. Erich Pommer, who was responsible for the rebuilding of the German film industry, placed what was left of the facilities at Universum Film AG at Wilder's disposal. While researching the existing situation for his screenplay, he interviewed many of the American military personnel stationed in Berlin, as well as its residents, many of whom were having difficulty dealing with the destruction of their city. One of them was a woman he met while she was clearing rubble from the streets. \"The woman was grateful the Allies had come to fix the gas\", Wilder later recalled. \"I thought it was so she could have a hot meal, but she said it was so she could commit suicide\".Marlene Dietrich was Wilder's first choice to play Erika, and Friedrich Hollaender already had written three songs \u2013 \"Black Market\", \"Illusions\", and \"The Ruins of Berlin\" \u2013 for her to sing in the film (the lyrics were closely tied to the plot), but the director suspected she would be opposed to portraying a woman who collaborated with the Nazis. En route home from Berlin, he stopped in Paris to visit her, ostensibly to hear her opinion about a screen test he had made with June Havoc. \"She kept making criticisms and suggestions ... and finally I said, like I had thought of it just that moment, 'Marlene, only you can play this part.' And she agreed with me\", Wilder said.Wilder persuaded Jean Arthur, who was attending college at the time, to come out of retirement to play Phoebe. Throughout filming, the actress felt the director was favoring Dietrich, and late one night she and her husband Frank Ross went to Wilder's home to confront him with her suspicions. \"Marlene told you to burn my close-up\", an extremely upset Arthur insisted. \"She doesn't want me to look better than she does.\" Wilder, knowing such insecurities were common when two very different personalities were working together, tried to reassure her he was not playing favorites, although of all the actresses he directed, he admired Dietrich most of all. \"The crews adored her ... She liked to find somebody with a cold, so she could make chicken soup for him. She loved to cook\", Wilder recollected. Years later, Arthur called Wilder to tell him she finally had seen the film and liked it, apologized and said she would act in any future Wilder project.Location shooting, much of it in the Soviet occupation zone, began in August 1947, and filming continued at Paramount Pictures in Hollywood between December 1947 and February 1948.

Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference to and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music\u2014exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka\u2014as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instruments such as harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments, such as the sitar and slide guitar, in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs. According to biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the Stones \"pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock & roll that came to define hard rock with a \"strong yet subtly swinging rhythm\" provided by Wyman and Watts.Jagger and Richards had a shared admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. Little Walter influenced Brian Jones. Richards recalls, \"He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's all the same shit, man, and you can do it.'\" Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair, stating in 2003, \"Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four.\" Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R&B artists, said it \"seemed the most real thing\" he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the \"most powerful music [he had] ever heard ... the most expressive\". He also recalled, \"when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters\u2014and there were a lot of us\u2014in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, [it was] very ... heartwarming\".Despite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live set lists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. Critic Richie Unterberger described the first Jagger/Richards single, \"Tell Me (You're Coming Back)\", as a \"pop rock ballad ... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers\". \"As Tears Go By\", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, \"It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn't think of [recording] it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group.\" The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.Richards said of their early writing experiences, \"The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try ...'\" Jagger opined, \"We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order ... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us.\"\nThe writing of \"The Last Time\", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it \"a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.\" The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.Beginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the \"ancient art of weaving\" responsible for part of their sound\u2014the interplay between two guitarists on stage. Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's. Likewise, Watts was primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming. The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards, and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes for a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills. In the studio the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on Beggars Banquet are driven by Nicky Hopkins' piano playing. On Exile on Main St., Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.Richards started using open tunings for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a capo), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Brown Sugar\" (Sticky Fingers, 1971), \"Tumbling Dice\" (capo IV), \"Happy\" (capo IV), (Exile on Main St., 1972), and \"Start Me Up\" (Tattoo You, 1981).The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict, resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years. When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision-making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like having his authority diminished. This led to the period Richards has referred to as \"World War III\". Of making albums with the Stones, Richards referred to it in 2023 as \"controlled madness. Mick is the controller and I'm the madness.\"Musical collaboration between members of the band and supporting musicians was key, due to the fluid lineups typically experienced by the band in the studio, as tracks tended to be recorded \"by whatever members of the group happened to be around at the time of the sessions\". Over time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the Telegraph, \"changed music\" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry.\nStephen Hyden writes:The Rolling Stones turn 50 next year, an unprecedented milestone for a rock group and confirmation of an obvious truism: Nobody survives like the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. Starting out as a purist blues combo that fronted a bad-boy image while recording the occasional Lennon/McCartney pop tune and string-laden ballad to help secure their popularity, the Stones deftly moved through a number of guises in the '60s and '70s while remaining essentially the same band at its core. When arena-rock reigned, the Stones became an excessive live act whose decadence was on par with Led Zeppelin; when David Bowie and glam became the hippest thing in England, Mick Jagger lathered on the mascara and campy posturing. By the time of 1978's Some Girls, the Stones absorbed the energy of New York City's punk and disco scenes so completely that it reinvigorated the band's career, spawning their final (to date) No. 1 single in the U.S., \"Miss You.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Shinoda told Musique Mag that the band wanted the album to be \"more energetic [and] song-based\", as opposed to their previous album, A Thousand Suns, which was more of a concept record.The band had numerous influences and inspirations for Living Things. Shinoda told Rolling Stone that \"Castle of Glass\", \"Skin to Bone\" and \"Roads Untraveled\" contained folk music influenced by the works of Bob Dylan, as well as the inspirations of Dylan. In the seventh track \"Victimized\", which Rolling Stone described as \"the band's most aggressive track in years\", was influenced by punk rock bands such as Pennywise and Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Shinoda noted the minimal content of numerous punk rock songs attributed to the short length of \"Victimized\"; bassist Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell noted that the song's working title, \"Battle Axe\", \"which to me is..what that song is; it's just this big 'crack' and then you're out.\" Like the band's first two albums, the penultimate track (\"Tinfoil\") is an instrumental.

After a few attempts by her aunt to get her back in bed, she tells Harper that she just came back into the house after climbing out of her window to investigate a sound that she heard. Joan says that she just witnessed her uncle, Harper's husband, loading bloody children and other people into the back of a lorry. After repeated attempts to censor what Joan saw, Harper tells her that the uncle is saving the children and taking them to a safer place. She tells Joan that she can never tell anyone about what she saw because it would put all of their lives in danger. Harper claims they are on the good side and are making the world a better place.\nAct 2, Scene 1 is roughly 15 years later in a factory where an adult Joan has just begun her professional career as a milliner. Her co-worker Todd is an established hatter and is experienced in the field. Various days at the factory are seen, with the hats that Joan and Todd are making in various stages of completion over time. Todd and Joan exchange basic conversation about this body of work and about their previous works. Todd says that the company has been pushing for hats to be created quicker for the parades; they used to have two weeks to finish a hat but now they only have one.\nScene 2: Joan and Todd learn more about each other through a discussion about their current hat designs. Todd brings up a hypothesis that the way the company gets contracts is corrupt, claiming there is a certain person's brother-in-law that is involved. Joan wants to know more, but Todd doesn't want to talk about it at work. Joan changes the topic, saying she does not like to watch the trials at night. Todd says he watches them every night while drinking Pernod, or absinthe.\nScene 3: Todd and Joan speak about different hat genres: Animal and Abstract. Joan changes the subject and asks why Todd doesn't do something (regarding the corruption). He says he spends days wondering what he should do.\nScene 4: Joan and Todd compliment each other on their almost completed hats. Todd announces he is going to talk to \"him\" (someone working above Todd). He says he is going to talk about the brother-in-law and hint at the possibility of leaking information to a friend of his who is a journalist. He say that if he lost his job, he'd miss Joan.\nScene 5 shows the completed hats of Todd and Joan on the heads of prisoners being marched to have the hats \"judged\" in the trials.\nScene 6 returns to the factory. Joan states that she can't believe that she won. She says she doesn't understand why more aren't kept, because they could be re-used. Todd says that keeping more hats would put them out of work. Joan thinks it is sad that all the hats are burned with the bodies. Todd says that the hats are metaphorical for life. He is not bothered that only three out of nearly 300 hats that he has created made it to the museum. He loves making beauty that disappears. Todd brings up his meeting with \"him\". \"He\" said, \"These things must be thought about\". Todd wonders if \"he\" was talking about the content of their meeting, or if he should fire Todd.

A North American version of the game was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released globally as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015 and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022.\nMother was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies and received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score from Famitsu magazine. Mother was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, but many considered its sequel Mother 2: G\u012bgu no Gyakush\u016b (known outside as EarthBound) to be similar and a better overall implementation of Mother's gameplay ideas, with the game's high difficulty level polarizing critics, along with balance issues. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com wrote that Mother importantly generated interest in video game emulation and the historical preservation of unreleased games. The game was re-released in Japan on the single-cartridge compilation Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance in 2003.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology. The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes. Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a Star Wars planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life. The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae. Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars. Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections and hyperspace transmission.The universe of Star Wars is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories. One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as \"an energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together\". The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god. Through training and meditation, those whom \"the Force is strong with\" exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy). It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force. The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression. While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.The franchise is set against a backdrop of galactic conflict involving republics and empires, such as the evil Galactic Empire. The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called the lightsaber, a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant. Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments, while illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.The combination of science fiction and fantasy elements makes Star Wars a very universal franchise, capable of telling stories of various genres.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The U-boat was U-110. In 1942, the Royal Navy also seized U-559, capturing additional Enigma codebooks.

An earlier military Enigma had been examined by Polish Intelligence in 1928; the Polish Cipher Bureau broke the Enigma code in 1932 and gave their findings to Britain and France in 1939, just before the German invasion of Poland.Sub Lt.

He spent most of his life in Italy, and is one of the earliest important artists, apart from his contemporaries in Dutch Golden Age painting, to concentrate on landscape painting.  His landscapes are usually turned into the more prestigious genre of history paintings by the addition of a few small figures, typically representing a scene from the Bible or classical mythology.\nBy the end of the 1630s he was established as the leading landscapist in Italy, and enjoyed large fees for his work. His landscapes gradually became larger, but with fewer figures, more carefully painted, and produced at a lower rate. He was not generally an innovator in landscape painting, except in introducing the sun and streaming sunlight into many paintings, which had been rare before.  He is now thought of as a French painter, but was born in the independent Duchy of Lorraine, and almost all his painting was done in Italy; before the late 19th century he was regarded as a painter of the \"Roman School\". His patrons were also mostly Italian, but after his death he became very popular with English collectors, and the UK retains a high proportion of his works.\nHe was a prolific creator of drawings in pen and very often monochrome watercolour \"wash\", usually brown but sometimes grey. Chalk is sometimes used for under-drawing, and white highlighting in various media may be employed, much less often other colours such as pink.  These fall into three fairly distinct groups. Firstly there are large numbers of sketches, mostly of landscapes, and apparently very often done at the scene; these have been greatly admired, and influenced other artists. Then there are studies for paintings, of various degrees of finish, many clearly done before or during the process of painting, but others perhaps after that was complete. This was certainly the case for the last group, the 195 drawings recording finished paintings collected in his Liber Veritatis (now in the British Museum). He produced over 40 etchings, often simplified versions of paintings, mainly before 1642.  These served various purposes for him, but are now regarded as much less important than his drawings. He painted frescoes in his early career, which played an important part in making his reputation, but are now nearly all lost.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The project yielded only a three-track EP, Ride, Rope and Destroy, released in 2004. It has been confirmed by both Ethan Luck and Reese Roper that there never was a fourth, unreleased song recorded for the EP. Reese Roper often compared the sound of the band to Letters to Cleo. Their name was a play on the Rage Against the Machine single \"Guerrilla Radio\".\nWhen the Guerilla Rodeo project came to an end, Reese reformed the band under his own name, Roper. Roper's full-length album, Brace Yourself for the Mediocre, was produced before the band was officially together and released on Five Minute Walk Records. All songs on the album with the exception of \"Day of Pigs\" and \"You're Still The One\" were written by Reese Roper, Masaki Liu, and Ethan Luck. Because of the incomplete state of the band at the time of the album's release, the only official member appearing on the CD is Reese Roper. As a result, the album features many additional musicians such as Frank Lenz (drums), Elijah Thomson (bass), Phil Bennett (organ), Bob Schiveley (guitar), Masaki Liu (guitar), Jason White (additional drums), Ethan Luck (guitar), and many additional vocalists. Some of the songs on the album were originally written for Guerilla Rodeo.  One of the online forums spawned by this group is the Roper Board in which many fans of both Roper and Reese's previous band Five Iron Frenzy congregate.\nRoper issued a statement regarding the status of the band in 2006:\n\nWhat happened to Roper? Is it dead? - Yes. Roper was a project put together by 5minutewalk records. We had a falling out with them, and are too lazy to start over again. Everyone has real jobs now, and although we miss seeing you all, we are just going to let it die. Unless you are a record company executive that wants to give us an enormous signing bonus and not make us tour.\nIn 2009 Reese Roper told HM that the probability of making another album was \"somewhere around 3%.\" The Roper project sold close to 30,000 albums in total, about the same as Brave Saint Saturn and other Five Iron related side projects. He also stated that, in retrospect, the project was \"doomed from the beginning,\" but that musically it was the highlight of his career.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The only individual who can bend all four elements, the \"Avatar\", is responsible for maintaining harmony among the world's four nations, and serves as the link between the physical world and the spirit world. The series is centered around the journey of twelve-year-old Aang, the current Avatar and last survivor of his nation, the Air Nomads, along with his friends Katara, Sokka, and Toph, as they strive to end the Fire Nation's war against the other nations and defeat Fire Lord Ozai before he conquers the world. It also follows the story of Zuko\u2014the exiled prince of the Fire Nation, seeking to restore his lost honor by capturing Aang, accompanied by his uncle Iroh\u2014and later, his sister Azula. Avatar is presented in a style that combines anime with American cartoons and relies on the imagery of primarily Chinese culture, with various other influences from different East Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian, North Asian, and Native American cultures.\nAvatar: The Last Airbender was a ratings success and received acclaim from critics for its characters, cultural references, art direction, voice acting, soundtrack, humor, and themes. These include concepts rarely touched on in youth entertainment, including war, genocide, imperialism, totalitarianism, indoctrination and free choice. It won five Annie Awards, a Genesis Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Kids' Choice Award, and a Peabody Award. The show is regarded by many critics as one of the greatest animated television series of all time.\nAvatar aired on Nickelodeon for three seasons, from February 2005 to July 2008.

{"id": "91_67", "question": "What genre is A Love Story?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Penderecki was interested in freedom from conventional aspects of music\u2014namely meter, rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Important works from this period, particularly Anaklasis (1959\u201360), Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960), and Fluorescences (1961\u201362), were experimental compositions characterized by blocks of sound of varying dynamics, extended techniques on acoustic instruments, and tone clusters.By the early 1970s, however, Penderecki began to move away from the avant-garde movement, claiming in an interview in 2000, \"we pushed music so far in the sixties that even for myself, for me, I closed the door behind me, because there was no way to do anything more than I have done... I decided that there is no way that I can move on.\" Acknowledging that he had pushed the limits, Penderecki began to rediscover the neo-Romantics while working as a conductor in the 1970s. He specifies, \"The kind of music I was conducting influenced my own music very much... During this time I began to have my Romantic ideas, partly because I was conducting Bruckner, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky.\" At this point in his career, Penderecki's music begins to feature melodic expression, lyricism, and dramatic character.Penderecki felt that the early 1970s represented a major shift in his compositional style. Important to this shift was the composer's renewed emphasis on \"tradition.\" Penderecki attributed the importance of tradition to Artur Malawski, his composition teacher from 1954\u201357, who balanced contemporary techniques with more conventional musical forms. Penderecki echoed Malawski's compositional philosophy: \"The general principles at the root of a work's musical style... the integrity of a musical experience embodied in the notes the composer is setting down on paper, never change. The idea of good music means today exactly what it meant always.\" In 1973, he also stated he was in search of a new direction, one which resolved to \"gain inspiration from the past and look back on my heritage.\" For Penderecki, tradition also served as an \"opportunity to [overcome the] dissonance between the artist and the audience.\"The symphony particularly became an essential genre for Penderecki starting in the early 1970s, stating that his \"third style period\" began with his first symphony. From the 1970s on, Penderecki described the importance of the symphony in various ways, for instance explaining that his second symphony of 1980 \"referred fully to the late-nineteenth century symphonic tradition...\" He also stated in 2000, \"...It's very clear that I'm trying to continue this tradition, this Romantic tradition\" when describing his symphonic compositions. A passage from his collected essays Labyrinth of Time confirms this sentiment: \"I would like to continue the music that was cast at the beginning of the [twentieth] century: the tradition of writing symphonies.\" More importantly, however, Penderecki saw the genre as a kind of synthesis of traditional and contemporary styles, calling the symphony \"that musical ark which would make it possible to convey to coming generations what is best in our twentieth-century tradition of the composing of sounds.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

To facilitate improvisation a number of patterns evolved, of which the most familiar is the Twelve-bar blues.\n\nThe typical harmonic structure of Blues, as identified by New Grove, is the twelve-bar blues.\nBecause blues is based on improvisation, having a common and familiar chord progression lends itself to an easier improvisation.  Not every blues progression is exactly the same, but this one in particular is very common, and Barber uses this progression almost exactly.  What ties this movement with the first is the harmonic progression.  The boogie-woogie, which is \u201ca style of piano blues,\u201d also contains the chord progression I-IV-I-V-I.\nEach large phrase of a twelve-bar blues is broken up into three sub-phrases consisting of four measures each.  In the third sub-phrase, the third measure contains two harmonic possibilities.  In the first and third twelve-bar phrases of Barber's movement, the subdominant harmony (C) occurs after the dominant harmony (D); however, in the second and fourth twelve-bar phrases, the subdominant does not occur, but rather the tonic appears. The harmonic movement from V \u2192 IV \u2192 I, creating a plagal-type of cadence, is weaker than the V \u2192 V \u2192 I movement.  When Barber uses this type of movement in the last 12-bar phrase, it creates a strong closing gesture.  This is one way in which Barber strays from the typical twelve-bar blues form.\nAnother way that Barber differs from the typical twelve-bar blues pattern is that on the first, second and fourth occurrence of the phrase, there is an added measure to each. The first twelve-bar phrase, measure 1 through 13, has its repeated measure at the end of the phrase.  Through means of extension by repetition, measure 13 is identical to bar 12.  The second and fourth phrases do not contain a repeated measure at the end of the phrase.\nIn phrase 2, measure 14 through 26, there is an extension by repetition from measures 14 to 16.  Those three measures can be grouped together as can measures 17 and 18 for their melodic similarities.  Measures 14 to 16 all contain the melodic bass figure and a parallel right hand pattern as well.  The next two measures are the second half of that sub-phrase.  The right hand chord is a G-major triad with an added second underneath a B to G eighth-note triplet pattern.\nThe exact extension that occurred in phrase 2 also occurs in phrase 4 due to their striking similarities.  Even though the right-hand motive in phrase 4 begins a third higher, it is still very similar to phrase 2's occurrence.  Measure 39 is repeated twice instead of just one time with a few slight alterations to the rhythmic patterns before moving to the G-major triad with an added second in bar 42.  Barber uses this addition of one measure to some of the twelve-bar phrases.  By doing this, he makes the overall structure atypical compared to the standard twelve-bar phrase.\nAs mentioned briefly before, there are unifying phrases throughout the twelve-bar phrases that help to connect each section we the other.  One way in which Barber unifies all of these sections is through the use of specific melodic figures.  The left-hand bass figure in measures 1 to 2 is used ten times in this movement.\n\u201cThe rhythmic pattern of the accompaniment motive is a common blues figure.\u201d The other, and more important, unifying motive is the descending third melodic figure within the right hand.  This figure occurs at the start of every new twelve-bar phrase.  Within this movement one can find this descending motive returning in either the left or the right hand.\nThe harmonies of this movement consist of strictly the tonic (G), subdominant (C), and dominant (D) tonalities.  However, there is some debate as to whether this movement is indeed in G, or as the key signature says, C.  Friedewald claims that this movement is centered on C with each section being \u201climited to the tonic and dominant chord.\u201d However, through closer analysis, this piece is centered on G.  Sifferman explains that \u201csimply listening to or playing the piece\u2026 makes the tonal center [of] G undeniably clear to the ear.\u201dIn Friedewald's defense, this movement's key signature indicates C major, there are a fair number of G dominant seventh chords, and the final chord of the piece is a perfect fifth on C.  There is some truth in saying this movement is in C, but Barber most likely chose not to include a key signature to further emphasize the \u201cblue\u201d notes, specifically, the lowered sevenths.  In an analysis of this movement in G major, the \u201cabsence of a sharp in the key signature is accounted for by the\u2026 F-natural.\u201d This further explains that the F-naturals which occur within the tonic harmonies were not written for the purpose of creating dominant seventh chords.  \u201cBy avoiding the F-sharp in the key signature, the lowered seventh is established as a constant pitch, while the use of the leading tone is the exception.\u201dIn the first measure, Barber incorporates another \u201cblue\u201d note, the lowered third.  The B-flat (enharmonically spelled A-sharp) creating \u201cincreased tension or dissonance\u2026 harmonically.\u201d  Barber continues, throughout this movement with the added \u201cblue\u201d notes that create the harmonic tension characteristic of a blues piece.\nIn measures 19 through 22 Barber emphasizes the raised and lowered third scale degrees in the left hand octaves.  This first begins with the pick up B-natural.  Additionally, Barber makes use of the lowered seventh scale degree, F-natural as a melodic tone over the tonic chord.  This further demonstrates Barber's \u201cbending or worrying\u201d particular scale degrees to create a blues mood.\nClearly the slowest movement of all four, this piece has a subtle uniqueness about it that makes it stand out from the rest.  This is especially heard in the final chord of the movement.  The movement ends on the subdominant harmony which Sifferman believes it ends as \u201cthough the progression could continue \u2018ad infinitum.\u2019\u201d", "hasanswer": false}]}

The duo performs in the 1941 movie Hellzapoppin'.\nGaillard's appeal was similar to Cab Calloway's and Louis Jordan's in that he presented a hip style with broad appeal (for example in his children's song \"Down by the Station\"). Unlike them, he was a master improviser whose stream of consciousness vocals ranged far from the original lyrics. He sang wild interpolations of nonsense syllables, such as \"MacVoutie O-reeney\". One such performance is celebrated in the 1957 novel On the Road by Jack Kerouac. Gaillard, with Dodo Marmarosa on piano, appeared as a guest several times on Command Performance, recorded at KNX radio studios in Hollywood in the 1940s and distributed on transcription discs to American troops in World War II.\nIn 1943,:\u200a4\u200a Gaillard was drafted in the United States Army Air Forces and \"qualified as a pilot flying [...] B-26 bombers in the Pacific\" and resumed his music career on his release from the draft in 1944. Upon his return he released the song \"Atomic Cocktail\", which featured seemingly lighthearted lyrics laced with symbolism about nuclear war.Gaillard later teamed with bassist Bam Brown, and their successes included the hipster anthem \"Opera in Vout (Groove Juice Symphony)\".  They can be seen in a 1947 motion picture featurette O'Voutie O'Rooney filmed live at one of their nightclub performances. Slim and Bam was featured at the first Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles that was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on September 23, 1945, along with Count Basie. Gaillard also played for the 2nd Cavalcade of Jazz held at Wrigley Field on October 12, 1946, and played for the 3rd Cavalcade of Jazz held also at Wrigley Field on September 7, 1947.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Gaillard frequently opened at Birdland for Charlie Parker, Flip Phillips, and Coleman Hawkins. His December 1945 session with Parker and Dizzy Gillespie is notable, both musically and for its relaxed convivial air. \"Slim's Jam\", from that session, is one of the earliest known recordings of Parker's speaking voice.  In 1949 he was playing in San Francisco.  Near the end of Part Two of Jack Kerouac's book On the Road is an account of meeting him at a performance there.\nGaillard could play several instruments and managed to turn the performance from jazz to comedy. He would play the guitar with his left hand fretting with fingers pointing down over the fingerboard (instead of the usual way up from under it), or would play credible piano solos with his palms facing up. Gaillard wrote the theme song to the Peter Potter radio show. In addition, in 1950 he wrote and recorded the \"Don Pitts On the Air\" theme for San Francisco DJ Don Pitts. On March 27, 2008, the Pitts theme song entered the archives of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio.In the early 1960s, Gaillard lived in San Diego, California. During that time he recorded several singles and performed with local bands. Under the name Slim Delgado, he recorded a rock and roll single for the Xavier label titled \"Frank Rhoads Round\" The B-side is a song called \"Dr. Free\".\nGaillard appeared in several shows in the 1960s and 1970s, including Marcus Welby, M.D., Charlie's Angels, Mission: Impossible, Medical Center, The Flip Wilson Show, and Then Came Bronson. He also appeared in the 1970s TV series Roots: The Next Generations and reprised some of his old hits on the NBC prime-time variety program The Chuck Barris Rah Rah Show.By the early 1980s Gaillard was touring the European jazz festival circuit, playing with such musicians as Arnett Cobb. He also played with George Melly and John Chilton's Feetwarmers, appearing on their BBC television series and also occasionally deputising for Melly when he was unwell. Gaillard's behavior on stage was often erratic and nerve-wracking for the accompanying musicians. He made a guest appearance on Show 106 of the 1980s music program Night Music, an NBC late-night music series hosted by David Sanborn.\nAround Christmas 1985, Gaillard recorded the album Siboney at Gateway Studios in Battersea, London, produced by Joe Massot.

Why are they sending kids far away from their families overseas? Why are they attacking their own kids in the street?\" Returning to Detroit, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland wrote and composed a song based on his conversations with Benson of what he had seen in Berkeley. Benson sent the song to the Four Tops but his bandmates turned the song down. Benson said, \"My partners told me it was a protest song. I said 'no man, it's a love song, about love and understanding. I'm not protesting. I want to know what's going on.'\"Benson offered the song to Marvin Gaye when he participated in a golf game with the singer. Returning to Gaye's home outside Outer Drive, Benson played the song to Gaye on his guitar. Gaye felt the song's moody flow would be perfect for The Originals. Benson eventually convinced Gaye that it was his song. The singer responded by asking for partial writing credit, which Benson allowed. Gaye added new musical composition, a new melody and lyrics that reflected Gaye's own disgust. Benson said later that Gaye tweaked and enriched the song, \"added some things that were more ghetto, more natural, which made it seem like a story and not a song ... we measured him for the suit and he tailored the hell out of it.\" During this time, Gaye had been deeply affected by letters shared between him and his brother after he had returned from service in the Vietnam War over the treatment of Vietnam veterans.Gaye had also been deeply affected by the social ills plaguing the United States at the time, and covered the track \"Abraham, Martin & John\", in 1969, which became a UK hit for him in 1970. Gaye cited the 1965 Watts riots as a pivotal moment in his life in which he asked himself, \"with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\" One night, he called Berry Gordy about doing a protest record, to which Gordy chastised him, \"Marvin, don't be ridiculous.

Benson later told author Ben Edmonds, \"I saw this and started wondering 'what was going on, what is happening here?' One question led to another. Why are they sending kids far away from their families overseas? Why are they attacking their own kids in the street?\" Returning to Detroit, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland wrote and composed a song based on his conversations with Benson of what he had seen in Berkeley. Benson sent the song to the Four Tops but his bandmates turned the song down. Benson said, \"My partners told me it was a protest song. I said 'no man, it's a love song, about love and understanding. I'm not protesting. I want to know what's going on.'\"Benson offered the song to Marvin Gaye when he participated in a golf game with the singer. Returning to Gaye's home outside Outer Drive, Benson played the song to Gaye on his guitar. Gaye felt the song's moody flow would be perfect for The Originals. Benson eventually convinced Gaye that it was his song. The singer responded by asking for partial writing credit, which Benson allowed. Gaye added new musical composition, a new melody and lyrics that reflected Gaye's own disgust. Benson said later that Gaye tweaked and enriched the song, \"added some things that were more ghetto, more natural, which made it seem like a story and not a song ... we measured him for the suit and he tailored the hell out of it.\" During this time, Gaye had been deeply affected by letters shared between him and his brother after he had returned from service in the Vietnam War over the treatment of Vietnam veterans.Gaye had also been deeply affected by the social ills plaguing the United States at the time, and covered the track \"Abraham, Martin & John\", in 1969, which became a UK hit for him in 1970. Gaye cited the 1965 Watts riots as a pivotal moment in his life in which he asked himself, \"with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?\" One night, he called Berry Gordy about doing a protest record, to which Gordy chastised him, \"Marvin, don't be ridiculous. That's taking things too far.\" The singer's brother Frankie wrote in his 2003 autobiography, My Brother Marvin, that while reuniting at their former childhood home in Washington, D.C., Frankie's recalling of his tenure at the war made both brothers cry. At one point, Marvin sat propped up in a bed with his hands in his face. Afterwards, Gaye told his brother: \"I didn't know how to fight before, but now I think I do. I just have to do it my way. I'm not a painter. I'm not a poet. But I can do it with music.\"In an interview with Rolling Stone, Marvin Gaye discussed what had shaped his view on more socially conscious themes in music and the conception of his eleventh studio album:\n\nIn 1969 or 1970, I began to re-evaluate my whole concept of what I wanted my music to say ... I was very much affected by letters my brother was sending me from Vietnam, as well as the social situation here at home.

{"id": "91_98", "question": "What genre is Focus?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_100", "question": "What genre is ALF?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_37332", "text": "The series was videotaped at Century Studios, 8660 Hayden Place in Culver City, California.\nProducer Bernie Brillstein was approached to see Fusco's audition with a puppet character but was initially uninterested, having managed Jim Henson for years and regarding Henson as the best puppeteer in showbiz. However, Fusco's brief performance as ALF won over Brillstein, who thought the character was hilarious and strong enough to be the focus of a series.Fusco co-produced the series with Tom Patchett. Patchett also co-created, wrote, and directed the series. The series was first syndicated by Warner Bros. Television and Lorimar-Telepictures. The U.S. syndication rights were passed over to Debmar-Mercury when its parent company, Lionsgate, owned home video rights. Shout! Factory assumed distribution rights to the series in February 2022.Due to the inherent nature of producing a show featuring hand-operated puppets (\u00e0 la Jim Henson's The Muppet Show), ALF was technically difficult and extremely demanding on series creator Fusco as well as its four lead actors. All confirmed during a 2000 People magazine interview that there were constant high levels of tension on the set. Max Wright stated that he despised supporting a technically demanding inanimate object that received most of the good lines of dialogue. He admitted to being \"hugely eager to have ALF over with.\" Artie Lange, who later worked with Wright on The Norm Show, told of a time when Wright had become \"crazed\" and physically attacked ALF, causing producers to have to pull Wright off the puppet. Anne Schedeen said that on the last night of taping the final episode, \"there was one take and Max walked off the set, went to his dressing room, got his bags, went to his car and disappeared... There were no goodbyes.\" Schedeen herself said \"there was no joy on the set...it was a technical nightmare \u2013 extremely slow, hot and tedious... A 30-minute show took 20, 25 hours to shoot.\" While fond of her on-screen children, Schedeen said some adults had \"difficult personalities. The whole thing was a big dysfunctional family.\" Schedeen added, \"It's astonishing that ALF really was wonderful and that word never got out what a mess our set really was.\" Andrea Elson, who suffered from bulimia during the second season of shooting, stated, \"If ALF had gone one more year, everybody would have lost it.\" Wright later admitted that as the years passed he looked back at ALF with less animosity and conceded that \"It doesn't matter what I felt or what the days were like, ALF brought people a lot of joy.\" In reference to the tension, Fusco commented in 2012 that \"It was just the nature of the beast. There was no way we could have made it go any further or any faster,\" he insisted. \"I think it was frustrating that it would take so long, but people got paid for what they did. Despite what people thought, that there was a lot of tension on set, there really wasn't.\"Fusco was notoriously secretive about his character up until the series' premiere. During the show's production, Fusco refused to acknowledge that the puppet ALF was anything other than an alien. All involved with the production were cautioned not to reveal any of ALF's production secrets.\nThe set was built on a platform raised four feet above the ground, with trap doors constructed at many points so that ALF could appear almost anywhere; Fusco operated him from underneath, so the unoccupied holes all over the floor were deep and treacherous. The trap doors had to be reset multiple times, sometimes during a single scene. Principal puppeteer Paul Fusco (who was mainly left-handed when puppeteering) used his left hand to control ALF's mouth, while his right hand controlled ALF's right arm. Another puppeteer, Lisa Buckley, who would go on to perform on Sesame Street, assisted Fusco beneath the stage, operating ALF's left arm. At times when ALF's full body was shown in the sitting position, Lisa controlled ALF's left hand by cable allowing slight finger movements. There was additionally a third puppeteer, Bob Fappiano, who controlled ALF's facial and ear movements via a radio control offscreen. During tapings, Fusco would wear a head-mounted microphone to record ALF's voice. The process resulted in numerous mistakes and retakes, making it impossible to record ALF in front of a live audience. A laugh track was added during post-production.\nTo avoid wear and tear on the principal ALF puppet, the performers rehearsed with a crude early version of ALF, nicknamed \"RALF\" For (\"Rehearsal Alien Life Form\"). Fusco did not like to rehearse, and would often substitute his hand or RALF for the real ALF puppet during rehearsals.In an interview on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Tina Fey said that her biggest frustration as producer of NBC's 75th-anniversary special was dealing with ALF's \"people\". Fey said Fusco would only allow ALF to appear on the show if the puppeteers were hidden from everyone else. After ALF's cameo alongside former Family Ties star Michael Gross, ALF disappeared through a hole in the riser, was stuffed into a case, and immediately removed from the building.\nWhile a puppet was usually used for ALF, there were some shots of the tiny alien running or walking around. This was accomplished by the 2 feet 9 inches (84 cm) actor Michu Meszaros wearing an ALF costume. This can be seen in one of the series' intros, which concludes with the Tanner family getting their picture taken; ALF (played by Meszaros) walks over to be part of the photo. However, Meszaros' services became too costly as well as time-consuming, and the full ALF costume was abandoned after the first season.\nALF scored its highest ratings during Season 2 (reaching tenth place in the Nielsen ratings). Ratings remained at a steady fifteenth place during Season 3, but plummeted to 39th place during Season 4. NBC moved the show from its traditional Monday night slot to Saturday in March 1990 and eventually moved to Sunday, but ratings continued to fall.\nThe season-ending cliffhanger \"Consider Me Gone\" became an unintentional series finale when NBC gave Alien Productions a verbal commitment for a fifth season, but ultimately withdrew its support. ABC resolved the cliffhanger on February 17, 1996, with the TV movie Project: ALF. NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff later told Fusco that the network regretted cancelling ALF prematurely, saying \"It was a big mistake that we cancelled your show, because you guys had at least one or two more seasons left.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Halloween popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. Halloween helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s. Due to its popularity, Halloween became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed, and that others like Scream parodied.The major themes present in Halloween also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in Halloween, there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.There are slasher films that predated Halloween, such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972),  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Black Christmas (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. Halloween, however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others. Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of Halloween,\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting.

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The DVD was released on September 18, 2007, in the US. The score of the film was changed dramatically, with many of the female vocals being cut. An addition to the music is the use of Danny Elfman's theme for Planet of the Apes during the pivotal fight between Hector and Achilles in front of the Gates of Troy. Josh Groban's song was removed from the end credits as well.\nVarious shots were recut and extended. For instance, the love scene between Helen and Paris was reframed to include more nudity of Diane Kruger. The love scene between Achilles and Briseis is also extended. Only one scene was removed: the scene where Helen tends to the wound of Paris is taken out. The battle scenes were also extended, depicting more violence and gore, including much more of Ajax's bloody rampage on the Trojans during the initial attack by the Greek Army. Perhaps most significant was the sacking of Troy, barely present in the theatrical cut, but shown fully here, depicting the soldiers raping women and murdering babies. Characters were provided more time to develop, specifically Priam and Odysseus, the latter being given a humorous introduction scene.

AllMusic's Steve Huey states that \"Nine Inch Nails were the most popular industrial group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience\". Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as Throbbing Gristle and Test Dept. Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term \"industrial\" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor's body of work to describe it as such. Reznor acknowledged in Spin magazine that \"Down in It\" was influenced by early Skinny Puppy, particularly the band's song \"Dig It\"; other songs from Pretty Hate Machine and With Teeth have been described as synth-pop.:\u200a35\u200a Reviewing The Fragile, critic Steve Cooper noted that the album juxtaposes widely varied genres, such as solo piano in \"The Frail\" and drum and bass elements in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" Ambient music has been featured in some of Nine Inch Nails' music, including on Ghosts I\u2013IV (which is specifically dark ambient), Hesitation Marks, The Downward Spiral, The Slip, and The Fragile.\n\nSongs such as \"Wish\" and \"The Day the World Went Away\" exhibit terraced dynamics. Reznor's singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" and \"Burn\". The band's music also occasionally contains complex time signatures, notably in \"The Collector\" from With Teeth and concert favorite \"March of the Pigs\". Reznor uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody and/or harmony. These techniques are all used in the song \"Hurt\", which contains a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses, a B5#11, emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word \"I\" every time the B/E# dyad is played. \"Closer\" concludes with a chromatic piano motif: the melody is debuted during the second verse of \"Piggy\" on organ, then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of \"Heresy\", while an inverted (ascending) version is used throughout \"A Warm Place\", and then recurs in its original state for the final time on \"The Downward Spiral\".On The Fragile, Reznor revisits the technique of repeating a motif multiple times throughout different songs, either on a different musical instrument with a transposed harmony or in an altered tempo. Many of the songs on Year Zero contain an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire second half of the three-minute long \"The Great Destroyer\". Allmusic's review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: \"Guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken.\" Lyrical themes found in Nine Inch Nails songs are largely concerned with dark explorations of the self ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, and nihilism. Occasionally, the lyrics depart from their introspective nature to deal with a topic like politics, which is the focus of Year Zero. Three Nine Inch Nails albums are concept albums: The Downward Spiral, The Fragile, and Year Zero. The album With Teeth was originally set to be a concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_127", "question": "What genre is Unity?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_8983", "text": "While Tchaikovsky struggled with his first three symphonies, developments in Europe led to an alternative to this genre that, in a reverse twist, offered to change the scope of the symphony. Hungarian composer Franz Liszt desired a form of orchestral music that would offer greater flexibility in developing musical themes than the symphony then allowed but also preserve the overall unity of a musical composition. His objective was to expand single-movement works beyond the concert overture format. By doing so, he hoped to combine the dramatic, emotive and evocative qualities of concert overtures with the scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movements of symphonies.The fruit of Liszt's labors was what he eventually termed symphonic poems. In them, he used two alternatives to sonata form. Beethoven had used the first of these, cyclic form, to link separate movements thematically with one another. Liszt took this process one step further by combining themes into a single-movement cyclic structure. The second alternative, thematic transformation, originated with Haydn and Mozart. This process worked in a similar manner as variation but instead of a theme being changed into a related or subsidiary version of the main one, it becomes transformed into a related but separate, independent theme. Beethoven used it in the finale of his Ninth Symphony when he transformed the theme of the \"Ode to Joy\" into a Turkish march. Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes. Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his Wanderer Fantasy, a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt. However, Liszt learned to create longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation.Liszt's approach to musical form in his symphonic poems was also unorthodox. Instead of following a strict presentation and development of musical themes as in sonata form, he placed his themes into a loose, episodic pattern. There, recurring melodies called motifs were thematically transformed as musical and  programmatic needs dictated. (Richard Wagner would make good use of this practice in his operas and music dramas.) Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, were foreshortened. Codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, were greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffled into new and unexpected patterns of order and three- or four-movement structures were rolled into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.A number of composers, especially Bohemian and Russian, followed in Liszt's footsteps to develop the symphonic poem further.  Added to this was the Russian love of story-telling, for which the genre seemed expressly tailored. Tchaikovsky wrote a symphonic poem, Fatum, after he had finished his First Symphony and first opera, The Voyevoda. There, he dabbled with the free form the new genre offered. However, the work did not come out well and he destroyed it after two performances. For his next programmatic work, the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet, Tchaikovsky reverted to sonata form, structuring it in a similar fashion to Beethoven's concert overtures. However, in a case of musical cross-pollination, the symphonic poem offered the potential to change the nature of the symphony in its merging of a wide emotional range with symphonic resources. This potential played to the conception Tchaikovsky would form of the symphony as a vehicle for personal expression and one whose details could, as he phrased it to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, \"be manipulated as freely as one chooses.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_129", "question": "What genre is Southern Rock Opera?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_37453", "text": "The idea for Southern Rock Opera pre-dates the band's formation in 1996. Southern Rock Opera began in a long discussion between Drive-By Truckers' frontman Patterson Hood and former Truckers bassist and producer Earl Hicks, during a road trip. The pair discussed writing a semi-autobiographical screenplay about growing up in the South and about the plane crash that almost ended the career of the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, taking singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, and Gaines' back-up-singer sister Cassie Gaines.\nSoon after this discussion, Hood formed Drive-By Truckers. The Truckers recorded two studio albums and one live album during the four years between their formation and the actual recording of Southern Rock Opera. During these years, Drive-By's principal songwriters Hood, Mike Cooley, and Rob Malone continued to contribute songs to \"The Rock Opera\", as they had come to call it.\nAfter the release of their live album Alabama Ass Whuppin', Drive-By Truckers began recording what they hoped would be their magnum opus: Southern Rock Opera. According to Patterson Hood, \"(the album) was recorded in Birmingham, upstairs in a uniform shop during an early September heat wave, with no air-conditioning. We had to turn the fans off when we were recording, and we worked from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. So Southern Rock Opera was fun to write, but we had a miserable time making it.\"After the album was finished, however, the troubles continued for The Truckers when they ran out of funding for the immense project. To resolve the problem, and to avoid \"any fine print crap\", as Hood put it, the band took a non-traditional approach. The Truckers made a prospectus and solicited investors, with a promise of 15% interest, to pay for the manufacturing and distribution of Southern Rock Opera. The approach worked. Through their fan-based online news group and by sheer word of mouth, The Truckers were able to raise $23,000. This allowed them to print about 5,000 copies of the album, and buy a \"new\" used van for touring. \nSouthern Rock Opera was finally released on September 12, 2001 on Soul Dump Records.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

From there they intend to drive to Vienna.\nA sick man in the back seat, who claims to be an Englishman called Flemyng, seems known to an aristocratic Englishwoman, Lady Ashmore, sitting in the front seat. The journey is difficult with diversions and roadblocks, some operated by Soviet troops and others by Hungarian insurgents. At a small lakeside town close to the Austrian border, the passengers are removed from the bus by Major Surov, the local Soviet commander. After questioning them and impounding their passports, Surov orders they remain in the town's only hotel. He suspects the ailing Flemyng's passport is not genuine and develops a love interest in the attractive Lady Ashmore.\nIt emerges that Flemyng is a Hungarian insurgent whom Lady Ashmore, his lover, is smuggling to safety. Surov deduces both facts but does not act, hoping that Lady Ashmore will offer herself to him in exchange for safe passage into Austria. Speaking good English, which Surov claims to have learned in Canada, he uses the trapped passengers as a sounding board for his views, arguing that Russians are human too and questioning the imposition of Marxism by military force. However, with Flemyng getting weaker from what is revealed as an untreated gunshot wound, Lady Ashmore bribes a fisherman to take the two of them to Austria, across the lake under cover of darkness. Surov deduces what is happening and captures them both. After getting Flemyng treatment by an army doctor, Surov sends Lady Ashmore back to the hotel. The other passengers are furious that Lady Ashmore jeopardised their release with her selfish behaviour. A pregnant American woman warns Lady Ashmore very frankly what she should do to save them all.\nSniping by Hungarians has kept the Russian garrison on edge and a shot wounds Surov's beloved black horse. Unable to euthanise the horse himself, revealing a compassionate side to his nature, Surov orders a sergeant to kill the stricken animal. Lady Ashmore returns, dutifully, prompting Surov, in deep sorrow, to question if she returned willingly. When she truthfully says no, Surov releases Lady Ashmore. In the morning Surov orders the passengers to leave, minus the arrested Flemyng, driving to a quiet spot where they can walk into Austria. As the party crosses the border, Surov turns up with the weakened Flemyng, who he releases to Lady Ashmore. As Surov watches the two disappear, Hungarian bullets kill him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As a teenager he learnt acoustic guitar, but was not satisfied with the popular rock music being played at the time. In the mid-1970s he formed an avant-garde folk-rock group called Conventum with Ren\u00e9 Lussier, Jean Derome, Jean-Pierre Bouchard, Jacques Laurin, Bernard Cormier and poet Alain-Arthur Painchaud. Conventum was described by AllMusic as a mixture of  \"Quebec's folk roots with absurd poetry and progressive arrangements\". They released two albums, \u00c0 l'Aff\u00fbt d'un Complot in 1977 and Le Bureau Central des Utopies in 1979.In 1983 Duchesne, Lussier, Derome and Robert M. Lepage formed Ambiances Magn\u00e9tiques, a musical collective and artist-run record label specialising in avant-garde music. Duchesne released his first solo album, Le Temps des Bombes on the new label in 1984. Then he began writing contrapuntal compositions for a guitar quartet, and formed Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar (The 4 Guitarists of the Apocalypso-Bar) with Lussier, Bouchard and Roger Boudreault to perform the pieces. Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar was a concept band that Duchesne said was from post-apocalypse Canada \"inspired by the ghost of Jimi Hendrix\". They premiered at the 4th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville (FIMAV) at Victoriaville, Quebec in October 1986, and continued until 1989, touring Canada, the United States and Europe. They also released two albums in 1987 and 1989.After the success of Les 4 Guitaristes de l'Apocalypso-Bar, Duchesne returned to FIMAV in 1989 to premier \"his most ambitious work ever\", L' Ou 'L, a composition that explored different styles of chamber music. In 1991, he formed Locomotive with Claude Fradette and R\u00e9mi Leclerc, which also performed at FIMAV in 1991. Locomotive recorded an album of the same name in 1992, which AllMusic called \"the pinnacle of Andr\u00e9 Duchesne's discography\".During the mid- to late-1990s, Duchesne formed several rock bands, but they never recorded. In 1999 he released R\u00e9flexions, an album of classical guitar solos, and in 2001, Polaro\u00efde, a free improvisation session for guitar, viola and percussion.

The Nihon Keizai Shimbun awarded Saito the \"Best Young Manager/Venture of the Year\" for his work on the game. After the initial Japanese release, Maxis president Jeff Braun contacted Saito regarding a worldwide release; SimCity creator Will Wright had informed Braun of the game. The company localized the game for sale in the United States, and changed the name to capitalize on the popularity of the Sim franchise and increase sales figures. Maxis published SimTower for the Windows and Macintosh System 7 operating systems in November 1994 in the United States. In 1996, it was ported to the Sega Saturn and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in Japan.The South China Morning Post praised the game's formula, noting that it followed in the footsteps of previous open-ended Maxis games. Comparing SimTower to SimCity 2000, the review remarked that it was more interesting to watch people live out their lives in a tower rather than to observe cars moving around. They also appreciated the \"homely\" feeling of SimTower, in contrast with other Sim games such as SimEarth and SimLife, which they felt were too universal to take on a personal identity. Benjamin Svetkey of Entertainment Weekly praised the game and commented that it is \"more fun than [the concept] sounds\". However, he stated that the gameplay may be too much for fans of the series. A reviewer for Next Generation panned the game, saying it lacks the bustling interactivity of previous games in the Sim franchise: \"There are bug infestations and the occasional fire with which to deal, but most of the time, SimTower sees you standing around waiting for cash reserves to grow in order to add more floors. Not much fun at all.\" Australia's The Age found SimTower a pleasing return to form for Maxis, after the release of the disappointing SimFarm. Lisa Karen Savignano of Allgame stated that the game had decent graphics and sound. However, she also felt that SimTower had good replay value due to the non-linear gameplay, giving the game four stars out of five.The game was criticized by the South China Morning Post for lacking documentation, making it more difficult to learn how to play the game. They also predicted that players would be unhappy with the game's speed, as time plays an important role in earning money from tenants. Before the player can purchase new facilities, a long period of time must pass before income is earned from tenants. The newspaper was also unhappy with complaints from tenants; specific reasons for their dissatisfaction are never given. The Age was disappointed by the lack of pre-built towers and scenarios, suggesting that one along the lines of The Towering Inferno's plot could have been included. Game Informer referred to SimTower as a \"lesser-known\" simulation game, and described it as \"fun and addictive\". Writing for the San Diego Union-Tribune, Matt Miller felt that, when compared to SimCity 2000 (1993), gameplay in SimTower moved slowly. He also disliked the moments when he had to wait several minutes to pass by before he could make enough money to purchase new additions for his building. Dragon magazine's reviewers Jay and Dee praised the visuals and gameplay. However, the two commented that the game can feel slow because it lacks gameplay elements and options present in other strategy games. In 1995, the Software and Information Industry Association listed SimTower as the \"Best Simulation Program\" in the Consumer software category of their annual Codie awards.The game was followed by Yoot Tower (called The Tower II in Japan), also designed by Yoot Saito, which was initially released on November 24, 1998, for the Macintosh. It was later made available for the Windows operating systems in January 1999. Yoot Tower's gameplay is similar to that of SimTower\u2014players build hotels, resorts, and office buildings, and work towards building a five-star tower.

Devis was the younger brother of the painter Thomas Anthony Devis (1757\u20131810) and of the schoolmistress and grammarian Ellin Devis (1746\u20131820), teacher, among others, of author of Maria Edgeworth and Frances Burney (later novelist Madame d'Arblay).\nHe followed his elder brother  Thomas Anthony in becoming a pupil at the Royal Academy Schools in 1774 and like his brother exhibited at the Free Society of Artists, of which in 1768 their father had become president, and at the Royal Academy. Early on he came to the notice of Sir Joshua Reynolds.\nHe was appointed draughtsman on the British East India Company's packet Antelope in a voyage in 1783, under Captain Henry Wilson. In her he was injured in an encounter with Papuans near the Schouten Islands and was then wrecked on the Pelew Islands before proceeding to Canton and thence to Bengal. During his voyages, the artist received arrow wounds, one of which inflicted permanent injury on his lower jaw. During his time in Bengal, he painted a portrait of Sir William Jones, at the time a judge in Fort William. The painting now hangs at the British Library. \nHe was back in London by 1795 and is recorded on 21 July 1797 as living at 27 George Street, Hanover Square, where he was insured by the Sun Assurance Office.He is noted for his involvement in the creation of the posthumous cult of Horatio Nelson. As she returned from Trafalgar, Devis went out to meet HMS Victory and was present on board the ship during the autopsy of Nelson's body conducted by Dr Beatty, the ship's surgeon. With the help of sketches he took at that time, he painted a heroic Death of Nelson, which proved a sensation.\n\nDevis also painted Dr Beatty, and was commissioned by him to produce a half-length painting of Nelson as vice-admiral, which he lent to Emma Hamilton (who later lost it in an accident whilst travelling). Either the original or a copy of this portrait was exhibited at the Royal Academy two years after the Battle and many copies were made of it. Lord Howe owned one, and another ended up in the collection of the National Maritime Museum. It also appeared as an engraving in Beatty's published account of Nelson's death.\nOther work includes a portrait of King George III on horseback, and a range of portraits of admirals and generals, along with historical subjects, such as the Babington Plot and the signing of the Magna Carta. Better known is perhaps his Master Simpson (1780), a portrait of a small boy, James Alexander Simpson, carrying a dog which has often been copied, imitated and exploited commercially. Despite some success in life, Devis seems often to have had financial difficulties, including imprisonment for debt.\nBy the will of his brother Thomas Anthony Devis, who died in London in 1810, he inherited all Anthony's printed books and prints.Devis himself died in London, at Caroline Street, Bedford Square, of apoplexy in 1822 and was buried in nearby St Giles-in-the-Fields churchyard.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When director Hellman first suggested Oates as the star of the film, co-star and co-producer Nicholson immediately agreed with the choice, but during the filming, Nicholson and Oates repeatedly clashed, with the two frequently ending up in screaming matches. According to Hellman, production had to shut down for half a day when Oates refused to speak a lengthy amount of dialogue in the way Hellman wanted, preferring instead to whisper the lines almost unintelligibly. Oates stormed away from the film crew in anger when the director insisted. After Oates finally returned late in the afternoon, Hellman allowed the actor to read the lines the way he wanted, as long as he also read them in Hellman's preferred manner. In the editing room, Hellman rejected Oates's version.\nWill Hutchins as Coley: As Gashade's dimwitted friend, Hutchins was cast in the same burst of inspiration that Hellman had when he also thought of Warren Oates and Millie Perkins for the other lead roles in the film. Like Oates, when The Shooting began production, Hutchins was already fully identified with the Western genre, having starred for several years in the ABC-TV television series Sugarfoot, which ran from 1957 to 1961. Both Perkins and Hellman later recalled the actor as being a funny and charming man, who never complained about the often adverse filming conditions.\nMillie Perkins as the Woman: Best known for playing the title role in The Diary of Anne Frank, Perkins was Hellman's next-door neighbor when she was cast as the enigmatic, unnamed woman who leads the search party to their doom. The Shooting was her fifth film, immediately followed by another starring role in Hellman's companion Western, Ride in the Whirlwind. Although Perkins enjoyed working on both of Hellman's Westerns, and became good friends with Warren Oates, she was dismayed that Hellman insisted on such realism that he allowed only the most minimal of makeup to be applied to the actors. She felt she was constantly filmed in an unflattering manner.\nJack Nicholson as Billy Spear: This was the young actor's 13th film appearance, and his fourth with director Hellman. In addition to playing the odious villain, Nicholson had been asked by Hellman to co-produce the film.

During the ceremony, the princess is suddenly enclosed in a giant cube and spirited away. Ike is so distraught that he cannot stop crying during rehearsal and gets sent home by Mr. Mackey. People all over Canada commit mass suicide of despair for the princess' abduction and a candlelight vigil is held where Rush performs a version of \"Candle in the Wind.\" The Prime Minister of Canada instructs all people of Canadian descent to go home and open their \"Box of Faith\", which contains \u2013 along with a location beacon, a first aid kit, and a sandwich \u2013 a video recording issuing a call to arms for all Canadians in fighting condition to \"meet by the tree in Edmonton\". Ike answers the call and, while riding a bus to Canada, meets a fellow Canadian named Ugly Bob, who claims he has to wear a bag over his head because, even though he simply appears Canadian to Americans, other Canadians find his face frighteningly ugly.\nOnce the pair arrive, the first instinct of the member of the Canadian Armed Forces leading the gathered Canadians is that the princess was taken by a giant, who turns out to be Scott the Dick, who grew to seven feet tall \u2013 giant by Canadian standards \u2013 after a radioactive accident in Ottawa. When it turns out that Scott has been wrongly accused of taking the princess, most other Canadians go home, but Scott persuades Ike and Ugly Bob to follow him as he accuses the Inuit of kidnapping the princess out of his racial prejudice towards the \"Native Canadians\".

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.\nComputer programmer Thomas Anderson, known by his hacking alias \"Neo\", is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix\". Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named Morpheus has the answers Neo seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith, arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Though Morpheus attempts to guide Neo to safety, Neo surrenders rather than risk a dangerous escape. The Agents offer to erase Neo's criminal record in exchange for his help with locating Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses to cooperate, they fuse his mouth shut, pin him down, and implant a robotic \"bug\" in his abdomen. Neo wakes up from what he believes to be a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo.\nMorpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: red to reveal the truth about the Matrix, or blue to make Neo forget everything and return to his former life. Neo takes the red pill, and his reality begins to distort, awakening in a liquid-filled pod among countless other pods, containing other humans. He is then brought aboard Morpheus's flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: In the early 21st century, a war broke out between humanity and intelligent machines. After humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix, a shared simulated reality modeled on the world as it was in 1999. In the years following, the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion.\nMorpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix kills the physical body too and explains that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels eliminate rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual training cements Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet-like program who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police ambush the group, tipped off by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who has betrayed Morpheus in exchange for a deal to be plugged back into the Matrix to live a comfortable life.\nTo buy time for the others, Morpheus fights Smith and is captured. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders the other crew members as they lie unconscious. Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity, crew member Tank regains consciousness and kills him before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents.\nAfter Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and appears to kill Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived, with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix; he easily defeats Smith, prompting the other Agents to flee and he leaves the Matrix just as the ship's electromagnetic pulse disables the Sentinels.

Feminist scholar Susan J.

Marwick also suggests that cosmetic reality television encourages viewers to frame their family, financial, or social problems in bodily terms, and portrays surgical procedures as an everyday and normal solution.

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

She became addicted to drugs, and six years ago, she reportedly killed a police officer, though she cannot remember whether she did so or not. She was sentenced to death, but Division faked her execution and trained her to be an assassin. However, she broke one of their rules by falling in love with a civilian, Daniel Monroe (Sebastien Roberts). Division had Daniel killed in what appeared to be an accident, and this prompted Nikita to escape. Nikita explains all of this to Gary, knowing full well that doing so would alert Division to her presence.\nMeanwhile, in Detroit, Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) is captured by the police during a failed robbery, while her accomplice escapes. Shortly after being brought to prison, Alex wakes up to find herself inside Division. Michael (Shane West), Division's second-in-command, informs Alex that they have faked her death and that she is being offered a second chance - an opportunity to serve her government. She soon meets two other recruits, Thom (Ashton Holmes) and Jaden (Tiffany Hines), as well as Amanda (Melinda Clarke), Division's psychologist who also assists in training the recruits. Amanda guesses correctly that Alex had been smuggled to the US after being sold to human traffickers in Ukraine.\nPercy (Xander Berkeley), the head of Division gets wind of Nikita's reemergence and assigns Michael to kill her. Nikita once again gets Division's attention by visiting Daniel's grave. A strike team is sent to go after her, but, during the attack, Nikita captures Birkhoff (Aaron Stanford), Division's head technician. She demands that he give her access to Division's computer network. Even though he doesn't comply, she lets Birkhoff return to Division unharmed.\nIn spite of Nikita, Percy decides to go ahead with all of Division's operations, including Operation Black Arrow, in which the head of a West African nation is targeted for assassination. Nikita learns about Black Arrow from an unknown source and sabotages the mission. Nikita then comes face-to-face with Percy and Michael at a government fundraiser and tells Percy of her intentions to destroy Division. Michael chases her out of the building and has the opportunity to kill her, but he hesitates. He tells Nikita that Percy cannot be stopped because he has evidence of every illegal Division operation ever done and that this information would irreparably damage the US government. Michael decides to let Nikita escape, but she shoots him in the shoulder before running off, claiming that she is protecting him since the wound would make it look like he tried to stop her.\nPercy immediately names Nikita Division's priority target and believes that she is working with someone who is giving her information on Division's operations. It is revealed that Alex is Nikita's source inside Division and that Nikita was Alex's accomplice during the robbery that resulted in Alex's recruitment into Division.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although it is impossible to verify the truth of this statement, there is every reason to believe that Lully was in a hurry when writing this opera.  In effect, the opera reuses the interm\u00e8des from Moli\u00e8re's play.  Since these interm\u00e8des had met with such spectacular success seven years earlier, Lully must have felt that given his lack of time, he could at the very least attract a crowd with the promise of reviving the plainte italienne and the final divertissement.\nAll that was required was a synthesis of Moli\u00e8re's play (Moli\u00e8re had died in 1673) that could coherently string together the existent interm\u00e8des. Such a text would have to be one third the length of the original \u2014 that is, 600 rather than 1800 lines long \u2014 and composed in varied rimes and rhythms rather than the alexandrines in riming couplets used in spoken declamation.

Corneille's nephew, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, is believed to have collaborated; it is impossible to know to what extent. No anecdote speaking of Psych\u00e9 mentions Fontenelle.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women (1977) was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior.

{"id": "91_176", "question": "What genre is Darkness?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Each makes historical research a major vector of narrative suspense, with specific historical details\u2014the Civil War in Lincoln's Dreams, the sinking of the Titanic here\u2014treated as though they were clues in a murder mystery.\nWolfe continues: Like Doomsday Book (1992), it grapples with one of the grandest of all themes, death, and uses the inability of major characters to communicate key bits of information to each other as another suspense device. Like Willis's comic short fiction, it pokes fun at institutional culture\u2014in this case hospitals, with their mazelike architecture and ego-driven politics\u2014and at such ghoulish aspects of pop culture as afterlife gurus like John Edwards\" (i.e., John Edward) \"and self-help manuals for the recently bereaved.\"\nFaren Miller wrote in Locus: \n\nWhile the subject matter and setting of Passage allow Willis to display her characteristically unsentimental poignancy ... she can also poke fun at matters of life and death... The book's multiplying internal and external mazes provide an emblem of human complexity, foolishness, and deeper terrors, some reaching from beyond death. Jonathan Strahan of Locus praises the novel's \"seriousness\", \"clear-eyed humor\" and its \"amusing portrayal of what it's like to be in a big hospital\", which is itself a \"confusing, overwhelming portrait,\" as parts of what it makes \"her most ambitious novel\". He adds, \"At the three-quarter point of Passage, Willis does something that no reviewer should leak but it is much of what makes the book worth reading. What she attempts is to find a way to look at death and life after death in a way that doesn't conflict with matters of faith, but which also is consistent with the fundamentally rational underpinnings of science fiction.\"SciFi.com describes Passage as \"an emotionally exhausting trip\" that is ultimately \"a rewarding experience.\" Laura Miller, writing for Salon, says that \"its construction is a marvel of ingenuity and \u2014 what's even more remarkable, given the wizardry of Willis' storytelling \u2014 its intellectual honesty is impeccable... You won't find the beautiful sentences of more-celebrated 'novelists of ideas' here, though the ideas themselves are far better, more daring and more original, than those chewed over by most literary heavyweights. The dialogue can sound a trifle canned, the minor characters feel a mite thin (not that many novels of ideas don't share these flaws, too), which explains in part why Passage seems to hover between genre and genius. Given how rare a searching intelligence like Willis' is among today's novelists, does it really matter?\"The SF Site review judges that the novel \"starts slowly, and it's too long. Willis' trademark habit of making some set of frustrating everyday-life details a recurring motif or running joke (in this case, the difficulty of navigating the hospital corridors, plus the never-open cafeteria) is over-extended here...\"; conversely, reviewer Steven Wu felt that \"Part One of the book is masterful, with several chilling scenes, a compelling mystery, and a doozy of a cliffhanger ending. But then, only a third of the way through the book, things begin slowing down.\"\nThe A.V. Club's reviewer writes: There's certainly nothing comforting about Passage, which steeps its characters in death of all kinds \u2014 swift and sudden, prolonged and painful. Willis' satirical flair originally has Landry [sic] and Wright running around like The Three Stooges, juggling impossible schedules in an impossible environment and careening amidst exaggeratedly colorful characters in every chapter. A mid-book twist, however, takes the story into darker and more memorable territory, helping turn Passage into a complex, finely crafted, haunting story that makes the light at the end of the tunnel impossible to take lightly.\nA reviewer from Scientific Gems wrote of the novel, \"it is well-written, it has an interesting plot, and it has useful things to say about the nature of science and the nature of medicine.

His plectrum technique involved holding the plectrum between his thumb and forefinger, with the rest of his fingers outstretched for balance.\nThe Who's studio recordings seldom did justice to Entwistle's playing, in part because he was better heard in concert, where he and Pete Townshend frequently exchanged roles, with Entwistle providing rapid melodic lines and Townshend anchoring the song with rhythmic chord work. At the same time, Townshend noted that Entwistle provided the true rhythmic timekeeping in the band, while Keith Moon, with his flourishes around the kit, was more like a keyboardist. In 1989, Entwistle pointed out that, by modern standards, \"the Who haven't got a proper bass player.\"Entwistle also developed what he called a \"typewriter\" approach to playing the bass. It involved positioning his right hand over the strings so all four fingers could be used to tap percussively on the strings, causing them to strike the fretboard with a distinctive twangy sound. This gave him the ability to play three or four strings at once, or to use several fingers on a single string. It allowed him to create passages that were both percussive and melodic. This method should not be confused with tapping or slapping, and in fact predates these techniques. Modern players such as Ryan Martinie of heavy metal band Mudvayne have used similar techniques. Entwistle can be seen using this technique in Mike Gordon's documentary film, Rising Low (2002). Notable in his left-hand technique was his use of slides, positioning his left hand for octaves, and his use of the pentatonic when playing with the Who.\nEntwistle was notorious for the extremely high volume at which he played bass, going so far as to rig pick-ups to each string on his instruments. This led to him developing hearing loss, similar to Townshend. Although not as public about his problems as Townshend, he reputedly had to rely on lip reading to understand speech in his later years. Randy Bachman of Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive claimed that towards the end of his life, Entwistle mostly played by feeling the rush of air from his giant amp stacks. Entwistle blamed his hearing loss on using headphones.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was taken from the group's album Greatest Hits from the Beginning, but originally appeared on their abortive 1964 album, I Like It Like That.\nWritten by Miracles members Smokey Robinson, Bobby Rogers, and Pete Moore, this song was a Billboard Top 40 Pop hit, peaking at number 35, and a Top 10 Billboard R&B hit, peaking at number nine. A showcase for poetic wordplay, the Miracles utilized several famous nursery rhymes in this song; in fact, the song's title itself is a variation of the rhyme \"What Are Little Girls/Little Boys Made Of?\" and parts of this famous rhyme were incorporated into the lyrics of this song, which, like many Miracles songs, starts with the guitar licks of Miracles member Marv Tarplin. Robinson, as the lead singer, serves as the song's narrator: \n\nWhile Tarplin plays and Robinson sings the lyrics, the other Miracles (Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White, Pete Moore and Claudette Robinson, answer in classic call-and-response style.\nBillboard stated that the song has a \"good lyric line, great hand clappin' beat and mighty good on-frantic performance by the group.\"Cash Box described it as \"an inviting shuffle thumper...that the artists serve up with a rhythmic delight.\"The Miracles performed this song before a live audience at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on the 1964 American International Pictures film, The T.A.M.I. Show. Present on stage were Robinson, Tarplin, Rogers, White and Moore. Although present on the original recording, Miracle Claudette Robinson, who was married to Smokey Robinson, was not present at the concert.  She had retired from onstage and TV performances earlier that year for health reasons, after touring caused her to have miscarriages, but she continued singing on their records as a non-touring member of the Miracles.\nThe Miracles' \"That's What Love Is Made Of\" has inspired cover versions by Michael Jackson, Bobby Vee, Choker Campbell, and the Magicians, and has appeared on many Miracles \"Greatest Hits\" albums and CD Anthologies.  This Miracles song also inspired a cover version by Len Barry. The song's flip side was the popular regional Miracles hit tune, \"Would I Love You\", which was included on Greatest Hits from the Beginning, but did not appear on CD until 1996's Early Classics.

Linnaeus's hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey.\nLinnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on 12 May 1732, just before he turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near G\u00e4vle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Ume\u00e5, Lule\u00e5 and Tornio. He returned from his six-month-long, over 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica. However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system.In Flora Lapponica Linnaeus's ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora. The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with Flora Lapponica as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described Flora Lapponica as \"the most classic and delightful\" of Linnaeus's works.It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was travelling, Linnaeus remarked: \"If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.\"In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna. Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at R\u00f8ros.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He acknowledged that Avatar shares themes with the films At Play in the Fields of the Lord, The Emerald Forest, and Princess Mononoke, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with Dances with Wolves, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against. He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as Princess Mononoke as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.In 2012, Cameron filed a 45-page legal declaration that intended to \"describe in great detail the\ngenesis of the ideas, themes, storylines, and images that came to be Avatar.\" In addition to historical events (such as European colonization of the Americas), his life experiences and several of his unproduced projects, Cameron drew connections between Avatar and his previous films. He cited his script and concept art for Xenogenesis, partially produced as a short film, as being the basis for many of the ideas and visual designs in Avatar. He stated that Avatar's \"concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force, and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes\" from his earlier films including Aliens, The Abyss, Rambo: First Blood Part II, The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. He specifically mentioned the \"water tentacle\" in The Abyss as an example of an \"avatar\" that \"takes on the appearance of...an alien life form...in order to bridge the cultural gap and build trust.\"Cameron also cited a number of works by other creators as \"reference points and sources of inspiration\" for Avatar. These include two of his \"favorite\" films, 2001: A Space Odyssey, where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, and Lawrence of Arabia, where \"an outsider...encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders.\" Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a \"synthetic avatar\" inside another world from George Henry Smith's short story \"In the Imagicon\" and Arthur C. Clarke's novel The City and the Stars. He said he learned of the term \"avatar\" by reading the cyberpunk novels Neuromancer by William Gibson and Islands in the Net by Bruce Sterling. The idea of a \"world mind\" originated in the novel Solaris by Stanislaw Lem. Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with \"indigenous cultures\" as inspiring him, including Dances with Wolves, The Man Who Would Be King, The Mission, The Emerald Forest, Medicine Man, The Jungle Book and FernGully. He also cited as inspiration the John Carter and Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs and other adventure stories by Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard.In a 2007 interview with Time magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term Avatar, to which he replied, \"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\" Cameron also cited the Japanese cyberpunk manga and anime Ghost in the Shell, in terms of how humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies.\nThe look of the Na'vi \u2013 the humanoids indigenous to Pandora \u2013 was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on Avatar. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet (4 m) tall, which he thought was \"kind of a cool image\". Also he said, \"I just like blue. It's a good color ... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities, which I like conceptually.\" He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of \"gorgeous\" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them.For the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, which he said was in the tradition of Romeo and Juliet. He acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film Titanic. An interviewer stated: \"Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.\" Cameron described Neytiri as his \"Pocahontas\", saying that his plotline followed the historical story of a \"white outsider [who] falls in love with the chief's daughter, who becomes his guide to the tribe and to their special bond with nature.\" Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists. Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters did. Cameron said the two actors \"had a great chemistry\" during filming.\nFor the film's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\", the designers drew inspiration from \"many different types of mountains, but mainly the karst limestone formations in China.\" According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired by Huangshan (also known as Yellow Mountain), Guilin, Zhangjiajie, among others around the world. Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains.To create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the Noble Clyde Boudreaux oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico during June 2007. They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealistic CGI during post-production.Cameron said that he wanted to make \"something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that\" but also have a conscience \"that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man\". He added that \"the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are\" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans \"represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future\".Cameron acknowledges that Avatar implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference to the use of the term \"shock and awe\" in the film, Cameron said: \"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\" He said in later interviews, \"... I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled ...\" and, \"The film is definitely not anti-American.\"\nA scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron said he had been \"surprised at how much it did look like September 11\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Koepp was hired in 1990 to write a new draft, and was able to find the right tone that the studio liked. Bregman remembers, 'Some of them were light, some of them were darker, and others were supposedly funnier \u2013 which they weren't. It just didn\u2019t work.' Koepp's script relied predominantly on the pulp novels while taking the overall tone from the radio show, with the actual plot originated by Koepp himself in consultation with Bregman.\nIn an attempt to differentiate The Shadow from other superhero films of the time, Koepp 'focused on the copy line, 'Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?' and wondered how [the Shadow] knew what evil lurks in the hearts of men. And I decided that perhaps it was because he was uncomfortably familiar with the evil in his own heart.' For Koepp, the film then became 'a story of guilt and atonement'. He picked Shiwan Khan as the film\u2019s villain because 'he was bold and he knew what he was doing \u2013 he wanted to conquer the world. That was very simple, maybe a little ambitious, but he knew exactly what he wanted.' He had always been a fan of Alec Baldwin and wrote the script with him in mind: 'He has the eyes and the voice; he had so much of what I pictured Cranston being.' Koepp also sat in on rehearsals and incorporated a lot of the actor\u2019s humor into the script.Stephen H. Burum served as cinematographer.The Shadow was shot on the Universal backlot in Hollywood on five sound-stages over sixty days with a five-day mini-unit tour of location shooting, and a week lost when an earthquake destroyed the Hall of Mirrors set. Mulcahy said, 'There are a lot of FX in this film, but it's not a FX film. It's a character/story-driven film. The FX are part of the story.'The Shadow uses a mix of traditional practical and optical effects alongside computer-generated imagery.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Their enduring following, described as \"cult-like\", is notable in that their fanbase and legacy have continuously remained strong throughout their entire career whereas other bands from the 2000s emo scene have faded into obscurity. They have been widely praised by critics for creating artistic statements with their music instead of aiming for mainstream success like many of their contemporaries did. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork remarked, \"popular guitar music in 2017 has been undeniably shaped by Brand New, a band who has served not just as damaged role models but as a formative musical influence.\" Writing for The Outline, Zoe Camp stated that \"they were increasingly sincere and self-aware in a genre where emotional histrionics were the default setting. Music like this made them, and Lacey, seem definitively different than Fall Out Boy\u2019s Pete Wentz, Taking Back Sunday\u2019s Adam Lazzara, or virtually any other sad white guy who once covered Alternative Press.\" Spin declared that \"Brand New didn\u2019t just became a band, they became a lifeline and sanctuary for thousands upon thousands of messed-up kids.\" Ryan Bassil of Noisey declared Brand New \"to be crowned the best band of a generation.\" Music writers have credited the eight-year gap between 2009's Daisy and 2017's Science Fiction as essential for the growth of Brand New's legacy in the music world. In Chris Payne's 2023 retrospective novel Where Are Your Boys Tonight?: The Oral History of Emo's Mainstream Explosion 1999-2008, he named Brand New \"arguably the most innovative and critically acclaimed band of their scene.\"Brand New's influence on the new wave of downbeat hip hop has also been noted, with Lindsay Zoladz of The Ringer stating \"your future favorite rapper might be listening to Brand New right now.\" Lil Peep sampled Brand New's \"The No Seatbelt Song\" on his track \"Crybaby\".Artists influenced by Brand New include Manchester Orchestra, mewithoutYou, Cymbals Eat Guitars, Citizen, Oso Oso, Amy Shark, Sorority Noise, Moose Blood and The Xcerts. Pop singer Halsey has referred to their third album in particular as a major influence and Lacey as \"largely responsible for why I write with such detail.\"Foxing lead singer Conor Murphy pointed to a motivational speech that Lacey gave the band before their first show opening for Brand New as a pivotal moment in the band's development.

I admired the Francesco passages rather than feeling engrossed by them and occasionally it felt as if Smith's ideas were so clever they were in danger of getting in the way of the story. But there is no doubt that Smith is dazzling in her daring. The sheer inventive power of her new novel pulls you through, gasping, to the final page.\"\nLaura Miller, in The Guardian comments on duality of the novel: \"While I do not doubt the two halves of How to Be Both may be read in either order with satisfying results, once read, it's impossible to know what it would be like to first encounter it in the alternate order... How to Be Both is unforgettable. I can never know what it would be like to meet George before knowing Del Cossa, so that version of the novel is forever lost to me. It's a bit sad. But it was worth it.\"\nArifa Akbar in The Independent also comments on the dual narrative, writing that \"Smith has written a radical novel, one that becomes two novels, with discrete meanings, through its (re)ordering... How to be Both shows us that the arrangement of a story, even when it's the same story, can change our understanding of it and define our emotional attachments. We may have known this, but to see it enacted with such imagination is dazzling indeed. Those writers making doomy predictions about the death of the novel should read Smith's re-imagined novel/s, and take note of the life it contains.\"\nPatrick Flanery of The Telegraph finds that \"The pain of mourning and loss is seared into the lives of Smith\u2019s two motherless heroines, but despite the novel\u2019s refusal of consolation and the profound seriousness of the questions it explores, How to be Both brims with palpable joy, not only at language, literature, and art\u2019s transformative power, but at the messy business of being human, of wanting to be more than one kind of person at once. The possibilities unleashed by the desire to be neither one thing nor the other means that one may ever and always strive to be both. With great subtlety and inventiveness, Smith continues to expand the boundaries of the novel\".\nRon Charles of The Washington Post writes that \"This gender-blending, genre-blurring story, bounces across centuries, tossing off profound reflections on art and grief, without getting tangled in its own postmodern wires.

She adopted the stage name \"Alessandra\" and a pop-rock style in 2008; later that year, she changed her stage name to \"Inna\" and began releasing house music. \"Hot\" (2008), her debut single, was a commercial success worldwide and topped the Romanian and Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart, among others. Her debut studio album of the same name followed in August 2009 and was certified Gold and Platinum. It featured several other successful singles in Europe, including \"Amazing\" (2009), the singer's second number-one single in Romania.\nInna's second album, I Am the Club Rocker (2011), yielded global success for the single \"Sun Is Up\" (2010). The track won the Eurodanceweb Award, making Inna the first and only Romanian artist to win the award. In 2011, it was announced Inna was the highest-paid Romanian and Eastern European artist. Her follow-up studio album, Party Never Ends (2013), was nominated for two consecutive years for Best Album at the Romanian Music Awards and reached the top ten in Mexico. It featured \"More than Friends\", a moderate European hit in collaboration with Daddy Yankee. In 2014, Inna signed with Atlantic Records and released the commercially successful \"Cola Song\" with J Balvin, which was used to promote that year's FIFA World Cup.\nInna's fourth and eponymous studio album was released in October 2015 and included \"Diggy Down\", her third number-one single in Romania.

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

The initial controversy surrounding the end of Evangelion has had no lasting negative influence on the popularity of the series.Evangelion has developed into a social phenomenon beyond its primary fan base, generating national discussion in Japan. The series has also been the subject of numerous media reports, debates, and research studies worldwide. The show has received review by critics, academics and sociologists alike, including by Susan J. Napier, William Rout, Mick Broderick, Mari Kotani, Shinji Miyadai, Hiroki Azuma, Yuriko Furuhata, and Marc Steinberg. The series has been described as both a critique and deconstruction of the mecha genre. Japanese critic Manabu Tsuribe considered that Evangelion was \"extremely interior and is lacking in sociality, so that it seems to reflect pathology of the times.\" Anime News Network's Martin Theron described the character design as \"distinctive, designed to be sexy rather than cutesy\", and the mecha designs as \"among the most distinctive ever produced for an anime series, with sleek, lithe appearances that look monstrous, fearsome, and nimble rather than boxy and knight-like\". Mike Crandol stated \"It no longer seems contrite to say that Evangelion is surely one of the all-time great works of animation\". In February 2004 Cinefantastique listed the anime as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

These paintings fall mainly in the genre of the so-called merry companies.  The key work is the Prodigal son among courtesans (Museum Mayer van den Bergh). It depicts a merry company known as a buitenpartij, i.e. a scene of people from the middle class enjoying an outdoor party rather than the lowly peasant scenes that were often the subject of genre paintings.  Another example is the Merry company (At Lempertz auction of 21 November 2009, lot 1018B). The male and female participants in this composition are wearing clothes in the latest fashion such as high hats, puffed pants and ruff collars. They are enjoying themselves in the outdoors in a garden with plenty of food, drink, music and dance.  The scene also includes a black page and a jester.  The composition includes allusions to the aristocratic pursuit of hunting such as the dog in the foreground and the falcon on the right.  Some couples on the right have separated themselves from the revelers at the table and their amorous intentions are all too clear.\nIn most cases the moralizing message of a 'buitenpartij' is to warn the viewers to distance themselves from the pleasures and excesses depicted, as these should be morally condemned as a frivolous waste of time and as worldly vanity. One of the origins of the type of the \"buitenpartij\" is the pictorial tradition of religious representations of a Biblical subject such as \"The Prodigal Son\", in which a moral story is told through depictions of drunken feasts with erotic overtones.  It is possible that Pourbus also intended to convey such a religious or moralising message in his buitenpartijen.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The series revolves around the invasion of Earth by an interdimensional force called the Nova, and a special military group of genetically engineered young women called Pandoras. Pandoras fight alongside their male partners known as Limiters, who are created to combat the Nova. The story centers around Kazuya Aoi, a Limiter whose late sister was a Pandora, and Satellizer el Bridget, a Pandora with a cold personality who is known as the \"Untouchable Queen\" due to her intense aphephobia. Both are enrolled at West Genetics Academy, which is a training school for Pandoras and Limiters.\nFreezing began serialization in Kill Time Communication's seinen manga magazine Comic Valkyrie in its March 2007 issue.

The truck stop is located off a freeway and it features a diner, a gas station, and a convenience store.\nThe story's narrator and a handful of strangers find themselves trapped together in a freeway truck stop diner after semi-trailers and other large vehicles are suddenly brought to independent life by an unknown force and proceed to gruesomely kill every human in sight. Cars, which remain unaltered, are swiftly battered into wreckage and pedestrians are massacred by rampaging trucks and buses. The six survivors hiding in the diner include the narrator, as well as an elderly counterman, a trucker, a young man named Jerry, his girlfriend, and a salesman named Snodgrass.\nAs the story begins, the counterman and the trucker attempt to radio any other survivors, but the two-way radio fails for unknown reasons. Snodgrass, cracking under the strain, attempts to flee across the stop's parking lot and is hit by a truck. Snodgrass gets propelled into a drainage ditch, taking hours to die from internal bleeding. The situation worsens when the diner's power goes out. The counterman instructs the survivors that they will need to consume the perishable meats and collect good potable water from the restrooms. While the employee restroom is inside the diner, the men's and ladies' room are by the outdoor gas station, and the narrator's attempt to gather fresh water from those places nearly costs him his life when the trucks realize what he is trying to do. \nSome time later, a glimmer of hope appears when the trucks begin to run out of fuel. An enormous semi-truck noses up to the diner and starts blasting its horn erratically. Jerry remembers from his time in the Boy Scouts that the horn blasts are Morse code, and translates that the trucks are demanding humans start pumping fuel. The trucks assure they will not attack people who refuel them. The narrator is outvoted when he suggests they comply with this, and a bulldozer arrives and proceeds to attack the diner. The narrator and Jerry destroy the bulldozer with improvised Molotov cocktails, but the diner is half-destroyed and Jerry and the trucker are killed.\nThe remaining three humans surrender and, taking turns, start pumping the gas into the mile-long string of waiting trucks. When the narrator exhausts the fuel reserve of the truck stop's gas station, a fuel tanker arrives to replenish the fuel cisterns. When the narrator is at a point of collapsing, he is relieved by the counterman, who starts pumping gas for his \"shift\". The narrator says that he will have to show the girl how to handle a fuel pump, and that she will do it because she wants to live. The narrator thinks to himself that perhaps this will last only until the trucks run out of fuel, rust, and fall apart, but he then has a grim vision of forced assembly lines churning out new generations of trucks, and the trucks, aided by construction vehicles and tanks, doing great efforts such as draining the Okefenokee Swamp and paving much of the wild backcountry, stamping it into a great plain. The story ends as a pair of planes fly overhead, and the narrator laments \"I wish I could believe there are people in them.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others.

In a brief review in Rolling Stone, Michael Sragow similarly called it \"A minor horror movie with a major modern-movie problem: director Tony Scott develops so many ingenious ways to illustrate his premise that there's no time left to tell a story.\"Christopher John reviewed The Hunger in Ares Magazine #15 and commented that \"Beautifully filmed, but boringly void of substance, The Hunger is (was) a film to be avoided like the plague.\"Camille Paglia wrote in Sexual Personae (1990) that while The Hunger comes close to being a masterpiece of a \"classy genre of vampire film\", it is \"ruined by horrendous errors, as when the regal Catherine Deneuve is made to crawl around on all fours, slavering over cut throats\", which Paglia considered an inappropriate focus on violence rather than sex. Critic Elaine Showalter called The Hunger a \"post-modernist vampire film\" that \"casts vampirism in bisexual terms, drawing on the tradition of the lesbian vampire...Contemporary and stylish, [it] is also disquieting in its suggestion that men and women in the 1980s have the same desires, the same appetites, and the same needs for power, money, and sex.\" David Bowie later commented about the film that \"the first twenty minutes rattle along like hell - it really is a great opening.\"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Hunger holds a 59% approval rating based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The consensus reads: \"Stylish yet hollow, The Hunger is a well-cast vampire thriller that mistakes erotic moments for a satisfying story.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Frustrated, he asks the priest what he should do with his mundane life, and the priest tells him that he should repent, sacrifice all his palatial pleasures, and live the life of a simple and ordinary man, and hence learn the true meaning of life, for at least six months.

Winslet was handpicked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind. The character was named Iris after Jude Law's young daughter. A fan of Meyers' previous work on Something's Gotta Give (2003), Winslet, then primarily known for her portrayals in period films, \"loved the idea\" of playing a contemporary English woman in a romantic comedy, a genre she had not done before. Winslet said she had initially felt \"nervous and ... scared about trying to be funny\" at times, stating that \"Jude [Law] and I would speak on the telephone a lot before we started shooting, 'Oh my god, they're going to fire us, they're going to recast, what if we don't make them laugh?\" In preparing for her role, Winslet watched screwball comedies from the 1940s, such as His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story, to study the dialogues and performances.\nCameron Diaz as Amanda Woods:  Amanda is the owner of a successful business that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character \"was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz's performance in the film to Goldie Hawn's, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said.\nJude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\", and single father raising his two daughters (Miffy Englefield as Sophie, and Emma Pritchard as Olivia) by himself after his wife's death. Robert Downey Jr. auditioned for the role. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday.\nJack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend, Ethan. Jimmy Fallon auditioned for the role. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock (2003). On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\"\nEli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man.The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale (2001) together, although they do not share a scene. The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair.\nDustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate (1967). According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster Video to rent a film when he saw the lighting from the film production crew and walked over to see what was happening. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it.Lindsay Lohan, who had made her motion picture debut in Meyers's remake of The Parent Trap (1998), and James Franco, a friend of Meyers, make uncredited appearances in the trailer of the fictional movie Deception, which Amanda and her team finish at the beginning of The Holiday. Veteran voice-over talent Hal Douglas was the narrator for the trailer, as well as other \"trailers\" that describe Amanda's situation at various points in the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the first entry in the Mother series. It is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but is set in the late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to put an end to the paranormal phenomena that recently spiraled the country into disarray. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.\nWriter and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mother's concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. A North American version of the game was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released globally as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015 and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022.\nMother was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies and received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score from Famitsu magazine. Mother was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, but many considered its sequel Mother 2: G\u012bgu no Gyakush\u016b (known outside as EarthBound) to be similar and a better overall implementation of Mother's gameplay ideas, with the game's high difficulty level polarizing critics, along with balance issues. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com wrote that Mother importantly generated interest in video game emulation and the historical preservation of unreleased games. The game was re-released in Japan on the single-cartridge compilation Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance in 2003.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

Journalist Jennifer Pozner, in her book Reality Bites Back, calls The Swan \"the most sadistic reality series of the decade\". Journalist Chris Hedges also criticized the show in his 2009 book Empire of Illusion, writing \"The Swan's transparent message is that once these women have been surgically 'corrected' to resemble mainstream celebrity beauty as closely as possible, their problems will be solved\". Feminist scholar Susan J. Douglas criticized the show in her book The Rise of Enlightened Sexism for its continuation of a negative female body image, claiming that \"it made all too explicit the narrow physical standards to which women are expected to conform, the sad degree to which women internalize these standards, the lengths needed to get there, and the impossibility for most of us to meet the bar without, well, taking a box cutter to our faces and bodies\".Author Alice Marwick believes that this program is an example of \"body culture media\", which she describes as \"a genre of popular culture which positions work on the body as a morally correct solution to personal problems\". Marwick also suggests that cosmetic reality television encourages viewers to frame their family, financial, or social problems in bodily terms, and portrays surgical procedures as an everyday and normal solution.

She informs Earl of his brother's execution by the Outfit. Earl realises that the motel stay is a setup, and when one of the hitmen who killed his brother bursts into the room, Earl ambushes him and tortures him for information.\nMacklin lets the hitman live and sends him back to Chicago as a warning. Bett confesses that the Outfit tortured her and threatened to cut her face up if she didn't lure Earl to the motel. His next move is to rob a poker game where Outfit member Jake Menner is playing. Menner explains that the bank that Eddie and Earl robbed together was an Outfit cover, so the contract on the two of them is simple retribution. Macklin calculates that the Outfit owes him $250,000 for the trouble it has caused him. He says whatever he earns by ripping off the Outfit's operations in the meantime is just gravy. Then, he shoots Menner in the hand as revenge for the treatment of Bett.\nMenner tells his boss Mailer that the Outfit has a problem, but Mailer insists that it is Menner's problem to solve.

Their next target is a dive restaurant that does not even have a safe. On their way out with the money, the cook throws his cleaver at Cody and three gunmen lie in wait outside the restaurant. Bett mows two of them down and the trio escapes.\nMacklin and Cody go to Chemey to get a new car, since theirs has been made. Chemey's sister-in-law makes a pass at Cody. When he turns her down, she claims that he tried to rape her. That causes a physical confrontation that Chemey manages to deflate, allowing Cody and Macklin to leave in their new car.\nTheir next target is a much bigger operation. Cody poses as a mailman, and Macklin as a maintenance man. They knock out a secretary and make their way into a warren of back rooms where they rob the safe.

Thousands of years ago, the Blue Star was infected with evil by a dark god named Zophar. His evil corrupted the hearts of people, turning some into monsters to do his bidding. The survivors cried out to the patron-deity of the Blue Star, a Goddess named Althena, for help. She confronted Zophar in an epic battle, and was only able to stop him by using her powers of creation to seal him in another dimension, destroying nearly all life on the planet in the process.\nUnable to restore the planet until several millennia had passed, Althena instead chose to transform the planet's moon into an earthlike world, and transported the survivors there. These included not only humans but also a race of \"beast-men\", and another race of elf-like beings skilled in wielding magic. The only elf-like being depicted in Lunar is Ghaleon, who is a confirmed member of the Vile Tribe in \"Lunar: Vane Hikuusen Monogatari\", which is mysteriously classified here as a \"fourth race\", despite there being only three. There was also a fourth race of people who would later come to be known as \"The Vile Tribe\" after they rejected Althena's teachings. She was forced to banish them to an area of Lunar called \"The Frontier\", a barren wasteland where even Althena's magical power could not reach. They became enemies of Althena and her followers for thousands of years.\nTo protect Lunar, Althena created four intelligent Dragons \u2013 a white one, a red one, a blue one, and a black one \u2013 that each shared a part of her divine power. There are only four Dragons at any given time, though they are replaced over time with younger ones. Strangely, during their infancy, these dragons resemble talking, winged cats, until they claim the power of their predecessor and ascend to adulthood. The Dragons spend most of their time sleeping underground until they are needed.\nAlthena also decreed that there would be a champion called The Dragonmaster to lead Lunar's heroes. This person would be anyone who managed to make their way to the hidden lairs of the Four Dragons, and pass their harrowing trials. There have been many Dragonmasters across the centuries, and many on Lunar have striven to achieve that title.

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His 2017 album, Colors, won awards for Best Alternative Album and Best Engineered Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. His fourteenth studio album, Hyperspace, was released on November 22, 2019. In 2022, Beck was nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\nWith a pop art collage of musical styles, oblique and ironic lyrics, and postmodern arrangements incorporating samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics and the public throughout his musical career as being among the most idiosyncratically creative musicians of 1990s and 2000s alternative rock. Two of Beck's most popular and acclaimed recordings are Odelay and Sea Change, both of which were ranked on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

Recorded between 1970 and 1971 in sessions at Hitsville U.S.A., Golden World, United Sound Studios in Detroit, and at The Sound Factory in West Hollywood, California, it was Gaye's first album to credit him as producer and to credit Motown's in-house session musicians, known as the Funk Brothers.\nWhat's Going On is a concept album with most of its songs segueing into the next and has been categorized as a song cycle. The narrative established by the songs is told from the point of view of a Vietnam veteran returning to his home country to witness hatred, suffering, and injustice. Gaye's introspective lyrics explore themes of drug abuse, poverty, and the Vietnam War. He has also been credited with promoting awareness of ecological issues before the public outcry over them had become prominent (\"Mercy Mercy Me\").\nWhat's Going On stayed on the Billboard Top LPs for over a year and became Gaye's second number-one album on Billboard's Soul LPs chart, where it stayed for nine weeks. The title track, which had been released in January 1971 as the album's lead single, hit number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and held the top position on Billboard's Soul Singles chart five weeks running. The follow-up singles \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\" and \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\" also reached the top 10 of the Hot 100, making Gaye the first male solo artist to place three top ten singles on the Hot 100 from one album.\nThe album was an immediate commercial and critical success, and came to be viewed by music historians as a classic of 1970s soul. Multiple critics, musicians, and many in the general public  consider What's Going On to be one of the greatest albums of all time and a landmark recording in popular music.

It is the first entry in the Mother series. It is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but is set in the late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to put an end to the paranormal phenomena that recently spiraled the country into disarray. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.\nWriter and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mother's concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. A North American version of the game was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released globally as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015 and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022.\nMother was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies and received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score from Famitsu magazine. Mother was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, but many considered its sequel Mother 2: G\u012bgu no Gyakush\u016b (known outside as EarthBound) to be similar and a better overall implementation of Mother's gameplay ideas, with the game's high difficulty level polarizing critics, along with balance issues.

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds (Museum Bredius, The Hague).  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format.\n\nThe influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time.\nThe traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings.\nWhile his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer.Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women (1977) was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas.

Halloween popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. Halloween helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s. Due to its popularity, Halloween became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed, and that others like Scream parodied.The major themes present in Halloween also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in Halloween, there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.There are slasher films that predated Halloween, such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972),  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Black Christmas (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. Halloween, however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others. Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of Halloween,\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting.

{"id": "91_338", "question": "What genre is Steps?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_8983", "text": "While Tchaikovsky struggled with his first three symphonies, developments in Europe led to an alternative to this genre that, in a reverse twist, offered to change the scope of the symphony. Hungarian composer Franz Liszt desired a form of orchestral music that would offer greater flexibility in developing musical themes than the symphony then allowed but also preserve the overall unity of a musical composition. His objective was to expand single-movement works beyond the concert overture format. By doing so, he hoped to combine the dramatic, emotive and evocative qualities of concert overtures with the scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movements of symphonies.The fruit of Liszt's labors was what he eventually termed symphonic poems. In them, he used two alternatives to sonata form. Beethoven had used the first of these, cyclic form, to link separate movements thematically with one another. Liszt took this process one step further by combining themes into a single-movement cyclic structure. The second alternative, thematic transformation, originated with Haydn and Mozart. This process worked in a similar manner as variation but instead of a theme being changed into a related or subsidiary version of the main one, it becomes transformed into a related but separate, independent theme. Beethoven used it in the finale of his Ninth Symphony when he transformed the theme of the \"Ode to Joy\" into a Turkish march. Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes. Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his Wanderer Fantasy, a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt. However, Liszt learned to create longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation.Liszt's approach to musical form in his symphonic poems was also unorthodox. Instead of following a strict presentation and development of musical themes as in sonata form, he placed his themes into a loose, episodic pattern. There, recurring melodies called motifs were thematically transformed as musical and  programmatic needs dictated. (Richard Wagner would make good use of this practice in his operas and music dramas.) Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, were foreshortened. Codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, were greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffled into new and unexpected patterns of order and three- or four-movement structures were rolled into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.A number of composers, especially Bohemian and Russian, followed in Liszt's footsteps to develop the symphonic poem further.  Added to this was the Russian love of story-telling, for which the genre seemed expressly tailored. Tchaikovsky wrote a symphonic poem, Fatum, after he had finished his First Symphony and first opera, The Voyevoda. There, he dabbled with the free form the new genre offered. However, the work did not come out well and he destroyed it after two performances. For his next programmatic work, the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet, Tchaikovsky reverted to sonata form, structuring it in a similar fashion to Beethoven's concert overtures. However, in a case of musical cross-pollination, the symphonic poem offered the potential to change the nature of the symphony in its merging of a wide emotional range with symphonic resources. This potential played to the conception Tchaikovsky would form of the symphony as a vehicle for personal expression and one whose details could, as he phrased it to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, \"be manipulated as freely as one chooses.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

From then on, he worked as a painter of portrait miniatures in London, and also Essex, and in 1832 in Winchester. He exhibited 113 portrait miniatures between 1786 and 1832, principally at the Royal Academy, and had a reputation for creating a good likeness.\nHayter married Martha Stevenson in 1788. His two sons and daughter were all successful artists; Sir George Hayter (1792\u20131871), John Hayter (1800\u20131895), and Anne Hayter who, like her father, was a miniature painter.\nCharles Hayter taught perspective (on which he was an authority) to Princess Charlotte, King George IV's daughter, to whom he was later appointed Professor in Perspective and Drawing. He also dedicated to her his book An Introduction to perspective, adapted to the capacities of youth, in a series of pleasing and familiar dialogues, first published in 1813 in London. He later published A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information (London 1826), in which he described how all colours could be obtained from just three.\n\nAn album containing 443 studies for miniature portraits is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Hayter noted inside the cover that these were sketches which he 'placed behind the Ivory, which being transparent, gave the artist the aid in making his outline on the ivory'.", "hasanswer": true}]}

For two years, it also faced CBS's The Price Is Right, already a major hit. After continued mediocrity in the Nielsen ratings, ABC was prepared to cancel General Hospital, but decided to give it a second chance in 1978 when it expanded the show from an experimental 45 minutes to a full hour. However, the expansion came with an ultimatum to the producers that they had six months to improve the show's ratings. Gloria Monty was hired as the new executive producer, and on her first day, she spent an extra $100,000 re-taping four episodes. A miracle occurred thanks to Monty and head writer Douglas Marland; the show became the most-watched daytime drama by 1979, marking a rare instance of a daytime serial's comeback from near-extinction. During the wedding of Luke and Laura on November 17, 1981, about 30 million people tuned in to watch them exchange vows and be cursed by Elizabeth Taylor's Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers).\nFrom 1979 to 1988, General Hospital remained number one in the ratings, competing against two game shows and two low-rated soaps on NBC\u2014Texas and Santa Barbara\u2014and Guiding Light on CBS (although  Guiding Light experienced a renaissance for a brief period in the middle of 1984, and became the #1-rated soap, briefly dethroning General Hospital from the top ratings spot). For the most part, however, General Hospital continued to triumph, even after the departure of popular actors Anthony Geary and Genie Francis in the mid-1980s. Although The Young and the Restless took General Hospital's place as the highest-rated serial in 1989, General Hospital continued to maintain excellent ratings.\nEven at its peak in the 1980s, General Hospital had been pre-empted in at least two markets in the United States. With the show still number one in the Nielsens, WDTN in Dayton, Ohio preempted the series upon joining ABC in January 1980 in favor of Woody Woodpecker and Super Friends cartoons. Later, the station would air such shows as Hour Magazine, Geraldo and Maury in the show's timeslot until September 2000, when the station's new owners, Sunrise Broadcasting (which purchased the station from Hearst Television two years prior), pulled Maury from the station's schedule, due to what it called \"community standards\", and brought General Hospital back to Dayton. In Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York, WVNY dropped General Hospital from the schedule in the 1980s and would only bring it back in 1995. During that hiatus, General Hospital still aired on Montreal's CFCF-DT, whose signal was decently available in Vermont and Plattsburgh.\nEver since the 1991\u20131992 season of General Hospital, the show has had a steady decline in ratings. On and off, it would rank between third and fifth place in the Nielsen ratings, with CBS's The Young And The Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful coming in first and second place, respectively. General Hospital remained in between third and fifth place in the ratings during that time, and from late 1991 to 1996 All My Children held the title of ABC's highest-rated soap.\nAfter months of speculation and cancellation rumors, Deadline Hollywood reported on April 11, 2012, that ABC quietly made the decision to keep General Hospital on the air and to cancel instead the lower-rated talk show The Revolution. On June 26, 2012, ABC officially announced that General Hospital would move to the 2 p.m. ET/PT timeslot starting on September 10, 2012, and that the network would give the 3:00 p.m. hour back to its affiliates, as it was the recommended time slot for Katie Couric's new, ABC-syndicated talk show, Katie.Encore episodes were shown every weeknight on the former cable channel Soapnet, with a marathon on Saturday and classic episodes at 4 a.m. EST and 5 a.m. (3 a.m. and 4 a.m. CST).\nProduction of General Hospital was suspended in March 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The show had banked roughly two months' worth of episodes at that time.  By airing repeats on \"Flashback Fridays\", General Hospital was able to air original episodes through the week ending of May 21. This was followed by several weeks of vintage episode repeats. Production resumed on July 22, 2020, and new episodes began airing on August 3.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women (1977) was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas.

This genre includes such critically revered films as Psycho, Repulsion, and Persona.\" Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to Altman's earlier film That Cold Day in the Park (1969) and his later 3 Women, declaring them a trilogy.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_347", "question": "What genre is First Love?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His wife Gwen suggests that it would make him feel better if he wrote down what was bothering him.\nMany years prior, Thomas is taken in by a kindly community of field mice after being caught in a snowstorm. There he meets Woodget, a little field mouse who becomes his close friend, and a beautiful maiden named Bess Sandibrook. Thomas falls deeply in love with Bess, but is unaware that Woodget has similar feelings for her. Stating that she loves Woodget, Bess gently rejects Thomas, only for them both to realise that Woodget has run away after mistakenly thinking he's getting in the way of their romance. Thomas vows to find Woodget, and catches up with him at a dock as a ship called the Calliope is getting ready to set sail. Thomas and Woodget meet a tough Irish mouse named Mulligan, who invites them to have a drink with him on the ship before he leaves. But they stay too long and to their dismay are stuck on the ship. The two become suspicious of Mulligan, who is evasive and will not let anyone see the contents of a satchel he always carries with him. The Calliope eventually crashes in a violent storm, killing most of its passengers.\nMulligan washes ashore in Crete with Dimlon, a simple-minded young mouse Thomas and Woodget befriended during the voyage. Dimlon drops his facade of innocence and reveals himself to Mulligan as Dahrem Ruhar, an adept of the Scale, an evil cult that worships a banished reptile god called Suruth Scarophion. Mulligan has been carrying a piece of a jade egg sacred to the Scale, trying to prevent them from obtaining it and joining it with the other pieces, which would create a vessel into which Scarophion can be reborn. Thomas and Woodget survived the storm as well, and come onto the island in time to see a dying Mulligan, poisoned by the blades of Dahrem. He has carried the egg fragment with him and pushes it into the horrified Woodget's paws, telling him to take it to a place called Hara. Thomas and Woodget are discovered by an army of Indian mongooses who demand to know where they got the egg fragment from. After they explain the situation, the mongooses offer to take the two mice to Hara, their home city in India so they can speak to the sadhu and ask his advice. Dahrem, once again in the guise of Dimlon, comes along with them. Upon their arrival in Hara, Thomas, Woodget and mongoose Captain Chattan go to see the sadhu, who also possesses a piece of the jade egg of Scarophion. In the night, the Scale arrive and launch a vicious attack on the city of Hara to steal the fragment. To everyone's shock, it is the sadhu himself who opens the gates for the Scale to enter. Dahrem attacks Woodget in the sadhu's chamber, demanding that he hand over the egg fragment Mulligan gave him. Thomas and Chattan hear the field mouse's screams and come to his rescue. Chattan engages in battle with Dahrem, who demonstrates his ability as an adept to tear his mammalian flesh off and assume the form of a lizard. Ultimately Dahrem is killed, but not before poisoning Chattan with his blades.\nFaced with nowhere else to go, Thomas and Woodget decide to head to Singapore, where it is said that the jerboa prophet Simoon has journeyed. In a seedy bar called the Lotus Parlour, Thomas accidentally lets it slip to the bar's owner, Ma Skillet, that he and Woodget have the final egg fragment. Simoon is present and scolds the two mice for having walked directly into Scale territory. The bar is full of members of the cult (including Ma Skillet, the high priestess) who capture Thomas, Woodget, and Simoon and take them to their temple. The high priest joins the egg fragments together, and it appears Suruth Scarophion will be reborn. But as the reptilian form writhes within the newly created egg, it suddenly shrivels and dies. Simoon reveals that it was the plan all along to let the Scale obtain every piece of the egg, as he and other members of the Green Council like the sadhu knew it would ultimately be useless. The fragment held by Mulligan was periodically moved to different shrines to the benevolent Green Mouse deity, and thus gradually became a holy object. Cast from the ruined egg, Scarophion's spirit enters a nearby statue in his image. Riding on its back, the enraged high priest chases Thomas, Woodget, and Simoon. The statue is destroyed when it crashes on a crag of rock, and Woodget kills the high priest to save Thomas's life.\nAt the end of the journey, Thomas and Woodget are at a dock in Singapore waiting for a ship to take them back to England. An old beggar approaches them, but soon they discover that it is Ma Skillet, former high priestess of the Scale. She puts Thomas into a trance, during which he picks up Woodget and casts him into the water. Despite the field mouse's pleas, Thomas lets him presumably drown. Hours later, Thomas emerges from the trance and to his horror, remembers what he has done. He screams in anguish.\nIn present day Hara, Chattan's sister Sobhan is taking her grandson to see the sadhu. She tries to help the latter remember his former identity, but he responds that Zenna, the siren who rescued him from the sea, wiped his memory completely and he is content that way.

In the end, Miranda's impassioned narrative of one man's story becomes the collective narrative of a nation, a nation built by immigrants who occasionally need to be reminded where they came from.\"\nIn his review of the off-Broadway production, Jesse Green in New York wrote, \"The conflict between independence and interdependence is not just the show's subject but also its method: It brings the complexity of forming a union from disparate constituencies right to your ears. ... Few are the theatergoers who will be familiar with all of Miranda's touchstones. I caught the verbal references to Rodgers and Hammerstein, Gilbert and Sullivan, Sondheim, West Side Story, and 1776, but other people had to point out to me the frequent hat-tips to hip-hop ... Whether it's a watershed, a breakthrough, and a game-changer, as some have been saying, is another matter. Miranda is too savvy (and loves his antecedents too much) to try to reinvent all the rules at once. ...

The show is burdened with eye-glazingly dull stretches, especially those involving George Washington.\"Reviewing the Broadway production in The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote, \"I am loath to tell people to mortgage their houses and lease their children to acquire tickets to a hit Broadway show.

I love it like I love New York, or Broadway when it gets it right. And this is so right. A sublime conjunction of radio-ready hip-hop (as well as R&B, Britpop and trad showstoppers), under-dramatized American history and Miranda's uniquely personal focus as a first-generation Puerto Rican and inexhaustible wordsmith, Hamilton hits multilevel culture buttons, hard. ... The work's human drama and novelistic density remain astonishing.\" Cote chose Hamilton as a Critics' Pick, and gave the production five out of five stars.In an issue of Journal of the Early Republic, Andrew Schocket wrote that while Hamilton makes bold choices to stray away from what he calls the \"American Revolution Rebooted\" genre, it remains \"forged in the mold of this genre, and despite its casting and hip-hop delivery, is more representative of it than we might think\". In the same issue, Marvin McAllister noted that the production's heavy hip-hop influence works so well because \"Miranda elevates the form through this marriage with musical theater storytelling, and in the process, ennobles the culture and the creators.\"A review in The Economist summed up the response to Hamilton as \"near-universal critical acclaim\". Barack Obama joked that admiration for the musical is \"the only thing Dick Cheney and I agree on.\" In 2019, writers for The Guardian ranked Hamilton the second-greatest theatrical work since 2000.Philosopher Michael Sandel critiques Hamilton for its oversimplistic multiculturalism, avoidance of discussions on Hamilton's financial doctrines, and a blind embrace of liberal meritocracy in his 2022 edition of Democracy's Discontent.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_360", "question": "What genre is Halloween?", "ctxs": [{"id": "164_34315", "text": "Halloween is a widely influential film within the horror genre; it was largely responsible for the popularization of slasher films in the 1980s and helped develop the slasher genre. Halloween popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. Halloween helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s. Due to its popularity, Halloween became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed, and that others like Scream parodied.The major themes present in Halloween also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in Halloween, there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.There are slasher films that predated Halloween, such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972),  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Black Christmas (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. Halloween, however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others. Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of Halloween,\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting. Rockoff considers the film \"the blueprint for all slashers and the model against which all subsequent films are judged.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 2006, he produced an album Songs Forever of swing and jazz versions of popular songs (including Modern Talking's first hit). Bohlen has written two autobiographical books about Modern Talking's history from his perspective. The first book sold a million copies in Germany. The sequel was heavily criticised for his unfairness towards the people he worked with. As a result of that, Bohlen withdrew from the public for a year until 2006, when he said he regretted putting out the second book. Anders had not been the only one pressing charges against Bohlen and demanding that sections of the book be modified. Frank Farian was also angered by Bohlen's literary output and released a book in which he tried to expose Bohlen as a fraud. Bohlen's first book was the basis of an animated comedy film called Dieter: Der Film. The soundtrack of this film contains a new Modern Talking song \"Shooting Star\" which had been created using fragments of vocal recordings from previous Modern Talking titles from the \"Year of the Dragon\" album.\nMusic critics were unenthusiastic about Modern Talking and gave the band's music and performance lacklustre reviews. Although recognizing the catchiness and professional production of the songs, the lack of originality was criticized by British representatives of these genres of music, such as the Pet Shop Boys or Erasure.

Pitchfork editors ranked \"Vogue\" as the 115th best song of the 1990s, praising it for how unapologetically it celebrated queer life at the height of the AIDS epidemic. Rolling Stone listed the track as one of the \"500 Best Songs of All Time\" at number 139, while they named it the 11th greatest dance song of all time. The song was placed by Billboard on the number four spot on its list of \"60 Top LGBTQ Anthems of All Time\", and as part of the 65th anniversary of Billboard Hot 100, the magazine's staff ranked \"Vogue\" as the 186th best pop song that appeared on the chart. Slant Magazine ranked it at number 10 on their \"Best Singles of the '90s\" list, and number three in the list of the 100 Greatest Dance Songs. Music critic Jody Rosen from Slate included \"Vogue\" as one of Madonna's \"ten essential songs for new or aspiring fans\". Time called it \"the most famous fashion song of all time\", although the song was not specifically about the Vogue magazine. It was named the most iconic female dance moment in history in a list elaborated by The Daily Telegraph.\nMany critics and academics agree that with the song, Madonna brought voguing into mainstream culture, and also view it as one of the first mainstream pop culture works to spotlight elements from the queer, Black and Latino-led ballroom scene. Boston.com's Scott Kearnan noted that although Madonna has occasionally been accused of cultural appropriation for taking vogue mainstream, \"she never obfuscated or demeaned its roots\", and completed that \"even at an especially homophobic time, Madonna's gay dancers were shown as front, center, and fabulous, striking a pose alongside the most famous woman on Earth.\" Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone had similar thoughts, criticizing the mainstream's willingness to seriously engage with that culture and craft only when it is presented by white people, but stated that it \"doesn't mean one can\u2019t still revel in the song's brilliance, nor do they necessarily suggest anything malicious on Madonna's part\", as she \"approached 'Vogue' with a clear admiration and respect for the ballroom world.\" For Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, \"Vogue\" was \"the beginning of a new phase for Madonna. It was as if she got a sense of her immortality, and her true power. Feeling secure in her status as a mainstream artist, she began to play with that power and challenge her audience.\" James Rose of Daily Review agreed, writing that with the song Madonna began \"a phase of her career that oscillates between cynical self-exploitation and courageous self-expression. Raunchy videos, explicitly themed lyrics and boudoir beats became de rigueur for the lady now arguably bearing the biggest name in popular music.\"Before Madonna popularized the dance, voguing was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. According to O'Brien, when \"Vogue\" became the \"Number 1 hit of that summer, [it was] played in clubs across the globe, from London to New York to Bali\", also pointing out that it \"rode the crest of the newly emerging dance craze, where club culture, house music and techno met the mainstream. 'Vogue' reflected the new hedonism; positive, upbeat, and totally inclusive\". Liam Hess of Vogue commented that \"this subcultural movement had officially boiled over into the zeitgeist\" as \"many were mimicking the playful, exaggerated gestures of the Harlem ballrooms\" around the world. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated, \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream. She introduced the world to this community who, up until that point in time, had been a subculture.\" Voguing has since become a prominent dance form practised worldwide, and many female performers have followed Madonna's footsteps, adopting the dance style and incorporating it into their music videos and performances.The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death. Erick Henderson of Slant Magazine explained that the song was \"instrumental in allowing disco revivalism to emerge, allowing the denigrated gay genre to soar once again within the context of house music, the genre disco became in its second life.\" Sal Cinquemani of the same publication wrote that the song was \"making its impact all the more impressive (it would go on to inspire a glut of pop-house copycats) and begging the question: If disco died a decade earlier, what the fuck was this big, gay, fuscia drag-queen boa of a dance song sitting on top of the charts for a month for?\" According to Tom Breiham of Stereogum, \"Vogue\" was certainly the first number-one house track ever. He added, \"House, like voguing itself, had been a relatively underground club phenomenon a few years earlier, and it had only started to make inroads into the mainstream. As far as this column is concerned, that breakthrough might be the main legacy of 'Vogue'\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States, and of American literature. Poe was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story, and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction. He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. He attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with John Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under an assumed name, he published his first collection, Tamerlane and Other Poems, credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan.\nPoe switched his focus to prose, and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, but she died of tuberculosis in 1847. In January 1845, he published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal The Penn, later renamed The Stylus. But before it began publishing, Poe died in Baltimore in 1849, aged 40, under mysterious circumstances.

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The movie is also an example of a techno-thriller. The American Film Institute named Jurassic Park the 35th-most thrilling film of all time on June 13, 2001. In 2004, Empire magazine judged Jurassic Park the sixth-most influential film in the magazine's lifetime. Empire called the first encounter with a Brachiosaurus the 28th-most magical moment in cinema. In 2008, an Empire poll of readers, filmmakers, and critics also rated it one of the 500 greatest films of all time. On Film Review's 55th anniversary in 2005, it declared the film to be one of the five most important in the magazine's lifetime. In 2006, IGN ranked Jurassic Park as the 19th-greatest film franchise ever. In a 2010 poll, the readers of Entertainment Weekly rated it the greatest summer movie of the previous 20 years.The movie's popularity led the management of the National Basketball Association expansion franchise founded in Toronto in 1995 to adopt the nickname Raptors. In addition, during the team's playoff games, fans watch the game on a large television in a fan area outside the arena that has been nicknamed Jurassic Park. The film has been said to have given rise to a Jurassic Park generation, young people inspired to become paleontologists, and to a surge in discoveries about dinosaurs.Jurassic Park's biggest influence on subsequent films was a result of its breakthrough use of computer-generated imagery. The film is regarded as a landmark for visual effects. Film historian Tom Shone said of the film's innovation and influence, \"in its way, Jurassic Park heralded a revolution in movies as profound as the coming of sound in 1927\". Many filmmakers saw Jurassic Park's effects as a realization that many of their visions, previously thought unfeasible or too expensive, were now possible. ILM owner George Lucas, realizing the success of creating realistic live dinosaurs by his own company, started to make the Star Wars prequels; Stanley Kubrick decided to invest in pet project A.I. Artificial Intelligence, which he later got Spielberg to direct; and Peter Jackson began to re-explore his childhood love of fantasy films, a path that led him to The Lord of the Rings and King Kong. Jurassic Park also inspired films and documentaries with dinosaurs such as the American adaptation of Godzilla, Dinosaur from the Deep, Carnosaur (in which Laura Dern's mother Diane Ladd starred), Dinosaur Island and Walking with Dinosaurs. Stan Winston, enthusiastic about the new technology pioneered by the film, joined with IBM and director James Cameron to form a new special effects company, Digital Domain. In 2018, Jurassic Park was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".It also started a trend of dubbing US films into Hindi for the Indian market and was the highest-grossing US film in India at the time with a gross of $3 million.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_400", "question": "What genre is Need to Believe?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_16369", "text": "Johnson's works, especially his Lives of the Poets series, describe various features of excellent writing. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposely archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.In his smaller poetic works, Johnson relied on short lines and filled his work with a feeling of empathy, which possibly influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and argues that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.When it came to biography, Johnson disagreed with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that could be viewed as tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he writes that a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.\nJohnson's thoughts on biography and on poetry coalesced in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his Dictionary of which he wrote: \"I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style\". Although a smaller edition became the household standard, Johnson's original Dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from what he considered to be the most important literary fields: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the Dictionary so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context.Johnson did not attempt to create schools of theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature. When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: \"If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them\".His works on Shakespeare were devoted not merely to Shakespeare, but to understanding literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including what he saw as lack of morality, vulgarity, carelessness in crafting plots, and occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In Detroit, he was mainly played as a small forward, and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player; Rodman was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally well and won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards. From 1991 on, he established himself as one of the best rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 rebounds per game in six of the next seven years. Playing power forward as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the 1996 NBA Finals: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992. Rodman's rebounding prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by his decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense. Daly said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but deemed him a hard worker and coachable. Rodman's defensive intensity returned while with Chicago.On offense, Rodman's output was mediocre. He averaged 11.6 points per game in his second season, but his average steadily dropped: in the three championship seasons with the Bulls, he averaged five points per game and connected on less than half of his field goal attempts. His free throw shooting (lifetime average: .584) was considered a big liability: on December 29, 1997, Bubba Wells of the Dallas Mavericks committed six intentional fouls against him in only three minutes, setting the record for the fastest foul out in NBA history. The intention was to force him to attempt free throws, which in theory would mean frequent misses and easy ball possession without giving up too many points. However, this plan backfired, as Rodman hit 9 of the 12 attempts. This was Dallas coach Don Nelson's early version of what would later develop into the famous \"Hack-a-Shaq\" method that would be implemented against Shaquille O'Neal, Dwight Howard, and other poor free throw shooters.\nIn 14 NBA seasons, Rodman played in 911 games, scored 6,683 points, and grabbed 11,954 rebounds, translating to 7.3 points and 13.1 rebounds per game in only 31.7 minutes played per game. NBA.com lauds Rodman as \"arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history and one of the most recognized athletes in the world\" but adds \"enigmatic and individualistic, Rodman has caught the public eye for his ever-changing hair color, tattoos and, unorthodox lifestyle\". On the hardwood, he was recognized as one of the most successful defensive players ever, winning the NBA championship five times in six NBA Finals appearances (1989, 1990, 1996\u20131998; only loss 1988), being crowned NBA Defensive Player of the Year twice (1990\u20131991) and making seven NBA All-Defensive First Teams (1989\u20131993, 1995\u20131996) and NBA All-Defensive Second Teams (1994). He additionally made two All-NBA Third Teams (1992, 1995), two NBA All-Star Teams (1990, 1992) and won seven straight rebounding crowns (1992\u20131998) and finally led the league once in field goal percentage (1989).Rodman was recognized as the prototype bizarre player, stunning basketball fans with his artificial hair colors, numerous tattoos and body piercings, multiple verbal and physical assaults on officials, frequent ejections, and his tumultuous private life. He was ranked No. 48 on the 2009 revision of SLAM Magazine's Top 50 Players of All-Time. In 2021, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary The Athletic ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Rodman as the 62nd greatest player in NBA history. Metta World Peace played one year with the 91 jersey number in homage to Rodman, who he described as a player who he liked \"on the court as a hustler, not when he kicked the cameraman.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community, instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy. It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies. The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. The Thing focuses on being unable to trust one's peers, but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions.Developed in an era of cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction. Diabolique's Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that preferring annihilation to defeat is a recurring motif, both in MacReady's destruction of the chess computer after being checkmated and his vow to destroy the Thing even at the expense of the team. Clarkson Fisher and Screen Rant's Michael Edward Taylor see the team's accusatory distrust and fear of assimilation as an expression of the American Red Scare of the 1950s and 1960s, while Taylor also sees a commentary on the isolationism of the me generation in the 1970s. Slant Magazine's John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-Vietnam War (1955\u20131975) \"fatigued counterculturalism\" \u2013 the rejection of conventional social norms, each defined by their own eccentricities.\nThe Atlantic's Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, women are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual.

Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure. Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other.Nerdist's Kyle Anderson and Strange Horizons's Orrin Grey analyzed The Thing as an example of author H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror. Anderson's analysis includes the idea of cosmic horror in large part coming \"from the fear of being overtaken,\" connecting it to Lovecraft's xenophobia and Blair's character arc of becoming what he most fears. In contrast, Anderson compares Blair to MacReady, who represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist. Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self, using Blair's character as an example. Discussing The Thing in the context of the first of three films in Carpenter's \"Apocalypse Trilogy\", Grey states the threat the monster poses to the world \"is less disconcerting than the threat posed to the individual concept of self.\"The Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal. Den of Geek's Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over. In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe The Thing as \"pro-science\" like Who Goes There? or \"anti-science\" like The Thing from Another World, Carpenter chose \"pro-human\", stating, \"It's better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who's not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon.\" Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the epidemic of HIV at the time, which could be identified only by a blood test.Since its release, many theories have been developed to attempt to answer the film's ambiguous ending shared by MacReady and Childs. Several suggest that Childs was infected, citing Dean Cundey's statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of uninfected characters, something absent from Childs. Similarly, others have noted a lack of visible breath from the character in the frigid air. While both aspects are present in MacReady, their absence in Childs has been explained as a technical issue with the filming. During production, Carpenter considered having MacReady be infected, and an alternate ending showed MacReady having been rescued and definitively tested as uninfected. Russell has said that analyzing the scene for clues is \"missing the point\". He continued, \"[Carpenter] and I worked on the ending of that movie together a long time. We were both bringing the audience right back to square one. At the end of the day, that was the position these people were in. They just didn't know anything ... They didn't know if they knew who they were ... I love that, over the years, that movie has gotten its due because people were able to get past the horrificness of the monster ... to see what the movie was about, which was paranoia.\" However, Carpenter has teased, \"Now, I do know, in the end, who the Thing is, but I cannot tell you.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Reese remained there for eight weeks. Although her roots were in gospel music, she now was being exposed to and influenced by such jazz artists as Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday. In 1953, she signed a recording contract with Jubilee Records, for which she recorded six albums. Later that year, she also joined the Hawkins Orchestra. Her first recordings for Jubilee were songs such as \"In the Still of the Night\" (originally published in 1937), \"I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm\" and \"Time After Time\" (1947). The songs were later included on the album And That Reminds Me (1959).\nIn 1957, Reese released a single called \"And That Reminds Me\". After years of performing, she gained chart success with this song. It became a Top Twenty pop hit and a million-seller record. That year, Reese was voted by Billboard, Cashbox and various other magazines, as \"The Most Promising Singer\". In 1959, Reese moved to RCA Records and released her first RCA single, called \"Don't You Know?\", which was adapted from Giacomo Puccini's music for La boh\u00e8me, specifically the aria \"Quando m'en vo'\" (Musetta's Waltz). It became her biggest hit to date, reaching the number 2 spot on the pop charts and topping the R&B charts (then called the \"Hot R&B Sides\") that year. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Eventually, the song came to be widely considered the signature song of her early career. She then released a successful follow-up single called \"Not One Minute More\" (number 16). She remained on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with \"And Now\" (number 69). In 1960 she released \"Someday (You'll Want Me to Want You)\" (number 56), which was drawn from her Grammy-nominated album Della \u2013 a big band outing arranged by Neal Hefti who incorporated some arrangement ideas conceived by Reese, who was not credited as co-arranger.In November 1960, Reese appeared in advertisements in Ebony magazine for the newly launched AMI Continental jukebox. Reese recorded regularly throughout the 1960s, releasing singles and several albums. Two of the most significant were The Classic Della (1962) and Waltz with Me, Della (1963), which broadened her fan base internationally. She recorded several jazz-focused albums, including Della Reese Live (1966), On Strings of Blue (1967) and One of a Kind (1978). Live hit number 21 on the R&B charts. She also performed in Las Vegas for nine years, and toured across the country. She signed with Avco Embassy Records and released the soul-pop album Black is Beautiful in 1970, charting at number 44 on the R&B chart.In 1986, Reese formed the gospel group Brilliance with fellow singers O.C. Smith, Mary Clayton, Vermettya Royster, and Eric Strom. They released an album that  earned Reese a Grammy nomination in the gospel category for the song \"You Gave Me Love\" (1987). She later earned another nomination for the album Live! My Soul Feels Better Right Now (1998).Motown singer Martha Reeves cites Reese as a major influence, and says she named her group the Vandellas after Van Dyke Street in Detroit and Della Reese.

The story begins during the Third Reich. A crew of Wehrmacht soldiers is driving a cargo truck through the Black Forest when they are stopped by a road block of SS commandos. The SS hijack the truck and its cargo killing its passengers. Thirty-four years later, Harry Morgan is driving his Rolls-Royce home in London, where a repossession agent is waiting to confiscate the car. Harry gives the agent the keys, as Harry boasts that he will soon own another one. He enters his family's apartment, where he has a brief conversation with his wife, Meredith (Lorna Dallas), about their debts and the building that is soon to be sold. As he looks through the bills, he finds a letter addressed to him from someone in his past, requesting to meet with him.\nThe following day, Harry meets Ernst Furben at the London Embassy Hotel. Ernst invites Harry to his hotel room, where they reminisce about the past, and Ernst brings up the story about the cargo. According to his story, he received an order for two guards, a heavy truck and a driver. The truck was assigned to collect a cargo from a railroad yard and deliver it to the Reich Bank. The driver, named Hans Schmidt, presented the order to the railroad official in charge to receive the cargo that was intercepted by a convoy of SS officers. They presented Schmidt with an order signed by a Nazi Party official to transport the cargo from the Balkans. Schmidt noticed the contents of gold bars when one of the crates was dropped. Schmidt was shipped out to the Eastern Front, where he was captured, and remained in prison until the year 1955. Twenty years later, Schmidt met Ernst again, and told him the story about the gold bars. During the war, an order could be countermanded by Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann G\u00f6ring, Martin Bormann, Rudolf Hess, or Reinhardt Holtz. Schmidt confirmed that Reinhardt Holtz was the Nazi party official who signed the transfer order. Ernst proposes that he and Harry join forces to release Holtz, to find out the location of the gold. After some discussion about a fellow inmate of the concentration camp, named Sergeant Prior, they discuss tentative ideas for releasing Holtz.\nA few days later, Harry travels to Amsterdam to find Sly playing chess with a Dutch teenage boy in a pub. Sly forfeits the game, and speaks to Harry, who tells him about the gold worth six million dollars. Sly initially refuses, but hears Harry out and agrees to the heist. Harry talks Sly into paying for two tickets to West Berlin, where they meet Ernst. They drive by Seigfried prison (where Holtz is an inmate) on the way to an expensive Berlin hotel, where Harry is ringing up an expensive tab for Ernst to pay. Harry goes to the store of Peter Dohlberg to ask him to finance the heist. Peter agrees to the heist for 15% of it. Harry reluctantly agrees, knowing he has no other options. Peter's employee, named Siggi, brings her friend Erika Kurtz (Doris Kunstmann) to meet Harry. They arrange to have Udo Blimperman (Peter Schlesinger), an obese costume shop owner, give them the uniforms they need, in exchange for unlimited meals. Later that evening, Udo gets drunk and crashes through a table.\nHarry introduces Sly to Erika and Udo. Erika confirms that Udo will recover. The next morning, Harry wakes up to find that Sly and Erika had been playing chess all night, and that Udo had ordered another large meal for himself. Harry and Ernst meet Schmidt at a carnival to discuss his part in the heist. Harry meets Prior, who is now a prison sergeant at Seigfried prison. Harry mentions the scheme to the rest of the group at a hotel. Prior tells everyone about the security procedures at the prison, where the only man to speak to Holtz is a doctor named Maar. Prior offers to allow them to interrogate Holtz in his cell, but Sly says it will not work, stating that Holtz will not disclose the information to anyone outside the Nazi party. Sly informs Schmidt about his idea to stage a confidence game to trick Holtz, and use Erika as an assistant. When Ernst begins to object, Sly reassures him that his idea will not cost him his share.\nSly has fallen in love with Erika, and they go on a walk together to discuss more details about the heist. They find an abandoned courthouse, which they pick the lock on, and decide to use it for their confidence game on Holtz. They purchase furnishings for the scheme, while Harry and Ernst purchase a used car to repaint as a United States Army staff car. Back at the hotel, Prior sets up a model of the prison to show where Holtz's cell is located. Ernst and Sly purchase a camera to photograph Maar with a transsexual named Pauli. Maar is blackmailed by Schmidt and Ernst, claiming that Pauli was Ernst's nephew. Knowing the police will not believe him, Maar agrees to switch places with Holtz, while Harry and Sly accompany them, disguised as United States Army officers. Holtz is drugged with a sedative, while Sly distracts the cell block guard with a ruse about a filthy cell, and orders him to clean it up. Prior relocks the door with the key that has been inadvertently left in the cell door and returns it to the guard, while Harry and Sly leave with Holtz, who is barely conscious enough to walk escorted. Harry makes up a cover story that Holtz needs to be seen by a dental surgeon the next day for an infection. Prior collaborates to ensure that no one else will see Holtz to ensure that no one else knows the surgeons identity, who is actually Ernst. Harry rebukes Prior for not having his name on the visitor's log as part of a ruse.\nThey pick up Erika from work to change Holtz's appearance to make him look younger. As they arrive at the derelict courthouse, they change Holtz from Maar's borrowed civilian street clothes into a replica of his old Nazi uniform. Holtz is escorted into a courtroom furnished to look like a Third Reich office. Once inside the sedative wears off, he awakens to find himself in a staged meeting, with Schmidt disguised as Adolf Hitler, Sly disguised as an SS officer, and Ernst disguised as a Field Marshal. Schmidt states that Holtz stole the gold from the Reich and betrayed him. Holtz is confused about what Schmidt is referring to and asks what gold was stolen. Schmidt tells Holtz that the gold disappeared only seven days ago, and confirms that Holtz signed the order to have it deposited into the Reich Bank. Ernst escorts Holtz into another room to refresh his memory. Sly and Schmidt congratulate each other on their performances, while Ernst tells Holtz that Germany is winning the war and Holtz has been hospitalised. Holtz remembers that the gold was hidden to prevent Hermann G\u00f6ring from stealing it. He will only tell Hitler the exact location, though. Holtz whispers to Schmidt (still disguised as Hitler) that the gold is hidden in his bunker, which is on the property of his summer home in Vanglitz. Holtz is given another sedative, while Schmidt admires a portrait of Hitler, comparing his likeness to it. Sly congratulates Schmidt, and Harry sarcastically says that they should do a double act with himself as Benito Mussolini. Schmidt gets carried away with his acting, while Ernst is worried Holtz may recognize the scam, and that their cover can still be blown by him reporting the incident to the prison guards. Sly proposes to return Holtz first thing in the morning before going after the gold, but Harry refuses to wait, worried that it could be found by anyone at any time.\nThey cross the border into East Germany and everything goes well, despite Schmidt becoming nervous. They arrive at the summer home, to find that the bomb shelter has been built over by an apartment building. Further examination of one of the basement rooms reveals that the bunker is directly below, separated by three feet of concrete. Ernst contacts Wilhelm Schlager to arrange to get cooperation from the Soviet police garrison. Schlager insists on 1/8% of the heist for his inconvenience. He steps into another room and conceals a Walther PPK in his belt, while he calls Colonel Kosnikov of the Russian army. He plans for them to double cross the group, to get a two-way split for himself and Kosnikov. Kosnikov arrives with Soviet soldiers army, surrounds the house, and kills Schlager. Sly notices and secretly retrieves Schlager's handgun. Kosnikov demands a share for allowing them to stage a bomb threat to get access to the bunker. He reroutes his troops to the apartment building, and provides the group with equipment to impersonate a bomb disposal unit.\nThe army evacuates the residents, so that they can begin drilling through the concrete floor. A boy wanders into the room where the dynamite is placed for the explosion. The boy is discovered at the last moment and safely removed before the explosion. Ernst announces that another bomb has been discovered, as a diversion to allow them to enter the hole leading to the bunker. Searching the bunker, the group finds two steel chests containing the gold behind a partition. Sly breaks the locks with a hammer and a chisel as the group admires their loot. After the gold is retrieved, Kosnikov shows up alone to intercept the group, armed with a machine gun. He tries to blackmail them and take all of the gold. As Schmidt pleads for their lives, Harry pins Kosnikov with a ladder. Kosnikov then shoots and kills Schmidt, after which Sly kills Kosnikov with Schlager's pistol. When the team returns to West Germany, they are confronted by the checkpoint guard about their flags on the wrong sides of the car's hood. The checkpoint guard puts the flags on correctly and allows them to leave. They throw Schmidt's body into a river.\nThey pick up Erika, as well as Holtz, who is still sedated. They turn the gold over to Peter to have it divided up and converted from bullion to United States dollars. En route to the prison, they are forced to deal with a truck with toppled pallets blocking the road. They use the pallets to create a ramp to jump over the cargo truck and proceed to the prison. Returning to the prison, they are confronted by the United States Army colonel in charge of Seigfried, who demands an explanation about the unauthorized personnel at the prison. Harry cons their way out of the situation to allow Ernst access as the dental surgeon. Maar and Holtz are switched back to their proper places. Holtz wakes up in his cell to tell the guard that he believes he saw Hitler. As they leave the prison, Harry asks Ernst if he ever was really a Nazi. Ernst replies \"Not necessarily.\" After they abandon the staff car, Harry, Ernst and Sly walk away on the streets of Berlin.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference to and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music\u2014exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka\u2014as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instruments such as harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments, such as the sitar and slide guitar, in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs. According to biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the Stones \"pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock & roll that came to define hard rock with a \"strong yet subtly swinging rhythm\" provided by Wyman and Watts.Jagger and Richards had a shared admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. Little Walter influenced Brian Jones. Richards recalls, \"He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's all the same shit, man, and you can do it.'\" Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair, stating in 2003, \"Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four.\" Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R&B artists, said it \"seemed the most real thing\" he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the \"most powerful music [he had] ever heard ... the most expressive\". He also recalled, \"when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters\u2014and there were a lot of us\u2014in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, [it was] very ... heartwarming\".Despite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live set lists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. Critic Richie Unterberger described the first Jagger/Richards single, \"Tell Me (You're Coming Back)\", as a \"pop rock ballad ... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers\". \"As Tears Go By\", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, \"It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn't think of [recording] it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group.\" The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.Richards said of their early writing experiences, \"The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try ...'\" Jagger opined, \"We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order ... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us.\"\nThe writing of \"The Last Time\", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it \"a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.\" The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.Beginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the \"ancient art of weaving\" responsible for part of their sound\u2014the interplay between two guitarists on stage. Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's. Likewise, Watts was primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming. The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards, and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes for a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills. In the studio the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on Beggars Banquet are driven by Nicky Hopkins' piano playing. On Exile on Main St., Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.Richards started using open tunings for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a capo), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Brown Sugar\" (Sticky Fingers, 1971), \"Tumbling Dice\" (capo IV), \"Happy\" (capo IV), (Exile on Main St., 1972), and \"Start Me Up\" (Tattoo You, 1981).The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict, resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years. When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision-making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like having his authority diminished. This led to the period Richards has referred to as \"World War III\". Of making albums with the Stones, Richards referred to it in 2023 as \"controlled madness. Mick is the controller and I'm the madness.\"Musical collaboration between members of the band and supporting musicians was key, due to the fluid lineups typically experienced by the band in the studio, as tracks tended to be recorded \"by whatever members of the group happened to be around at the time of the sessions\". Over time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the Telegraph, \"changed music\" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry.\nStephen Hyden writes:The Rolling Stones turn 50 next year, an unprecedented milestone for a rock group and confirmation of an obvious truism: Nobody survives like the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. Starting out as a purist blues combo that fronted a bad-boy image while recording the occasional Lennon/McCartney pop tune and string-laden ballad to help secure their popularity, the Stones deftly moved through a number of guises in the '60s and '70s while remaining essentially the same band at its core. When arena-rock reigned, the Stones became an excessive live act whose decadence was on par with Led Zeppelin; when David Bowie and glam became the hippest thing in England, Mick Jagger lathered on the mascara and campy posturing. By the time of 1978's Some Girls, the Stones absorbed the energy of New York City's punk and disco scenes so completely that it reinvigorated the band's career, spawning their final (to date) No. 1 single in the U.S., \"Miss You.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

By 2002, Hamasaki had earned the nickname \"Empress of J-pop\" due to her popularity in Japan and throughout Asia, as well as being referred to as \"the voice of the lost generation\". Due to her success and relevance throughout her career, she is considered one of the top solo female artists of the Heisei era for her influence on the music industry and various fashion trends.Born and raised in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Hamasaki moved to Tokyo at 14 in 1993 to pursue a career in singing and acting. In 1998, Hamasaki released her debut single \"Poker Face\" and debut major-label album A Song for \u00d7\u00d7. The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks, selling over a million copies. This rapid rise to fame is typically attributed to her insightful style of lyric-writing in contrast to her young age; this would continue to be a defining aspect of her work, listeners praising her poetic way of conveying relatable subjects. Her next ten albums shipped over a million copies in Japan, with her third, Duty, selling nearly three million. A Best, her first compilation album, further established her position as a crowning artist with more than four million copies sold in Japan. It was at this time that she represented more than 40% of her record label's income.After A Best, Hamasaki went on to experiment with her music style and lyricism, incorporating English into her work from Rainbow onwards. Later albums would range from electronic dream-pop to rock genres, with Hamasaki herself saying she does not feel tied to follow music trends, instead focusing on what she enjoys and wants to create \"whether it is trendy or not\". This perspective would continue to resonate with the public throughout her career, with her albums consistently placing in the top ten of the Oricon charts to present day; she currently holds the record for the most albums to place in the top ten by a female artist in Japan, with 54 of her releases reaching that distinction.Hamasaki has sold over 50.70 million units in Japan, making her the best-selling Japanese solo artist in history. Hamasaki has several domestic record achievements for her singles, such as the most number-one hits by a female artist (38); the most consecutive number-one hits by a solo artist (25), and the most million-sellers. From 1999 to 2010, Hamasaki had at least two singles each year topping the charts. Hamasaki is also the first female recording artist to have ten studio albums since her debut to top the Oricon, and the first artist to have a number-one album for 13 consecutive years since her debut.

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds (Museum Bredius, The Hague).  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format.\n\nThe influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time.\nThe traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings.\nWhile his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer.Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples. This series of engravings had an important influence on the Dutch animal painter Paulus Potter, in particular the way in which van Laer was able to place figures, animals, buildings and trees in a coherent pictorial space.  A second set of 6 plates was entitled Horses and depicts the bleak lot of horses belonging to poor peasants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to Hellman, production had to shut down for half a day when Oates refused to speak a lengthy amount of dialogue in the way Hellman wanted, preferring instead to whisper the lines almost unintelligibly. Oates stormed away from the film crew in anger when the director insisted.

Although Perkins enjoyed working on both of Hellman's Westerns, and became good friends with Warren Oates, she was dismayed that Hellman insisted on such realism that he allowed only the most minimal of makeup to be applied to the actors. She felt she was constantly filmed in an unflattering manner.\nJack Nicholson as Billy Spear: This was the young actor's 13th film appearance, and his fourth with director Hellman.

Rising from rags to riches, Eminem's anger-fueled music represented widespread angst and the reality of American underclass. He has been greatly influential for artists of various genres.\nStephen Hill, the then vice president of African American-themed television network BET (Black Entertainment Television), said in 2002:Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than average, had to be the best, to be accepted ... he is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best lyricist, alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem.\nIn 2002, the BBC said that the perception of Eminem as a \"modern-day William Shakespeare\" was comparable to the reception of American singer Bob Dylan: \"Not since Bob Dylan's heyday in the mid-1960s has an artist's output been subjected to such intense academic scrutiny as an exercise in contemporary soul-searching. US critics point to [Eminem's] vivid portraits of disenfranchised lives \u2013 using the stark, direct language of the street \u2013 as an accurate reflection of social injustice.\" In addition, the BBC highlighted that, \"Where parents once recoiled in horror [to his music], there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young, angry white underclass.\" Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was \"the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.... he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation.\"Writing for Spin in 2002, rock critic Alan Light compared Eminem to the Beatles' John Lennon:\n\nEminem is even starting to bear a resemblance to one of those rock icons ... Marshall Mathers is becoming something like this generation's John Lennon ... Lennon and Eminem were both subjects of pickets and protests; they both wrote songs about troubled relationships with their mothers; they both wrote about their strange public lives with their wives; they both wrote about how much they loved their kids. Lennon, of course, was able to find ways to use his voice to advocate for peace rather than just blasting away at litigious family members and various pop stars, but still, few other pop musicians since Lennon have found a way to render their private psychodramas into compelling art as effectively as Eminem.\nRegarding his rehearsal with Eminem for the \"Stan\" duet at the 2001 Grammy Awards, English singer Elton John said, \"[When] Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, 'Fuck, this man is amazing.' There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time \u2014 only the greats.\" John further praised Eminem, saying, \"Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we'll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he's one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what [Bob] Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out.\"Concerning the controversy surrounding Eminem due to his transgressive music, American entertainer Madonna had said, \"I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect ... He's stirring things up, he's provoking a discussion, he's making people's blood boil. He's reflecting what's going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do.\" American musician Stevie Wonder also said, \"Rap to me is a modern blues \u2013 a statement of how and where people are at ... I think art is a reflection of our society, and people don't like to confront the realities in society ... But until we really confront the truth, we are going to have a Tupac or Eminem or Biggie Smalls to remind us about it \u2013 and thank God.

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Halloween III is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist, Michael Myers. After the film's disappointing reception and box office performance, Michael Myers was brought back six years later in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988).\nThe film departs from the slasher genre of the other installments, instead featuring a \"witchcraft\" theme with science fiction aspects. John Carpenter and Debra Hill believed that the Halloween series could have been an anthology series of films that centered around Halloween night, with each sequel containing its own characters, setting, and storyline. Director Wallace stated there were many ideas for Halloween-themed films, some of which could have potentially created any number of their own sequels, and that Season of the Witch was meant to be the first.As with the series' other films, suspense and tension are key themes, exploring violence against young children. On a budget of $4.6 million, Halloween III made a profit by grossing $14.4 million at the box office in the US, but it was also the poorest performing film in the Halloween series at the time.

{"id": "91_461", "question": "What genre is Live in London?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_16369", "text": "Johnson's works, especially his Lives of the Poets series, describe various features of excellent writing. He believed that the best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposely archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest complaint was that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.In his smaller poetic works, Johnson relied on short lines and filled his work with a feeling of empathy, which possibly influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and argues that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.When it came to biography, Johnson disagreed with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that could be viewed as tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he writes that a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.\nJohnson's thoughts on biography and on poetry coalesced in his understanding of what would make a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his Dictionary of which he wrote: \"I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, for the use of such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style\". Although a smaller edition became the household standard, Johnson's original Dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from what he considered to be the most important literary fields: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the Dictionary so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context.Johnson did not attempt to create schools of theories to analyse the aesthetics of literature. Instead, he used his criticism for the practical purpose of helping others to better read and understand literature. When it came to Shakespeare's plays, Johnson emphasised the role of the reader in understanding language: \"If Shakespeare has difficulties above other writers, it is to be imputed to the nature of his work, which required the use of common colloquial language, and consequently admitted many phrases allusive, elliptical, and proverbial, such as we speak and hear every hour without observing them\".His works on Shakespeare were devoted not merely to Shakespeare, but to understanding literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including what he saw as lack of morality, vulgarity, carelessness in crafting plots, and occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:\nIt's exactly what I had hoped. We all end up with a sense of a new beginning and the audience has a sense that it's a new chapter in the lives of all these characters. \nNBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of Dateline NBC, one of which ran for two hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before the airing of the episode. Following the finale, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was filmed on the set of the Friends' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2 million for 30 seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the Seinfeld finale at $1.7 million.In the U.S., 52.5 million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the Seinfeld finale in 1998. The finale was the fifth most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of M*A*S*H, Cheers, The Fugitive, and Seinfeld, which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4, 78.0 and 76.3 million viewers. The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36 million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl. Following the finales of Friends and Frasier, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre, and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_481", "question": "What genre is The Rolling Stones?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_38724", "text": "The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres into their own collective sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference to and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music\u2014exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka\u2014as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instruments such as harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments, such as the sitar and slide guitar, in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs. According to biographer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the Stones \"pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock & roll that came to define hard rock with a \"strong yet subtly swinging rhythm\" provided by Wyman and Watts.Jagger and Richards had a shared admiration of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters, and Howlin' Wolf. Little Walter influenced Brian Jones. Richards recalls, \"He was more into T-Bone Walker and jazz blues stuff. We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's all the same shit, man, and you can do it.'\" Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz drummer, was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair, stating in 2003, \"Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer, playing swing, with a straight four.\" Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major American R&B artists, said it \"seemed the most real thing\" he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the \"most powerful music [he had] ever heard ... the most expressive\". He also recalled, \"when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters\u2014and there were a lot of us\u2014in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, [it was] very ... heartwarming\".Despite the Rolling Stones' predilection for blues and R&B numbers on their early live set lists, the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide-ranging interest. Critic Richie Unterberger described the first Jagger/Richards single, \"Tell Me (You're Coming Back)\", as a \"pop rock ballad ... When [Jagger and Richards] began to write songs, they were usually not derived from the blues, but were often surprisingly fey, slow, Mersey-type pop numbers\". \"As Tears Go By\", the ballad originally written for Marianne Faithfull, was one of the first songs written by Jagger and Richards and one of many written by the duo for other artists. Jagger said of the song, \"It's a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time. And we didn't think of [recording] it, because the Rolling Stones were a butch blues group.\" The Rolling Stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the US.Richards said of their early writing experiences, \"The amazing thing is that although Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to Andrew [Loog Oldham], 'Well, at least we gave it a try ...'\" Jagger opined, \"We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order ... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us.\"\nThe writing of \"The Last Time\", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it \"a bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It gave us a level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it.\" The song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.Beginning with Jones and continuing with Wood, the Rolling Stones have developed what Richards refers to as the \"ancient art of weaving\" responsible for part of their sound\u2014the interplay between two guitarists on stage. Unlike most bands, the Stones follow Richards' lead rather than the drummer's. Likewise, Watts was primarily a jazz player who was able to bring that genre's influences to the style of the band's drumming. The following of Richards' lead has led to conflicts between Jagger and Richards, and they have been known to annoy one another, but they have both agreed it makes for a better record; Watts in particular has praised Jagger's production skills. In the studio the band have tended to use a fluid personnel for recordings and not use the same players for each song. Guest pianists were commonplace on recordings; several songs on Beggars Banquet are driven by Nicky Hopkins' piano playing. On Exile on Main St., Richards plays bass on three tracks while Taylor plays on four.Richards started using open tunings for rhythm parts (often in conjunction with a capo), most prominently an open-E or open-D tuning in 1968. Beginning in 1969, he often used 5-string open-G tuning (with the lower 6th string removed), as heard on the 1969 single \"Honky Tonk Women\", \"Brown Sugar\" (Sticky Fingers, 1971), \"Tumbling Dice\" (capo IV), \"Happy\" (capo IV), (Exile on Main St., 1972), and \"Start Me Up\" (Tattoo You, 1981).The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin addict, resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years. When Richards got himself off heroin and became more present in decision-making, Jagger was not used to it and did not like having his authority diminished. This led to the period Richards has referred to as \"World War III\". Of making albums with the Stones, Richards referred to it in 2023 as \"controlled madness. Mick is the controller and I'm the madness.\"Musical collaboration between members of the band and supporting musicians was key, due to the fluid lineups typically experienced by the band in the studio, as tracks tended to be recorded \"by whatever members of the group happened to be around at the time of the sessions\". Over time, Jagger has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of the Telegraph, \"changed music\" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music industry.\nStephen Hyden writes:The Rolling Stones turn 50 next year, an unprecedented milestone for a rock group and confirmation of an obvious truism: Nobody survives like the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band. Starting out as a purist blues combo that fronted a bad-boy image while recording the occasional Lennon/McCartney pop tune and string-laden ballad to help secure their popularity, the Stones deftly moved through a number of guises in the '60s and '70s while remaining essentially the same band at its core. When arena-rock reigned, the Stones became an excessive live act whose decadence was on par with Led Zeppelin; when David Bowie and glam became the hippest thing in England, Mick Jagger lathered on the mascara and campy posturing. By the time of 1978's Some Girls, the Stones absorbed the energy of New York City's punk and disco scenes so completely that it reinvigorated the band's career, spawning their final (to date) No. 1 single in the U.S., \"Miss You.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The singer credited this to her mixed ethnicity, saying \"I am a fusion. That's my persona. I'm a fusion between black and white, between pop and rock, between cultures - between my Lebanese father and my mother's Spanish blood, the Colombian folklore and Arab dance I love and American music.\" Arabian and Middle Eastern elements, which had a high influence on D\u00f3nde Est\u00e1n los Ladrones?, are also present in Laundry Service, most prominently on \"Eyes Like Yours\" (Ojos As\u00ed). Musical styles from different South American countries surface on the album. Tango, a style of fast-paced ballroom dance that originated in Argentina, is evident on \"Objection (Tango)\", which also combines elements of rock and roll. The uptempo track features a guitar solo and a bridge in which Shakira delivers rap-like vocals. \"Whenever, Wherever\" blends pop rock with Andean music and contains instrumentation from panpipes and the charango - traditional instruments generally associated with the genre.A few songs are also influenced by dance-based genres; the \"feisty\" \"Rules\" is laced with new wave and \"Ready for the Good Times\" is inspired by disco music. The power ballad \"Underneath Your Clothes\" has Shakira delivering \"racked\" vocals and features brass instrumentation influenced by English rock band The Beatles. It contains a melody similar to the one in \"Eternal Flame\", a 1989 song by American all-female band The Bangles. Similarly, the tune of \"The One\", another power ballad on the album, is similar to that of \"Michelle\", a 1965 song by The Beatles. \"Fool\" and \"Poem to a Horse\" are more directly influenced by rock music. The former received comparisons to the work of Alanis Morissette while the latter also displays indie elements and contains instrumentation from a soul music-styled horn section and guitar riffs similar to the one present in songs by American grunge band Nirvana. Laundry Service also contains four Spanish tracks: \"Que Me Quedes T\u00fa\" (\"That You Remain With Me\"), \"Te Dejo Madrid\" (\"I Leave You Madrid\"), \"Suerte\" (\"Luck\") and \"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\" (\"I'm Warning You, I'm Announcing to You\"); the latter two are Spanish translations of \"Whenever, Wherever\" and \"Objection (Tango)\", respectively.The lyrics of most songs in Laundry Service are based on issues and themes related to love, as they had been written after Shakira began a relationship Antonio de la R\u00faa, the son of former Argentine president Fernando de la R\u00faa. \"Underneath Your Clothes\" is an \"ode\" to the positivity one gains when pursuing a relationship with a good person. Shakira shows an \"important side\" in \"The One\", which is a song about how \"you love your guy so much that you're actually going to learn to cook\" and contains lines like \"To buy more thongs and write more happy songs, it always takes a little help from someone.\" In \"Rules\", she aims to make her lover realise that he is \"condemned\" to her and lists \"all the things your new boy can do.\" Songs like \"Objection (Tango)\" and \"Fool\" also deal with issues related to love but in a different manner. The former is dramatic and humorous in approach as Shakira commands her partner to end a love triangle and choose between her and the other lady; it was described as a \"hell-hath-no-fury it's-her-or-me steam train.\" In the song, Shakira asserts that \"Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal/That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible\", which a reviewer commented was a \"brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers  [sic].\" \"Fool\" discusses how Shakira continues to try to build up a relationship with a \"shitty, self-absorbed man\" even after suffering a \"soul-crushing defeat.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The latter idea spread across the English-speaking world and remains in place today in most teaching hospitals. Through this system, physicians in training make up much of a teaching hospital's medical staff. The success of his residency system depended, in large part, on its pyramidal structure with many interns, fewer assistant residents and a single chief resident, who originally occupied that position for years. While at Hopkins, Osler established the full-time, sleep-in residency system whereby staff physicians lived in the administration building of the hospital. As established, the residency was open-ended, and long tenure was the rule. Physicians spent as long as seven or eight years as residents, during which time they led a restricted, almost monastic life.\nHe wrote in an essay \"Books and Men\" that \"He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all.\" His best-known saying was \"Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis\", which emphasises the importance of taking a good history.The contribution to medical education of which he was proudest was his idea of clinical clerkship \u2013 having third- and fourth-year students work with patients on the wards. He pioneered the practice of bedside teaching, making rounds with a handful of students, demonstrating what one student referred to as his method of \"incomparably thorough physical examination.\" Soon after arriving in Baltimore, Osler insisted that his medical students attend at bedside early in their training. By their third year they were taking patient histories, performing physicals and doing lab tests examining secretions, blood and excreta.\n\nHe reduced the role of didactic lectures and once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, \"He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching.\" He also said, \"I desire no other epitaph \u2026 than the statement that I taught medical students in the wards, as I regard this as by far the most useful and important work I have been called upon to do.\"  Osler fundamentally changed medical teaching in North America, and this influence, helped by a few such as the Dutch internist P. K. Pel, spread to medical schools across the globe.\nOsler was a prolific author and a great collector of books and other material relevant to the history of medicine. He willed his library to the Faculty of Medicine of McGill University where it now forms the nucleus of McGill University's Osler Library of the History of Medicine. Osler was a strong supporter of libraries and served on the library committees at most of the universities at which he taught and was a member of the Board of Curators of the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He was instrumental in founding the Medical Library Association in North America, alongside employee and mentee Marcia Croker Noyes, and served as its second president from 1901 to 1904. In Britain he was the first (and only) president of the Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland and also a president of the Bibliographical Society of London (1913).Osler was a prolific author and public speaker and his public speaking and writing were both done in a clear, lucid style. His most famous work, The Principles and Practice of Medicine quickly became a key text to students and clinicians alike. It continued to be published in many editions until 2001 and was translated into many languages. It is notable in part for supporting the use of bloodletting as recently as 1923. Though his own textbook was a major influence in medicine for many years, Osler described Avicenna as the \"author of the most famous medical textbook ever written\". He noted that Avicenna's Canon of Medicine remained \"a medical bible for a longer time than any other work\". Osler's essays were important guides to physicians. The title of his most famous essay, \"Aequanimitas\", espousing the importance of imperturbability, is the motto on the Osler family crest and is used on the Osler housestaff tie and scarf at Hopkins.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is known for his orchestral music such as the Brandenburg Concertos; solo instrumental works such as the cello suites and sonatas and partitas for solo violin; keyboard works such as the Goldberg Variations and The Well-Tempered Clavier; organ works such as the Schubler Chorales and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and choral works such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival, he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician, Johann Ambrosius, in Eisenach. After being orphaned at the age of 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph, after which he continued his musical education in L\u00fcneburg. From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and K\u00f6then, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. From 1723, he was employed as Thomaskantor (cantor at St Thomas's) in Leipzig. There he composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city, and for its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726, he published some of his keyboard and organ music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus III of Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life, he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after a botched eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65.\nBach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic, and motivic organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He often adopted Lutheran hymns, not only in his larger vocal works, but for instance also in his four-part chorales and his sacred songs. He wrote extensively for organ and for other keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for instance for violin and for harpsichord, and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of his works employ contrapuntal techniques like canon and fugue.\nThroughout the 18th century, Bach was primarily valued as an organist, while his keyboard music, such as The Well-Tempered Clavier, was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century saw the publication of some major Bach biographies, and by the end of that century all of his known music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through periodicals (and later also websites) exclusively devoted to him, and other publications such as the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works) and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including the Air on the G String and \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\", and of recordings, such as three different box sets with complete performances of the composer's oeuvre marking the 250th anniversary of his death.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The group specialises in killing their victims using elaborate schemes that mask the murders as if they were accidents. Uncle (Stanley Fung), one of the team members, accidentally leaves a cigarette butt at the crime scene, and it is found by the Brain. After an argument, Uncle vows to quit smoking afterwards.\nThe team then gets a job from a son that wants to kill his own father, likely for insurance money. They plan an accident to kill their target via electrocution, but the plan requires for it be to raining at a specific time. The team tries to execute their plan many times but fail due to the rain falling later than necessary.

He trails the son to an insurance company the next day. The Brain sees the son arguing with an insurance agent (Richie Jen) over what appears to be money, leading the Brain to suspect that the insurance agent was behind the bus accident. The Brain rents a flat on the floor directly below the insurance agent's flat, and begins to perform secret surveillance on the agent.\nOne day, the Brain trails the client to find the Woman (Michelle Ye) picking up the payment for the job at a parking garage. However, only Fatty and the Brain should have known about the pick-up. The Woman explains to the Brain that Fatty had told her about the client, but the Brain, suspecting her betrayal, kills her and takes the money.

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say.

Although it is impossible to verify the truth of this statement, there is every reason to believe that Lully was in a hurry when writing this opera.  In effect, the opera reuses the interm\u00e8des from Moli\u00e8re's play.  Since these interm\u00e8des had met with such spectacular success seven years earlier, Lully must have felt that given his lack of time, he could at the very least attract a crowd with the promise of reviving the plainte italienne and the final divertissement.\nAll that was required was a synthesis of Moli\u00e8re's play (Moli\u00e8re had died in 1673) that could coherently string together the existent interm\u00e8des. Such a text would have to be one third the length of the original \u2014 that is, 600 rather than 1800 lines long \u2014 and composed in varied rimes and rhythms rather than the alexandrines in riming couplets used in spoken declamation. Lully's usual librettist, Philippe Quinault, was inconveniently in disgrace at court over his previous opera Isis, and so the task fell to Thomas Corneille, likely at the bidding of the same cabal that had sought to disgrace Quinault.\nWhether by choice or of necessity Corneille's text emerged not as a synthesis of the Moli\u00e8re but rather as a different plot for a profoundly different genre. Corneille's nephew, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, is believed to have collaborated; it is impossible to know to what extent. No anecdote speaking of Psych\u00e9 mentions Fontenelle. Nevertheless the latter placed the libretto among his complete works without mention of his uncle.

Although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there; but Buffy remains somewhat suspicious and jealous of Dawn's bond with their mother. Xander's girlfriend Anya Jenkins begins to experience deeper human emotions, both negative and positive, such as a love for money. Anya is hired by Giles and works alongside him at a magic shop called The Magic Box.\nMeanwhile, Glorificus, or Glory, a hell-goddess who was exiled from her dimension after a war, has come to Earth. She can only remain there by being connected to her human form; a medical intern called Ben. Glory takes the form of a beautiful young woman, with some of her powers still intact as long as she maintains her strength through draining people of their sanity. She begins searching for a \"Key\" that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension by blurring the lines between dimensions, and in the process unleashing Hell on Earth. At the beginning of the season Glory and Ben are vying for control, alternating who possesses the body they share; later the line between them begins to blur and they experience each other's emotions and memories.\nWhen Joyce suffers from unexplained headaches, Buffy suspects Dawn may be harming her, but they discover that they were caused by a brain tumor. Buffy soon discovers that the Key's protectors had turned the Key into a human biologically related to the Summers \u2014 her new sister Dawn.

In Literary Review, Sebastian Shakespeare wrote: \u201cMcCarthy transforms what could have been a ludicrous story into a tense psychological drama about a man living on the edge of sanity. It is remarkable for its acuity, empathy and insight.\u201d The Village Voice referred to it as \"McCarthy's purest fable yet.\" In a New York Review of Books article, author Michael Chabon heralded the novel. Discussing the novel's relation to established genres, Chabon insists The Road is not science fiction; although \"the adventure story in both its modern and epic forms... structures the narrative\", Chabon says, \"ultimately it is as a lyrical epic of horror that The Road is best understood.\" Entertainment Weekly in June 2008 named The Road the best book, fiction or non-fiction, of the past 25 years and put it on its end-of-the-decade \"best-of\" list, saying, \"With its spare prose, McCarthy's post-apocalyptic odyssey from 2006 managed to be both harrowing and heartbreaking.\" In 2019, the novel was ranked 17th on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.On March 28, 2007, the selection of The Road as the next novel in Oprah Winfrey's Book Club was announced. A televised interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show was conducted on June 5, 2007, McCarthy's first, although he had been interviewed for the print media before. The announcement of McCarthy's television appearance surprised his followers. \"Wait a minute until I can pick my jaw up off the floor,\" said John Wegner, an English professor at Angelo State University in San Angelo, Texas, and editor of The Cormac McCarthy Journal, when told of the interview. During Winfrey's interview, McCarthy insisted his son, John Francis, was also his co-author, as some of the conversations between the father and son in the novel were based upon conversations between McCarthy and John Francis in real life. McCarthy also dedicated the novel to his son, possibly as an expression of paternal love as well as a depiction of it, although he did not say as much in the interview.On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed The Road on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.

Mei discovers that she has been accepted at a different university than her boyfriend, Justin Wexler, and worries about telling him. Lucas Arnaz is in love with his lab partner, Simone, and turns to his friend, Corey Doyle, to help him ask her to the prom. The only one who does not care about the prom is Jesse Richter. Principal Dunnan tries to talk but does not get through to him.\nMeanwhile, Jordan Lundley finds an earring in her boyfriend's car, Tyler Barso, but he assures her that he's not cheating. To show his love, he takes her on a date in the shed where the prom decorations are stored; Tyler forgot to extinguish one candle before they left, and the shed is burned down. Nova is left to manufacture replacement props alone. The principal, annoyed at Jesse's lack of respect, gives him a choice: either he helps Nova with the rebuild, or he can't graduate. Jesse accepts reluctantly, as does Nova; and realizes they need each other's cooperation. \nWhile Brandon disappoints Nova by not asking her to the prom, she and Jesse grow closer. When Nova discovers that the prom theme of the neighboring school is the same as theirs, Jesse decides to sneak into their school to check it out. However, the security guard notices them, and the police catch them after they escape.\nAs Lloyd still cannot find a date and becomes frustrated, Lucas asks Simone to a barbecue hosted by his friend Tyler.

Two nights before the prom, Nova, Ali, and Mei are in Nova's room, chatting. Nova confesses to them that she has feelings for Jesse, which her father overhears. The next day, Nova's father tells Jesse he cannot ask Nova to prom because he is \"bringing her down\". That afternoon, Jesse is unusually hostile towards Nova and deserts her.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women (1977) was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others.

By age sixteen he was producing local bands and recorded the idiosyncratic performer Tiny Tim after the two met following a Tampa performance. It was Tiny Tim who first suggested to Barone that he should live in Greenwich Village, where Tim himself had gotten his start. Moving to New York, Barone lived briefly at the Hotel Chelsea, modeled, and landed small acting roles. Answering an advertisement in the Village Voice newspaper led him to meet the musicians with whom he would soon form the Bongos, a critically acclaimed new wave band that helped to create the 1980s Hoboken, New Jersey indie pop community.The Bongos quickly gained favor at New York City music venues as well as at their home venue, Maxwell's in Hoboken. Signed to the British label Fetish Records, they were invited to perform at the Rainbow Theatre in London as part of a concert that included other bands on the New York scene and was recorded for the live album Start Swimming, released on Stiff Records. A European tour with the Bush Tetras followed. After a string of independent singles released in the U.K. on Fetish were compiled in the U.S. as Drums Along the Hudson (PVC), and a major U.S. tour with the B-52s, the group signed to RCA Records. With the advent of MTV, they made a commercial impact with the title song of their label debut, the Barone-penned \"Numbers With Wings.\" The song's accompanying video earned the group a nomination at the first MTV Video Music Awards. Two more albums followed, one for RCA and one for Island Records, which was to remain unreleased until 2013.Breaking out as a solo artist, Barone's albums have included chamber pop, orchestral, folk, and narrative singer-songwriter material. He has been called a \"gifted pop-rock tunesmith\" by The New York Times.Barone released his first solo album, Cool Blue Halo (recorded live at The Bottom Line in New York) in 1987, prior to the Bongos' amicable breakup. Anthony DeCurtis, writing in Rolling Stone, praised Barone's \"spare, elegant arrangements\" and credited him with fashioning \"a kind of rock chamber music.\"  While Trouser Press described the record as \"intimate but confused,\" NPR's Tom Moon, in a more recent assessment, called the album \"a plaintive masterpiece,\" adding \"Cool Blue Halo feels timeless, and maybe even exotic.\" Moon also credited Barone's version of David Bowie's \"The Man Who Sold the World\" with influencing Nirvana's own cover of the song on their 1994 album MTV Unplugged in New York.Two studio albums followed: the rock-dominated Primal Dream (MCA Records) in 1990, and the more acoustic-based Clouds Over Eden (Rhino Records), dedicated to his late friend, rock journalist Nicholas Schaffner, in 1994. Trouser Press championed the \"fine set of yearning love songs\" on Primal Dream, while calling their production and arrangements as a \"step backwards\" from his debut album.  But David Browne, writing in Rolling Stone, gave the album four stars and commented that \"Barone is fast moving beyond the limited vocabulary of twelve strings and wimp-pop vocals.\"  Billy Altman, in The New York Times, called his next album, Clouds Over Eden \"unquestionably the most fully realized effort of Barone's career,\" while Trouser Press described the album as \"wrenching and thoroughly worthwhile\" and \"the great album fans always imagined [Barone] making.\"In the mid-1990s, Barone performed and recorded with experimental guitarist Gary Lucas and his group Gods and Monsters, in which Barone handled lead vocals and played Mellotron. In 1995 he recorded Harry Nilsson's \"I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City,\" with Lucas on guitar, for the album For the Love of Harry: Everybody Sings Nilsson (BMG Records) and produced B-52's frontman Fred Schneider's version of \"Coconut\" for the same project. He performed the song with Schneider on Late Night With Conan O'Brien.In 1996, he partnered with Phil Ramone and Larry Rosen's N2K Records label to become one of the first five artists, each representing a different genre, to make their music available as purchasable digital downloads on the pioneering Music Boulevard retail site. Amidst the music industry's growing fear of the then-new technology of digital distribution, Barone appeared on The Wall Street Journal Report television show and other programs to explain and promote legal music downloading as a legitimate method of distribution.In 1997, Barone released Between Heaven and Cello, a live album recorded primarily at NYC's intimate Fez nightclub during a series of \"Guitar & Cello\" shows. In November he performed in Bryter Later: The Music of Nick Drake at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, N.Y., performing Drake's \"Cello Song\" and \"Northern Sky.\" In that year, he also performed with David Johansen on Buster's Spanish Rocketship, the fourth album by Johansen's alter-ego Buster Poindexter, released on Island Records. Barone sang backing vocals on the album, credited as \"Richard Barone and the Beautiful Bustiers.\" Also in 1997, Barone partnered with songwriter Jules Shear to co-host \"Writers in the Round - Bluebird Style,\" a monthly series at The Bottom Line that featured Rosanne Cash, Ron Sexsmith, Susan Cowsill, and other singer/songwriters.\nToward the end of the 90s, Barone began collaborating with producer Tony Visconti. Nine of the songs they wrote and recorded together over the next few years were released on the album Glow in 2010. Also during this period, he was invited to sing on sessions Visconti was producing for David Bowie, including the song \"Mother,\" which would be released in 2021. \"Yet Another Midnight,\" a Barone/Visconti composition from this period, appears on the 2023 retrospective box set Produced by Tony Visconti on Demon Records.In 1999 he provided musical direction and orchestrations for the off-Broadway musical Bright Lights, Big City at the New York Theatre Workshop, working with Rent director Michael Greif. From 1999 to 2004, Barone directed and performed in The Downtown Messiah, a unique, multi-genre interpretation of Handel's baroque oratorio that was broadcast annually in December on over 200 public radio stations nationwide, and combined elements of pop, folk, blues, and jazz.A boxed set of Barone's first three studio albums was released in Europe in 2000 as The Big Three by Line Records, Germany. In 2001, he contributed the track \"Showdown\"  to Lynne Me Your Ears - A Tribute to Jeff Lynne, a 32-track collection that included performances by Ringo Starr, Brian Wilson, Stevie Nicks and others. He also sang backing vocals for Tony Visconti's version of \"Mr. Blue Sky\" on the album, along with Kristeen Young.As a concert producer/director, he began to create large-scale concert events, including three all-star tributes to Peggy Lee at Carnegie Hall, the Hollywood Bowl, and Chicago's Ravinia Festival in 2003 and 2004 in partnership with legendary concert impresario George Wein. The fully-orchestrated concerts spanned Lee's entire career and were staged as a musical biography. Performers included Bea Arthur, Nancy Sinatra, Rita Moreno, Debbie Harry, and Shirley Horn. For New York's Central Park SummerStage he created The Not-so Great American Songbook, a lovingly irreverent look at the guilty-pleasure hits of the 1970s, featuring an eclectic cast that included Justin Vivian Bond.In 2004, Barone interviewed Quincy Jones for the PBS documentary Fever: The Music of Peggy Lee. That year also saw the first release on his own RBM Special Editions label, an anthology entitled Collection: An Embarrassment of Richard, composed of highlights from his back catalogue. The cover was photographed by Mick Rock, the first of many collaborations. In June, he performed in The Blood on the Tracks Project at Merkin Hall, a multi-artist tribute to Bob Dylan's landmark 1974 album on its thirtieth anniversary. He was accompanied by Tony Visconti on bass, Vernon Reid on guitar, and Buddy Cage, who had performed on the original album, on pedal steel.Also that year, Barone joined 1960s folk-rock icon Donovan for a series of the latter's Beat Caf\u00e9 concert events, including nine performances at New York's Joe's Pub, singing and reading excerpts from Allen Ginsberg's Howl.Barone increasingly turned his attention to producing, including a duet between Liza Minnelli and pianist/vocalist Johnny Rodgers; a children's album for Jolie Jones (daughter of Quincy Jones); Fred Schneider for his solo album Just Fred; and others. During this time, he also collaborated with Schneider on songs for British pop sensation Sophie Ellis-Bextor.Other projects during this time included executive-producing The Nomi Song DVD (Palm Pictures, 2005), which includes his remix of operatic New Wave countertenor Klaus Nomi's \"Total Eclipse.\"  His songs and collaborations, including several written with singer-songwriter Jill Sobule, were heard on the TV shows The West Wing, Dawson's Creek, Felicity, and South of Nowhere.In 2006, the original three Bongos reunited in the studio with Moby to create a re-make and music video of \"The Bulrushes,\" an early Bongos single, for the re-issue of the group's debut album, released by Cooking Vinyl Records in June 2007. Several Bongos reunion concerts were held, culminating with an outdoor performance at the Hoboken Arts and Music Festival, during which the band was honored with a Mayoral Proclamation and the keys to the city.\nIn September 2007, Barone's memoir, Frontman: Surviving the Rock Star Myth, with cover and interior photos of the author by Mick Rock, was published by Backbeat/Hal Leonard Books. In late 2007, he began staging a series of musical readings of Frontman with excerpts of the book read by television actress Joyce DeWitt and radio personality Vin Scelsa, among others. On his birthday, October 1, 2008, he brought Frontman: A Musical Reading to the stage at Carnegie Hall in New York City, with \"Special Guests and Legendary Friends,\" including Moby, Lou Reed, the Band's Garth Hudson, Marshall Crenshaw, Terre and Suzzy Roche, Randy Brecker, Carlos Alomar, DeWitt and others as a benefit for public radio station WFUV.In July 2009, Barone entered the recording studio to complete production work on the album he began at age 16 for performer Tiny Tim. The album, I've Never Seen a Straight Banana - Rare Moments: Volume 1, was released in October 2009 on Collector's Choice Records.In May 2010, Barone produced a concert to benefit Anthology Film Archives and to honor avant-garde filmmaker/author Kenneth Anger.

At 10,990 square kilometres (4,240 sq mi), it is the third largest island\u2014after Cuba and Hispaniola\u2014of the Greater Antilles and the Caribbean. Jamaica lies about 145 km (90 mi) south of Cuba, 191 km (119 mi) west of Hispaniola (the island containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and 215 km (134 mi) south-east of the Cayman Islands (a British Overseas Territory).First inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule after the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Many of the indigenous people either were killed or died of diseases, after which the Spanish brought large numbers of Africans to Jamaica as slaves. The island remained a possession of Spain, under the name Santiago, until 1655, when England (part of what would become the Kingdom of Great Britain) conquered it and named it Jamaica. It became an important part of the colonial British West Indies. Under Britain's colonial rule, Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on continued importation of African slaves and their descendants. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British began using Chinese and Indian indentured labourers for plantation work. Jamaicans achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.With 2.8 million people, Jamaica is the third most populous Anglophone country in the Americas (after the United States and Canada), and the fourth most populous country in the Caribbean. Kingston is the country's capital and largest city. Most Jamaicans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, with significant European, East Asian (primarily Chinese), Indian, Lebanese, and mixed-race minorities. Because of a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, there is a large Jamaican diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The country has a global influence that belies its small size; it was the birthplace of the Rastafari religion, reggae music (and such associated genres as dub, ska and dancehall), and it is internationally prominent in sports, including cricket, sprinting, and athletics. Jamaica has sometimes been considered the world's least populous cultural superpower.Jamaica is an upper-middle-income country with an economy heavily dependent on tourism; it has an average of 4.3 million tourists a year. The country performs favourably in measures of press freedom, democratic governance and sustainable well-being. Jamaica is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy with power vested in the bicameral Parliament of Jamaica, consisting of an appointed Senate and a directly elected House of Representatives.Andrew Holness has served as Prime Minister of Jamaica since March 2016. As a Commonwealth realm, with Charles III as its king, the appointed representative of the Crown is the Governor-General of Jamaica, an office held by Patrick Allen since 2009.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was written and developed by David Braben and Ian Bell and originally published by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers in September 1984. Elite's open-ended game model, and revolutionary 3D graphics led to it being ported to virtually every contemporary home computer system and earned it a place as a classic and a genre maker in gaming history. The game's title derives from one of the player's goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of \"Elite\".\nElite was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden-line removal. It added graphics and twitch gameplay aspects to the genre established by the 1974 game Star Trader. Another novelty was the inclusion of The Dark Wheel, a novella by Robert Holdstock which gave players insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire.\nThe Elite series is among the longest-running video game franchises. The first game was followed by the sequels Frontier: Elite II in 1993, and Frontier: First Encounters in 1995, which introduced Newtonian physics, realistic star systems and seamless freeform planetary landings. A third sequel, Elite Dangerous, began crowdfunding in 2012 and was launched on 16 December 2014, following a period of semi-open testing; it received a paid-for expansion season, Horizons, on 15 December 2015.Elite proved hugely influential, serving as a model for other games including Wing Commander: Privateer, Grand Theft Auto, EVE Online, Freelancer, the X series and No Man's Sky.Non-Acorn versions were each first published by Firebird and Imagineer.

Development began immediately after Uchikoshi's first visual novel, Memories Off, was finished. He was unable to make heavy use of science fiction themes in Never 7, as his superiors at KID told him that the game needed to include cute girl characters in order to sell; he kept science fiction themes light, and the game was designed with a focus on dating game elements, with the main focus being to develop a relationship with a girl. The Dreamcast version includes new scenarios not available in the PlayStation version.The development team depicted reality in the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Cur\u00e9 syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as \"vague existences\", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which \"should be fictional\" remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die at some point during the game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for themselves what the answer would be.The game's soundtrack was composed by Takeshi Abo, and features \"geometric music\" because of the game's theoretical and science fiction elements. Prior to composing the music, he read through the game's story, to understand the setting and each character's personality as much as possible. He would write his impressions of the plot, with a focus on the \"emotional flow\" and the events that occur throughout the story; he valued his first impressions as very important for this. According to Abo, this method takes longer time, but allows him to make better music with a stronger relation to the game's world than if he had just designated different songs to different points of the game. Because he enjoyed the story, the music strongly reflects Abo's own musical tastes. The opening and ending themes of the PlayStation Portable version, titled \"Sen Oku no Hoshikuzu Furasu Yoru no Sora\" and \"Hokorobishi Hana\", respectively, were performed by the band Asriel.The game was originally released by KID for PlayStation under the title Infinity on March 23, 2000. A Neo Geo Pocket Color version titled Infinity Cure was released on November 23, 2000, also by KID. On December 21, 2000, KID released a Dreamcast version titled Never 7: The End of Infinity; this version was also released for Microsoft Windows on October 26, 2001, and for PlayStation 2 on May 22, 2003. On March 3, 2005, it was released for Macintosh computers through the \"GameX for Mac\" service.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women (1977) was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\"Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process. In 1982's American Skeptic: Robert Altman's Genre-Commentary Films by Norman Kagan, he cites the film as an \"anti-genre exploration of what might be called the theme of madness. This genre includes such critically revered films as Psycho, Repulsion, and Persona.\" Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to Altman's earlier film That Cold Day in the Park (1969) and his later 3 Women, declaring them a trilogy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This will be more familiar to people than A Thousand Suns was, where we were like 'Fuck it, we're just going to go bonkers.\" Bennington also said that the new album's lyrics would be personal and avoid being political, adding \"We've been writing a lot about relationships.\" Bennington and Shinoda echoed similar statements during an interview with Spin, with the former commenting that \"We now know we have the skills and the tools to take those ideas and make them into what we're actually looking for, as opposed to getting into it and discovering that it just sounds really n\u00fc-metal. That's always going to be gross to us, but we can take elements of that and reinvent the vibe, make it new and fresh.\" The two previewed five songs from the album, as well as announced that they had collaborated with Canadian musician Owen Pallett. The vocalists also stated that they have adopted numerous influences and topics for the album, particularly about people.Bennington told Live 105 that the band is \"embracing everything that [they] have done in the past,\" taking the \"best pieces\" of their previous four albums and \"smash[ing] them together into this new record.\" Shinoda explained in an interview with NME that the album would not return to their nu metal sound, however he assured that the record \"gets back to our roots and it's captured a feeling that we haven't gone after in many years.\" He also spoke similar statements to Bennington about combining elements of all four albums, saying, \"We've learned so much from all the albums we've done, so we've taken everything we've learned and mixed it all into one.\" Shinoda stated that the album is more \"rap-centric\" compared to their previous two albums. Shinoda told Musique Mag that the band wanted the album to be \"more energetic [and] song-based\", as opposed to their previous album, A Thousand Suns, which was more of a concept record.The band had numerous influences and inspirations for Living Things. Shinoda told Rolling Stone that \"Castle of Glass\", \"Skin to Bone\" and \"Roads Untraveled\" contained folk music influenced by the works of Bob Dylan, as well as the inspirations of Dylan. In the seventh track \"Victimized\", which Rolling Stone described as \"the band's most aggressive track in years\", was influenced by punk rock bands such as Pennywise and Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Shinoda noted the minimal content of numerous punk rock songs attributed to the short length of \"Victimized\"; bassist Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell noted that the song's working title, \"Battle Axe\", \"which to me is..what that song is; it's just this big 'crack' and then you're out.\" Like the band's first two albums, the penultimate track (\"Tinfoil\") is an instrumental.

{"id": "91_530", "question": "What genre is First Love?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_533", "question": "What genre is Human Nature?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_10925", "text": "Emerson uses spirituality as a major theme in the essay. Emerson believed in re-imagining the divine as something large and visible, which he referred to as nature; such an idea is known as transcendentalism, in which one perceives a new God and a new body, and becomes one with his or her surroundings. Emerson confidently exemplifies transcendentalism, stating, \"From the earth, as a shore, I look out into that silent sea. I seem to partake its rapid transformations: the active enchantment reaches my dust, and I dilate and conspire with the morning wind\", postulating that humans and wind are one. Emerson referred to nature as the \"Universal Being\"; he believed that there was a spiritual sense of the natural world around him. Depicting this sense of \"Universal Being\", Emerson states, \"The aspect of nature is devout. Like the figure of Jesus, she stands with bended head, and hands folded upon the breast. The happiest man is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship\".According to Emerson, there were three spiritual problems addressed about nature for humans to solve: \"What is matter? Whence is it? And Whereto?\" What is matter? Matter is a phenomenon, not a substance; rather, nature is something that is experienced by humans, and grows with humans' emotions. Whence is it and Whereto? Such questions can be answered with a single answer, nature's spirit is expressed through humans, \"Therefore, that spirit, that is, the Supreme Being, does not build up nature around us, but puts it forth through us\", states Emerson. Emerson clearly depicts that everything must be spiritual and moral, in which there should be goodness between nature and humans.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Their first two singles had vocals shared equally amongst the seven members of the group, and it was not until their third single, \"Two in a Million\", that O'Meara became known as their lead vocalist. Although the band were to progressively change their style over the four years they were together, even their first album had many tracks atypical of the pop genre: \"You're My Number One\" and \"Everybody Wants Ya\" were Motown-driven, whereas \"Viva La Fiesta\" and \"It's a Feel Good Thing\" were both bouncy, salsa-driven Latino songs. Over the years their style and direction changed progressively with each new album. Their second album 7 had songs with styles that somewhat opposed the traditional pop songs that rival pop bands of the nineties were releasing. With the release of \"Natural\" in 2000, S Club 7 showcased a new R&B-lite sound. The release of their third album, Sunshine, gave audiences their biggest change: the album contained tracks such as the disco-influenced \"Don't Stop Movin'\" and the R&B ballad \"Show Me Your Colours\". The album marked a more mature approach for the band. After the departure of Cattermole, S Club released their fourth and final album, Seeing Double, including the single \"Alive\", which was called a power-packed dance floor filler. The single has a style similar to that of their final single, \"Love Ain't Gonna Wait for You\". The album contained dance tracks that varied from their original bubblegum pop stylings, such as the sex for the CBBC generation on \"Hey Kitty Kitty\".\nA reviewer for The Guardian, referring to \"Gangsta Love\", said \"S Club's spiritual home is the suburban disco, not urban underground clubs, and their attempt to go garage on \"Gangsta Love\" ends up amusing rather than authentic\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The man in the suit, having noticed he is being followed, quickly confronts the Young Man and introduces himself as \"Cobb\". Cobb reveals he is a serial burglar and invites the Young Man (who tells Cobb his name is \"Bill\") to accompany him on burglaries. The material gains from these crimes seem to be of secondary importance to Cobb. He takes pleasure in rifling through the personal items in his targets' flats and drinking their wine. He explains his true passion is using the shock of robbery, and violation of property, to make his victims re-examine their lives. He sums up his attitude thus: \"You take it away, and show them what they had.\"\nThe Young Man is thrilled by Cobb's lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb's suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit.

The truck stop is located off a freeway and it features a diner, a gas station, and a convenience store.\nThe story's narrator and a handful of strangers find themselves trapped together in a freeway truck stop diner after semi-trailers and other large vehicles are suddenly brought to independent life by an unknown force and proceed to gruesomely kill every human in sight. Cars, which remain unaltered, are swiftly battered into wreckage and pedestrians are massacred by rampaging trucks and buses. The six survivors hiding in the diner include the narrator, as well as an elderly counterman, a trucker, a young man named Jerry, his girlfriend, and a salesman named Snodgrass.\nAs the story begins, the counterman and the trucker attempt to radio any other survivors, but the two-way radio fails for unknown reasons. Snodgrass, cracking under the strain, attempts to flee across the stop's parking lot and is hit by a truck. Snodgrass gets propelled into a drainage ditch, taking hours to die from internal bleeding. The situation worsens when the diner's power goes out. The counterman instructs the survivors that they will need to consume the perishable meats and collect good potable water from the restrooms. While the employee restroom is inside the diner, the men's and ladies' room are by the outdoor gas station, and the narrator's attempt to gather fresh water from those places nearly costs him his life when the trucks realize what he is trying to do. \nSome time later, a glimmer of hope appears when the trucks begin to run out of fuel. An enormous semi-truck noses up to the diner and starts blasting its horn erratically. Jerry remembers from his time in the Boy Scouts that the horn blasts are Morse code, and translates that the trucks are demanding humans start pumping fuel. The trucks assure they will not attack people who refuel them. The narrator is outvoted when he suggests they comply with this, and a bulldozer arrives and proceeds to attack the diner. The narrator and Jerry destroy the bulldozer with improvised Molotov cocktails, but the diner is half-destroyed and Jerry and the trucker are killed.\nThe remaining three humans surrender and, taking turns, start pumping the gas into the mile-long string of waiting trucks. When the narrator exhausts the fuel reserve of the truck stop's gas station, a fuel tanker arrives to replenish the fuel cisterns. When the narrator is at a point of collapsing, he is relieved by the counterman, who starts pumping gas for his \"shift\". The narrator says that he will have to show the girl how to handle a fuel pump, and that she will do it because she wants to live. The narrator thinks to himself that perhaps this will last only until the trucks run out of fuel, rust, and fall apart, but he then has a grim vision of forced assembly lines churning out new generations of trucks, and the trucks, aided by construction vehicles and tanks, doing great efforts such as draining the Okefenokee Swamp and paving much of the wild backcountry, stamping it into a great plain. The story ends as a pair of planes fly overhead, and the narrator laments \"I wish I could believe there are people in them.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_549", "question": "What genre is The International?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_10420", "text": "Glas is described as experimental and obscure. Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_551", "question": "What genre is Xenogears?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_39001", "text": "Xenogears was produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, who previously worked on the SNES game Secret of Mana. The scenario of the game was written by director Tetsuya Takahashi and by Kaori Tanaka. Yasuyuki Honne served as art director, while Kunihiko Tanaka was responsible for the character designs. Tetsuo Mizuno, Tomoyuki Takechi, and Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi were executive producers for Xenogears. Koichi Mashimo, an animation director and his studio Bee Train, was in charge of the anime cut scenes. The CGI sequences were created by Shirogumi. Xenogears started out as an early concept conceived by Takahashi and Tanaka for the Square game Final Fantasy VII. Their superior in the company deemed it \"too dark and complicated for a fantasy\", but Takahashi was allowed to develop it as a separate project. The project began under the working title \"Project Noah\". The main impetus for Takahashi was that he was growing frustrated with the Final Fantasy series. The initial concept was to make Xenogears a sequel to Chrono Trigger, but after multiple clashes with the company over this and unspecified practical difficulties, it was decided to make it a completely original title. Due to this initial development idea, there were concepts unsuited for a fantasy world, so a compromise was made by incorporating both fantasy and science fiction into the game's world.Development took approximately two years, and included a staff of thirty developers. Preliminary planning and creation of the backstory extended to several years before that. The word \"Xeno\" had been decided between staff from an early stage, with its meaning being \"something strange or alien\". \"Gears\" was chosen from multiple suggested words. The game's Gears were not present during early stages, with their places being filled by traditional summoned monsters. The game's use of anime cutscenes was chosen as it was difficult to properly recreate Tanaka's Gear artwork into 3D CGI. The game's engine was also designed to be best suited for the 3D map displays and battle arenas. Takahashi had wanted to create the game in full 3D, but the PlayStation's capacities meant this could not be managed, resulting in the current mesh of 2D sprites against 3D backgrounds. The themes and story were greatly influenced by the works and philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, as well as dystopian science fiction films such as THX 1138 and Soylent Green. According to Tanaka, the reason for this correlation was simply due to a common interest with her husband. According to her, the story revolved around \"where do we come from, what are we, where are we going\". There was a large portion of story and artwork that did not make it into the final game. The game's second disc consisted mainly of narration by Fei and Elly of events following the party's escape from Solaris. While it was popularly assumed to be due to budget constraints, Takahashi later revealed the full reason; as his team was inexperienced they were unable to create the entire proposed game in the expected two-year development time, so instead of ending prematurely with the end of the first disc, Takahashi offered up a compromise which became the second disc's content, allowing the staff to finish the game within time and budget deadlines.Square had announced that Xenogears may not have come out in the United States due to \"sensitive religious issues\". The English translation of Xenogears was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge. In a later interview, Honeywood stated that the biggest issue was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of \"killing God\", which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood may also have had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus: the staff were originally going to call it Yahweh, and during his argument against it he said \"It's dangerous\" (\u30e4\u30d9\u30fc\u3088, yab\u0113 yo). The Japanese staff found the similarity between Yahweh and yab\u0113 amusing, and, according to Honeywood, decided to call the boss Yabeh in Japanese. However, in the final Japanese release of Xenogears, the boss is called Deus (\u30c7\u30a6\u30b9, deusu), so either the name was changed again at a later point or Honeywood's account is inaccurate.\nSquare Enix released Xenogears on the Japanese PlayStation Network on June 25, 2008, and in North America on February 22, 2011.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The text was compiled from the King James Bible and the Coverdale Psalter by Charles Jennens. It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere a year later. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music.\nHandel's reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens's text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ. The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others, and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds, the only \"scene\" taken from the Gospels. In Part II, Handel concentrates on the Passion of Jesus and ends with the Hallelujah chorus. In Part III he covers Paul's teachings on the resurrection of the dead and Christ's glorification in heaven.\nHandel wrote Messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces, with optional alternate settings for many of the individual numbers. In the years after his death, the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale, with giant orchestras and choirs. In other efforts to update it, its orchestration was revised and amplified, such as Mozart's Der Messias. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to Handel's original intentions, although \"big Messiah\" productions continue to be mounted.

She sends one of the real Ben, and then devises the reason why they cannot meet in person: he is working in China.\nWhile she is developing the online romance between her mother and fake Ben, and preventing her mother and the real Ben from meeting in person, she finds herself drawn to a cute, artistic boy in her class, Adam, but is unwilling to get close to anyone as she, having been uprooted so often.\nHolly spends more time with Ben while picking his brain for romance tips. She slowly comes to realize that he really is her mother's \"perfect man\".\nHolly asks for Adam's help to disguise himself as Ben on the telephone to break up with Jean. But he fails, as he is harboring feelings for Holly and ends up telling Jean the opposite of what was planned. The following day, when Holly confronts Adam angrily because of this failure, Adam tells her that he just got distracted, then reveals his feelings for Holly by kissing her.\nThat night, Lenny, an awkward man infatuated with Jean, proposes to her, and she replies with a \"maybe\". Holly, believing Ben the better choice, disguises herself as Ben's secretary and arranges a meeting between Ben and her mother. The next day, when Holly thinks Ben is marrying someone else, she disrupts the wedding to tell Ben he should be with her mother - who he does not know about - not knowing he was there as the bride's dear friend.\nA disappointed Ben follows Holly out, and she admits the full story. She then goes to where Jean thinks Ben is meeting here for the first time and confesses the whole ruse to Jean, who takes it terribly; Holly insists that Jean is perfect the way she is and does not need a man. Days pass, and Holly and her mother keep distant.\nA humiliated Holly begs Jean for them to move again, and they start to pack. Adam, for what he thinks is the last time, goes to Holly's, giving her mother a drawing he made telling Holly that he will always be there for her.\nTouched, Jean logs onto the Internet using Holly's screen name and talks to Adam. He, thinking it is Holly, says that her mom sets a bad example by getting up and leaving when things get bad. This, in return, is creating a bad role model for her own daughters. Jean is deeply moved by this and decides to stay, finding a new job and trying to rebuild her life without running away. She also apologizes to her daughter, showing her Adam's drawing.\nMeanwhile, Ben is inspired by what Holly told him about her mother, and with her help, Jean and Ben finally meet and Jean finds her \"perfect man\". Holly is on the road to her perfect man as well, finally opening up and admitting her feelings for Adam. Adam and Holly go to their first school dance together.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_562", "question": "What genre is The Driver?", "ctxs": [{"id": "526_50572", "text": "The film is divided into ten scenes, each of which depict a conversation between an unchanging female driver (played by Mania Akbari) and a variety of passengers as she drives around Tehran. Her passengers include her young son Amin (played by Akbari's real life child, Amina Maher), her sister, a bride, a sex worker, and a woman on her way to prayer.\nThe first vignette of the film is a conversation between Amin and his mother, as he is being driven to the local pool. Over the course of their conversation, the driver raises her voice to him and tensions escalate as he yells over her. It is revealed that, due to the limited rights women are given the court system, the driver obtained a divorce from her ex-husband, by falsely telling the court he was a drug addict. After their conversation erupts into a fight, Amin abruptly exits the car.\nThe second vignette features the driver's sister who works as a teacher. They discuss the heavy burden and expectations children place on their parents. Both of their children have accused the women of not being good mothers. They eventually pick up a birthday cake for the driver's husband, Mortaza. The driver's sister advises her regarding Amin's rude behavior and tells her to let Amin live with his father, who will be able to \"set him straight\".\nDuring the third vignette, the driver picks up a pious old woman who goes to the Mausoleum three times a day to pray. She reveals that her husband and 12-year-old son have both died. She goes to the Mausoleum to pray for them. She has sold her possessions in order to go on a pilgrimage to Syria and has given away her other possessions to people who are less fortunate than her. Their conversation ends as the driver drops the old woman off at the Mausoleum after she is unable to convince the driver to go in and pray herself.\nThe fourth vignette starts with a sex worker who mistakes the driver for a male client and gets into her car. The driver continues to drive around with the unnamed woman and persists in asking her personal questions. The sex worker, in turn, ends up lecturing the driver. She tells the driver that many of her clients are married men that get calls from their wives while they are with her. She admits to the driver that she feels bad for women who are idiotic enough to cling onto men and who actually believe that men are truthful. The sex worker was engaged to a man once until she realized she was \"foolish\". The conversation ends as she is dropped off and immediately picked up by a client.\nThe fifth vignette features a woman whose relation to the driver is unclear. The woman is picked up just after she has prayed at the Mausoleum. The two women discuss religion and whether or not they are believers. The passenger confesses that she had not been a believer in the past, and now she is not so sure. The passenger tells the driver that she was supposed to get married and she now prays at the Mausoleum with the hope that the man she is dating will propose soon.\nIn the next vignette, the driver picks up Amin from her ex-husband, who has been taking care of him. She and her ex-husband each stay in their cars, leaving Amin to cross a busy traffic-filled street. The driver asks permission to keep Amin overnight and he eventually agrees. Amin disagrees with his mother over a shortcut to his grandmother's house, but eventually realizes his mother is going the right way. Amin tells his mom that his father has been watching porn at home alone at night.\nThe driver next picks up her crying sister who is distraught over her husband leaving after 7 years together. As she cries, the driver tells her, \"It is wrong to cling to him.\" The driver is reciting almost exactly what the sex worker had told her the night before. The driver is very frank and harsh with her sister. She tells her to toughen up and stop being so weak.\nDuring the eighth vignette, the driver is with Amin again. She says a woman told her that Amin is a man and therefore needs to live and learn from a man. The driver agrees that Amin should go live with his father, and they have a conversation about her ex-husband finding a new wife. Amin says that his new wife would be better than his mother by obeying her husband, doing more housework, and coming home earlier. They disagree again over a shortcut and soon their argument escalates to the point where Amin abruptly gets out of the car again.\nThe ninth vignette features the same woman from the fifth vignette. She tells the driver that her boyfriend does not want to marry her, despite her hopes that he will. She feels jealous over the fact that he is thinking of another woman and that is what hurts her the most. The driver asks her passenger why her veil is so tight, and it is revealed that the passenger has shaved her head.\nThe final vignette is the shortest. The driver picks up Amin from his father. The film ends as the driver is taking him to his grandma's house.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The flora, fauna and customs of Gor are intricately detailed. Norman populates his planet with the equivalents of Roman, Greek, Native American, Viking, Inuit and other cultures. In the novels, these various population groups are transplants from Earth brought there by spacecraft through the behind-the-scenes rulers of Gor, the Priest-Kings, an extraterrestrial species of insectoid appearance. The Gorean humans are permitted advanced architectural, agricultural and medical skills (including life extension), but are forced to remain primitive in the fields of transportation, communication and weaponry (at approximately the level of Classical Mediterranean civilization) due to restrictions on technology imposed by the Priest-Kings. The most advanced form of transportation is the riding of large predatory birds called tarns by masterful men known as tarnsmen. The limitation of technology is imposed to ensure the safety of both the Priest-Kings and the other indigenous and transplanted beings on Gor, who would otherwise possibly come to harm due to the humans' belligerent tendencies.The planet Gor has lower gravity than the Earth (which allows for the existence of large flying creatures and tall towers connected by aerial bridges in the cities) and would have an even lower gravity if not for the technology of the Priest-Kings. The known geography of Gor consists mainly of the western seaboard of a continent that runs from the Arctic in the north to south of the equator, with the Thassa ocean to the west, and the Voltai mountain range forming an eastern boundary at many latitudes. There are also offshore islands in the ocean and some relatively sparsely settled plains to the east of the Voltai.

{"id": "91_569", "question": "What genre is Another?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Stockhausen explained that in pieces like this, \"the first step is always that of imitating something and the next step is that of transforming what you're able to imitate\". The first event is realized with the short-wave receiver and the instrument/voice together. The subsequent events freely alternate performance by the radio, by the instrument or voice, and their combination, though a balance should be aimed for between events with and without radio sounds.Each plus, minus, or equal sign indicates that, upon repetition of an event, the performer is to increase, decrease, or maintain the same level in one of four musical dimensions (or \"parameters\"): overall duration of the event, number of internal subdivisions, dynamic level, or pitch register/range. It is up to the performer to decide which of these dimensions is to be affected, except that vertically stacked signs must be applied to different parameters. Despite this indeterminacy, a large number of plus signs (for example) will result in successive events becoming longer, more finely subdivided, louder, and either higher or wider in range; a large number of minus signs will produce the reverse effect. To the signs previously used in Prozession and Kurzwellen, Stockhausen adds a dozen new ones. An especially important one is the \"spiral sign\", consisting of a column of different combinations of four or five plus or minus signs bracketed by repeat marks. At this sign, the performer is to repeat the previous event several times, transposing it each time in all parameters, and attempt to transcend not only previous limits reached in the piece, but also to go beyond the limitations of the instrument/voice itself. In doing this, the performer is encouraged to employ visual and theatrical possibilities. Because there are only seven \"spiral\" signs altogether, not every section contains one of them. Spiral is not ordinarily performed complete: the performer may end a version at any of the wavy barlines, and then for the next performance should resume where the previous one left off. On the other hand, the end of the score is marked \"da capo\" so that, should a chosen starting point result in the end being reached too soon, the performer may continue again from the beginning. Most performances last between fifteen and twenty-five minutes, and Stockhausen did not authorise a full-length version until Michael Vetter convinced him to permit such a thing. The first complete performance was realised by Michael Vetter and was recorded on 22 November 1995 at the Ballhorn Tonstudio in Odenthal.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The trucks assure they will not attack people who refuel them. The narrator is outvoted when he suggests they comply with this, and a bulldozer arrives and proceeds to attack the diner. The narrator and Jerry destroy the bulldozer with improvised Molotov cocktails, but the diner is half-destroyed and Jerry and the trucker are killed.\nThe remaining three humans surrender and, taking turns, start pumping the gas into the mile-long string of waiting trucks. When the narrator exhausts the fuel reserve of the truck stop's gas station, a fuel tanker arrives to replenish the fuel cisterns. When the narrator is at a point of collapsing, he is relieved by the counterman, who starts pumping gas for his \"shift\". The narrator says that he will have to show the girl how to handle a fuel pump, and that she will do it because she wants to live. The narrator thinks to himself that perhaps this will last only until the trucks run out of fuel, rust, and fall apart, but he then has a grim vision of forced assembly lines churning out new generations of trucks, and the trucks, aided by construction vehicles and tanks, doing great efforts such as draining the Okefenokee Swamp and paving much of the wild backcountry, stamping it into a great plain. The story ends as a pair of planes fly overhead, and the narrator laments \"I wish I could believe there are people in them.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Rimmer decides to conduct a \"morale meeting\" and appoints himself \"morale officer\". However the morale meeting turns out to be nothing more than an excuse for Rimmer to vent his feelings about how much he hates everyone. The rest of the crew discuss the bleak lives they're now leading, but the conversation is stopped when Starbug flies into a region of space populated by unreality pockets, a security measure around a top-secret Space Corps test ship. During one of these, Kryten becomes convinced that Lister is a 3000 series android (an unsuccessful model, due to its hyper-realistic appearance), after which he is forced to obey orders from Kryten, a 4000 series. After embarrassingly learning the truth, the crew are eager to find what has been protected so elaborately, flying further in as more of these unreality pockets occur, causing more very strong hallucinations. Everyone is about to give up when Kryten suggests the crew go into Deep Sleep.\nOnce awoken, the crew board the derelict ship and find a device capable of time travel. They learn the derelict ship's crew contracted an influenza virus in the 20th century, 800 years before the ship's origin. They all soon died, and their last act was to pilot the ship into deep space and generate the mine-field to drive off looters. The crew test the device, but as it only allows Starbug to travel through time, not space, it is of no use at the moment; however, if a faster-than-light drive can be found, then the time machine will allow them to travel to any time and place they desire.\nThe crew are subsequently contacted by another Starbug, populated by their future selves. Only Kryten speaks to them to prevent the rest of the crew learning about their futures; however, afterwards he gets very emotional around Lister, which makes him very worried. Lister speaks to Kryten, telling him he understands that he's died in the future, but Kryten tells him that a \"David Lister\" is aboard the future ship, which seriously confuses Lister. Kryten explains that the future crew's time drive has malfunctioned and only allows them to go forwards. In order to fix it, they need to copy components from the time drive aboard the present Starbug. The future crew board, but everyone except Kryten is sealed in the hold to prevent them from meeting their future counterparts. Lister is desperate to see what's happened to him and rigs a camera to see what's going on, and each of the crew is dismayed to see what they have become. Rimmer is obese, Cat is bald, Kryten has donned a toupee and a turtleneck sweater, and Lister is merely a brain in a jar. It soon becomes clear that their future selves are snobs and have socialised with some of the most evil figures of history (including the Hitlers, with future Rimmer stating that Hitler is \"a hoot\" as long as he's not talking politics) and lived in the height of luxury.\nLister refuses to help the future crew after seeing what they have become, and sends them at gunpoint back to their ship without the information they need. Later, as the crew try to come to terms with the fact they're destined to lead selfish and despicable lives, the future crew launch an attack on their past selves and, unwilling to spend the rest of their existence stranded in deep space, are willing to kill the crew knowing they'll be wiping themselves out. Rimmer shows uncharacteristic bravery by urging they fight, stating \"Better dead than smeg\" and the rest of the crew agree. Although things start off well, the more advanced future Starbug causes massive damage, killing Lister, Cat, and Kryten in explosions in the cockpit. Rimmer realises that the crew's only hope is to destroy the time drive, and grabs a bazookoid. Rimmer struggles through the bowels of the crumbling ship but manages to reach the time drive and fires upon it just as Starbug is destroyed by the future crew.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

Jamaica lies about 145 km (90 mi) south of Cuba, 191 km (119 mi) west of Hispaniola (the island containing Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and 215 km (134 mi) south-east of the Cayman Islands (a British Overseas Territory).First inhabited by the indigenous Ta\u00edno peoples, the island came under Spanish rule after the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1494. Many of the indigenous people either were killed or died of diseases, after which the Spanish brought large numbers of Africans to Jamaica as slaves. The island remained a possession of Spain, under the name Santiago, until 1655, when England (part of what would become the Kingdom of Great Britain) conquered it and named it Jamaica. It became an important part of the colonial British West Indies. Under Britain's colonial rule, Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on continued importation of African slaves and their descendants. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have subsistence farms rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British began using Chinese and Indian indentured labourers for plantation work. Jamaicans achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.With 2.8 million people, Jamaica is the third most populous Anglophone country in the Americas (after the United States and Canada), and the fourth most populous country in the Caribbean. Kingston is the country's capital and largest city. Most Jamaicans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, with significant European, East Asian (primarily Chinese), Indian, Lebanese, and mixed-race minorities. Because of a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, there is a large Jamaican diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The country has a global influence that belies its small size; it was the birthplace of the Rastafari religion, reggae music (and such associated genres as dub, ska and dancehall), and it is internationally prominent in sports, including cricket, sprinting, and athletics.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women (1977) was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\"Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process. In 1982's American Skeptic: Robert Altman's Genre-Commentary Films by Norman Kagan, he cites the film as an \"anti-genre exploration of what might be called the theme of madness. This genre includes such critically revered films as Psycho, Repulsion, and Persona.\" Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to Altman's earlier film That Cold Day in the Park (1969) and his later 3 Women, declaring them a trilogy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Winslet was handpicked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind. The character was named Iris after Jude Law's young daughter. A fan of Meyers' previous work on Something's Gotta Give (2003), Winslet, then primarily known for her portrayals in period films, \"loved the idea\" of playing a contemporary English woman in a romantic comedy, a genre she had not done before. Winslet said she had initially felt \"nervous and ... scared about trying to be funny\" at times, stating that \"Jude [Law] and I would speak on the telephone a lot before we started shooting, 'Oh my god, they're going to fire us, they're going to recast, what if we don't make them laugh?\" In preparing for her role, Winslet watched screwball comedies from the 1940s, such as His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story, to study the dialogues and performances.\nCameron Diaz as Amanda Woods:  Amanda is the owner of a successful business that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character \"was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz's performance in the film to Goldie Hawn's, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said.\nJude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\", and single father raising his two daughters (Miffy Englefield as Sophie, and Emma Pritchard as Olivia) by himself after his wife's death. Robert Downey Jr. auditioned for the role. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday.\nJack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend, Ethan. Jimmy Fallon auditioned for the role. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock (2003). On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\"\nEli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man.The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale (2001) together, although they do not share a scene. The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair.\nDustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate (1967). According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster Video to rent a film when he saw the lighting from the film production crew and walked over to see what was happening. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it.Lindsay Lohan, who had made her motion picture debut in Meyers's remake of The Parent Trap (1998), and James Franco, a friend of Meyers, make uncredited appearances in the trailer of the fictional movie Deception, which Amanda and her team finish at the beginning of The Holiday.

In texts of all genres, especially those produced in his first year as pope, Gregory bemoaned the burden of office and mourned the loss of the undisturbed life of prayer he had once enjoyed as a monk.\nWhen he became pope in 590, among his first acts was writing a series of letters disavowing any ambition to the throne of Peter and praising the contemplative life of the monks. At that time, for various reasons, the Holy See had not exerted effective leadership in the West since the pontificate of Gelasius I. The episcopacy in Gaul was drawn from the great territorial families, and identified with them: the parochial horizon of Gregory's contemporary, Gregory of Tours, may be considered typical; in Visigothic Spain the bishops had little contact with Rome; in Italy the territories which had de facto fallen under the administration of the papacy were beset by the violent Lombard dukes and the rivalry of the Byzantines in the Exarchate of Ravenna and in the south.Pope Gregory had strong convictions on missions: \"Almighty God places good men in authority that He may impart through them the gifts of His mercy to their subjects. And this we find to be the case with the British over whom you have been appointed to rule, that through the blessings bestowed on you the blessings of heaven might be bestowed on your people also.\" He is credited with re-energizing the Church's missionary work among the non-Christian peoples of northern Europe. He is most famous for sending a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, under Augustine of Canterbury, prior of Saint Andrew's, where he had perhaps succeeded Gregory, to evangelize the pagan Anglo-Saxons of Britain. It seems that the pope had never forgotten the Anglo-Saxon slaves whom he had once seen in the Roman Forum. The mission was successful, and it was from England that missionaries later set out for the Netherlands and Germany. The preaching of non-heretical Christian faith and the elimination of all deviations from it was a key element in Gregory's worldview, and it constituted one of the major continuing policies of his pontificate. Pope Gregory the Great urged his followers on the value of bathing as a bodily need.It is said he was declared a saint immediately after his death by \"popular acclamation\".In his official documents, Gregory was the first to make extensive use of the term \"Servant of the Servants of God\" (servus servorum Dei) as a papal title, thus initiating a practice that was to be followed by most subsequent popes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry. With a little guidance from Valentin, who draws a beauty spot on her cheek after finding her in his dressing room, Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.\nTwo years later, Zimmer announces plans to cease production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to leave the studio for the chance to produce, finance, and direct his own silent film, Tears of Love. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film Beauty Spot and the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately, audiences flock to Peppy's film instead, while only a few people (including Peppy herself) attend Valentin's. With Valentin ruined, his wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy quickly becomes the first of several major new Hollywood sound film stars.\nLater, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid the loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him his car before firing him. Depressed and drunk, Valentin sets fire to a stack of his old films. As the nitrate film quickly blazes out of control, he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, still clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued, Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin shows ingratitude for Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to remind Valentin of his changing luck.\nPeppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if he does not agree to her terms. After Valentin learns that Peppy bought all of his possessions at auction, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace and Valentin tells her it is no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let her make a musical production so Valentin can avoid the humiliation of having to speak.\nNow the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful.

I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz's performance in the film to Goldie Hawn's, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said.\nJude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\", and single father raising his two daughters (Miffy Englefield as Sophie, and Emma Pritchard as Olivia) by himself after his wife's death. Robert Downey Jr. auditioned for the role. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday.\nJack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend, Ethan. Jimmy Fallon auditioned for the role. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock (2003). On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\"\nEli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man.The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale (2001) together, although they do not share a scene. The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair.\nDustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate (1967). According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster Video to rent a film when he saw the lighting from the film production crew and walked over to see what was happening. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it.Lindsay Lohan, who had made her motion picture debut in Meyers's remake of The Parent Trap (1998), and James Franco, a friend of Meyers, make uncredited appearances in the trailer of the fictional movie Deception, which Amanda and her team finish at the beginning of The Holiday. Veteran voice-over talent Hal Douglas was the narrator for the trailer, as well as other \"trailers\" that describe Amanda's situation at various points in the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mother received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score of 31/40 from Japanese magazine Famitsu. Reviewers noted the game's similarities with the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous \"parody\" of the genre's tropes. They thought the game's sequel, EarthBound, to be very similar and a better implementation of Mother's gameplay ideas. Critics also disliked the game's high difficulty level and balance issues.Jeremy Parish of USgamer described the game as a mild-mannered parody (\"between satire and pastiche\") of the role-playing game genre, specifically the Dragon Quest series. He noted that Mother, like many Japanese role-playing games, emulated the Dragon Quest style: the windowed interface, first-person perspective in combat, and graphics, but differed in its contemporary setting and non-fantasy story. Parish commented that Atlus's 1987 Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei was similarly set in the modern day, though it devolved into science fiction and fantasy in ways Mother did not. He added that the game has \"a sense of wonder and magic realism ... in the context of childhood imagination\", as Ninten can feel more like someone \"pretending\" to be a Dragon Quest-style hero than a hero in his own right. Parish said this makes the player wonder which game events are real and which are Ninten's imagination. Parish cited Itoi's interest in entering the games industry to make a \"satirical\" role-playing game as proof of the genre's swift five-year rise to widespread popularity in Japan.Cassandra Ramos of RPGamer praised the game's graphics and music, and considered it among the console's best, with \"rich, ... nicely detailed\" visuals, Peanuts-style characters, and \"simple but effective\" audio. In contrast, she found the battle sequences aesthetically \"pretty bland\" and, otherwise, the game's \"least interesting\" aspect. Overall, she found Mother \"surprisingly complex ... for its time\", and considered its story superior to (but less \"wacky\" than) its sequel. She especially recommended the game for EarthBound fans.Parish credited Itoi for the game's vision and compared his ability and literary interests with American author Garrison Keillor. Parish felt that Itoi's pedigree as a writer and copywriter was well suited for the space-limited, 8-bit role-playing game medium, which privileged Mother ahead of other games written by non-writers. USgamer's Parish noted how the game's non-player characters would \"contemplate the profound and trivial\" instead of reciting the active plot. He added that the game's lack of an official North American release has bolstered the reputation and revere of its immediate sequel.While Parish said Mother's script was \"as sharp as EarthBound's\", he felt that the original's game mechanics did not meet the same level of quality. Mother lacked the \"rolling HP counter\" and non-random encounters for which later entries in the series were known. Parish also found the game's balance to be uneven, as the statistical character attributes and level of difficulty scaled incorrectly with the game's progression. Rose Colored Gaming, a company that made custom reproductions of the NES cartridge, noted that the Japanese release's was more challenging than the unreleased English localization. RPGamer's Ramos similarly found balance issues, with a high number of battles, difficult enemies, reliance on grinding, and some oversized levels. Parish wrote earlier for 1UP.com that in comparison to EarthBound, Mother is \"worse in just about every way\", a clone where its sequel was \"a satirical deconstruction of RPGs\". He wrote that the game's historical significance is not for its actual game but for the interest it generated in video game emulation and the preservation of unreleased games.Mother was rereleased in Japan as the single-cartridge Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. This version uses the extended ending of the unreleased English prototype, but is only presented in Japanese. Starmen.net hosted a Mother 25th Anniversary Fanfest in 2014 with a livestream of the game and plans for a remixed soundtrack. Later that year, fans released a 25th Anniversary Edition ROM hack that updated the game's graphics, script, and gameplay balance.A film group known as 54&O Productions developed a fan-made documentary entitled Mother to Earth.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women (1977) was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\"Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.

This genre includes such critically revered films as Psycho, Repulsion, and Persona.\" Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to Altman's earlier film That Cold Day in the Park (1969) and his later 3 Women, declaring them a trilogy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Developed by Shiny Entertainment, the game features elements of action and other genres. Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures. The game was ported to Mac OS 9.2 in 2001.\nUnlike many of its contemporary real-time strategy games, Sacrifice places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their mana\u2014energy for casting spells\u2014constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard. Aside from a single-player campaign, Sacrifice offers a multiplayer mode, in which up to four players can play against each other over computer networks.\nSacrifice was created by a small team of developers; most of the work was done by four key personnel. The graphic engine of the game uses tesselation: thousands of polygons are used to display an object and as lesser details are needed, the number of polygons is reduced. By adjusting the required level of detail, Sacrifice can be run on various machines with the highest possible quality of graphics. Complementing the graphics of the game were the voice work of professional actors, such as Tim Curry, and the musical compositions of Kevin Manthei. Sacrifice was praised by reviewers for the novel designs of its creatures and for its humorous content. The high level of attention needed to manage its frenetic combat was mentioned as a flaw.

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mary learns that her real name is Amy Hide and that her past was quite dark, a fact which causes Mary a great deal of distress. During her stay at the shelter, she gets a job as a waitress in a seedy caf\u00e9. With one exception, all of the male employees sexually harass her, but she does not understand the significance of their actions. The exception is Alan, a meek and highly insecure man who is deeply infatuated with Mary but does nothing to ward off the attentions of others. Mary meets Prince again, and she learns that Amy had asked someone to kill her. According to Prince, the failed killing was what had caused her amnesia.

She is escorted out of Michael's office by his assistant, Jamie, who takes pity on the shabby-looking Mary and invites her to live with him. Jamie is extremely wealthy, and he squanders his wealth largely on drugs and alcohol. Mary becomes infatuated with Jamie and is crushed when he does not return her affection. The two eventually begin a sexual relationship, but it is clear that Jamie does not return Mary's love.\nAfter their relationship ends, Mary moves in with Prince and begins going by Amy.

{"id": "91_649", "question": "What genre is Root?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_10281", "text": "Early in his career, Penderecki was one of the key figures associated with the Polish avant-garde movement of the 1960s. Penderecki was interested in freedom from conventional aspects of music\u2014namely meter, rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Important works from this period, particularly Anaklasis (1959\u201360), Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960), and Fluorescences (1961\u201362), were experimental compositions characterized by blocks of sound of varying dynamics, extended techniques on acoustic instruments, and tone clusters.By the early 1970s, however, Penderecki began to move away from the avant-garde movement, claiming in an interview in 2000, \"we pushed music so far in the sixties that even for myself, for me, I closed the door behind me, because there was no way to do anything more than I have done... I decided that there is no way that I can move on.\" Acknowledging that he had pushed the limits, Penderecki began to rediscover the neo-Romantics while working as a conductor in the 1970s. He specifies, \"The kind of music I was conducting influenced my own music very much... During this time I began to have my Romantic ideas, partly because I was conducting Bruckner, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky.\" At this point in his career, Penderecki's music begins to feature melodic expression, lyricism, and dramatic character.Penderecki felt that the early 1970s represented a major shift in his compositional style. Important to this shift was the composer's renewed emphasis on \"tradition.\" Penderecki attributed the importance of tradition to Artur Malawski, his composition teacher from 1954\u201357, who balanced contemporary techniques with more conventional musical forms. Penderecki echoed Malawski's compositional philosophy: \"The general principles at the root of a work's musical style... the integrity of a musical experience embodied in the notes the composer is setting down on paper, never change. The idea of good music means today exactly what it meant always.\" In 1973, he also stated he was in search of a new direction, one which resolved to \"gain inspiration from the past and look back on my heritage.\" For Penderecki, tradition also served as an \"opportunity to [overcome the] dissonance between the artist and the audience.\"The symphony particularly became an essential genre for Penderecki starting in the early 1970s, stating that his \"third style period\" began with his first symphony. From the 1970s on, Penderecki described the importance of the symphony in various ways, for instance explaining that his second symphony of 1980 \"referred fully to the late-nineteenth century symphonic tradition...\" He also stated in 2000, \"...It's very clear that I'm trying to continue this tradition, this Romantic tradition\" when describing his symphonic compositions. A passage from his collected essays Labyrinth of Time confirms this sentiment: \"I would like to continue the music that was cast at the beginning of the [twentieth] century: the tradition of writing symphonies.\" More importantly, however, Penderecki saw the genre as a kind of synthesis of traditional and contemporary styles, calling the symphony \"that musical ark which would make it possible to convey to coming generations what is best in our twentieth-century tradition of the composing of sounds.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism and Gothic fiction in the United States, and of American literature. Poe was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story, and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of science fiction. He is the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond, Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. He attended the University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with John Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the United States Army under an assumed name, he published his first collection, Tamerlane and Other Poems, credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at West Point, declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan.\nPoe switched his focus to prose, and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move between several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, but she died of tuberculosis in 1847. In January 1845, he published his poem \"The Raven\" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal The Penn, later renamed The Stylus. But before it began publishing, Poe died in Baltimore in 1849, aged 40, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of his death remains unknown, and has been variously attributed to many causes including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide.Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums. The Mystery Writers of America present an annual Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As with many bands known for experimentation, changes have inevitably resulted in dissent among critics and fans. The bulk of the band's music has always included synthetic instruments, and this has been a source of contention among fans and critics, especially the band's heavy usage of synthesizers and keyboards during the 1980s, particularly on albums Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, and Hold Your Fire.The members of Rush have noted that people \"either love Rush or hate Rush\", resulting in strong detractors and an intensely loyal fan base. In 1979, The Rolling Stone Record Guide called them \"the power boogie band for the 16 magazine graduating class\". A July 2008 Rolling Stone article stated, \"Rush fans are the Trekkies/trekkers of rock\". Rush have been cited as an influence by artists including Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Dream Theater, Fishbone, Foo Fighters, Steven Wilson,Iron Maiden, Jane's Addiction, Living Colour, Manic Street Preachers, Meshuggah, Metallica, No Doubt, the Pixies, Primus, Queensr\u00ffche, Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Smashing Pumpkins, Elliott Smith, Soundgarden, and Tool. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails said in the 2010 documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage that Rush is one of his favourite bands, and he has also cited the band's early '80s period in particular as a major influence on him in regard to incorporating keyboards and synthesizers into hard rock.Rush were eligible for nomination into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame beginning in 1998. The band were nominated for entry in 2012, and their induction was announced on December 11, 2012.  A reason for their previous exclusion may have been their genre. USA Today writer Edna Gundersen criticized the Hall of Fame for excluding some genres, including progressive rock. Supporters cited the band's accomplishments, including longevity, proficiency, and influence, as well as commercial sales figures and RIAA certifications. In the years before induction, Lifeson expressed his indifference toward the perceived slight, saying, \"I couldn't care less. Look who's up for induction; it's a joke\".On April 24, 2010, the documentary Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage, directed by Scot McFadyen and Sam Dunn, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. It went on to receive the Tribeca Film Festival Audience Award. The film was also nominated for Best Long Form Music Video at the 53rd Grammy Awards, losing to When You're Strange, a documentary about The Doors. A limited theatrical run began on June 10, 2010, and the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the US and Canada on June 29, 2010. The film explores the band's influence on popular music and the reasons why that influence has been underrepresented over the years. This is done via interviews with popular musicians, music industry professionals, and the band members themselves.On June 25, 2010, Rush received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6752 Hollywood Boulevard. Critical acclaim continued to mount for Rush in 2010 when, on September 28, Classic Rock announced that Rush would receive that year's Living Legends award at the Marshall Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards in the UK. The award was presented on November 10, 2010. On September 29, Billboard.com announced that Rush would also receive the 2010 Legends of Live award for significant and lasting contributions to live music and the art of performing live and reaching fans through the concert experience. The award was presented at the Billboard Live Music Awards on November 4, 2010.In 2013, the Canadian government honoured Rush with a first class \"permanent\" postage stamp, the equivalent of a \"Forever\" stamp in the US, featuring the iconic \"Starman\" Rush logo.The band members were made Officers of the Order of Canada in 1996. In May 2012, the band received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement at a ceremony at Rideau Hall, followed the next by a gala at the National Arts Centre celebrating the award recipients.

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others.

The panel, for what was considered by 64 to be Nintendo's flagship game at the event, featured several big machines and sculptures, such as those for Banjo and Mumbo Jumbo. The Nintendo 64 games presented at E3 were lauded by Nintendo Power as \"pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment, innovation, and intensity\". Banjo-Kazooie was a major example, highlighting how its advanced technology created a Disney-esque \"rich, animated world full of fun animals and great music\", visuals containing \"rich textures, creative lighting,\" and dynamic music. The reaction from gamers and critics towards the game was generally positive, 64 magazine predicting it to be \"the biggest hit of the year.\" However, it was also met with skepticism as a rip-off of Super Mario 64 and overly cute, and despised its new name. The gaming community was also mystified by some of its concepts, such as the usage of a bird-bear duo for a Super Mario 64-esque genre, fart sound effects for speech, and Kazooie pooping out eggs as an attack.The game was then presented at the 1997 annual Nintendo Space World event, where the first five worlds were playable. Its panel had women that were dressed up as Banjo with shirts on. N64 Magazine gave a glowing review of the panel, admitting it to be the event's most absorbing experience, even moreso than the Zelda game that got the most attention from other gamers and journalists. They considered the worlds immersive due to its \"graphical opulence,\" such as the \"incredibly realistic ripples\" on the water, and choice of environments \"realistic\" even considering the cartoony characters. They also positively commented on its implementation of the dual-character mechanic (particularly how certain sections require a specific character unlike other games).Banjo-Kazooie was initially scheduled for a release in November 1997, in the US 24 November, but was delayed to give developers more time for polish. When Rare met Nintendo of America's Howard Lincoln at E3 1997, he was against a delay, complaining: \"We've committed $20 million to this campaign\". To fill that year's Christmas schedule, Lincoln told Rare to include Donkey Kong characters in an R.C. Pro-Am game they were developing at the time, turning it into Diddy Kong Racing (1997). Eurogamer called Diddy Kong Racing \"something of a testing ground for Rare's [Nintendo 64]-era heroes\", as it included Banjo and Conker as playable characters prior to featuring in their own games. In the following months, Rare released screenshots at such a rate that by May 1998, N64 Magazine suspected the game was completed besides testing.Banjo-Kazooie was released on 29 June 1998 in North America, 17 July 1998 in Europe, and 6 December 1998 in Japan as Banjo and Kazooie's Big Adventure (\u30d0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u3068\u30ab\u30ba\u30fc\u30a4\u306e\u5927\u5192\u967a).

The UK date was also set to 16 March 1998 as of Christmas 1997, before being moved to July two months later. In Europe, the game was released in the summer, an active season for Nintendo 64 releases that followed a scarce period and included games of various genres, such as Quest 64 (1998), Mortal Kombat 4 (1998), Off Road Challenge (1998), Dezaemon 3D (1998) and Virtual Chess 64 (1998).

R. R. Tolkien. It was edited and published posthumously by his son Christopher Tolkien in 1977, assisted by Guy Gavriel Kay, who became  a fantasy author. It tells of E\u00e4, a fictional universe that includes the Blessed Realm of Valinor, the ill-fated region of Beleriand, the island of N\u00famenor, and the continent of Middle-earth, where Tolkien's most popular works\u2014The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings\u2014are set. After the success of The Hobbit, Tolkien's publisher, Stanley Unwin, requested a sequel, and Tolkien offered a draft of the writings that would later become The Silmarillion. Unwin rejected this proposal, calling the draft obscure and \"too Celtic\", so Tolkien began working on a new story that eventually became The Lord of the Rings.\nThe Silmarillion has five parts. The first, Ainulindal\u00eb, tells in mythic style of the creation of E\u00e4, the \"world that is.\" The second part, Valaquenta, gives a description of the Valar and Maiar, supernatural powers of E\u00e4. The next section, Quenta Silmarillion, which forms the bulk of the collection, chronicles the history of the events before and during the First Age, including the wars over three jewels, the Silmarils, that gave the book its title. The fourth part, Akallab\u00eath, relates the history of the Downfall of N\u00famenor and its people, which takes place in the Second Age. The final part, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, tells the history of the rings during the Second and Third Ages, ending with a  summary of the events of The Lord of the Rings.\nThe book shows the influence of many sources, including the Finnish epic Kalevala, Greek mythology in the lost island of Atlantis (as N\u00famenor) and the Olympian gods (in the shape of the Valar, though these also resemble the Norse \u00c6sir).\nBecause J. R. R. Tolkien died leaving his legendarium unedited, Christopher Tolkien selected and edited materials to tell the story from start to end. In a few cases, this meant that he had to devise completely new material, within the tenor of his father's thought, to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in the narrative, particularly Chapter 22, \"Of the Ruin of Doriath\".The Silmarillion was commercially successful, but received generally poor reviews on publication. Scholars found the work problematic, not least because the book is a construction, not authorised by Tolkien himself, from the large corpus of documents and drafts also called \"The Silmarillion\". Scholars have noted that Tolkien intended the work to be a mythology, penned by many hands, and redacted by a fictional editor, whether \u00c6lfwine or Bilbo Baggins. As such, the scholar Gergely Nagy considers that the fact that the work has indeed been edited actually realises Tolkien's intention.", "hasanswer": true}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

{"id": "91_673", "question": "What genre is Romance?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_15005", "text": "The Italian was first announced in December 1796. At the time of the novel's release, Ann Ward Radcliffe was already a well-known and well-received Gothic writer. She had gained fame from several of her earlier works, most noticeably The Romance of the Forest in 1791 and The Mysteries of Udolpho in 1794. Her reputation was successful enough to allow her to be read by learned gentlemen as well as young men and women. Because the term 'gothic story\u2019 was not commonly used in this period of time, Radcliffe's contemporaries used the term \u2018romance\u2019 to describe her genre. This term was classified as writing about miraculous tales through the use of poetic prose. This poetic element was referred to in multiple reviews of Radcliffe's The Italian and is considered to be the defining characteristic of the author's many Gothic works. This unique characteristic of her writing set the author apart from other writers of the time and earned her a reputation through the appraisal she received from many well-respected literary voices of the time. In general praise for the author, Sir Walter Scott called her \"the first poetess of romance fiction\"; while Nathan Drake wrote that she was, \"the Shakespeare of Romance writers\". He believed that her readers valued her unrivaled ability to create \u2013 to realise visually \u2013 an enchanted, storied, and landscaped past.In a time where writing novels for commercial consumption was one of the only means through which a female author could earn a respectable living, The Italian was a great financial success for Radcliffe. Because of her reputation and earlier success, the author earned \u00a3800 from the original copyright of the novel, which was considered a very large sum for a female author and was unparalleled by many of Radcliffe's contemporaries.The Italian prompted a wide variety of both favourable and unfavorable reviews, making the overall reception of the novel very mixed. To some critics, it was the high point of Ann Radcliffe's short but productive career; to others, it represented a distinct decline in form from her earlier products.\nMost reviewers were united in believing that the monk Schedoni was the most successful character that Radcliffe had created in any of her novels. Characterised as a man governed by an amalgam of anger, hypocrisy and guilt, the monk was praised as standing apart from the traditional conventions of Gothic protagonists, and many readers approved of his strong personality. Not only was he considered one of the best characters, but one of the best villains; he had \"great energy, with strong passions, and inordinate pride; sometimes softened by the feelings of humanity, but preserving the firmnesss of his mind in the most trying situations\". However, many of these reviews found a fault in the extent of his wicked nature, and others asserted that Radcliffe's careful handling of his character and attempt to implement a touch of parental affection to soften him only served to make him seem less realistic.Reviews that were run in response to The Italian echo these tensions between approval and disappointment in what would be the final novel of Radcliffe's Gothic career. The writer of an 1827 review in the United States Review and Literary Gazette declares his belief that The Italian is Radcliffe's \"greatest work,\" paying particular reverence to the \"masterly dialogues\" in several key scenes, including the interview between Marchesa and Schedoni in the church of San Nicolo as well as the discussion between Schedoni and Spalatro, in which the later refuses to murder Ellena. The writer of a 1797 review in The Monthly Review praised Radcliffe's visual and descriptive language in the novel, citing \"the part\u2026which displays the greatest genius, and the most force of description, is the account of the scenes which passed in the long house on the shore of the Adriatic, between Schedoni, Ellena, and Spalatro: \u2013 The horrible sublimity which characterises the discovery made by the former that Ellena was his daughter, at the instant in which he was about to stab her, was perhaps unparalleled.\u201d This style of 'painting the sublime\u2019 reflects the preference for allegorical or transcendent imagery over physical or realistic imagery in the Gothic literary and artistic period. Originating in the works of Edmund Burke's On the Sublime and Beautiful, which also parallels Radcliffe's preference in the use of terror over horror in her novels. Similarly, a later evaluation in the Edinburgh Review described the mastery of Ann Radcliffe's narrative description as allowing the reader to almost see, feel and experience the events on the Mediterranean alongside the characters.However, various negative reviews emerged and had issues when comparing The Italian to Radcliffe's earlier and more overwhelmingly successful pieces. Several articles commented on the difficulty the author had in maintaining her reputation after her early success. The writer of The English Review\u2019s article on The Italian in December 1796 attempted to make a rational assessment of the disappointment that some people felt in reading the novel, saying that:\n\u201cIt was impossible to raise curiosity and expectation to a higher pitch than she has done in her Mysteries of Udolpho; yet these mysteries she accounted for in a natural manner.\u201d Having been frightened perfectly by Radcliffe before, this critique believed that readers were likely prepared for the twists of The Italian. There was also some unfavorable criticism of the scenes dealing with the Spanish Inquisition, which are sometimes considered too unrealistic or ridiculous to be believable to the audience. A review in The Critical Review from June 1798 stated that, \"Among those parts of the romance which we disapprove, we may reckon the examination before the court of inquisition:  it is so improbable, that we should rather have attributed it to one of Mrs. Radcliffe's numerous imitators.\u201d Despite this, the review went on to say that there still remained several scenes that would successfully seize the imagination and interest the passions of readers.Following Radcliffe's retirement after this novel at the young age of thirty-two, and her death a few decades later, public opinion of her overall works including The Italian swung to a more positive light. Upon her death in 1823, the political and social atmosphere in England had changed again and Radcliffe regained positive assessments of her importance in the history of Gothic writers. In her obituary in the New Monthly Magazine, she was described as \"the able authoress of some of the best romances that ever appeared in the English language;\" in the Literary Gazette she was, \"the finest writer in this kind of fiction that ever existed;\" and in the Gentleman\u2019s Magazine she was noted to have produced romances that we able to be translated into 'every European tongue\u2019 to the 'honour of the country.\u2019", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was Swiny in the late 1720s who encouraged the artist to paint small topographical views of Venice with a commercial appeal for tourists and foreign visitors to the city. Sometime before 1728, Canaletto began his association with Smith, an English businessman and collector living in Venice, who was appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744. Smith later became the artist's principal agent and patron, acquiring nearly fifty paintings, one hundred fifty drawings and fifteen rare etchings from Canaletto, the largest and finest single group of the artist's works, which he sold to King George III in 1763.In the 1740s, Canaletto's market was disrupted when the War of the Austrian Succession led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice. Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of \"capricci\" (or architectural phantasies) (capriccio Italian for fancy) in his vedute ideali, but the returns were not high enough, and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London, to be closer to his market.Whilst in England, between 1749 and 1752 Canaletto lived at number 41 Beak Street in London's Soho district.He remained in England until 1755, producing views of London (including several of the new Westminster Bridge, which was completed during his stay) and of his patrons' houses and castles. These included Northumberland House for Sir Hugh Smithson, Bt., who by marriage later became the 2nd Earl of Northumberland; and Warwick Castle for Lord Brooke, later 1st Earl of Warwick. Smithson was one of the commissioners of Westminster Bridge, and it is \"not impossible\" that he had encouraged Canaletto to come to England and record the beginning of the bridge's life. His 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge includes an image of Canaletto himself.\nHe was often expected to paint England in the fashion with which he had painted his native city. Canaletto's painting began to suffer from repetitiveness, losing its fluidity, and becoming mechanical to the point that the English art critic George Vertue suggested that the man painting under the name 'Canaletto' was an impostor. This may have been because Canaletto's nephew, Bernardo Bellotto, was also using his uncle's nickname; or more likely because the story had been spread by unscrupulous art dealers who had been passing off copies of Canaletto's own work and were anxious to see him return to Venice. Historian Michael Levey described his work from this period as \"inhibited\".In order to refute this claim the artist, through an advertisement in a newspaper, invited \"any Gentleman\" to inspect his latest painting of St. James's Park at his studio in Silver Street (now Beak Street) off Golden Square; however, his reputation never fully recovered in his lifetime.After his return to Venice, Canaletto was elected to the Venetian Academy in 1763 and appointed prior of the Collegio dei Pittori. He continued to paint until his death in 1768. In his later years, he often worked from old sketches, but he sometimes produced surprising new compositions.

GameZone also criticised the combat, stating \"If not for the graphics to carry the game through, XIII would have been a boring game. Gunfights are the best part of the gameplay. It also happens to be the most unbalanced part\". Edge said XIII had \"true artistic merit: it never gets stale; every episode has been drawn with minute care and attention.

GameSpy criticised the graphics and the multiplayer mode, and concluded \"When it comes right down to it, XIII is a fine game...Just don't expect the FPS of the year because, sadly, this isn't it\".GamesTM said \"It's one of those mixed-bag situations \u2013 flashes of genius and genuinely enjoyable moments of success, occasionally mired by unbalanced weapon damage, clumsy AI and the odd bit of unfair level design that requires astounding feats of memory\".

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1904, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.Many young American artists who arrived in Paris in the late 19th-century became Gay's pupils to the extent that the New York Times dubbed him the \"Dean of American Artists in Paris.\" His students who went on to have illustrious careers include: Henry Bacon.\nHis first compositions were still lifes, followed by depictions of 18th-century French peasant life. Later he shifted to genre scenes of realistic depictions of peasants and factory workers.However, beginning around 1895, he abandoned such simple peasant scenes, virtually creating a new genre with his depictions of luxurious interiors. He is most noted for these paintings of opulent interiors show-casing French chateaux and chic private homes. These painterly works display the luxurious detail of domestic interiors which included fine porcelain, furnishings, gilt mirrors, paintings and focused on the \"spirit of an empty room\" by avoiding the inclusion of figures.Gay was also a notable art collector. Following his death in 1937, his widow donated some 200 works of Dutch, Italian, English and French paintings, drawings and illustrations to the Louvre indicating something of the collection's importance.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was the first project for Planet Moon Studios, which consisted of former Shiny Entertainment employees who had worked on the game MDK in 1997. Giants went through four years of development before Interplay Entertainment published it on December 7, 2000, for Microsoft Windows; a Mac OS X port was published by MacPlay in 2001, and the game was also ported to the PlayStation 2 later that year.\nIn the game, players take control of a single character from one of three humanoid races to either complete the story in single-player mode or to challenge other players in online multiplayer matches. They can select heavily armed Meccaryns equipped with jet packs, or amphibious spell-casting Sea Reapers; the game's subtitle, \"Citizen Kabuto\", refers to the last selectable race, a thundering behemoth who can execute earthshaking wrestling attacks to pulverize its enemies. The single-player mode is framed as a sequential story, putting the player through a series of missions, several of which test the player's reflexes in action game-like puzzles.\nGame critics praised Giants for its state-of-the-art graphics on Windows computers, a humorous story, and successfully blending different genres. Criticisms focused on crippling software bugs and the lack of an in-game save feature. The console version rectified some of the flaws found in the PC versions, at the cost of removing several features. The game initially sold poorly for Windows and PlayStation 2; however, it sold well afterwards, and gained a cult following.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Pitchfork editors ranked \"Vogue\" as the 115th best song of the 1990s, praising it for how unapologetically it celebrated queer life at the height of the AIDS epidemic. Rolling Stone listed the track as one of the \"500 Best Songs of All Time\" at number 139, while they named it the 11th greatest dance song of all time. The song was placed by Billboard on the number four spot on its list of \"60 Top LGBTQ Anthems of All Time\", and as part of the 65th anniversary of Billboard Hot 100, the magazine's staff ranked \"Vogue\" as the 186th best pop song that appeared on the chart. Slant Magazine ranked it at number 10 on their \"Best Singles of the '90s\" list, and number three in the list of the 100 Greatest Dance Songs. Music critic Jody Rosen from Slate included \"Vogue\" as one of Madonna's \"ten essential songs for new or aspiring fans\". Time called it \"the most famous fashion song of all time\", although the song was not specifically about the Vogue magazine. It was named the most iconic female dance moment in history in a list elaborated by The Daily Telegraph.\nMany critics and academics agree that with the song, Madonna brought voguing into mainstream culture, and also view it as one of the first mainstream pop culture works to spotlight elements from the queer, Black and Latino-led ballroom scene. Boston.com's Scott Kearnan noted that although Madonna has occasionally been accused of cultural appropriation for taking vogue mainstream, \"she never obfuscated or demeaned its roots\", and completed that \"even at an especially homophobic time, Madonna's gay dancers were shown as front, center, and fabulous, striking a pose alongside the most famous woman on Earth.\" Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone had similar thoughts, criticizing the mainstream's willingness to seriously engage with that culture and craft only when it is presented by white people, but stated that it \"doesn't mean one can\u2019t still revel in the song's brilliance, nor do they necessarily suggest anything malicious on Madonna's part\", as she \"approached 'Vogue' with a clear admiration and respect for the ballroom world.\" For Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, \"Vogue\" was \"the beginning of a new phase for Madonna. It was as if she got a sense of her immortality, and her true power. Feeling secure in her status as a mainstream artist, she began to play with that power and challenge her audience.\" James Rose of Daily Review agreed, writing that with the song Madonna began \"a phase of her career that oscillates between cynical self-exploitation and courageous self-expression. Raunchy videos, explicitly themed lyrics and boudoir beats became de rigueur for the lady now arguably bearing the biggest name in popular music.\"Before Madonna popularized the dance, voguing was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. According to O'Brien, when \"Vogue\" became the \"Number 1 hit of that summer, [it was] played in clubs across the globe, from London to New York to Bali\", also pointing out that it \"rode the crest of the newly emerging dance craze, where club culture, house music and techno met the mainstream. 'Vogue' reflected the new hedonism; positive, upbeat, and totally inclusive\". Liam Hess of Vogue commented that \"this subcultural movement had officially boiled over into the zeitgeist\" as \"many were mimicking the playful, exaggerated gestures of the Harlem ballrooms\" around the world. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated, \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream. She introduced the world to this community who, up until that point in time, had been a subculture.\" Voguing has since become a prominent dance form practised worldwide, and many female performers have followed Madonna's footsteps, adopting the dance style and incorporating it into their music videos and performances.The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death. Erick Henderson of Slant Magazine explained that the song was \"instrumental in allowing disco revivalism to emerge, allowing the denigrated gay genre to soar once again within the context of house music, the genre disco became in its second life.\" Sal Cinquemani of the same publication wrote that the song was \"making its impact all the more impressive (it would go on to inspire a glut of pop-house copycats) and begging the question: If disco died a decade earlier, what the fuck was this big, gay, fuscia drag-queen boa of a dance song sitting on top of the charts for a month for?\" According to Tom Breiham of Stereogum, \"Vogue\" was certainly the first number-one house track ever. He added, \"House, like voguing itself, had been a relatively underground club phenomenon a few years earlier, and it had only started to make inroads into the mainstream. As far as this column is concerned, that breakthrough might be the main legacy of 'Vogue'\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

At Warner's London office, Dickins bumped into songwriter Brian Higgins, who was asked to pitch songs for a Cher album. Three days later, a tape with sixteen of Higgins's songs arrived. \"I lay on my bed and put the tape on and listened to every song. The ninth song was 'Believe'.

Nova hopes Brandon, whom she has a crush on, will ask her to go to the prom. Lloyd Taylor complains to his stepsister, Tess Torres, that he has no date. Mei discovers that she has been accepted at a different university than her boyfriend, Justin Wexler, and worries about telling him. Lucas Arnaz is in love with his lab partner, Simone, and turns to his friend, Corey Doyle, to help him ask her to the prom. The only one who does not care about the prom is Jesse Richter. Principal Dunnan tries to talk but does not get through to him.\nMeanwhile, Jordan Lundley finds an earring in her boyfriend's car, Tyler Barso, but he assures her that he's not cheating. To show his love, he takes her on a date in the shed where the prom decorations are stored; Tyler forgot to extinguish one candle before they left, and the shed is burned down. Nova is left to manufacture replacement props alone. The principal, annoyed at Jesse's lack of respect, gives him a choice: either he helps Nova with the rebuild, or he can't graduate. Jesse accepts reluctantly, as does Nova; and realizes they need each other's cooperation. \nWhile Brandon disappoints Nova by not asking her to the prom, she and Jesse grow closer. When Nova discovers that the prom theme of the neighboring school is the same as theirs, Jesse decides to sneak into their school to check it out. However, the security guard notices them, and the police catch them after they escape.\nAs Lloyd still cannot find a date and becomes frustrated, Lucas asks Simone to a barbecue hosted by his friend Tyler. Tyler tries to talk and flirt with her, but she rejects him because he is dating Jordan. Mei and Justin's relationship reaches its breaking point, and Mei cancels on Justin for fear of telling him about her acceptance. At school, Lucas blows off Corey to spend more time with Simone and invites her to study with him. However, en route to the library, Simone is stopped by Tyler, who convinces her to talk with him about his feelings. Jordan sees the two talking and immediately realizes the situation. After school, Nova apologizes to Jesse for her father's behavior. Later, she brings him along as she goes dress shopping, for a second opinion. Back at school, Simone apologizes to Lucas for having ditched him. She surprises him with tickets to a concert, where Stick Hippo (his and Corey's favorite band) is opening. Lucas wants to take Simone instead of Corey, much to his dismay. Jordan dumps Tyler for his unfaithfulness and decides to go to prom alone. This prompts him to ask Simone to prom, which is the same night as the concert, and she agrees. Simone tells Lucas that she cannot attend the concert.\nMei apologizes to Justin and tells him the truth, but instead of feeling hurt, he tells her he is proud of her, and agrees to attend prom together. As Lloyd gets rejected by another girl, he spots Lucas sitting outside the school, looking dejected. He learns of his situation and tells Lucas his own problem. Two nights before the prom, Nova, Ali, and Mei are in Nova's room, chatting. Nova confesses to them that she has feelings for Jesse, which her father overhears. The next day, Nova's father tells Jesse he cannot ask Nova to prom because he is \"bringing her down\". That afternoon, Jesse is unusually hostile towards Nova and deserts her. On prom night, Lucas climbs a tree to reach Simone's window. He tells her how he feels and begs her not to go to prom, but she does anyway. Disappointed, Lucas realizes what a bad friend he has been to Corey and offers him the other concert ticket.\nAt her house, Nova is heartbroken. Her father explains that he was the one who told Jesse not to ask her to prom. Angered, Nova storms out of the house. At Lloyd's house, it is revealed that he is taking his sister to prom. At Jesse's house, his mother has a talk with him, and he realizes that he should still take Nova to prom. At the school, Tyler leads Simone into the building and almost immediately abandons her. Simone finds out that it was actually Jordan who dumped Tyler, and Tyler had gone to her with no other option. As Tyler and Jordan are pronounced prom king and queen, Jordan refuses to participate in the king-and-queen dance. When Tyler asks Simone to dance, she refuses and leaves.

Winslet was handpicked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind. The character was named Iris after Jude Law's young daughter. A fan of Meyers' previous work on Something's Gotta Give (2003), Winslet, then primarily known for her portrayals in period films, \"loved the idea\" of playing a contemporary English woman in a romantic comedy, a genre she had not done before. Winslet said she had initially felt \"nervous and ... scared about trying to be funny\" at times, stating that \"Jude [Law] and I would speak on the telephone a lot before we started shooting, 'Oh my god, they're going to fire us, they're going to recast, what if we don't make them laugh?\" In preparing for her role, Winslet watched screwball comedies from the 1940s, such as His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story, to study the dialogues and performances.\nCameron Diaz as Amanda Woods:  Amanda is the owner of a successful business that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character \"was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz's performance in the film to Goldie Hawn's, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said.\nJude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\", and single father raising his two daughters (Miffy Englefield as Sophie, and Emma Pritchard as Olivia) by himself after his wife's death. Robert Downey Jr. auditioned for the role. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday.\nJack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend, Ethan. Jimmy Fallon auditioned for the role. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock (2003). On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\"\nEli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man.The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale (2001) together, although they do not share a scene. The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair.\nDustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate (1967). According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster Video to rent a film when he saw the lighting from the film production crew and walked over to see what was happening. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it.Lindsay Lohan, who had made her motion picture debut in Meyers's remake of The Parent Trap (1998), and James Franco, a friend of Meyers, make uncredited appearances in the trailer of the fictional movie Deception, which Amanda and her team finish at the beginning of The Holiday.

Regarding the use of techno-pop music, Nakata stated that he was particularly interested in re-inventing the term \"techno-pop\" for the Japanese music scene; a term first recognised in Western culture in the 1980s, and sonically established by Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra, who used the genre in their studio album Naughty Boys (1983). Nakata also incorporated his post-Shibuya-kei sound, which he had previously used for songs produced with Perfume during their time as an indies idol group, into the tracks on Game.According to Perfume, they were unaware of the techno genre prior to Game; A-Chan stated in an interview with Bomb Magazine, \"Well, we have just gotten to the point where we got to like techno music. But we are on the level that we \u2018like\u2019 it, and we don\u2019t know the depth of it beyond that. I don\u2019t think it is good to go to the next step without learning anything. So I want to know techno to the full first. It may be hard but I want to try at least.\" Nocchi believed that techno music, at the time of Game's release, represented Perfume.AllMusic editor Ian Martin said that Game \"is successful in the way it navigates its various genres and influences, largely thanks to the deft touch and glossy sheen of Nakata's production.\" Japanese magazine CDJournal recognised the influence of techno-pop music, while music website Sputnikmusic described it as \"electropop.\" MTV Iggy reviewed Perfume's catalogue and concluded that Japanese club and electronic culture influenced all of Perfume's studio albums, including Game.

It also presents Camus' concept of absurdism, as well as many examples of human choices. The dilemmas faced by Daru are often seen as representing the dilemmas faced by Camus regarding the Algerian crisis and there are many similarities between the character of Daru and his creator Camus. Both are French Algerians exiled by the choices they have made.\nThe main themes of \"The Guest\" are of choice and accountability. Camus emphasizes, characteristically of existentialist philosophy, that there is always a choice, that the only choice unavailable is not to choose. Daru chooses how he will handle Balducci and whether he will turn in the prisoner; the prisoner chooses whether to go to jail or to freedom. More important, however, is the theme of accountability.  The essence of Camus's philosophy is that everyone is \"condemned\" to an eventual, inevitable death, and accepting this allows for a certain freedom; the prisoner, having achieved self-awareness when Daru gave him the choice to flee or go to jail, realizes the futility of fleeing from the inevitable punishment and goes willingly to jail, thus revolting against the inevitable by making the decision of his own accord and holding himself accountable for the murder.\nDaru's choice can also be seen as a \"damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't\" situation.  Daru makes his decision based on what he believes to be the right thing to do.  The fact that he will be punished for doing the right thing does not make it any less right.  The important point is that people must do what they feel is right, without worrying about how others feel, or about possible rewards or punishments.Yet another theme can be extracted from this short story, however: complete neutrality is unattainable. This is evidenced by Daru's attempt to avoid making a decision; in the end, the Arab makes the decision for him, and he loses his neutrality.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A film this technically clever can't get away with patronizing and familiar genre cliches.\" Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times called the film a \"surprisingly cheesy disaster epic\" while musing, \"The lava keeps flowing for much of the movie, never looking convincing. I loved it when the firemen aimed their hoses way offscreen into the middle of the lava flow, instead of maybe aiming them at the leading edge of the lava\u2014which they couldn't do, because the lava was a visual effect, and not really there.\" In the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote that \"Things go bad after Volcano plays its last card \u2014 the lava \u2014 and from there it has nothing to show but more of the same.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said, \"Volcano is cheese, all right, but it's tangy cheese. I'm not sure I've ever seen a disaster movie in which special effects this realistic and accomplished were put to the service of a premise this outlandish.\"Walter Addiego of the San Francisco Examiner opined  that \"Volcano offers a bit of humor, a minimum of plot distraction and the joys of watching molten rock ooze down Wilshire Boulevard.\" Left equally impressed was James Berardinelli of ReelViews. He described the character of Mike Roark as \"a wonderfully heroic figure \u2014 a man of action who never has time to rest. The fate of the city rests on his shoulders, and he knows it.\" He added: \"Volcano has opened the \"summer\" movie season at an astoundingly early late-April date... This isn't the kind of film where it's worth waiting for the video tape \u2014 it's too big and brash, and demands the speakers and atmosphere of a state-of-the-art theater.\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times asserted that the film \"glows with heat. Lava heat. The coast may be toast, but it's the lava, covering everything like a malevolent tide of melted butter, that makes this a disaster picture that's tastier than usual.\"Writing for Time Out, author TCh said, \"The most striking aspect of this fun, old-fashioned disaster movie is the novelty of seeing the most familiar of backdrops used as a creative resource in its own right.\" Not entirely impressed was Margaret McGurk writing for The Cincinnati Enquirer. She stated that the high-caliber special effects were \"still fun, but all this lock-step storytelling is wearing thin.\" In a hint of commendation, McGurk added, \"On its own escapist terms, Volcano dishes up a textbook serving of low-I.Q., high-energy entertainment.\" Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle called Volcano was a \"laughably ridiculous take on what we all secretly dream of: Los Angeles, washed away in a huge, molten tide of cheese \u2014 uh, lava, I mean.\" Savlov added, \"Screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray have crammed the script with...reams of very, very bad dialogue. So bad, in fact, that the screening audience I viewed Volcano with seemed to enjoy it immensely, hooting and hollering and laughing as though it were an old episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.\"Rita Kempley of The Washington Post  wondered why \"there's no volcano in \"Volcano\"?...The hokey disaster drama features towering plumes of smoke, a splendid display of fireworks and brimstone, and rivers of molten magma, but I'll be darned if there's a burning mountain.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety was more positive, writing that \"first-time screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray waste no time with exposition or scene-setting, starting the fireworks with a nerve-jangling morning earthquake that puts city workers on alert for possible damage.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

I don't mind comparisons. It's not like we are trying to outdo them. We are simply related; The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland are so much a part of us. This is the fantasy world that she (the Labyrinth heroine) has grown up with. These are the stories that have fascinated her.\nRichard Corliss noted that the film appeared to have been influenced by The Wizard of Oz and the works of Maurice Sendak, writing that, \"Labyrinth lures a modern Dorothy Gale out of the drab Kansas of real life into a land where the wild things are\". Nina Darnton of The New York Times wrote that the plot of Labyrinth \"is very similar to Outside Over There by Mr. Sendak, in which 9-year-old Ida's baby sister is stolen by the goblins.\" This almost got the film into legal trouble, as the similarity caused Sendak's lawyers to advise Jim Henson to stop production on the film. However, the legal complaint was eventually settled, with an end credit being added that states that, \"Jim Henson acknowledges his debt to the works of Maurice Sendak\". Sendak's Outside Over There and Where the Wild Things Are are shown briefly in Sarah's room at the start of the film, along with copies of Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, and Grimms' Fairy Tales.\nThe film's concept designer Brian Froud, who had previously collaborated with Henson on The Dark Crystal, has stated that the character of Jareth was influenced by a diverse range of literary sources. In his afterword to the 20th anniversary edition of The Goblins of Labyrinth, Froud wrote that Jareth references \"the romantic figures of Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights and a brooding Rochester from Jane Eyre\" and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Bowie's costumes were intentionally eclectic, drawing on the image of Marlon Brando's leather jacket from The Wild One as well as that of a knight \"with the worms of death eating through his armor\" from Grimms' Fairy Tales. In his audio commentary of Labyrinth, Froud said that Jareth also has influences from Kabuki theatre.The dialogue starting-with phrase \"you remind me of the babe\" that occurs between Jareth and the goblins in the Magic Dance sequence in the film is a direct reference to an exchange between Cary Grant and Shirley Temple in the 1947 film The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer.Labyrinth's \"Escher scene\" features an elaborate staircase set inspired by the art of Dutch artist M.

After the United States entered World War I, in April 1917, and Pershing was named commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front, Patton requested to join his staff. Patton was promoted to captain on May 15, 1917, and left for Europe, among the 180 men of Pershing's advance party which departed May 28 and arrived in Liverpool, England, on June 8. Taken as Pershing's personal aide, Patton oversaw the training of American troops in Paris until September, then moved to Chaumont and was assigned as a post adjutant, commanding the headquarters company overseeing the base. Patton was dissatisfied with the post and began to take an interest in tanks, as Pershing sought to give him command of an infantry battalion. While in a hospital for jaundice, Patton met Colonel Fox Conner, who encouraged him to work with tanks instead of infantry.On November 10, 1917, Patton was assigned to establish the AEF Light Tank School. He left Paris and reported to the French Army's tank training school at Champlieu near Orrouy, where he drove a Renault FT light tank. On November 20, the British launched an offensive towards the important rail center of Cambrai, using an unprecedented number of tanks. At the conclusion of his tour on December 1, Patton went to Albert, 30 miles (48 km) from Cambrai, to be briefed on the results of this attack by the chief of staff of the British Tank Corps, Colonel J. F. C. Fuller. On the way back to Paris, he visited the Renault factory to observe French tanks being manufactured. Patton was promoted to major on January 26, 1918. He received the first ten tanks on March 23, 1918, at the tank school at Bourg, a small village close to Langres, Haute-Marne d\u00e9partement. The only US soldier with tank-driving experience, Patton personally backed seven of the tanks off the train. In the post, Patton trained tank crews to operate in support of infantry, and promoted its acceptance among reluctant infantry officers. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on April 3, 1918, and attended the Command and General Staff College in Langres.\nIn August 1918, he was placed in charge of the U.S. 1st Provisional Tank Brigade (redesignated the 304th Tank Brigade on November 6, 1918). Patton's Light Tank Brigade was part of Colonel Samuel Rockenbach's Tank Corps, part of the American First Army. Personally overseeing the logistics of the tanks in their first combat use by U.S. forces, and reconnoitering the target area for their first attack himself, Patton ordered that no U.S. tank be surrendered. Patton commanded American-crewed Renault FT tanks at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, leading the tanks from the front for much of their attack, which began on September 12. He walked in front of the tanks into the German-held village of Essey, and rode on top of a tank during the attack into Pannes, seeking to inspire his men.While outside the village of Essey he had his first chance meeting with Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, then commanding a brigade of the 42nd \"Rainbow\" Division, who, at just thirty-eight, was already one of the most highly decorated officers in the AEF, and with whom Patton would serve later in his career.\nMuch has been made of this chance encounter but it was actually brief and inconsequential. A few words were exchanged before Patton moved on. What was significant about it was that one well-placed German shell that morning would have wiped out two of the most significant and controversial figures of World War II at a single stroke.\nPatton's brigade was then moved to support I Corps for the upcoming Meuse\u2013Argonne offensive, which began on September 26. He personally led a troop of tanks through thick fog as they advanced 5 miles (8 km) into German lines. Around 09:00, Patton was wounded while leading six men and a tank in an attack on German machine guns near the town of Cheppy. His orderly, Private First Class Joe Angelo, saved Patton, for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. Although the 35th Division (of which Patton's tank troop was a component) eventually captured Varennes, it did so with heavy losses. Trying to move his reserve tanks forward, Patton relates that he might have killed one of his own men, stating: \"Some of my reserve tanks were stuck by some trenches. So I went back and made some Americans hiding in the trenches dig a passage. I think I killed one man here. He would not work so I hit him over the head with a shovel.\"\nPatton stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E. Brett, commander of the U.S. 326th Tank Battalion, took command of the brigade in Patton's absence. Patton wrote in a letter to his wife: \"The bullet went into the front of my left leg and came out just at the crack of my bottom about two inches to the left of my rectum. It was fired at about 50 m [160 ft] so made a hole about the size of a [silver] dollar where it came out.\"While recuperating from his wound, Patton was promoted to temporary colonel in the Tank Corps of the U.S. National Army on October 17. He returned to duty on October 28 but saw no further action before hostilities ended on his 33rd birthday with the armistice of November 11, 1918. For his actions in Cheppy, Patton received the Silver Star, later upgraded to the DSC. The citation for the medal read:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Colonel (Armor) George Smith Patton, Jr. (ASN: 0-2605), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with Tank Corps, A.E.F., near Cheppy, France, 26 September 1918. Colonel Patton displayed conspicuous courage, coolness, energy, and intelligence in directing the advance of his brigade down the valley of the Aire. Later he rallied a force of disorganized infantry and led it forward, behind the tanks, under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire until he was wounded. Unable to advance further, Colonel Patton continued to direct the operations of his unit until all arrangements for turning over the command were completed.\nFor his leadership of the tank brigade and tank school, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the citation for which reads:\n\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Colonel (Tank Corps) George Smith Patton, Jr. (ASN: 0-2605), United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. By his energy and sound judgment, Colonel Patton rendered very valuable services in his organization and direction of the Tank Center at the Army schools at Langres, France. In the employment of Tank Corps troops in combat he displayed high military attainments, zeal, and marked adaptability in a form of warfare comparatively new to the American Army.\nIn addition, he was also awarded the Purple Heart for his combat wounds after the decoration was created in 1932.\nOn 11 November 1918, World War I ended. In the months and years that followed Patton was haunted by his experience in the Meuse\u2013Argonne. Although he emerged from the war with honours and acclaim, the year 1918 took its toll and the price was indeed high. Contrary to his image as a tough guy, Patton was deeply affected by the horror of war and suffered from post-traumatic stress. What had been a high on the battlefield turned into the giant letdown that is so common to soldiers who have been in combat.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Pitchfork editors ranked \"Vogue\" as the 115th best song of the 1990s, praising it for how unapologetically it celebrated queer life at the height of the AIDS epidemic. Rolling Stone listed the track as one of the \"500 Best Songs of All Time\" at number 139, while they named it the 11th greatest dance song of all time. The song was placed by Billboard on the number four spot on its list of \"60 Top LGBTQ Anthems of All Time\", and as part of the 65th anniversary of Billboard Hot 100, the magazine's staff ranked \"Vogue\" as the 186th best pop song that appeared on the chart. Slant Magazine ranked it at number 10 on their \"Best Singles of the '90s\" list, and number three in the list of the 100 Greatest Dance Songs. Music critic Jody Rosen from Slate included \"Vogue\" as one of Madonna's \"ten essential songs for new or aspiring fans\". Time called it \"the most famous fashion song of all time\", although the song was not specifically about the Vogue magazine. It was named the most iconic female dance moment in history in a list elaborated by The Daily Telegraph.\nMany critics and academics agree that with the song, Madonna brought voguing into mainstream culture, and also view it as one of the first mainstream pop culture works to spotlight elements from the queer, Black and Latino-led ballroom scene. Boston.com's Scott Kearnan noted that although Madonna has occasionally been accused of cultural appropriation for taking vogue mainstream, \"she never obfuscated or demeaned its roots\", and completed that \"even at an especially homophobic time, Madonna's gay dancers were shown as front, center, and fabulous, striking a pose alongside the most famous woman on Earth.\" Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone had similar thoughts, criticizing the mainstream's willingness to seriously engage with that culture and craft only when it is presented by white people, but stated that it \"doesn't mean one can\u2019t still revel in the song's brilliance, nor do they necessarily suggest anything malicious on Madonna's part\", as she \"approached 'Vogue' with a clear admiration and respect for the ballroom world.\" For Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, \"Vogue\" was \"the beginning of a new phase for Madonna. It was as if she got a sense of her immortality, and her true power. Feeling secure in her status as a mainstream artist, she began to play with that power and challenge her audience.\" James Rose of Daily Review agreed, writing that with the song Madonna began \"a phase of her career that oscillates between cynical self-exploitation and courageous self-expression. Raunchy videos, explicitly themed lyrics and boudoir beats became de rigueur for the lady now arguably bearing the biggest name in popular music.\"Before Madonna popularized the dance, voguing was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. According to O'Brien, when \"Vogue\" became the \"Number 1 hit of that summer, [it was] played in clubs across the globe, from London to New York to Bali\", also pointing out that it \"rode the crest of the newly emerging dance craze, where club culture, house music and techno met the mainstream. 'Vogue' reflected the new hedonism; positive, upbeat, and totally inclusive\". Liam Hess of Vogue commented that \"this subcultural movement had officially boiled over into the zeitgeist\" as \"many were mimicking the playful, exaggerated gestures of the Harlem ballrooms\" around the world. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated, \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream. She introduced the world to this community who, up until that point in time, had been a subculture.\" Voguing has since become a prominent dance form practised worldwide, and many female performers have followed Madonna's footsteps, adopting the dance style and incorporating it into their music videos and performances.The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death. Erick Henderson of Slant Magazine explained that the song was \"instrumental in allowing disco revivalism to emerge, allowing the denigrated gay genre to soar once again within the context of house music, the genre disco became in its second life.\" Sal Cinquemani of the same publication wrote that the song was \"making its impact all the more impressive (it would go on to inspire a glut of pop-house copycats) and begging the question: If disco died a decade earlier, what the fuck was this big, gay, fuscia drag-queen boa of a dance song sitting on top of the charts for a month for?\" According to Tom Breiham of Stereogum, \"Vogue\" was certainly the first number-one house track ever.

Marsh said \"Fat Bottomed Girls\" treated women \"not as sex objects but as objects, period (the way the band regards people in general)\", and finished by famously tagging Queen \"the first truly fascist rock band\". Mitchell Cohen of Creem gave another negative review, calling Jazz \"absurdly dull\" and filled with \"dumb ideas and imitative posturing\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said the album was not wholly bad, even finding \"Bicycle Race\" humorous, although he said Queen sounded like the band 10cc \"with a spoke, or a pump, up their ass\". The Los Angeles Times concluded that, \"while the surfaces remain as mainstream and as accessible as ever, there's a maturity to Queen that suggests even more advances are possible.\"In a retrospective assessment, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as \"one of their sleekest albums.\" He cited that the album's diversity and exaggeration made it \"more fun than any of their other albums.\" Alexis Petridis wrote in The Guardian, \"Jazz was hysterical in every sense of the word, but the music press comprehensively failed to get the joke, particularly in the US\". In 2006, Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times included it in his list of \"The Great Albums,\" describing it as \"a genre-hopping tour of diverse musical styles\" and concluded that \"What ultimately keeps me coming back to the album, however, is that ambiguous sexual energy running through all 13 tracks; the fact that each of them boasts more hooks than some bands have on an entire album, and the inviting sonic density of it all.\" Chicago Tribune was less favorable, awarding the album 1 and a half stars.\nWhen Loudersound ranked every Queen album from best to worst, Jazz came fourth, as they felt it presented \"some of the most satisfying moments in Queen's career.\" In a similar list of the band's greatest albums, Ultimate Classic Rock placed Jazz in third position. \"Whenever discussions take place about Queen's incredible string of classic albums throughout the late '70s,\" they wrote, \"1978's 'Jazz' is the one that often seems to get the shortest shrift, but tucked away behind its unusually nondescript cover art lies one of the band's finest albums.

In spite of the apparent conclusion, this was then followed by a weekly television series, V: The Series, from 1984 to 1985 that continued the story a year after The Final Battle. Johnson left V during production of The Final Battle due to disagreements with NBC over how the story should progress.In November 2005, Entertainment Weekly named V one of the 10 best miniseries on DVD.

After playing a set of two songs (a cover of Metallica's Creeping Death and an original song penned by Moggridge called \"No Man's Land\") and enjoying the experience, the guys decided to continue and pursue the band full-time taking the Epidemic name from the Slayer song.\nAfter recruiting drummer Geoff Bruce and vocalist Carl Fulli to complete the lineup, the band entered a Battle of the Bands contest held at the Mountain View Theater in September 1987.  Having only recruited Fulli a couple of weeks prior, and having no previous experience, the band had no real expectations of winning the contest.  After the first night of competition the band had reached the finals and subsequently won the competition the next night. They won an opening slot for Death Angel the following month.\nThe band recorded their first demo, \"Immortal Minority\", in December 1987.  Achieving minor success in the Bay Area and playing almost every thrash show at the Mountain View Theater, with the likes of Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Death Angel, D.R.I., etc. the band started to branch out further, playing shows at the Stone in San Francisco and the Omni in Oakland.\n\nIn the fall of 1988, Epidemic came to the conclusion that they needed a drummer with further advanced double kick skills and Bruce agreed to leave the band. They recruited Bobby Cochran, a longtime friend and former Punisher drummer, to take over duties. With this line-up, Epidemic went into Telluride Studios in Palo Alto to record their demo, \"Demo '89\".  The band initially gave out 300 free demos after a Vio-lence show at the Omni and their popularity grew tremendously. The band sent out the demo to many magazines, radio stations and labels and created a name for themselves globally.  The band estimates that they sold roughly 5,000-7,000 demos on their own over the next two years. During this time the band was able to headline venues on their own. Epidemic's first headline show at the Stone was filled at 90% capacity. They also reached agreement with Marco Barbieri, who years later would become the head of the label Century Media Records, to become their manager. In addition, a deal was reached with Metalcore Records in Europe for the release of \"Demo '89\" on CD and vinyl. It would be the first official CD released by the band under the title The Truth of What Will Be, though it was only released in Europe.\nIn January 1991, the band recorded another demo, titled \"Extremities '91\", which led to their signing of a record contract with Metal Blade Records. The band recorded their United States debut album, Decameron, at HOS studios in Palo Alto. The album was released in the summer of 1992. The band went on a two-week East Coast tour with Malevolent Creation and Suffocation in December 1992 to support it, and eight weeks later headed out on a nationwide tour with Cannibal Corpse and Unleashed in early 1993. Epidemic gained considerable exposure as well as experience, as this was what they thought was the beginning of their touring years.\nAfter coming home from the tours the band focused on writing new material but asked Higbey to leave the band. This was a difficult decision for the band but they moved forward as a four-piece and continued to write and prepare for their next album. Entering Razor's Edge studios in San Francisco in the fall of 1993, the band recorded their album, Exit Paradise, which was released in October 1994. The band decided to break up a couple months after the release of this album  due to differences in the band and the label's lack of support.\nIn 2011 Divebomb Records approached the band to release all of the band's demos (Immortal Minority-1988, Demo '89-1989, and Extremities '91-1991) as a single release on CD.

The Boer War of 1899 split the Liberal Party into Imperialist and Pro-Boer factions, with CB strongly critical of the use of concentration camps as 'methods of barbarism'. Campbell-Bannerman faced the difficult task of holding together the strongly divided party, which was subsequently and unsurprisingly defeated in the \"khaki election\" of 1900. Campbell-Bannerman caused particular friction within his own party when in a speech to the National Reform Union in June 1901 and shortly after meeting Emily Hobhouse, he described the concentration camps set up by the British in the Boer War as \"methods of barbarism\".The Liberal Party was later able to unify over its opposition to the Education Act 1902 and the Brussels Sugar Convention of 1902, in which Britain and nine other nations attempted to stabilise world sugar prices by setting up a commission to investigate export bounties and decide on penalties. The Conservative Government of Arthur Balfour had threatened countervailing duties and subsidies of West Indian sugar producers as a negotiating tool. The convention's intent was to lead to the gradual phasing out of export bounties, and Britain would then forbid the importation of subsidised sugar. In a speech to the Cobden Club on 28 November 1902, Campbell-Bannerman denounced the convention as threatening the sovereignty of Britain.\n\nIt means that we abandon our fiscal independence, together with our free-trade ways; that we subside into the tenth part of a Vehmgericht which is to direct us what sugar is to be countervailed, at what rate per cent. we are to countervail it, how much is to be put on for the bounty, and how much for the tariff being in excess of the convention tariff; and this being the established order of things, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in his robes obeys the orders that he receives from this foreign convention, in which the Britisher is only one out of ten, and the House of Commons humbly submits to the whole transaction. (\"Shame.\") Sir, of all the insane schemes ever offered to a free country as a boon this is surely the maddest.\nHowever, it was Joseph Chamberlain's proposals for Tariff Reform in May 1903 that provided the Liberals with a great and nationally resonating cause on which to campaign and unify, due to its protectionist nature. Chamberlain's proposals dominated politics through the rest of 1903 up until the general election of 1906. Campbell-Bannerman, like other Liberals, held an unshakeable belief in free trade. In a speech at Bolton on 15 October 1903, he explained in greater detail the reasoning behind Liberal support for free trade.\n\nWe are satisfied that it is right because it gives the freest play to individual energy and initiative and character and the largest liberty both to producer and consumer. We say that trade is injured when it is not allowed to follow its natural course, and when it is either hampered or diverted by artificial obstacles.... We believe in free trade because we believe in the capacity of our countrymen. That at least is why I oppose protection root and branch, veiled and unveiled, one-sided or reciprocal. I oppose it in any form. Besides we have experience of fifty years, during which our prosperity has become the envy of the world.\nIn 1903, the Liberal Party's Chief Whip Herbert Gladstone negotiated a pact with Ramsay MacDonald of the Labour Representation Committee to withdraw Liberal candidates to help LRC candidates in certain seats, in return for LRC withdrawal in other seats to help Liberal candidates. This attempt to undermine and outflank the Conservatives, which would prove to be successful, formed what became known as the \"Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact\". Campbell-Bannerman got on well with Labour leaders, and he said in 1903 \"we are keenly in sympathy with the representatives of Labour. We have too few of them in the House of Commons\". Despite this comment, and his sympathies with many elements of the Labour movement, he was not a socialist. One biographer has written that \"he was deeply and genuinely concerned about the plight of the poor and so had readily adopted the rhetoric of progressivism, but he was not a progressive\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Dippold wrote the spec script on the side while fulfilling writing duties on Parks and Recreation and, ultimately, it sold to producer Peter Chernin for $600,000 prior to even being presented to prospective bidders. Inspired by the buddy cop film genre, primarily examples such as Running Scared (1986) and Lethal Weapon (1987), Dippold set out to write a film in which the leads were portrayed by women. As Dippold explains, \"[In] Running Scared, they go down to the Caribbean and there's this montage of them on scooters, and there's a different hot girl on the back every time it cuts back to the scooter. And it just felt like, I don't want to be the girl on the back of the scooter. I want to be the awesome cop doing this stuff.\"Despite the success of Bridesmaids (2011), studio executives were still uncertain of an action film with a female-led cast. \"There were people suspicious of this attempt, who thought girls won't want to see a cop action movie and guys won't want to see two girls holding guns and we'd cancel out our potential audience,\" said producer Jenno Topping. \"But we really believed, at the end of the day, it wouldn't be about gender as much as it would be about delivering a courageous action comedy with some heart to it.\"\n\nOn May 19, 2012, director Paul Feig and actresses Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy signed on to the film after previously struggling to close deals due to scheduling and payment conflicts.

I admired the Francesco passages rather than feeling engrossed by them and occasionally it felt as if Smith's ideas were so clever they were in danger of getting in the way of the story. But there is no doubt that Smith is dazzling in her daring. The sheer inventive power of her new novel pulls you through, gasping, to the final page.\"\nLaura Miller, in The Guardian comments on duality of the novel: \"While I do not doubt the two halves of How to Be Both may be read in either order with satisfying results, once read, it's impossible to know what it would be like to first encounter it in the alternate order... How to Be Both is unforgettable. I can never know what it would be like to meet George before knowing Del Cossa, so that version of the novel is forever lost to me. It's a bit sad. But it was worth it.\"\nArifa Akbar in The Independent also comments on the dual narrative, writing that \"Smith has written a radical novel, one that becomes two novels, with discrete meanings, through its (re)ordering... How to be Both shows us that the arrangement of a story, even when it's the same story, can change our understanding of it and define our emotional attachments. We may have known this, but to see it enacted with such imagination is dazzling indeed. Those writers making doomy predictions about the death of the novel should read Smith's re-imagined novel/s, and take note of the life it contains.\"\nPatrick Flanery of The Telegraph finds that \"The pain of mourning and loss is seared into the lives of Smith\u2019s two motherless heroines, but despite the novel\u2019s refusal of consolation and the profound seriousness of the questions it explores, How to be Both brims with palpable joy, not only at language, literature, and art\u2019s transformative power, but at the messy business of being human, of wanting to be more than one kind of person at once. The possibilities unleashed by the desire to be neither one thing nor the other means that one may ever and always strive to be both. With great subtlety and inventiveness, Smith continues to expand the boundaries of the novel\".\nRon Charles of The Washington Post writes that \"This gender-blending, genre-blurring story, bounces across centuries, tossing off profound reflections on art and grief, without getting tangled in its own postmodern wires.

{"id": "91_764", "question": "What genre is Love Story?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When asked about the Cube, Mr. Thomas states that he has asked himself that question many times where it is too good to be true. Mr. Thomas shows the Man the Call Button that he should push if he ever needs anything. Mr. Thomas then works to deny the fact that there are other Cubes like this while stating that while some people are quite content and stay in the Cube, others would wish to leave. As Mr. Thomas leaves, he tells the Man that he must find his own door.\nArnie returns again where he gives the Man a telephone and states that he can get him anything he wants. Arnie exclaims that the only trouble with this establishment is that there is no organization and The Man wouldn't believe the weirdos that run it. He also talks about the four tons of chocolate rabbits while mentioning that he's been working here for 14 years where there hasn't been a request for chocolate rabbits. As Arnie goes outside to call the Man to see if the telephone is working, the Man sees a brief opening until the telephone rings and Mr. Thomas briefly appears to give the receiver to him before leaving.

Arnie states to the Man that he is actually spraying deodorant and that Miss Bix can't tell the difference. Before leaving, Arnie stops the Man from following him since this is Arnie's door.\nA guitarist comes in and gives the Man the keys to the handcuffs which frees the Man. Upon finding a bed that manifested, the Man rests on it while the guitarist practices his music. The guitarist is then joined by the rest of his band as they sing a song to the Man about never getting out of the Cube. After the band leaves, Mr. Thomas briefly enters telling the Man that the \"Rest Period\" is over.\nA prisoner named Watson enters the Cube having escaped from his Cube. He notices that the Man hasn't been here for long while mentioning how his Cube had squares while the Man's Cube has rectangles. Watson tells the Man that he had to tell how many times has passed by making marks in his thumbnail which didn't work when he lost his thumbnails.

The image of the party then disappears as it shows the Man on his stool.\nAfter a panel briefly opens where an old man asks if he has considered that he is dead and this is what his afterlife is like, the Man is visited by a scientist who asks the Man to define reality for him. When the Man claims that the hammer doesn't exist, the scientist proves him wrong by throwing the hammer at one of the cube's walls causing a hole in it. Arnie reprimands the scientist for breaking the wall and gives him his hammer back while he gets the wall fixed.

Arnie fixes the hole and leaves stating that the scientist is a real pain in the neck.\nA woman named Liza enters where she gives the Man a hint on how to get out which is \"it's going to get worse before it gets better\". Her other hint is \"don't trust anybody\" as she turns into an elderly-like appearance. After she leaves, Mr. Thomas enters stating that the Man's time is up and that he must leave. As the Man tries to leave through the door that Mr. Thomas claims to be the Man's door, the Man has his suspicions in which if he steps out the door, two gorillas in ballerina dresses would grab him, drag him back into the cube, throw him to the ground, and dance around him singing \"Home! Sweet Home!\" The Man attempts to step out and is assaulted by the ballerina-dressed gorillas (depicted as two men in gorilla suits) in the manner that he described where they substitute \"home\" with \"the Cube.\" Mr. Thomas leaves stating that the Man is getting pretty good at predicting these things.\nTwo comics and enter and tell jokes to the audience. They then turn their attention to the Man when they find that he wasn't joining in on the laughter. The Man states that he just didn't feel like laughing. The comics then laugh at the Man before leaving.\nA kid on a tricycle rides around the Cube mocking the Man stating that he's never going to get out of the Cube and then leaves.\nA monk enters and disperses his wisdom onto the Man while stating that he is part of the \"All.\" Before leaving, the monk gives the Man an orb called the Ramadar which is supposed to hold the meaning of life. After the monk leaves, the Ramadar only makes a grinding noise. The Man smashes it with the stool to find that inexplicably it is made of strawberry jam inside. Arnie comes in and cleans up the broken Ramadar stating that most people break their Ramadar. Arnie then leaves with the broken Ramadar and the broken stool. After six people bring in a coffin, the Man finds a gun is left in the room. Grabbing the gun, the man attempts to shoot himself and ink squirts onto his face.\nAll the people he had encountered enter and laugh at him as Arnie states that this is all a joke. Enraged, he tells them he's had enough with their tricks and that no matter what happens he knows he is real. The Man then leaves the Cube as the people applaud him. The Man is then escorted into an office so that the head of the organization can sign his release. Once there, the Man reflects on the revelation of his own realness. He accidentally cuts himself with a knife while demonstrating and is asked to taste his blood. He does so and discovers his blood is strawberry jam. The head of the organization and his office fade away to reveal the Man is still trapped in the cube.\nAs the credits roll, the Man wanders around the room one last time and then sits down on the floor apparently resigned to his fate of never getting out while the band's song is reprised in the background.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The vast scope of Touhou Project derivatives prompted commentary, noting that Touhou Project became an unmissable aspect of Japanese consumer generated media. These d\u014djin activities are mostly responsible for adding original attributes to characters that ZUN may not have intended. ZUN, for the most part, had acknowledged, appreciated, and even encouraged these derivative works by imposing very few restrictions on the use of his works.

ZUN stated himself that he did not want the Touhou Project game series to be officially commercialized.\n\nThe first publication of Touhou derivative doujinshi occurred during December 2003, following the release of Perfect Cherry Blossom; seven circles sold Touhou derivative works at Comiket 65 in December 2003.

Throughout the mid-2010s, Touhou's popularity at Comiket began to diminish. From 2015 to 2017, Kantai Collection was consistently the most popular series at Comiket. By 2019, Touhou was the fourth most popular series at Comiket, with less than half the circles at Comiket than the Fate series.The d\u014djin games based on Touhou include adaptations of other game series' mechanics with Touhou characters, such as K\u014dmaj\u014d Densetsu: Scarlet Symphony (a parody of the Castlevania games with the title being a play on the Japanese game of the series, Akumaj\u014d Dracula), Age of Ethanols (based on the Age of Empires series), and Touhou Puppet Dance Performance (based on the Pok\u00e9mon games).At Tokyo Game Show 2014, ZUN announced a collaborative project with PlayStation bringing unofficial, fan-made Touhou Project d\u014djin games to the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and PlayStation Vita platforms. Yuyuko Saigyouji and Reimu Hakurei also made cameo character appearances in Square Enix's game Lord of Vermilion Re:2.The music of Touhou has been a particular source of interest, and many arrangement CDs are sold at Comiket and other Japanese conventions. Among the most popular derivatives are the series of Flash music videos created by the d\u014djin music circle IOSYS, which are often shared on otaku internet forums and Nico Nico Douga.

Halloween popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. Halloween helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s. Due to its popularity, Halloween became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed, and that others like Scream parodied.The major themes present in Halloween also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in Halloween, there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.There are slasher films that predated Halloween, such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972),  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Black Christmas (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. Halloween, however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others. Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of Halloween,\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting. Rockoff considers the film \"the blueprint for all slashers and the model against which all subsequent films are judged.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Excavations at Wilson Butte Cave near Twin Falls in 1959 revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America. American Indian peoples predominant in the area included the Nez Perc\u00e9 in the north and the Northern and Western Shoshone in the south.A Late Upper Paleolithic site was identified at Cooper's Ferry in western Idaho near the town of Cottonwood by archaeologists in 2019. Based on evidence found at the site, first people lived in this area 15,300 to 16,600 years ago, predating the Beringia land bridge by about a thousand years. The discoverers emphasized that they possess similarities with tools and artifacts discovered in Japan that date from 16,000 to 13,000 years ago. The discovery also showed that the first people might not have come to North America by land, as previously theorized. On the contrary, they probably came through the water, using a Pacific coastal route.\nThe most parsimonious explanation we think is that people came down the Pacific Coast, and as they encountered the mouth of the Columbia River, they essentially found an off-ramp from this coastal migration and also found their first viable interior route to the areas that are south of the ice sheet.\nAn early presence of French-Canadian trappers is visible in names and toponyms: Nez Perc\u00e9, C\u0153ur d'Al\u00e8ne, Bois\u00e9, Payette. Some of these names appeared prior to the Lewis and Clark and Astorian expeditions, which included significant numbers of French and M\u00e9tis guides recruited for their familiarity with the terrain.Idaho, as part of the Oregon Country, was claimed by both the United States and Great Britain until the United States gained undisputed jurisdiction in 1846. From 1843 to 1859, present-day Idaho was under the de facto jurisdiction of the Provisional Government of Oregon. When Oregon became a state in 1859, what is now Idaho was situated in what remained of the original Oregon Territory, designated as the Washington Territory.\nBetween 1849 and the creation of the Idaho Territory in 1863, parts of present-day Idaho were included in the Oregon, Washington, and Dakota Territories. The new Idaho territory included present-day Idaho, Montana, and most of Wyoming. The Lewis and Clark expedition crossed Idaho in 1805 on the way to the Pacific, and in 1806, on the return trip, largely following the Clearwater River in both directions. The first non-indigenous settlement was Kullyspell House, established on the shore of Lake Pend Oreille in 1809 by David Thompson of the North West Company for fur trading. In 1812 Donald Mackenzie, working for the Pacific Fur Company at the time, established a post on the lower Clearwater River near present-day Lewiston. This post, known as \"MacKenzie's Post\" or \"Clearwater\", operated until the Pacific Fur Company was bought out by the North West Company in 1813, after which the post was abandoned. The first organized non-indigenous communities within the present borders of Idaho were established by Mormon pioneers in 1860. The first permanent, substantial incorporated community was Lewiston, in 1861. Early in its history, Idaho saw a large influx of Chinese immigrants, who by 1870 made up about 28.5% of the territory's population.Idaho achieved statehood in 1890, following a difficult start as a territory, including the chaotic transfer of the territorial capital from Lewiston to Boise, disenfranchisement of Mormon polygamists upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1890, and a federal attempt to split the territory between Washington Territory, which gained statehood in 1889, a year before Idaho, and the state of Nevada which had been a state since 1864.Idaho was one of the hardest hit of the Pacific Northwest states during the Great Depression. Prices plummeted for Idaho's major crops: in 1932 a bushel of potatoes brought only ten cents compared to 1919 for $1.51, while Idaho farmers saw their annual income of $686 in 1929 drop to $250 by 1932.In recent years, Idaho has expanded its commercial base as a tourism and agricultural state to include science and technology industries. Science and technology have become the largest single economic center (over 25% of the state's total revenue) within the state and are greater than agriculture, forestry and mining combined.During the COVID-19 pandemic, Idaho enacted statewide crisis standards of care as COVID-19 patients overwhelmed hospitals.

{"id": "91_776", "question": "What genre is Frans Floris I?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_39874", "text": "Frans Floris was born in Antwerp. He was the scion of a prominent artist family which originally went with the name \u2018de Vriendt\u2019. The earliest known ancestors of the Floris de Vriendt family, then still called only \u2018de Vriendt\u2019, were residents of Brussels where they practiced the craft of stonemason and stonecutter which was passed on from father to son. One of Frans' ancestors became in 1406 a master of the Brussels stonemasons guild. A family member, Jan Florisz. de Vriendt, left his native Brussels and settled in Antwerp in the mid-15th century. His patronymic name \u2018Floris\u2019 became the common family name in subsequent generations. The original form \u2018de Vriendt\u2019 can, however, still be found in official documents until the late 16th century.Frans' brothers were prominent artists. The most famous one is Cornelis who was an architect and sculptor and was one of the designers of the Antwerp City Hall. Jacob Floris was a painter of stained-glass windows and Jan Floris was a potter. Jan traveled to Spain to practice his art there and died young. \n\nDocumentary evidence about the life of Frans Floris is scarce. Most of what we know about the youth and training of Frans Floris is based on the early biographer Karel van Mander's biography of the artist. At ten pages long it is one of the most detailed biographies in van Mander's Het Schilder-boeck published in 1604. According to van Mander, Frans Floris was the son of the stonecutter Cornelis I de Vriendt (died 1538). Like his brothers, Frans began as a student of sculpture, but later he gave up sculpture for painting. Floris went to Li\u00e8ge where he studied with the prominent painter Lambert Lombard. The choice for Lombard as a teacher was surprising since Antwerp was a cultural centre with many outstanding painters. He may have chosen Lombard as his brother Cornelis was good friends with Lombard, whom he had met in Rome around 1538. It is also possible that Frans trained as a painter in Antwerp before studying under Lombard. Floris became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1539\u201340.Lombard encouraged Frans Floris to study in Italy. He traveled to Rome probably as early as 1541 or 1542 and became fascinated with Italian contemporary painting (particularly Michelangelo and Raphael) and the Classical sculpture and art of Rome. He kept a notebook of sketches, which his pupils would later etch. Floris visited other cities in Italy including Mantua and Genoa.\nUpon his return to Antwerp around 1545, Frans Floris opened a workshop on the Italian model. He became the leading history painter and was called the \u2018Flemish Raphael\u2019. He enjoyed the patronage of prominent personalities such as the wealthy Antwerp banker Niclaes Jonghelinck for whose house he painted a series of ten compositions on the legend of Hercules and seven compositions on the liberal arts. He also painted 14 large panels for the duke of Aarschot's palace of Beaumont. Local nobility including the knights of the Golden Fleece, the Prince of Orange and the Counts of Egmont and Horn (later the leaders of the Dutch Revolt) visited Floris at his home, attracted by his artistic reputation as well as his ability to talk with \u2018great insight and judgment on any topic\u2019. He also moved in the circle of the leading humanists such as Abraham Ortelius, Christophe Plantin, Lucas de Heere, Lambert Lombard, Dominicus Lampsonius and Hieronymus Cock. This group of intellectuals and artists was the first to develop theories on art and the role of artists in the Low Countries. In 1549 Floris was commissioned by the Antwerp city authorities to design the decorations for the Joyous entry into Antwerp of Charles V of Spain and the Infante Philip.\nHis brother Cornelis designed a palace for him in Antwerp with a fa\u00e7ade of blue limestone and with luxurious decorations such as gilded leather wall-coverings in the bedroom. The fa\u00e7ade itself was designed by Frans. His design program for the fa\u00e7ade was intended to illustrate the high status of artists in society. He painted the fa\u00e7ade with seven personifications symbolizing the qualities and skills of an artist: Accuracy (Diligentia), Practice (Usus), Labor (Labor), Diligence (Industria), Experience (Experientia), Praise (Lauda) and Architecture (Architectura). Above the doorway of the house a relief depicted the sciences (the seven liberal arts together with painting and architectures) as the principal components of human society. The unknown monogrammist TG portrayed the fa\u00e7ade in 1576 in a print. Jozef Linnig made a drawing of the palace in the 19th century but by that time most of the decoration of the fa\u00e7ade had disappeared. Floris expressed similar ideas in his composition The awakening of the Arts (Museo de Arte de Ponce).In 1547 Floris married Clara Boudewijns and the couple had one daughter and two sons. The sons Frans and Baptist were later trained as artists by their father. Baptist died young while Frans moved to Italy where he had a successful career.\nFrans Floris was known to be hardworking as is testified by his motto: Als ick werck, dan leef ick: als ick spelen gae, dan sterf ick. This means \"When I work, I live: when I play, I die.\" Van Mander recounts that Floris nearly always had a large commission in his workshop on which he would work late at night, and that when he dozed off his pupils would take off his shoes and stockings and put him to bed before they left. Van Mander cites Frans Menton who asserted Floris was loved by his pupils for allowing them more freedom than other Antwerp masters. When a small group of his pupils met up for a reunion after his death they were able to compile a list of 120 of his pupils.Van Mander recounts that at the end of his life Floris became heavily indebted and started drinking. The debts were likely related to his high costs of living as well as the impact of the Beeldenstorm or Iconoclastic Fury that commenced from the 1560s and reached its peak in 1566. During the period of iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed by nominally Calvinist Protestant crowds as part of the Protestant Reformation. It is said Floris never recovered from the shock of seeing his artworks destroyed. Instead, he found himself in a downward spiral in both his personal and professional affairs. His disaffection was so great that he even refused to restore his own works damaged during the Beeldenstorm. He virtually stopped painting after 1566 and his place as the leading history painter in the Habsburg Netherlands was taken by a younger generation of artists among whom Marten de Vos became the most prominent.Van Mander recounts that while working on a large commission for the grand prior of Spain, Floris became ill and died on 1 October 1570 in Antwerp. His paintings for the grand prior were finished by his studio assistants Frans Pourbus the Elder and Chrispijn van den Broeck. Poems were written about him by Dominicus Lampsonius and the poet-painter Lucas de Heere, who according to van Mander, was his pupil.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Of theOctober 2005, Bergeron contacted singer Matthieu Chedid to ask him to compose the songs for the film; he came into contact with Vanessa Paradis shortly after, and the two artists worked together on the composition and recording of the songs.The team then worked on the visual universe of the film (characters, sets, accessories, color ambiances) for a year and a half. Bergeron says he was mainly influenced by Franquin the graphics of the characters, and draws his inspiration from impressionist painters like Alfred Sisley for the color moods and decorations. The appearance and gestures of the monster and the singer Lucille are respectively inspired by those of  Matthieu Chedid and Vanessa Paradis, who lend them their voices in the French dubbing. The visual design of a touching monster turns out to be tricky. Its final appearance is the result of contributions from several members of the team: its grasshopper appearance was an idea from a designer on the team, while Bibo Bergeron had the idea of taking inspiration from the cabaret singer's costume. Aristide Bruant for the disguise Lucille made for him.The search for financing for the film is being done at the same time. The budget of A Monster in Paris , 28 million euros, is very large for a French production, and therefore proves difficult to complete. Bergeron even had to put the project on hold for nine months because he struggled to raise funds; he is fortunately advantaged by his past experience at DreamWorks. Production of the film was finally launched at the beginning of 2009, and lasted until the end August 2010. A Monster in Paris is the third most expensive French film produced in 2010.In order to meet the requirements of co-producer EuropaCorp, the English voices are recorded before the animation itself, which makes the film easier to sell in Anglo-Saxon countries; Bibo Bergeron supervised the choice of voice actors and recording took place in Los Angeles. The French voices are recorded once the film is finished. Vanessa Paradis is the only actress to provide both the English and French voices.\nThe animation takes place in an animation studio created in Montreuil by Bibo Films for the needs of the project; it mobilizes a team of 140 people. The storyboard is the subject of several versions; once fixed, it is then rigorously respected during editing, which avoids having to cut completed scenes. For computer-generated image animation, animators use XSI software supplemented by plugins created for the needs of the film.The film is distributed by EuropaCorp.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Snelgrove at Hardcore Gaming 101 thought the game was fun, but noted that it lacked the \"philosophical and religious quandaries\" present in the first two Shin Megami Tensei titles. They also noted that it was shorter than the previous two games, but that the different dungeons and endings the game offers depending on who the player chooses as their partner resulted in a high replayability factor. They found the Guardian system interesting, but considered it a strange decision to force the player to die on purpose to get a new Guardian.

With a fluid mixture of clever dialogue, quick fire jokes, sight gags, witty repartee backwards and forwards with the audience and even slapstick routines the pair ripped the original script to shreds. The rest of the cast struggled manfully to keep the play on track and constantly suffered light heartedly at the hands of the two main stars.\nJimmy Edwards played Price-Hargreaves in his trademark blustery harumphing way, that was easily recognised from his role as the headmaster in Whack-O!. Sykes played Bloome, the eponymous mouse of the show's title. Throughout the show the one ability that marked the boss's dominance in the office was his practised skill in picking up his phone handset by chopping with his hand, causing the handset to leap off the cradle into his waiting hand. Bloome, trying to emulate this, would always fail with the trick, either hurting his hand or sending the handset spinning into a waste paper basket. Only when he has gained confidence after being accused does he succeed, grinning widely at the audience.\nAt one point, during what is supposed to be a serious solo scene by Sykes, Edwards could be seen by the audience in his shirtsleeves and braces relaxing in the wings on an armchair. He is smoking a cigarette, flicking over pages of the play's script and making occasional wry faces at Sykes's performance, while Sykes feigns puzzlement at the audience's laughter. During the mid-play interval the cast joined the audience in the bar, remaining in character and performing several hilarious set piece conversations in between chatting with theatre goers.\nThe office secretary, Miss Spencer, who works for both men, starts the play as a shy drab and dowdily dressed spinster, but when Bloome gains his undeserved reputation and she herself is smitten by him, she also starts to blossom seemingly unnoticed. In the classic Sykes-Edwards production, the young actress playing the part endured endless ad-libs and delays in the action and still resolutely hit her cues and scripted lines. She became the stable point of reference around which the anarchic comics wove their magic.

Although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there; but Buffy remains somewhat suspicious and jealous of Dawn's bond with their mother. Xander's girlfriend Anya Jenkins begins to experience deeper human emotions, both negative and positive, such as a love for money. Anya is hired by Giles and works alongside him at a magic shop called The Magic Box.\nMeanwhile, Glorificus, or Glory, a hell-goddess who was exiled from her dimension after a war, has come to Earth. She can only remain there by being connected to her human form; a medical intern called Ben. Glory takes the form of a beautiful young woman, with some of her powers still intact as long as she maintains her strength through draining people of their sanity. She begins searching for a \"Key\" that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension by blurring the lines between dimensions, and in the process unleashing Hell on Earth. At the beginning of the season Glory and Ben are vying for control, alternating who possesses the body they share; later the line between them begins to blur and they experience each other's emotions and memories.\nWhen Joyce suffers from unexplained headaches, Buffy suspects Dawn may be harming her, but they discover that they were caused by a brain tumor.

Upon learning of Joyce's tumor, Buffy leaves her dorm to take care of her mother. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and begins fighting alongside the Scoobies after learning of Joyce's tumor and supports Dawn when she learns of her true origins.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women (1977) was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\"Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process. In 1982's American Skeptic: Robert Altman's Genre-Commentary Films by Norman Kagan, he cites the film as an \"anti-genre exploration of what might be called the theme of madness. This genre includes such critically revered films as Psycho, Repulsion, and Persona.\" Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to Altman's earlier film That Cold Day in the Park (1969) and his later 3 Women, declaring them a trilogy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One day after returning from a family vacation, she began to feel faint, and was rushed to a hospital, where her heart stopped for eight seconds. She has since recovered and become a vocal spokesperson against eating disorders in Mexico. In 2008, with the support of Televisa, Anah\u00ed launched a campaign against anorexia and bulimia.In 2006, the tax administration of Mexico froze four of Anah\u00ed's bank accounts as a preventive measure because she was under investigation for tax fraud.

The titular \"game\" involves handcuffing Jessie to the bedposts during sex, a new practice that Jessie only pretends to enjoy, though Gerald finds it exciting. This time, however, Jessie finds herself reluctant after being handcuffed and asks to stop, only to be ignored by Gerald, who pretends her protests are only part of their game. Realizing her husband is deliberately feigning ignorance and that he intends to rape her, Jessie lashes out, kicking Gerald in the stomach and groin. The shock causes him to have a fatal heart attack. He dies, leaving Jessie still handcuffed to the bed.\nAt first, Jessie is only horrified at her husband's death and fears the humiliation of being discovered semi-naked and handcuffed, but she quickly realizes the situation is far more dire: it is unlikely that she or Gerald will be missed for several days, no one will think to look for them at the lake house, and all the usual lake residents have gone for the season. There is a real possibility that Jessie will die if she cannot escape.\nWhile Jessie frantically considers her options, a combination of panic and thirst causes her to hallucinate voices: \"The Goodwife\" or \"Goody Burlingame,\" a Puritanical version of herself that insists things will be fine and that she should wait to be rescued; \"Punkin,\" a representation of Jessie as a 10-year-old girl; Ruth Neary, a college roommate whom Jessie abandoned after a conversation that strayed dangerously close to uncovering Jessie's childhood; and Nora, Jessie's former psychologist, whom Jessie likewise abandoned when Nora questioned Jessie's relationship with her father. \nGuided by these voices, Jessie realizes that \"Goody's\" advice to wait for rescue stems from a subconscious belief that she deserves to be trapped in this situation, even if it means her death. When she probes for the reason why, she is able to recall a long-repressed memory of being sexually abused by her father during a solar eclipse when she was ten. Jessie's father manipulated young Jessie into believing that she was complicit, resulting in lifelong feelings of shame and guilt. She also remembers an inexplicable event in the aftermath of the abuse, during which she experienced a momentary psychic connection with an unknown woman. The memories cause Jessie to acknowledge how unhappy and controlling her marriage to Gerald was, leading her to suspect she gave up her independence for the security of being Gerald's trophy wife.\nWaking from an imaginary confrontation with all these characters to a dark bedroom, Jessie sees a tall, gaunt apparition whom she initially mistakes for the spirit of her long-dead father and whom she nicknames \"Space Cowboy\" (after a 1969 Steve Miller song). The figure shows her a wicker basket of jewelry mixed with human bones. Unsure if the figure is another hallucination, Jessie dismisses it, saying aloud it is \"only made of moonlight,\" which seems to make it vanish. Her inner voices, however, believe the figure is real and that it will return to harm Jessie if she does not escape by the next night.\nThe following morning, Jessie manages to secure a drink of water from a glass on the bedside table. Refreshed and encouraged by her own ingenuity in getting the water, she renews her efforts to escape, first by trying to break the headboard, then by trying to slip off the bed and push it to the bureau where the keys are placed. Inspired by her memory of the eclipse, in which her father warned her not to cut herself on the smoked glass panes they used as eclipse viewers, Jessie breaks the water glass and uses a sharp shard to slice her wrist, giving herself a degloving injury to lubricate her skin enough to slide her right hand from the cuff. She is then able to escape the bed, reach the keys, and free her other hand, only to faint from blood loss. When she awakens, it is nearly dark and the Space Cowboy, now undeniably real, has returned. Jessie throws her wedding ring at his box of jewelry and bones, thinking that is what he wanted all along. Still weak from blood loss, she reaches her car and drives away, only to discover the Space Cowboy hidden in the back seat. Jessie crashes and is knocked unconscious.\nMonths later, Jessie is still recuperating from her ordeal. An attorney at Gerald's law firm assists her in covering up the incident to protect her and the firm from scandal, but Jessie feels this is another version of burying her trauma, just as she buried her childhood abuse. To free herself, Jessie writes to the real Ruth, with whom she has not spoken in decades, detailing what really happened at the lake house and subsequent events. The \"Space Cowboy\" had turned out to be a serial killer and necrophile named Raymond Andrew Joubert who had been robbing and squatting in lake houses in the area. Jessie confronts Joubert at his court hearing, where he mocks her \"made of moonlight\" statement, confirming that the encounter really occurred and causing Jessie to spit in his face. Being able to directly confront the man who once terrified her allows Jessie to face the other manipulative men in her life, freeing her of fear and allowing her to deal more honestly with her past. She apologizes for abandoning Ruth, acknowledging that Ruth had confronted her with a truth she could not then face, and hopes they can resume their friendship. After mailing the letter, Jessie is able to sleep without nightmares for the first time since her ordeal at the lake house.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

A port to the PlayStation Portable retitled Shin Megami Tensei: Persona was released in North America and Japan in 2009, and the following year in Europe. This port featured new cutscenes and a reworked English localization that was more faithful to the original Japanese release. The PlayStation version was also released for the PlayStation Classic on December 3, 2018 worldwide, marking the PlayStation version being released in Europe for the first time.The story focuses on a group of high school students as they are confronted by a series of supernatural incidents. After playing a fortune-telling game, the group each gain the ability to summon Personas, the multiple selves within them. Using this power under the guidance of Philemon, a benevolent being representing humanity's subconscious, the group face off against multiple forces that threaten the world. Gameplay revolves around the characters navigating environments around their town and fighting enemies using their Personas. During the course of the game, the player can create new Personas for battle using spell cards gained in battle or by talking with enemies.\nPersona began development after the release of Shin Megami Tensei If..., with the idea of creating a subseries around the positively received high school setting of If....

In 2020, Los Angeles Times' editor Lindzi Scharf regarded her as \"the woman who will likely go down in history for putting the 'i' in influencer\". GQ's Carrie Battan had previously called her \"the figure who set off Hollywood 2.0's Big Bang, the effects of which continue to radiate through the industry today. Hilton, the one who made it possible to be famous for doing nothing, was so sought-after in the [...] 2000s that you couldn't get her to walk to her mailbox without giving her a check\". Bert Marcus, the director of the documentary The American Meme (2018), echoed that sentiment, remarking that she \"paved the way for creating a brand and a celebrity out of being herself and she turned it into a phenomenon,\" while Instagram celebrity and entrepreneur The Fat Jew, who was one of the subjects in the aforementioned documentary, credited her for \"inventing the way the world thinks about influence\".\nHilton made part of the early 2000s popularization of reality television into mainstream pop culture. Vice, in a 2015 profile, noted that after The Simple Life premiered in 2003, \"cable channels began programming reality television shows. MTV's second golden age consisted of The Hills; Andy Cohen reinvented Bravo with a repertoire of The Real Housewives, and TLC started teaching Americans about Dance Moms and Honey Boo Boo\". Dazed once considered that every \"[reality] star who cashes in after the series by collaborating with brands is essentially selling a sort of post-Hilton aspirational glamour\". The Kardashian family, Heidi Montag, Spencer Pratt, Tila Tequila, Danielle Staub, Alexa Chung, Brittny Gastineau, and Snooki are some of the personalities who are said to have followed in her footsteps. Kim Kardashian acknowledged Hilton for \"giving\" her a career, while Tana Mongeau stated that the media personality \"paved the way for me. A girl like me who is literally famous for nothing \u2013Paris Hilton taught us how to make that a business, you know what I mean\".Hilton's influence on fashion, tabloid journalism, and Hollywood throughout the 2000s led her to be considered an American pop culture icon. The height of her fame contributed to the growth of what The New York Times described as a \"misogynist\" and intrusive celebrity culture, monopolized by tabloids and paparazzi. For instance, a paparazzi photograph of her, at that time, could range from US$8,000 to US$1 million, celebrity-focused newspapers and media agencies (e.g. TMZ and Hollywood.TV) attributed part of their large viewership to their coverage on Hilton, and a network of gossip blogs such as PerezHilton.com emerged after she rose to fame. The clothing style that defined her image in her heyday \u2014tracksuits, rhinestones, trucker hats and \"the accessory dog\"\u2014 became a popular fashion trend and helped popularize brands such as Juicy Couture and Von Dutch. The Julien Macdonald dress Hilton wore for her 21st birthday has been recreated numerous times, while a 2011 report from The Kennel Club associated her with  \"the upsurge of popularity\" in \"so-called handbag dogs\". People magazine wrote in a March 2017 article: \"For millennials, Paris Hilton has always been and will always be a living legend. The socialite has come to perfectly define not only the millennial fashion aesthetic, but also a bygone era of celebrity where social media was nonexistent, as were stylists, and getting papped while partying was simply de rigueur\" (to get \"papped\" is to be followed and photographed by paparazzi).Hilton has been discussed by journalists and scholars interested in the role of celebrities and their influence through the media. Feminist theorist Camille Paglia described her as a \"groundbreaking\" figure in Hollywood, while in her book The Bling Ring, an account on the group of thieves who robbed Hilton's house, Nancy Jo Sales positioned her as a \"celebrity symbol of how destructive individualism ruled the 2000s\". Jej Perfekcyjno\u015b\u0107, a Polish sociologist and queer activist, created and organised a yearly event known as International Paris Hilton Day, which took place in Warsaw since 2006, on the first Sunday of May. However, the celebration was cancelled in 2010, following a plane crash near Smolensk, and was permanently discontinued in 2013, due to controversial comments made by Hilton the previous year. On August 29, 2006, the mayor of Las Vegas proclaimed the day \"Paris Hilton Day\" and gave Hilton a key to the city. Her quote, \"Dress cute wherever you go; life is too short to blend in\", was added to The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations in September 2009.", "hasanswer": false}]}

With the twelfth victim, Karen Silber (Kate Norby), changing her story again and the thirteenth victim's car missing, Don runs out of viable leads. Taking a map and a case file with him, Don goes to his childhood home, owned by his father Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), to take a shower. Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) of CalSci's mathematics department, finds and studies the map which Don lays on the dining room table. As Don prepares to return to the office, Charlie tries to talk Don into letting him help with the investigation and is inspired by the pattern of drops emanating from the family's sprinkler. He tells Don that he can use a mathematical model to find the neighborhood where the rapist resides. Skeptical, Don agrees to let Charlie assist him in the investigation.\nCharlie develops the model needed to find the rapist and refines it with graduate student Amita Ramanujan's (Navi Rawat) assistance. Charlie's model yields what he calls a \"hot zone\", an area in which the suspect probably lives. As the case progresses, Silber is found dead in her house. Don and his team resort to comparing DNA samples of men who live in the hot zone to samples of the rapist/killer. Using statistical analysis, Charlie deduces that Silber lied about where her rape took place. After Don learns from Silber's colleagues where Silber was raped, Charlie refines his equation, which yields a smaller area within the original hot zone. DNA, however, clears everyone in the original hot zone. As a result, Assistant Director in Charge (ADIC) Walter Merrick (Anthony Heald) pulls Don and his team from the investigation. At the same time, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), Charlie's colleague and friend, encourages Charlie to make his equation \"less elegant\" and to evaluate the worth of his consultation work.\nBack at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don discuss what went wrong. Alan is confident that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where he spends most of his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where he possibly works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim, who is still alive. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 2006, he produced an album Songs Forever of swing and jazz versions of popular songs (including Modern Talking's first hit). Bohlen has written two autobiographical books about Modern Talking's history from his perspective. The first book sold a million copies in Germany. The sequel was heavily criticised for his unfairness towards the people he worked with. As a result of that, Bohlen withdrew from the public for a year until 2006, when he said he regretted putting out the second book. Anders had not been the only one pressing charges against Bohlen and demanding that sections of the book be modified. Frank Farian was also angered by Bohlen's literary output and released a book in which he tried to expose Bohlen as a fraud.

{"id": "91_822", "question": "What genre is Love Story?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_823", "question": "What genre is Reminiscences?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_10420", "text": "Glas is described as experimental and obscure. Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Pitchfork editors ranked \"Vogue\" as the 115th best song of the 1990s, praising it for how unapologetically it celebrated queer life at the height of the AIDS epidemic. Rolling Stone listed the track as one of the \"500 Best Songs of All Time\" at number 139, while they named it the 11th greatest dance song of all time. The song was placed by Billboard on the number four spot on its list of \"60 Top LGBTQ Anthems of All Time\", and as part of the 65th anniversary of Billboard Hot 100, the magazine's staff ranked \"Vogue\" as the 186th best pop song that appeared on the chart. Slant Magazine ranked it at number 10 on their \"Best Singles of the '90s\" list, and number three in the list of the 100 Greatest Dance Songs. Music critic Jody Rosen from Slate included \"Vogue\" as one of Madonna's \"ten essential songs for new or aspiring fans\". Time called it \"the most famous fashion song of all time\", although the song was not specifically about the Vogue magazine. It was named the most iconic female dance moment in history in a list elaborated by The Daily Telegraph.\nMany critics and academics agree that with the song, Madonna brought voguing into mainstream culture, and also view it as one of the first mainstream pop culture works to spotlight elements from the queer, Black and Latino-led ballroom scene. Boston.com's Scott Kearnan noted that although Madonna has occasionally been accused of cultural appropriation for taking vogue mainstream, \"she never obfuscated or demeaned its roots\", and completed that \"even at an especially homophobic time, Madonna's gay dancers were shown as front, center, and fabulous, striking a pose alongside the most famous woman on Earth.\" Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone had similar thoughts, criticizing the mainstream's willingness to seriously engage with that culture and craft only when it is presented by white people, but stated that it \"doesn't mean one can\u2019t still revel in the song's brilliance, nor do they necessarily suggest anything malicious on Madonna's part\", as she \"approached 'Vogue' with a clear admiration and respect for the ballroom world.\" For Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, \"Vogue\" was \"the beginning of a new phase for Madonna. It was as if she got a sense of her immortality, and her true power. Feeling secure in her status as a mainstream artist, she began to play with that power and challenge her audience.\" James Rose of Daily Review agreed, writing that with the song Madonna began \"a phase of her career that oscillates between cynical self-exploitation and courageous self-expression. Raunchy videos, explicitly themed lyrics and boudoir beats became de rigueur for the lady now arguably bearing the biggest name in popular music.\"Before Madonna popularized the dance, voguing was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. According to O'Brien, when \"Vogue\" became the \"Number 1 hit of that summer, [it was] played in clubs across the globe, from London to New York to Bali\", also pointing out that it \"rode the crest of the newly emerging dance craze, where club culture, house music and techno met the mainstream. 'Vogue' reflected the new hedonism; positive, upbeat, and totally inclusive\". Liam Hess of Vogue commented that \"this subcultural movement had officially boiled over into the zeitgeist\" as \"many were mimicking the playful, exaggerated gestures of the Harlem ballrooms\" around the world. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated, \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream. She introduced the world to this community who, up until that point in time, had been a subculture.\" Voguing has since become a prominent dance form practised worldwide, and many female performers have followed Madonna's footsteps, adopting the dance style and incorporating it into their music videos and performances.The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death. Erick Henderson of Slant Magazine explained that the song was \"instrumental in allowing disco revivalism to emerge, allowing the denigrated gay genre to soar once again within the context of house music, the genre disco became in its second life.\" Sal Cinquemani of the same publication wrote that the song was \"making its impact all the more impressive (it would go on to inspire a glut of pop-house copycats) and begging the question: If disco died a decade earlier, what the fuck was this big, gay, fuscia drag-queen boa of a dance song sitting on top of the charts for a month for?\" According to Tom Breiham of Stereogum, \"Vogue\" was certainly the first number-one house track ever. He added, \"House, like voguing itself, had been a relatively underground club phenomenon a few years earlier, and it had only started to make inroads into the mainstream. As far as this column is concerned, that breakthrough might be the main legacy of 'Vogue'\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Penderecki was interested in freedom from conventional aspects of music\u2014namely meter, rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Important works from this period, particularly Anaklasis (1959\u201360), Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960), and Fluorescences (1961\u201362), were experimental compositions characterized by blocks of sound of varying dynamics, extended techniques on acoustic instruments, and tone clusters.By the early 1970s, however, Penderecki began to move away from the avant-garde movement, claiming in an interview in 2000, \"we pushed music so far in the sixties that even for myself, for me, I closed the door behind me, because there was no way to do anything more than I have done... I decided that there is no way that I can move on.\" Acknowledging that he had pushed the limits, Penderecki began to rediscover the neo-Romantics while working as a conductor in the 1970s. He specifies, \"The kind of music I was conducting influenced my own music very much... During this time I began to have my Romantic ideas, partly because I was conducting Bruckner, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky.\" At this point in his career, Penderecki's music begins to feature melodic expression, lyricism, and dramatic character.Penderecki felt that the early 1970s represented a major shift in his compositional style. Important to this shift was the composer's renewed emphasis on \"tradition.\" Penderecki attributed the importance of tradition to Artur Malawski, his composition teacher from 1954\u201357, who balanced contemporary techniques with more conventional musical forms. Penderecki echoed Malawski's compositional philosophy: \"The general principles at the root of a work's musical style... the integrity of a musical experience embodied in the notes the composer is setting down on paper, never change. The idea of good music means today exactly what it meant always.\" In 1973, he also stated he was in search of a new direction, one which resolved to \"gain inspiration from the past and look back on my heritage.\" For Penderecki, tradition also served as an \"opportunity to [overcome the] dissonance between the artist and the audience.\"The symphony particularly became an essential genre for Penderecki starting in the early 1970s, stating that his \"third style period\" began with his first symphony. From the 1970s on, Penderecki described the importance of the symphony in various ways, for instance explaining that his second symphony of 1980 \"referred fully to the late-nineteenth century symphonic tradition...\" He also stated in 2000, \"...It's very clear that I'm trying to continue this tradition, this Romantic tradition\" when describing his symphonic compositions. A passage from his collected essays Labyrinth of Time confirms this sentiment: \"I would like to continue the music that was cast at the beginning of the [twentieth] century: the tradition of writing symphonies.\" More importantly, however, Penderecki saw the genre as a kind of synthesis of traditional and contemporary styles, calling the symphony \"that musical ark which would make it possible to convey to coming generations what is best in our twentieth-century tradition of the composing of sounds.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

His wife was unaware of his affair and he arranges for Na\u00efma, his employee, who witnessed both the suicide attempt and the incident in the shop, to meet with Lucie.\nAfter hearing Na\u00efma's story, Lucie becomes distressed and confesses that she forwarded Marie and Samir\u2019s email correspondence to Samir's wife the day before she tried to kill herself, after calling her at the dry cleaning shop. Lucie disappears, and Ahmad and Samir search for her.  Ahmad finds Lucie, who has been staying with a friend, and tries to convince her to tell Marie what she did, saying that Marie has a right to know, now that she is carrying Samir's child. Lucie does so and Marie becomes enraged, telling Lucie to leave, which she does. Ahmad calms the situation and Marie goes after Lucie, asking her to come back, which she does.\nAfter questioning what feelings he may still hold for his wife, Marie tells Samir what Lucie did. Samir finds this hard to accept and questions Na\u00efma about the events leading up to his wife's suicide attempt. Na\u00efma states his wife wasn't even in the shop the day that Lucie said she called. After Marie accuses Lucie of lying, Lucie maintains her version of events saying that she spoke to a woman with an accent on the phone. Samir realizes that she actually spoke to Na\u00efma, who then gave Lucie his wife's email address. He confronts Na\u00efma, who confesses and explains that his wife had always been jealous of her and had been trying to get her either sacked or deported from France and had initiated the confrontation with the customer. However, Na\u00efma believes that his wife never read the emails, because she came into the shop and chose to drink bleach in front of her, instead of in front of Samir or Marie.\nSamir and Marie discuss the events and their relationship. Samir decides that they should focus on their future, while Marie appears conflicted. Ahmad prepares to return to Iran. He says farewell to the children and attempts to talk to Marie about the end of their marriage, but Marie does not let him, stating that she doesn't need to know such things now. Meanwhile, Samir visits his wife in the hospital with a selection of perfumes, which the doctors have recommended in order to possibly initiate a response. He sprays onto his neck some of his cologne and leans over her lying comatose in her hospital bed.  With his face close to his wife's he whispers to her to squeeze his hand if she can smell it. A tear rolls down her cheek but she remains comatose, and he looks down at her hand, which may or may not be holding his.

In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some of the film is trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it.\" Burton acknowledged that he probably portrayed Wood and his crew in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, stating he did not want to ridicule people who had already been ridiculed for a good deal of their life. Burton decided not to depict the darker side of Wood's life because his letters never alluded to this aspect and remained upbeat. To this end, Burton wanted to make the film through Wood's eyes. He said in an interview, \"I've never seen anything like them, the kind of bad poetry and redundancy\u2013 saying in, like, five sentences what it would take most normal people one ... Yet still there is a sincerity to them that is very unusual, and I always found that somewhat touching; it gives them a surreal, weirdly heartfelt feeling.\"According to Bela G. Lugosi (his son), Forrest Ackerman, Dolores Fuller and Richard Sheffield, the film's portrayal of Lugosi is inaccurate: in real life, he never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. Additionally, contrary to what was presented in the film, Bela was not thrown by a comic's ad-libbing in a skit on a TV show involving Wood, but on another show years earlier before the two ever met.Burton biographer Ken Hanke criticized the depiction of Dolores Fuller. \"The real Fuller is a lively, savvy, humorous woman,\" Hanke said, \"while Parker's performance presents her as a kind of sitcom moron for the first part of the film and a rather judgmental and wholly unpleasant character in her later scenes.\" During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on Queen for a Day and The Dinah Shore Show, which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave Ed Wood a positive review. \"Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous.

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_835", "question": "What genre is Visitors?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_38871", "text": "The Birds resembles all the early plays of Aristophanes in key aspects of its dramatic structure. Such resemblances are evidence of a genre of ancient drama known as Old Comedy. Variations from these 'conventions' are significant since they demonstrate either a trend away from Old Comedy, a corruption in the text or a unique dramatic effect that the author intended. Variations in this play are found in the following conventions:\n\nAgon: The agon is a debate or formal argument constructed as a 'symmetrical scene', with two declaimed sections and two songs. The protagonist generally defeats the antagonist in the debate and this decides the outcome of the play long before the play actually ends. The agon in The Birds (lines 451\u2013626) is conventional in form but there is no antagonist \u2013 the two main speakers are Pisthetaerus and his friend Euelpides, with Pisthetaerus delivering a speech and Euelpides providing supportive comments. The birds provide a willing audience and they are easily won over to the protagonist's point of view. A similarly one-sided agon is found in the next surviving play, Lysistrata.\nParabasis: The parabasis is an address to the audience by the Chorus in the absence of any actors. Generally there is a long parabasis in the middle of the play, including a 'parabasis proper' in which the Chorus speaks as the author's representative on issues relating to his career, and usually there is a shorter parabasis near the end. In this play, the first parabasis (678\u2013800) and the second (1058\u20131117) are conventional in structure but the Chorus always speaks in character as birds. Instead of speaking about the poet in the 'parabasis proper', the birds speak about themselves, outlining their genealogy, their value to the audience and their effect on the audience's vocabulary \u2013 in all these topics however there are amusing echoes of things a Chorus would ordinarily say on behalf of the poet. This 'parabasis proper' is in fact almost a satire on the convention of a parabasis proper.\nUnwelcome Visitors: The protagonist's early victory in the agon generally tends to ease dramatic tension early in the play and this is usually offset to some extent by a stream of minor characters or 'unwelcome visitors' that have to be chased off by the triumphant hero. This play is exceptional in that there are three waves of unwelcome visitors \u2013 the first wave comes before the walls of Cloudcuckooland have been completed, the second wave comes immediately after and the third wave comes as a delegation from Zeus. This repetition is the reason why The Birds is much longer than the other surviving plays.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas.

It was named the best adventure game of 2005 by Computer Games Magazine, GameSpy, PC Gamer, and IGN; Adventure Gamers ranked it fifty-seventh of all time. Game Informer listed Fahrenheit last among ten video game openings. Garnett Lee of 1Up.com praised the \"disturbing\" and graceful nature of the story as well as its combination with the gameplay, saying Fahrenheit had set a new standard for future aims of doing so. GameSpot's Alex Navarro highlighted the layers of context and \"heartfelt meaning\" to its use of cinematic gameplay. He enjoyed the narrative, dubbing it \"deep, captivating\", and, echoing Lee, \"disturbing\". The character development, art style, voice acting, and music also saw approval from Navarro. Raymond M. Padilla at GameSpy declared that \"it's so good that it just might save a dying genre\", regarding the plot and main characters to be well-written and the voice cast as one of the best of the year. The controls were admired for their accessibility, while the score was complimented for its \"moody and captivating\" qualities. Writing for GameZone, Ronnie Hobbs liked that the controls helped with narrative immersion, and that this created an emotional connection to the characters. Hobbs' verdict read: \"Despite its flaws, Indigo Prophecy is the definitive interactive story, and not only does it perfect the genre, it redefines it\". Charles Onyett, reviewing the game for IGN, thought it succeeded in its effort to provide a movie-like experience. The feature of multiple playable characters was believed to have worked well, the action choreography and voice acting impressed him, and the soundtrack was described as gripping.Conversely, Lee expressed dislike to the \"rather weakly implemented Metal Gear Solid-like stealth sections\" and Fahrenheit's final third, which he perceived to be rushed. Navarro agreed with Lee on the ending and sneak sequences, criticising the former for its incoherent aspects and latter because it lacked engagement, matching the reason he disapproved of the puzzles.

The first parody was the 1964 film Carry On Spying, which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind (Charles Hawtry) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor). One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine, was released in 1965. The eponymous hero is a rough-edged, petty crook turned spy, and was what academic Jeremy Packer called an \"anti-Bond\", or what Christoph Lindner calls \"the thinking man's Bond\". The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry. The four \"Matt Helm\" films starring Dean Martin (released between 1966 and 1969), the \"Flint\" series starring James Coburn (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1969), while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the Austin Powers series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the Johnny English trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.\n\nFollowing the release of the film Dr. No in 1962, the line \"Bond ... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\". In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere. In 1965, Time magazine observed \"James Bond has developed into the biggest mass-cult hero of the decade\".\nThe 25 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 27 Bond films have grossed over $7.04 billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\".Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy, and Get Smart.Considered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort. From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond\u2013style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady. Bond has been commemorated numerous times on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their March 2020 series to mark the 25th Bond film release.Throughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. \"Bondmania\", a term deriving from the adjacent \"Beatlemania\" and initiated in 1964 following the enormous success of Goldfinger, described the clamour for Bond films and their related products, from soundtrack LPs to children's toys, board games, alarm clocks playing the Bond theme, and 007-branded shirts.

The films may attract job applicants who may be unsuited for espionage, while dissuading more-qualified candidates.

Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s.

Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in Halloween, there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.There are slasher films that predated Halloween, such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972),  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Black Christmas (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. Halloween, however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others. Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of Halloween,\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting. Rockoff considers the film \"the blueprint for all slashers and the model against which all subsequent films are judged.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Those failing to show enthusiasm for the cause are gruesomely blown to pieces.\nIn the first scene, a bright and chirpy schoolteacher, played by Lyndsey Marshal, tells her class about the 10:10 campaign, and asks what they are doing to reduce their carbon footprint. She asks which students are planning to participate; most raise their hands, but two children shrug apathetically. The teacher reassures them that this is \"fine, it's absolutely fine, it's your choice\" and there is \"no pressure\", but then shifts the papers on her desk to reveal a red-buttoned detonator, which she presses. The two children who did not want to participate explode, covering their screaming classmates with blood and body parts. The blood-spattered teacher then goes on casually to explain the night's homework to her horrified charges.\nThe second scene shows a group of white-collar workers in an office meeting. The office manager, played by Paul Ritter, similarly explains the purpose of the 10:10 campaign, and asks who will be participating. While most raise their hands, four raise their hands unconvinced. The manager reassures them that there is \"no pressure\" to participate, but he is then handed a detonator by an assistant, which he uses to blow up the four workers, splattering appalled co-workers with gore.\nThe third scene is set on a football pitch during team training. The coach, played by David Ginola, asks the players to explain the 10:10 campaign that the team is participating in. They describe a range of energy-saving measures which have been implemented by the team and its fans. However, the coach remains unmoved, remarking the campaign would distract him from football. A player tells him that there's \"no pressure\", produces a detonator, and blows him up. Unlike the witnesses depicted in previous scenes, the team is not at all surprised, and casually jogs away to resume training.\nA brief interlude with captions explains the campaign, accompanied by the song \"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\" by Radiohead. In the final scene, the actress Gillian Anderson is finishing the voice-over for the interlude just seen. The sound engineer asks her what she is planning to do to cut her carbon footprint. Anderson irritably remarks that she thought providing the recording was a sufficient contribution. The sound engineer repeats the film's catchphrase, \"no pressure\", and detonates Anderson before picking up to leave. The film ends with a shot of Anderson's gory remains sliding down the sound-booth window with the text \"Cut your carbon by 10%. No pressure.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Picking up where the first film left off, the film sees Daniel accompany Miyagi on a trip to Okinawa, where he is reunited with loved ones and is challenged by an old adversary. Although a commercial success, it received mixed reviews. The Karate Kid Part III followed in 1989, which saw Kreese seek revenge on Daniel and Miyagi with the help of new allies. It was criticized for rehashing elements of the first two films. Another sequel, The Next Karate Kid (1994), was the first in the series not to include Macchio, although Morita returned as Miyagi. It follows Hilary Swank as one of his new students. A remake of the original film, also titled The Karate Kid, was released in 2010. Set in Beijing, it starred Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith and received generally favorable reviews.Aside from the film series, an animated series based on the film, also called The Karate Kid, aired on NBC in the fall of 1989. Consisting of thirteen episodes, the series abandoned the karate tournament motif and followed Daniel and Miyagi, voiced by Joey Dedio and Robert Ito, respectively, in an adventure/quest setting.A sequel live-action television series, Cobra Kai, debuted in 2018. Created by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, it stars Macchio and Zabka, who reprise their roles as LaRusso and Lawrence, respectively. Set 34 years later, Cobra Kai re-examines the \"Miyagi-Verse\" narrative from Johnny's point of view, his decision to reopen the Cobra Kai dojo, and the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel. The series draws upon all of the sequels, as well as the original film. The series also pays tribute to Morita, who died in 2005. After a guest appearance in the show's first season, Kove reprised his role as John Kreese starting in the second season, while Shue reprised her role as Ali Mills in the series' third season, and Thomas Ian Griffith as Terry Silver (from Part III) in the fourth and fifth seasons.In January 2020, a Broadway musical adaptation of The Karate Kid was revealed to be in development. Amon Miyamoto served as the director, with an accompanying novel being written by the original film's screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen. Drew Gasparini is the lyricist and composer of the score, while Keone and Mari Madrid choreographed the play. Kumiko Yoshii and Michael Wolk will serve as producers, with The Kinoshita Group. The cast will include Jovanni Sy as Mr. Miyagi, John Cardoza as Daniel LaRusso, Kate Baldwin as Lucille LaRusso, Alan H. Green as John Kreese, Jake Bentley Young as Johnny Lawrence, Jetta Juriansz as Ali Mills, and Luis-Pablo Garcia as Freddie Fernandez. The adaption debuted in St. Louis in June 2022.In August 2023, it was reported that Jackie Chan would be reprising his role from the 2010 film in a new \"Karate Kid\" film. By November of the same year, Chan officially joined the cast alongside Ralph Macchio in their respective roles as Mr. Han and Daniel LaRusso. The studio announced a world-wide open casting call for an actor to star as the movie's iteration of the titular character. Jonathan Entwistle will serve as director from a script written by Rob Lieber, where the plot will involve a teen from China moving to the east coast and beginning to study martial arts. Karen Rosenfelt will produce the film, with principle photography scheduled to commence in spring 2024. Originally scheduled to be released on June 7, 2024, the film was delayed to December 13, 2024, in part as a result of the 2023 writers and actors strikes.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By 2002, Hamasaki had earned the nickname \"Empress of J-pop\" due to her popularity in Japan and throughout Asia, as well as being referred to as \"the voice of the lost generation\". Due to her success and relevance throughout her career, she is considered one of the top solo female artists of the Heisei era for her influence on the music industry and various fashion trends.Born and raised in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Hamasaki moved to Tokyo at 14 in 1993 to pursue a career in singing and acting. In 1998, Hamasaki released her debut single \"Poker Face\" and debut major-label album A Song for \u00d7\u00d7. The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks, selling over a million copies. This rapid rise to fame is typically attributed to her insightful style of lyric-writing in contrast to her young age; this would continue to be a defining aspect of her work, listeners praising her poetic way of conveying relatable subjects. Her next ten albums shipped over a million copies in Japan, with her third, Duty, selling nearly three million. A Best, her first compilation album, further established her position as a crowning artist with more than four million copies sold in Japan. It was at this time that she represented more than 40% of her record label's income.After A Best, Hamasaki went on to experiment with her music style and lyricism, incorporating English into her work from Rainbow onwards. Later albums would range from electronic dream-pop to rock genres, with Hamasaki herself saying she does not feel tied to follow music trends, instead focusing on what she enjoys and wants to create \"whether it is trendy or not\". This perspective would continue to resonate with the public throughout her career, with her albums consistently placing in the top ten of the Oricon charts to present day; she currently holds the record for the most albums to place in the top ten by a female artist in Japan, with 54 of her releases reaching that distinction.Hamasaki has sold over 50.70 million units in Japan, making her the best-selling Japanese solo artist in history. Hamasaki has several domestic record achievements for her singles, such as the most number-one hits by a female artist (38); the most consecutive number-one hits by a solo artist (25), and the most million-sellers. From 1999 to 2010, Hamasaki had at least two singles each year topping the charts. Hamasaki is also the first female recording artist to have ten studio albums since her debut to top the Oricon, and the first artist to have a number-one album for 13 consecutive years since her debut. In addition to this, Hamasaki's remix albums Super Eurobeat Presents Ayu-ro Mix and Ayu-mi-x II Version Non-Stop Mega Mix, are recognized as two of the best selling remix albums of all time worldwide.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His wife Gwen suggests that it would make him feel better if he wrote down what was bothering him.\nMany years prior, Thomas is taken in by a kindly community of field mice after being caught in a snowstorm. There he meets Woodget, a little field mouse who becomes his close friend, and a beautiful maiden named Bess Sandibrook. Thomas falls deeply in love with Bess, but is unaware that Woodget has similar feelings for her. Stating that she loves Woodget, Bess gently rejects Thomas, only for them both to realise that Woodget has run away after mistakenly thinking he's getting in the way of their romance. Thomas vows to find Woodget, and catches up with him at a dock as a ship called the Calliope is getting ready to set sail. Thomas and Woodget meet a tough Irish mouse named Mulligan, who invites them to have a drink with him on the ship before he leaves. But they stay too long and to their dismay are stuck on the ship. The two become suspicious of Mulligan, who is evasive and will not let anyone see the contents of a satchel he always carries with him. The Calliope eventually crashes in a violent storm, killing most of its passengers.\nMulligan washes ashore in Crete with Dimlon, a simple-minded young mouse Thomas and Woodget befriended during the voyage. Dimlon drops his facade of innocence and reveals himself to Mulligan as Dahrem Ruhar, an adept of the Scale, an evil cult that worships a banished reptile god called Suruth Scarophion. Mulligan has been carrying a piece of a jade egg sacred to the Scale, trying to prevent them from obtaining it and joining it with the other pieces, which would create a vessel into which Scarophion can be reborn. Thomas and Woodget survived the storm as well, and come onto the island in time to see a dying Mulligan, poisoned by the blades of Dahrem. He has carried the egg fragment with him and pushes it into the horrified Woodget's paws, telling him to take it to a place called Hara. Thomas and Woodget are discovered by an army of Indian mongooses who demand to know where they got the egg fragment from. After they explain the situation, the mongooses offer to take the two mice to Hara, their home city in India so they can speak to the sadhu and ask his advice. Dahrem, once again in the guise of Dimlon, comes along with them. Upon their arrival in Hara, Thomas, Woodget and mongoose Captain Chattan go to see the sadhu, who also possesses a piece of the jade egg of Scarophion. In the night, the Scale arrive and launch a vicious attack on the city of Hara to steal the fragment. To everyone's shock, it is the sadhu himself who opens the gates for the Scale to enter. Dahrem attacks Woodget in the sadhu's chamber, demanding that he hand over the egg fragment Mulligan gave him. Thomas and Chattan hear the field mouse's screams and come to his rescue. Chattan engages in battle with Dahrem, who demonstrates his ability as an adept to tear his mammalian flesh off and assume the form of a lizard. Ultimately Dahrem is killed, but not before poisoning Chattan with his blades.\nFaced with nowhere else to go, Thomas and Woodget decide to head to Singapore, where it is said that the jerboa prophet Simoon has journeyed. In a seedy bar called the Lotus Parlour, Thomas accidentally lets it slip to the bar's owner, Ma Skillet, that he and Woodget have the final egg fragment. Simoon is present and scolds the two mice for having walked directly into Scale territory. The bar is full of members of the cult (including Ma Skillet, the high priestess) who capture Thomas, Woodget, and Simoon and take them to their temple. The high priest joins the egg fragments together, and it appears Suruth Scarophion will be reborn. But as the reptilian form writhes within the newly created egg, it suddenly shrivels and dies. Simoon reveals that it was the plan all along to let the Scale obtain every piece of the egg, as he and other members of the Green Council like the sadhu knew it would ultimately be useless. The fragment held by Mulligan was periodically moved to different shrines to the benevolent Green Mouse deity, and thus gradually became a holy object. Cast from the ruined egg, Scarophion's spirit enters a nearby statue in his image. Riding on its back, the enraged high priest chases Thomas, Woodget, and Simoon. The statue is destroyed when it crashes on a crag of rock, and Woodget kills the high priest to save Thomas's life.\nAt the end of the journey, Thomas and Woodget are at a dock in Singapore waiting for a ship to take them back to England. An old beggar approaches them, but soon they discover that it is Ma Skillet, former high priestess of the Scale. She puts Thomas into a trance, during which he picks up Woodget and casts him into the water. Despite the field mouse's pleas, Thomas lets him presumably drown. Hours later, Thomas emerges from the trance and to his horror, remembers what he has done. He screams in anguish.\nIn present day Hara, Chattan's sister Sobhan is taking her grandson to see the sadhu. She tries to help the latter remember his former identity, but he responds that Zenna, the siren who rescued him from the sea, wiped his memory completely and he is content that way.

Established musicians Dancho (Nogod), Miya (Mucc), Yuu (Merry), Akane (ex-The Scanty) and Daisuke (Jupiter) occasionally perform in a X Japan cover band called X Suginami. American musician Marty Friedman called X Japan the biggest band in visual kei and \"by far the most versatile musically,\" and cited them as the reason he got into Japanese rock music. Kai from Esprit D'Air named X Japan as one of his top ten rock and metal bands from Japan and also covered their song \"Kurenai\".In We Are X, Gene Simmons claims that if the X Japan members were \"born in America or England and sang in English, they might be the biggest band in the world.\" Due to band's various misfortunes with the suicide of band members, Toshi's brainwashing and lack of overseas success, X Japan has been described in The Times as: \"The world's unluckiest band\", in an article published on Friday the 13th October, 2017. When asked in an interview if the band was unlucky, Yoshiki answered: \"Kinda? I mean, you know, with so much crazy drama that has happened over the years. But at the same time, we have amazing fans around the world so I can't say 'the world's unluckiest band', but what I can say is 'the world's luckiest band'. Thanks to our fans.\"The group was popular among rebellious youths, who were attracted to, as Asiaweek put it, \"the tone of alienation and frustration for which X was revered.\" Their music was described by Asiaweek as having \"an angry sound that rejected the cookie-cutter principles of Japanese society.\" In 1998, Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained \"In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase. They put their life into being X fans: they dress like it, they breathe it.\" In the documentary Global Metal, Yoshiki stated that the music industry and media hated the band and would not even interview them, \"but eventually we sold 20 million albums, so they had no choice\".X Japan has also been named one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent record label. In 1990, they won the \"Grand Prix New Artist of the Year\" award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards. HMV Japan ranked the band number 40 on a 2003 list of the 100 most important Japanese pop acts, and in 2010 they came in third in a poll by Oricon on which Japanese bands people want around for future generations. In 2011, Consequence of Sound named X Japan one of their Top 15 Cult Acts. In April 2012, X Japan won the Revolver Golden Gods Award for \"Best International Artist\". They were awarded \"Most Devoted Fans\" in the 2012 Loudwire Music Awards on January 17, 2013, and won the poll again two years later on February 3, 2015. Later that year, they also won the website's Best Live Band Tournament in August, beating out Pearl Jam in the final round. LA Weekly ranked X Japan tenth on an October 2014 list of the 10 Best Prog Metal Bands. In March 2017, Loudwire named X Japan the Best Metal Band from Japan writing that \"their high-octane power metal and exhilarating live show make them the pinnacle of heavy music in the 'Land of the Rising Sun'.\"However, X Japan has also made a mark outside of the music industry. In 1999, at the request of the Japanese government, Yoshiki composed and performed a classical song for Japan's Emperor Akihito at a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of his enthronement. Japan's former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is a well-known fan of the band. His political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, even used X Japan's song \"Forever Love\" in several commercials in 2001. It was also reported that Koizumi was influential in getting the Hide Museum opened in Yokosuka in 2000.Yoshiki stated he loved \"the punkish elements\" of the albums Iron Maiden and Killers by Iron Maiden.

Using the analogy of  \"the clock and the compass,\" the authors assert that identifying primary roles and principles provides a \"true north\" and reference when deciding what activities are most important, so that decisions are guided not merely by the \"clock\" of scheduling but by the \"compass\" of purpose and values. Asserting that people have a need \"to live, to love, to learn, and to leave a legacy\" they propose moving beyond \"urgency\".\nIn the book, Covey describes a framework for prioritizing work that is aimed at long-term goals, at the expense of tasks that appear to be urgent, but are in fact less important. He uses a time management formulation attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower (see: The Eisenhower Method), categorizing tasks into whether they are urgent and whether they are important, recognizing that important tasks may not be urgent, and urgent tasks are not necessarily important. This is his 2x2 matrix: classifying tasks as urgent and non-urgent on one axis, and important or non-important on the other axis. His quadrant 2 (not the same as the quadrant II in a Cartesian coordinate system) has the items that are non-urgent but important. These are the ones he believes people are likely to neglect, but should focus on to achieve effectiveness.\nImportant items are identified by focusing on a few key priorities and roles which will vary from person to person, then identifying small goals for each role each week, in order to maintain a holistic life balance. One tool for this is a worksheet that lists up to seven key roles, with three weekly goals per role, to be evaluated and scheduled into each week before other appointments occupy all available time with things that seem urgent but are not important. This concept is illustrated with a story that encourages people to \"place the big rocks first.\"\nDelegation is presented as an important part of time management. Successful delegation, according to Covey, focuses on results and benchmarks that are to be agreed upon in advance, rather than on prescribing detailed work plans.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

Feminist scholar Susan J.

Marwick also suggests that cosmetic reality television encourages viewers to frame their family, financial, or social problems in bodily terms, and portrays surgical procedures as an everyday and normal solution. The Swan draws from cultural discourses of plastic surgery and self-improvement culture to frame cosmetic surgery as \"a morally appropriate means to achieving an authentic self\".

Each makes historical research a major vector of narrative suspense, with specific historical details\u2014the Civil War in Lincoln's Dreams, the sinking of the Titanic here\u2014treated as though they were clues in a murder mystery.\nWolfe continues: Like Doomsday Book (1992), it grapples with one of the grandest of all themes, death, and uses the inability of major characters to communicate key bits of information to each other as another suspense device. Like Willis's comic short fiction, it pokes fun at institutional culture\u2014in this case hospitals, with their mazelike architecture and ego-driven politics\u2014and at such ghoulish aspects of pop culture as afterlife gurus like John Edwards\" (i.e., John Edward) \"and self-help manuals for the recently bereaved.\"\nFaren Miller wrote in Locus: \n\nWhile the subject matter and setting of Passage allow Willis to display her characteristically unsentimental poignancy ... she can also poke fun at matters of life and death... The book's multiplying internal and external mazes provide an emblem of human complexity, foolishness, and deeper terrors, some reaching from beyond death. Jonathan Strahan of Locus praises the novel's \"seriousness\", \"clear-eyed humor\" and its \"amusing portrayal of what it's like to be in a big hospital\", which is itself a \"confusing, overwhelming portrait,\" as parts of what it makes \"her most ambitious novel\". He adds, \"At the three-quarter point of Passage, Willis does something that no reviewer should leak but it is much of what makes the book worth reading. What she attempts is to find a way to look at death and life after death in a way that doesn't conflict with matters of faith, but which also is consistent with the fundamentally rational underpinnings of science fiction.\"SciFi.com describes Passage as \"an emotionally exhausting trip\" that is ultimately \"a rewarding experience.\" Laura Miller, writing for Salon, says that \"its construction is a marvel of ingenuity and \u2014 what's even more remarkable, given the wizardry of Willis' storytelling \u2014 its intellectual honesty is impeccable... You won't find the beautiful sentences of more-celebrated 'novelists of ideas' here, though the ideas themselves are far better, more daring and more original, than those chewed over by most literary heavyweights. The dialogue can sound a trifle canned, the minor characters feel a mite thin (not that many novels of ideas don't share these flaws, too), which explains in part why Passage seems to hover between genre and genius. Given how rare a searching intelligence like Willis' is among today's novelists, does it really matter?\"The SF Site review judges that the novel \"starts slowly, and it's too long. Willis' trademark habit of making some set of frustrating everyday-life details a recurring motif or running joke (in this case, the difficulty of navigating the hospital corridors, plus the never-open cafeteria) is over-extended here...\"; conversely, reviewer Steven Wu felt that \"Part One of the book is masterful, with several chilling scenes, a compelling mystery, and a doozy of a cliffhanger ending. But then, only a third of the way through the book, things begin slowing down.\"\nThe A.V. Club's reviewer writes: There's certainly nothing comforting about Passage, which steeps its characters in death of all kinds \u2014 swift and sudden, prolonged and painful. Willis' satirical flair originally has Landry [sic] and Wright running around like The Three Stooges, juggling impossible schedules in an impossible environment and careening amidst exaggeratedly colorful characters in every chapter.

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Winslet was handpicked by Meyers, who wrote all of Iris's lines with Winslet in mind. The character was named Iris after Jude Law's young daughter. A fan of Meyers' previous work on Something's Gotta Give (2003), Winslet, then primarily known for her portrayals in period films, \"loved the idea\" of playing a contemporary English woman in a romantic comedy, a genre she had not done before. Winslet said she had initially felt \"nervous and ... scared about trying to be funny\" at times, stating that \"Jude [Law] and I would speak on the telephone a lot before we started shooting, 'Oh my god, they're going to fire us, they're going to recast, what if we don't make them laugh?\" In preparing for her role, Winslet watched screwball comedies from the 1940s, such as His Girl Friday and The Philadelphia Story, to study the dialogues and performances.\nCameron Diaz as Amanda Woods:  Amanda is the owner of a successful business that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character \"was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there.\" Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz's performance in the film to Goldie Hawn's, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: \"It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly ... She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl,\" she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: \"There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn\u2019t want to take it [the comedy] too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so we included realistic moments,\" she said.\nJude Law as Graham Simpkins:  Graham is Iris's brother, a book editor, \"countryside widower\", and single father raising his two daughters (Miffy Englefield as Sophie, and Emma Pritchard as Olivia) by himself after his wife's death. Robert Downey Jr. auditioned for the role. Law accepted the role as he was interested in playing a type of character that he had never played on film before. After his appearances in a string of period dramas and science fiction films in the early to mid-2000s, Law found it tricky to approach the contemporary role of Graham. Like Winslet, the actor stated, he felt more vulnerable about playing a character who fitted his own look and did not require an accent, a costume or a relocation. Meyers, who was not immediately sure if Law was going to fit into the genre and whose character evolved more during the writing than the others, decided to cast him after a meeting in which they went through the script together. In preparing for his role, Meyers sent him a collection of Clark Gable movies to prepare the performance that she wanted in The Holiday.\nJack Black as Miles Dumont:  Miles is a Hollywood film composer working with Amanda and an affiliate of her boyfriend, Ethan. Jimmy Fallon auditioned for the role. As with Diaz and Winslet, Meyers specially created the character for Black after watching his performance in the musical comedy film School of Rock (2003). On his cast, Meyers commented that \"when I was thinking of this movie I thought he was someone I would like to write a part for and I'm aware he's not Clark Gable, he's not tall dark and handsome, but he's adorable, he's lovable. It's my way of saying this is the right kind of guy, this is what most guys look like if they're lucky, he's so adorable, and why not?\" Cast against type, Black felt \"flattered [and] a little bit nervous\" about Meyers' approach to star in a rom-com, though he eventually agreed to sign on upon learning that he would play opposite Winslet. While he felt it was difficult to find the adorable side in his role, Black appreciated Miles' relationship with music, stating, \"I could relate to that Miles was a film composer and I just got done composing my music for my score. So I knew about that world.\"\nEli Wallach as Arthur Abbott:  Arthur is Amanda's neighbor, a famous screenwriter from the Golden Age of Hollywood whom Iris befriends. Wallach was 90 years old when The Holiday was filmed. Meyers found him so animated and energetic on the set that she had to remind him several times during filming to slow down, move more slowly, and act more like an older man.The film reunited Rufus Sewell and Shannyn Sossamon as they both starred in A Knight's Tale (2001) together, although they do not share a scene. The film also cast Bill Macy as Ernie and Shelley Berman as Norman, friends of Arthur, as well as Kathryn Hahn as Bristol and John Krasinski as Ben, Amanda's employees. Jon Prescott appears as Maggie's short-time affair.\nDustin Hoffman appears in the video rental store in an uncredited cameo as Jack Black talks about the score from The Graduate (1967). According to Hoffman, this was unscripted and unexpected. He was going to Blockbuster Video to rent a film when he saw the lighting from the film production crew and walked over to see what was happening. He knew director Nancy Meyers, who scripted a short scene with him in it.Lindsay Lohan, who had made her motion picture debut in Meyers's remake of The Parent Trap (1998), and James Franco, a friend of Meyers, make uncredited appearances in the trailer of the fictional movie Deception, which Amanda and her team finish at the beginning of The Holiday.

Recording for their debut studio album, Up All Night, began in January 2011. In February 2011, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. Carl Falk and Rami Yacoub produced three songs on the album: \"What Makes You Beautiful,\" \"One Thing\" and \"I Wish,\" all of which were co-written by Falk, Yacoub and Savan Kotecha. Initially, \"One Thing\" was written as two different songs: \"One had a really, really good verse\" and the other track \"had a really, really good chorus\", as noted by Falk in a 2012 interview with Examiner.com. Falk quipped that when they merged the two songs, \"everything fell into place\". Additionally, Falk deemed it the perfect accompaniment to \"What Makes You Beautiful\" and selected it as his favourite \"out of the three tracks [that I have on the Up All Night album]\".It premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 21 November 2011. One Direction confirmed that \"One Thing\" would be released as the third single from their debut studio album, Up All Night, on 22 November 2011. Syco Music described the song as an \"epic pop smash-in-waiting, featuring soaring vocal harmonies, powerhouse guitar riffs and an anthemic chorus that refuses to leave your head.\" The track was released digitally in various European countries on 6 January 2012. \"I Should Have Kissed You\", the B-side to \"One Thing\", was confirmed on 25 January 2012.

After playing a set of two songs (a cover of Metallica's Creeping Death and an original song penned by Moggridge called \"No Man's Land\") and enjoying the experience, the guys decided to continue and pursue the band full-time taking the Epidemic name from the Slayer song.\nAfter recruiting drummer Geoff Bruce and vocalist Carl Fulli to complete the lineup, the band entered a Battle of the Bands contest held at the Mountain View Theater in September 1987.  Having only recruited Fulli a couple of weeks prior, and having no previous experience, the band had no real expectations of winning the contest.  After the first night of competition the band had reached the finals and subsequently won the competition the next night. They won an opening slot for Death Angel the following month.\nThe band recorded their first demo, \"Immortal Minority\", in December 1987.  Achieving minor success in the Bay Area and playing almost every thrash show at the Mountain View Theater, with the likes of Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Death Angel, D.R.I., etc. the band started to branch out further, playing shows at the Stone in San Francisco and the Omni in Oakland.\n\nIn the fall of 1988, Epidemic came to the conclusion that they needed a drummer with further advanced double kick skills and Bruce agreed to leave the band. They recruited Bobby Cochran, a longtime friend and former Punisher drummer, to take over duties. With this line-up, Epidemic went into Telluride Studios in Palo Alto to record their demo, \"Demo '89\".  The band initially gave out 300 free demos after a Vio-lence show at the Omni and their popularity grew tremendously. The band sent out the demo to many magazines, radio stations and labels and created a name for themselves globally.  The band estimates that they sold roughly 5,000-7,000 demos on their own over the next two years. During this time the band was able to headline venues on their own. Epidemic's first headline show at the Stone was filled at 90% capacity. They also reached agreement with Marco Barbieri, who years later would become the head of the label Century Media Records, to become their manager. In addition, a deal was reached with Metalcore Records in Europe for the release of \"Demo '89\" on CD and vinyl. It would be the first official CD released by the band under the title The Truth of What Will Be, though it was only released in Europe.\nIn January 1991, the band recorded another demo, titled \"Extremities '91\", which led to their signing of a record contract with Metal Blade Records. The band recorded their United States debut album, Decameron, at HOS studios in Palo Alto. The album was released in the summer of 1992. The band went on a two-week East Coast tour with Malevolent Creation and Suffocation in December 1992 to support it, and eight weeks later headed out on a nationwide tour with Cannibal Corpse and Unleashed in early 1993. Epidemic gained considerable exposure as well as experience, as this was what they thought was the beginning of their touring years.\nAfter coming home from the tours the band focused on writing new material but asked Higbey to leave the band. This was a difficult decision for the band but they moved forward as a four-piece and continued to write and prepare for their next album. Entering Razor's Edge studios in San Francisco in the fall of 1993, the band recorded their album, Exit Paradise, which was released in October 1994. The band decided to break up a couple months after the release of this album  due to differences in the band and the label's lack of support.\nIn 2011 Divebomb Records approached the band to release all of the band's demos (Immortal Minority-1988, Demo '89-1989, and Extremities '91-1991) as a single release on CD. The subsequent release called \"Pandemic the Demo Anthology\" was released in the summer of 2012.\nIn 2014 the band was notified that a label from Massachusetts called The Crypt acquired the rights to license the band's first album for Metal Blade, Decameron, and will release it on gate fold vinyl in the first half of 2015.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is a rock opera about Pink, a jaded rock star who constructs a psychological \"wall\" of social isolation. The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks and reaching number three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time.\nThe bassist Roger Waters conceived The Wall during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh tour, modelling the character of Pink after himself and Pink Floyd's former member Syd Barrett. Recording spanned from December 1978 to November 1979. The producer Bob Ezrin helped to refine the album's concept and bridge tensions during recording, as the band members were struggling with personal and financial issues at the time. The Wall was the last album to feature Pink Floyd as a quartet; the keyboardist, Richard Wright, was fired by Waters during production but stayed on as a salaried musician.\nThree singles were issued from the album: \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (Pink Floyd's only UK and US number-one single), \"Run Like Hell\", and \"Comfortably Numb\". From 1980 to 1981, Pink Floyd performed the full album on a tour that featured elaborate theatrical effects. In 1982, The Wall was adapted into a feature film for which Waters wrote the screenplay.\nThe Wall is one of the best-known concept albums. With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second best-selling album in the band's catalogue (behind 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon), the best selling double-album of all time, and one of the best-selling albums of all time overall. Some of the outtakes from the recording sessions were used on the group's next album, The Final Cut (1983). In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stone's lists of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".

He criticized the movie for its strong gore content as well as the sado-masochistic treatment of women.

{"id": "91_900", "question": "What genre is Infected?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_20567", "text": "The central theme of The Thing concerns paranoia and mistrust. Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community, instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy. It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies. The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. The Thing focuses on being unable to trust one's peers, but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions.Developed in an era of cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction. Diabolique's Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that preferring annihilation to defeat is a recurring motif, both in MacReady's destruction of the chess computer after being checkmated and his vow to destroy the Thing even at the expense of the team. Clarkson Fisher and Screen Rant's Michael Edward Taylor see the team's accusatory distrust and fear of assimilation as an expression of the American Red Scare of the 1950s and 1960s, while Taylor also sees a commentary on the isolationism of the me generation in the 1970s. Slant Magazine's John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-Vietnam War (1955\u20131975) \"fatigued counterculturalism\" \u2013 the rejection of conventional social norms, each defined by their own eccentricities.\nThe Atlantic's Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, women are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual. Vice's Patrick Marlborough considered The Thing to be a \"scathing examination\" of manliness, noting that identifying the Thing requires intimacy, confession, and empathy to out the creature, but \"male frailty\" prevents this as an option. Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure. Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other.Nerdist's Kyle Anderson and Strange Horizons's Orrin Grey analyzed The Thing as an example of author H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror. Anderson's analysis includes the idea of cosmic horror in large part coming \"from the fear of being overtaken,\" connecting it to Lovecraft's xenophobia and Blair's character arc of becoming what he most fears. In contrast, Anderson compares Blair to MacReady, who represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist. Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self, using Blair's character as an example. Discussing The Thing in the context of the first of three films in Carpenter's \"Apocalypse Trilogy\", Grey states the threat the monster poses to the world \"is less disconcerting than the threat posed to the individual concept of self.\"The Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal. Den of Geek's Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over. In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe The Thing as \"pro-science\" like Who Goes There? or \"anti-science\" like The Thing from Another World, Carpenter chose \"pro-human\", stating, \"It's better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who's not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon.\" Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the epidemic of HIV at the time, which could be identified only by a blood test.Since its release, many theories have been developed to attempt to answer the film's ambiguous ending shared by MacReady and Childs. Several suggest that Childs was infected, citing Dean Cundey's statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of uninfected characters, something absent from Childs. Similarly, others have noted a lack of visible breath from the character in the frigid air. While both aspects are present in MacReady, their absence in Childs has been explained as a technical issue with the filming.

Joe McElhaney suggests in A Companion to Robert Altman, the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's 3 Women (1977) was inspired directly by Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing Images five years prior. In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\"Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.

This genre includes such critically revered films as Psycho, Repulsion, and Persona.\" Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to Altman's earlier film That Cold Day in the Park (1969) and his later 3 Women, declaring them a trilogy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Paul Hoggart wrote in The Times that, \"It is amiably amusing, but may suffer from comparison with last year's Outnumbered, which covered similar ground with superb dexterity.\" One critic from the Daily Mirror said, \"Stephen Mangan's latest incarnation as recovering alcoholic Keith doesn't land with the same weight as Steve Coogan's Tommy Saxondale [from Saxondale] or Jack Dee's Rick Spleen [from Lead Balloon].\"A.

After the second episode had been broadcast, he wrote that, \"Sadly, what modest potential the show evinced last week had evaporated in the interim. Recovering alcoholic Keith was again suffering from acute vagueness. Which was fine. But he also seemed to have lost his few remaining booze-free brain cells because he kept getting into scrapes as a result of not being able to use a mobile phone properly. If he'd been Victor Meldrew [from One Foot in the Grave], or a man of that generation, this might have been just about credible. But for an educated man in his thirties it was risible and came across as contrived beyond belief. A paper-thin character to begin with, with no job, no friends and no real personality to speak of, Keith was now entirely transparent, revealed as a mere vehicle for lazy situation comedy.

The religious message in the work and its uncertain, possibly satiric, tone has also alienated some theorists from the work.An applied example of More's Utopia can be seen in Vasco de Quiroga's implemented society in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, which was directly inspired by More's work.\nDuring the opening scene in the film A Man for All Seasons, Utopia is mentioned in a conversation.

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

The images of women that most of us raised in the '70s and '80s, and even the '60s, saw of women wasn't always appropriately complicated. A lot of times it was the bimbo or the nerd, you were either pretty or you were ugly and that's sort of how characters were written. With Blossom we were trying to show someone who had ups and downs. Some days she felt good, some days she didn't. We did a great episode called \"Blue Blossom\", which was about her being depressed and those were things we were trying to normalize.\"Bialik added, \"The character did not look like a runway model. She wore normal clothes. Some days we had flannel shirts and jeans days. And the actress playing her, me, was not a traditionally attractive female that people were used to seeing on TV, especially for lead women. The fact that it is so commonplace now\u2026 I don't know that we're uniquely responsible for that, but we definitely were the first network show I knew about at that time that was about a girl.\"The outfits worn by Blossom and Six turned the characters into trend setters, popularizing flowered, floppy hats, baby-doll dresses, and sundresses.

Harper's niece (Young Joan) enters and claims that she can't sleep. After a few attempts by her aunt to get her back in bed, she tells Harper that she just came back into the house after climbing out of her window to investigate a sound that she heard. Joan says that she just witnessed her uncle, Harper's husband, loading bloody children and other people into the back of a lorry. After repeated attempts to censor what Joan saw, Harper tells her that the uncle is saving the children and taking them to a safer place. She tells Joan that she can never tell anyone about what she saw because it would put all of their lives in danger. Harper claims they are on the good side and are making the world a better place.\nAct 2, Scene 1 is roughly 15 years later in a factory where an adult Joan has just begun her professional career as a milliner. Her co-worker Todd is an established hatter and is experienced in the field. Various days at the factory are seen, with the hats that Joan and Todd are making in various stages of completion over time. Todd and Joan exchange basic conversation about this body of work and about their previous works. Todd says that the company has been pushing for hats to be created quicker for the parades; they used to have two weeks to finish a hat but now they only have one.\nScene 2: Joan and Todd learn more about each other through a discussion about their current hat designs. Todd brings up a hypothesis that the way the company gets contracts is corrupt, claiming there is a certain person's brother-in-law that is involved. Joan wants to know more, but Todd doesn't want to talk about it at work. Joan changes the topic, saying she does not like to watch the trials at night. Todd says he watches them every night while drinking Pernod, or absinthe.\nScene 3: Todd and Joan speak about different hat genres: Animal and Abstract. Joan changes the subject and asks why Todd doesn't do something (regarding the corruption). He says he spends days wondering what he should do.\nScene 4: Joan and Todd compliment each other on their almost completed hats. Todd announces he is going to talk to \"him\" (someone working above Todd). He says he is going to talk about the brother-in-law and hint at the possibility of leaking information to a friend of his who is a journalist. He say that if he lost his job, he'd miss Joan.\nScene 5 shows the completed hats of Todd and Joan on the heads of prisoners being marched to have the hats \"judged\" in the trials.\nScene 6 returns to the factory. Joan states that she can't believe that she won. She says she doesn't understand why more aren't kept, because they could be re-used. Todd says that keeping more hats would put them out of work. Joan thinks it is sad that all the hats are burned with the bodies. Todd says that the hats are metaphorical for life. He is not bothered that only three out of nearly 300 hats that he has created made it to the museum. He loves making beauty that disappears. Todd brings up his meeting with \"him\". \"He\" said, \"These things must be thought about\". Todd wonders if \"he\" was talking about the content of their meeting, or if he should fire Todd. Joan reminds Todd about the journalist he knows. Joan hypothesizes that the whole industry is corrupt. She says that if Todd is fired, she will resign. Todd almost tells Joan that he loves her, but quickly changes to saying that he loves beads.\nAct 3, Scene 1 finds Harper and Todd at Harper's house waiting for Joan to return. They discuss the paranoia caused by not knowing what side various aspects of nature is on. They are very worried about Joan who eventually returns in a very frazzled state. She delivers a monologue about her fear of every natural thing on her journey (a stream, horses, light, and dark). She does not know whose side of the war they are on.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo) is a discount store clerk struggling to raise two sons with her husband, a compulsive gambler who has disappeared with the funds she had earmarked to finance the purchase of a double-wide mobile home. While searching for him, she encounters Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham), a Mohawk bingo-parlor employee who is driving his car, which she claims she found abandoned with the keys in the ignition at the local bus station. The two women, who have both fallen on hard economic times, form a desperate and uneasy alliance and begin smuggling illegal immigrants from Canada into the United States across the frozen St. Lawrence River for $1,200 each.\nRay's older son T.J. wants to find a job and help support the family so they can afford to eat something more substantial than popcorn and Tang. He and his mother clash over whether he should remain in high-school and look after his little brother Ricky or drop out to work. To make matters worse, T.J. sets an outside corner of the trailer afire with a torch in an attempt to unfreeze the water pipe. Lila longs for the day she will be able to reclaim and live with her young son, who was taken from her by her mother-in-law immediately after his birth.\nBecause the women's route takes them from an Indian reservation in the US to an Indian reserve in Canada, they hope to avoid detection by local law-enforcement. However, their problems escalate when they are asked to smuggle a Pakistani couple and Ray, fearful their duffel bag might contain explosives, leaves it behind in sub-freezing temperatures, only to discover it contained their infant baby when they arrive at their destination. She and Lila retrace their route and find the bag and the baby, which Lila insists is dead, but which she revives moments before being reunited with the baby's parents. The experience leaves her shaken, and she announces she no longer wants to participate in the smuggling operation. But Ray, needing just one more crossing to finance the down payment on her mobile home, coerces her into joining her for one last journey.\nThey pick up two  Asian women from a strip club for crossing. When the club owner tries to short them, Ray successfully threatens him with a gun. When she is re-entering her car, the irate club owner retaliates by shooting Ray in the ear. Shaken, her fast and erratic driving catches the attention of the provincial police. Ray tries to elude capture by crossing the frozen river where one of the wheels of the car breaks through the ice. The four women abandon the vehicle and take refuge at the Indian reservation.\nBecause the police are demanding a scapegoat, the tribal head decides to excommunicate Lila for five years due to her smuggling history which involved the death of her Mohawk husband. Surprised then saddened by the news, Ray gives in to Lila's pleas to go free for the sake of her children. However, running through the woods, Ray has a fit of conscience and returns. Ray gives her share of money to Lila with instructions for taking care of her (Ray's) sons and seeing through the purchase plans for a mobile home.

An opportunity for the suspension of disbelief even in the here and now ambiance of television\". The budget for each episode averaged \u00a35,000.\nShubik soon ran into difficulties finding material suitable for adaptation, a problem that had plagued earlier aborted attempts to get a similar series off the ground.  A useful contact Shubik made was with John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction, founder of the magazine New Worlds and agent for many British science fiction writers.  Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis.\nThe actor Boris Karloff, well known for his association with the horror film genre, was chosen as host for the new series.  This was an idea taken from such U.S. anthology series as The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller (which Karloff himself had hosted) and was in line with what had been done for Armchair Mystery Theatre, which was introduced by Donald Pleasence.\nThree scripts for Out of This World, adaptations of Philip K. Dick's \"Impostor\" and Clifford D. Simak's \"Immigrant\" as well as an original story called \"Botany Bay\", were supplied by Terry Nation, who would, a short time after, create the Daleks for Doctor Who.

The game deliberately avoids traits of its Japanese role-playing game contemporaries: it is not set within the fantasy genre and only enters science fiction for its final sequence. The player fights in warehouses and laboratories instead of in standard dungeons. Instead of swords, assault weapons, and magic, the player uses baseball bats, toy guns, and psychic abilities. The game's protagonist, Ninten, is about 12 years old.Like the Dragon Quest series, Mother uses a random encounter combat system. The player explores the overworld from a top-down perspective and occasionally enters a first-person perspective battle sequence where the player chooses attack options from a series of menus. On their turn, the player selects between options to fight, guard, check enemy attributes, run away, use items, or use offensive, defensive, or healing psychic powers. The player can also set the battle on autopilot with the \"auto\" option. Critical hits register with the series' signature \"SMAAAASH\" text and sound.The player can press a button to have Ninten \"check\" or \"talk\" with nearby people, animals, and objects. The game shares similarities with its sequel, EarthBound: there is a game save option through using a phone to call Ninten's father, an option to store items with Ninten's sister at home, and an automated teller machine for banking money (ATM). The members of Ninten's party are all visible on the overworld screen at once, and are analogous to EarthBound's party members in style and function. Mother's world map does not keep locations separate, and instead connects all areas (akin to the Pok\u00e9mon game series).

He has been in the USA working in the oil business for many years. He is greeted enthusiastically by his sister, Louise, but his elderly father is more reserved. Their childhood friend Alan welcomes Mike. Louise shows Mike to his old room where, alone, he unlocks his suitcase and reveals a secret compartment full of dollar bills and a gun. He hides the suitcase.\nAt dinner he is surprised to receive a phone call at the family home. Someone has tracked him down.\nAt the bank he changes a $50 bill. A man approaches him and demands his \"cut\". They arrange to meet near a railway shunting yard. Mike goes to the meeting with his gun; a scuffle starts when he produces it. Alan is passing, and Mike, who is near to being killed by the other man, tells him to grab the gun. Alan reluctantly shoots the man dead to stop him killing Mike. They leave him and drive off, arguing whether to tell the police. Alan believes it was justifiable self-defence, but Mike says if Alan goes to the police, he will not support Alan's story. The police find the body, and tyre tracks leading from the scene.\nAlan is Roman Catholic and decides to confess his crime (shown in the opening scene). As he receives absolution, an unseen assailant shoots him dead. The priest refuses to tell the police what had been confessed, despite them suggesting he may become a target. The police compare the bullets and (wrongly) decide that both victims were killed by the same man. They match the tyre tracks with Alan's car. They establish that Mike's alibi is false, but they cannot work out how he is connected.\nThe police inspector takes Louise to dinner. He implies that Mike had been in trouble with the American police, and tells her Mike lied about being in a pub with Alan on the night of the murder, but he gets nothing from her. Louise is disturbed and searches Mike's room. Mike catches her, he tells her that Alan murdered the man, and he lied about the pub to protect Alan. Louise is unsure what to think, but asks if Alan killed the man, who killed Alan?\nThe police start to work out what happened but have no proof. They ask the priest to go about his work as usual, and they will watch him, in case the murderer comes after him, to which he agrees. Meanwhile Mike decides to flee to South Africa.\nLouise forces Mike's suitcase and finds both the cash and the gun. Mike confronts her and then confesses what happened both next to the railway and in the church. He says the truth will kill their father.\nThe police set a trap by telling the family untruthfully that the priest has obtained permission from Rome to make a statement the next morning about Alan's confession. Louise leaves to visit an aunt, in order to keep away from Mike before he goes, but the inspector tells her they are trying to trap her brother and she must stay with the police until Mike is apprehended. She sadly agrees to take part in the trap by taking a rerouted telephone call from Mike, pretending that she is at their aunt's house. Meanwhile, their father has realised that something is wrong and, when Mike tries to leave the house to kill the priest, he confronts Mike. Mike pushes his father out of his wheelchair onto the floor and leaves the house, hearing his father call out 'Murderer!'\nMike heads for the church, but the police are watching. He hides in the organ loft and is about to shoot the priest mid-service when the organ starts playing and throws him off aim. The police rush in, joined by Louise. Mike climbs to the bell tower, firing at the police, but runs out of bullets. The bell starts to ring, he is deafened, and falls to his death.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_952", "question": "What genre is Kiss?", "ctxs": [{"id": "526_52634", "text": "From the start of writing the Buffy series, Joss Whedon asserted that it would never have a \"very special episode\" as in contemporary series Beverly Hills, 90210, The Wonder Years, or Party of Five, where the core cast of characters addresses a single issue (AIDS, drug abuse, or alcoholism, for example) and resolve all the problems at the end. Whedon was not interested in finding a life-affirming lesson for \"The Body\". Rather, he wanted to capture the isolation and boredom involved in the minutes and hours after finding a loved one has died, what he termed \"the black ashes in your mouth numbness of death\". He did not intend to resolve any religious or existential questions about the end of life, but wanted to examine the process in which a person becomes a mere body. Whedon's mother, a teacher, also died of a cerebral aneurysm, and he drew on his own experiences, and those of friends and other writers, in constructing the episode. He tried to achieve an \"unlovely physicality\" in \"The Body\" to portray the upsetting minutiae involved in attempting to comprehend what is incomprehensible.Small details became significant: to protect her dignity, Buffy pulls the hem of Joyce's skirt down after it rode up when she attempted CPR; the camera focuses on a breeze through wind chimes while Buffy vomits; to emphasize Buffy's isolation, the scene has no exterior establishing shots of the house.The opening sequence of \"The Body\" was also the closing scene of the previous episode, \"I Was Made to Love You\"; this is the only episode in the series that was first aired without a \"Previously on Buffy\" lead-in. The Christmas dinner scene was used both to contrast the stark reality of the rest of the episode and to avoid having the credits appear over the beginning scenes where Buffy is trying to revive her mother.The episode is presented in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar (Buffy). Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move through the house and calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, \"We're not supposed to move the body!\" Both Gellar and Trachtenberg (Dawn) were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, \"you try to separate it as best you can and at the same time it adds that extra layer\". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar \"at a fever pitch\", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure.Kristine Sutherland (Joyce) was informed during the third season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended to spend time in Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of \"The Body\" was strange and tense because she had been a regular character throughout the series and she was suddenly playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, but getting into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies.The most difficult scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession about what to wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences when he was at a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying that she was able to be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene.Whedon's rejection of the \"very special episode\" format impelled him to address the physicality of Willow and Tara's relationship within \"The Body\". Before this episode, they had held hands and danced on screen, but they had not kissed. A genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as the \"lesbian kiss episode\" in the 1990s, where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored. Whedon set out to acknowledge Willow's and Tara's affection without making it the primary focus of the show. For attempting this, he received resistance from the airing network, the WB. Whedon informed them that the kiss between Willow and Tara was \"not negotiable\". According to Whedon, the conversation about the kiss was approached by the network executives, who were concerned with the number of gay relationships on the network. Whedon countered that the kiss was \"true to character\" and said he would quit the show if the network forbade it. It was the only time during the series he threatened to do so.When Willow and Tara first met in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the relationship to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For the rest of the season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in \"The Body\", saying \"They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props when it came to the [characters' first] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy.\" Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was \"truly groundbreaking\"; no long speech, no huge discovery: \"Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world\". Tropiano calls it \"A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do.\"  Shortly before the end of the scene, while Xander is talking, Willow can be seen silently mouthing \"I love you\" to Tara.\nAudiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon expected to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence was similar to a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers \"the heart of the experience\" and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the \"whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters\". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality of dealing with the crisis. Whedon used another long tracking shot from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The panel, for what was considered by 64 to be Nintendo's flagship game at the event, featured several big machines and sculptures, such as those for Banjo and Mumbo Jumbo. The Nintendo 64 games presented at E3 were lauded by Nintendo Power as \"pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment, innovation, and intensity\". Banjo-Kazooie was a major example, highlighting how its advanced technology created a Disney-esque \"rich, animated world full of fun animals and great music\", visuals containing \"rich textures, creative lighting,\" and dynamic music. The reaction from gamers and critics towards the game was generally positive, 64 magazine predicting it to be \"the biggest hit of the year.\" However, it was also met with skepticism as a rip-off of Super Mario 64 and overly cute, and despised its new name. The gaming community was also mystified by some of its concepts, such as the usage of a bird-bear duo for a Super Mario 64-esque genre, fart sound effects for speech, and Kazooie pooping out eggs as an attack.The game was then presented at the 1997 annual Nintendo Space World event, where the first five worlds were playable. Its panel had women that were dressed up as Banjo with shirts on. N64 Magazine gave a glowing review of the panel, admitting it to be the event's most absorbing experience, even moreso than the Zelda game that got the most attention from other gamers and journalists. They considered the worlds immersive due to its \"graphical opulence,\" such as the \"incredibly realistic ripples\" on the water, and choice of environments \"realistic\" even considering the cartoony characters. They also positively commented on its implementation of the dual-character mechanic (particularly how certain sections require a specific character unlike other games).Banjo-Kazooie was initially scheduled for a release in November 1997, in the US 24 November, but was delayed to give developers more time for polish. When Rare met Nintendo of America's Howard Lincoln at E3 1997, he was against a delay, complaining: \"We've committed $20 million to this campaign\". To fill that year's Christmas schedule, Lincoln told Rare to include Donkey Kong characters in an R.C. Pro-Am game they were developing at the time, turning it into Diddy Kong Racing (1997). Eurogamer called Diddy Kong Racing \"something of a testing ground for Rare's [Nintendo 64]-era heroes\", as it included Banjo and Conker as playable characters prior to featuring in their own games. In the following months, Rare released screenshots at such a rate that by May 1998, N64 Magazine suspected the game was completed besides testing.Banjo-Kazooie was released on 29 June 1998 in North America, 17 July 1998 in Europe, and 6 December 1998 in Japan as Banjo and Kazooie's Big Adventure (\u30d0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u3068\u30ab\u30ba\u30fc\u30a4\u306e\u5927\u5192\u967a). The Japan date was shifted multiple times, set to be released before other territories in January 1998 as of November 1997, and moved to April months later. The UK date was also set to 16 March 1998 as of Christmas 1997, before being moved to July two months later. In Europe, the game was released in the summer, an active season for Nintendo 64 releases that followed a scarce period and included games of various genres, such as Quest 64 (1998), Mortal Kombat 4 (1998), Off Road Challenge (1998), Dezaemon 3D (1998) and Virtual Chess 64 (1998). It had a marketing budget of $10 million.Banjo-Kazooie performed well in both the UK and US. Virgin Megastore reported that the game was topping the UK charts as of 21 September 1998. In Japan, Banjo-Kazooie entered Famitsu's Top 10 sales charts for the week ending 13 December 1998, selling 74,000 copies for a total of 117,399. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, the game took home a \"Gold\" prize for revenues above \u20ac26 million in the European Union during 1998. As of March 2003, the game had sold more than 405,000 units in Japan. As of December 2007, it had sold more than 1.8 million copies in the US.

Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.\nIn the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a \"champion\", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their \"Nexus\", a large structure located within.\nLeague of Legends has received generally positive reviews; critics have highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value.

The player chooses an icon representing an \"experience\" or situation to explore. Each icon bears a symbol showing what kind of experience it represents (for example, a heart denotes an emotional event). After making a choice in each node, the user is moved back to the tree with that node marked as completed. In this manner, the user progresses through the alter ego's entire life and examines what impact their decisions had. In the process of playing the game, the player's alter ego proceeds through seven phases with their respective experiences: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood, middle adulthood, and old age. Some of these experiences are disturbing, and can even lead to premature death (such as being raped and killed by a child molester), though most tend to be humorous.\nAlter Ego keeps track of certain player statistics throughout the game, which in turn affect the alter ego's ability to succeed at certain choices. For example, in the high school segment, the player might be given the choice of trying out for the school baseball team, or deciding instead to crack down and study harder to improve in math. This decision might change the alter ego's \"Physical\", \"Confidence\", and \"Intellectual\" statistics, which in future experiences might influence the alter ego's ability to get into college or succeed in social situations.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Female Gothic differs from the Male Gothic in that elements initially perceived as supernatural are eventually revealed to have rational explanations, rather than serving as indicators of an actual ghost of otherworldly entity. These explanations largely serve to expose a true human threat, often the desire and motivations of characters seeking control and power over others. The Female Gothic also tends to advocate against injustice committed against female characters, ascribing these heroines with more agency and independence than was typical for representations the time as well as the genre of the Gothic itself. Speaking of Diana Wallace's book, Female Gothic Histories: Gender, History and the Gothic, Yael Shapira concludes that the Female Gothic \"helps articulate women's experiences and their problematic status in both history and historiography\". This differs from the traditional style of the Male Gothic, which Wallace feels is limited by the inherent biases of a male perspective. In this sense, the Female Gothic \"extended engagement with the ways in which the feminine has historically been constructed through male eyes\" (106).

For the first time an Asian music was not parodied utilising familiar stereotypes and misconceptions, but rather transferred in toto into a new environment with sympathy and rare understanding.\" Reck views it as the first in \"a series of finely crafted Indian-based songs\" by Harrison that would extend through his solo career, and while admiring the range of authentic Hindustani musical elements in the composition, he concludes: \"All of this in a three-minute song!\" Peter Lavezzoli describes \"Love You To\" as \"the first conscious attempt in pop to emulate a non-Western form of music in structure and instrumentation\", while Reck calls it \"the first song in the Euro-American pop music canon that is scored predominantly for Asian musical instruments, [with] sitar, tabla and tambura replacing rock band guitars, keyboards, bass and drums\". Lavezzoli says of the sitar part: \"[Harrison's] playing throughout the song is an astonishing improvement over 'Norwegian Wood'. In fact, 'Love You To' remains the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician.\"Music critic Lester Bangs termed \"Love You To\" \"the first injection of ersatz Eastern wisdom into rock\", while Peter Doggett credits Harrison's spiritual concerns with inspiring \"an entire [new] genre of songwriting\". The song has been recognised as a precursor to the world music genre. Through the success of Revolver in 1966, it was a key factor in the rise in popularity of Indian classical music among contemporary Western youth. In addition, the song inspired other rock musicians to experiment with non-Western instruments and tones, and so helped expand the scope of raga rock, while its mix of Indian instrumentation and distorted electric guitar was highly influential in the development of 1960s psychedelic music.Reviewing Harrison's musical career in a 2002 issue of Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson wrote that \"Love You To\" \"opened creative doors through which Harrison's bandmates may not \u2013 and [George] Martin certainly would not \u2013 have ever dreamed of passing\". Rolling Stone contributor Greg Kot pairs it with \"Taxman\" as two \"major contributions\" that saw Harrison \"[come] into his own as a songwriter\" on Revolver. Kot describes \"Love You To\" as \"a boldly experimental track\" and \"the first full-scale incorporation of Eastern instruments on a Beatles album\". Writing on his music website Elsewhere, Graham Reid views the song as a \"classic\" due to its standing as \"arguably the first in Western pop ... which owes nothing to pop music traditions. It is an Indian song in its structure and execution.\"AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers \"Love You To\" to be Harrison's \"first and best foray into Indian music\", while Bruce Eder, also writing for AllMusic, views it as \"exquisite\". In his song review for the same website, Richie Unterberger is unimpressed with the track; while acknowledging that \"Love You To\" was \"Undoubtedly ... another indication of the group's rapidly broadening barriers\", he cites a lead vocal that \"drone[s] on in a rather lugubrious way\", Harrison's slightly \"disheveled\" sitar playing, and lyrics that constitute \"a rather muddled mix of free love advocacy, meditations on the transience of life on Earth, and chip-on-the-shoulder wariness of people out to exploit him\". Although he finds the melody \"sourly repetitious\", Ian MacDonald writes that the track is \"distinguished by the authenticity of its Hindustani classical instrumentation and techniques\", and admires Harrison's understanding of the genre. In a 2009 review for Paste magazine, Mark Kemp described Revolver as the album on which the Beatles \"completed their transformation from the mop tops of three years earlier into bold, groundbreaking experimental rockers\", and added: \"Harrison's 'Love You To' is pure Indian raga \u2013 sitar and tablas punctuated by the occasional luminous guitar riff jolting through the song's paranoid, drug-fueled lyrics like a blinding ray of sun into a dark forest.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds (Museum Bredius, The Hague).  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format.\n\nThe influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time.\nThe traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings.\nWhile his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer.Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples. This series of engravings had an important influence on the Dutch animal painter Paulus Potter, in particular the way in which van Laer was able to place figures, animals, buildings and trees in a coherent pictorial space.  A second set of 6 plates was entitled Horses and depicts the bleak lot of horses belonging to poor peasants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others.

{"id": "91_990", "question": "What genre is Unity?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_8983", "text": "While Tchaikovsky struggled with his first three symphonies, developments in Europe led to an alternative to this genre that, in a reverse twist, offered to change the scope of the symphony. Hungarian composer Franz Liszt desired a form of orchestral music that would offer greater flexibility in developing musical themes than the symphony then allowed but also preserve the overall unity of a musical composition. His objective was to expand single-movement works beyond the concert overture format. By doing so, he hoped to combine the dramatic, emotive and evocative qualities of concert overtures with the scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movements of symphonies.The fruit of Liszt's labors was what he eventually termed symphonic poems. In them, he used two alternatives to sonata form. Beethoven had used the first of these, cyclic form, to link separate movements thematically with one another. Liszt took this process one step further by combining themes into a single-movement cyclic structure. The second alternative, thematic transformation, originated with Haydn and Mozart. This process worked in a similar manner as variation but instead of a theme being changed into a related or subsidiary version of the main one, it becomes transformed into a related but separate, independent theme. Beethoven used it in the finale of his Ninth Symphony when he transformed the theme of the \"Ode to Joy\" into a Turkish march. Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes. Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his Wanderer Fantasy, a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt. However, Liszt learned to create longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation.Liszt's approach to musical form in his symphonic poems was also unorthodox. Instead of following a strict presentation and development of musical themes as in sonata form, he placed his themes into a loose, episodic pattern. There, recurring melodies called motifs were thematically transformed as musical and  programmatic needs dictated. (Richard Wagner would make good use of this practice in his operas and music dramas.) Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, were foreshortened. Codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, were greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffled into new and unexpected patterns of order and three- or four-movement structures were rolled into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.A number of composers, especially Bohemian and Russian, followed in Liszt's footsteps to develop the symphonic poem further.  Added to this was the Russian love of story-telling, for which the genre seemed expressly tailored. Tchaikovsky wrote a symphonic poem, Fatum, after he had finished his First Symphony and first opera, The Voyevoda. There, he dabbled with the free form the new genre offered. However, the work did not come out well and he destroyed it after two performances. For his next programmatic work, the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet, Tchaikovsky reverted to sonata form, structuring it in a similar fashion to Beethoven's concert overtures. However, in a case of musical cross-pollination, the symphonic poem offered the potential to change the nature of the symphony in its merging of a wide emotional range with symphonic resources. This potential played to the conception Tchaikovsky would form of the symphony as a vehicle for personal expression and one whose details could, as he phrased it to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, \"be manipulated as freely as one chooses.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_992", "question": "What genre is Omen?", "ctxs": [{"id": "526_52015", "text": "American scholar Brad Duren argued that The Omen was part of a trend of films featuring cosmic horror that started with Rosemary's Baby in 1968, but the film was unusual at the time because it concerned the \"end times\" predicted in The Book of Revelation and focused on a form of premillennialism favored by American dispensationalists. Duren further maintained that the box office success of The Omen, which concerned the first stages of the Apocalypse as the Antichrist is born, reflected the zeitgeist of 1970s America.In 1973, an advertising executive and evangelical Christian, Robert Munger, who had read Hal Lindsey's book The Late, Great Planet Earth, speculated to film producer Harvey Bernard about the possibility that the Antichrist might be walking the earth in the form of a child, unknown to the vast majority of humanity. This conversation inspired Bernard with the idea for the film that became The Omen. Bernard commissioned scriptwriter David Seltzer to write a script for the film. Seltzer in turn borrowed many ideas from dispensationalism, especially The Late, Great Planet Earth, while also inventing his own. For an example, a supposed quote from the Book of Revelation featured in The Omen (\"When the Jews return to Zion and a comet rips the sky and the Holy Roman Empire rises, then you and I must die; from the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother, 'til man exists no more\") is not in fact in that book. Likewise, the sinister figure who will rule the world for seven years predicted in Revelation, commonly known as the Antichrist, is not described in the Bible as the son of Satan, whereas Satan is the father of the Antichrist in The Omen.\nJim Knipfel in The Omen: The Pedigree of a Horror Classic on Den of Geek, opines of The Omen, \"[T]here is no single source quite as central and clearly influential as \"The Devil's Platform\", a 1974 episode from the first season of Kolchak: The Night Stalker, with stars Tom Skerritt (credited as \"Tom Skerrit\") as Robert Palmer, a young politician whose meteoric rise seemed to come out of nowhere. He seems a shoo-in to become the new state senator from Illinois, but is already gunning for the White House. ...Palmer is rising quickly in the world of politics, which of course was the subtext of the entire Omen franchise. Anyone who threatens his rise or stands in his way \u2014 major political donors, speechwriters for the opposing candidate, even the opposing candidate himself \u2014 ends up dying mysteriously as the result of a tragic and freakish accident, which was the hook that brought most people to the theaters to see the Omen films in the first place. ...Palmer, again like Damien, also has a very protective Rottweiler familiar, who is impervious to harm. ... Like David Warner's photographer in the first film, inexplicable photographic anomalies help point Kolchak in the right direction. ... And finally, in the end the ambitious Satanic candidate is dispatched with a holy instrument (blessed daggers in The Final Conflict, holy water in The Night Stalker). So there. In a way, watching \"The Devil's Platform\" is a bit like watching all three Omen films from an outsider journalist's perspective, except Kolchak is able to wrap the whole thing up neatly in an hour.\"The success of the film in 1976 may have been due to a sense of malaise in the West at the time. As film critic John Kenneth Muir wrote: \"What if the Bible is correct? What if all the signs of the Apocalypse are happening around about now? Would we believe them? Heck, would we even notice?\" Duren wrote that, although it was unlikely that most people who viewed the film in 1976 accepted the dispensationalist viewpoint, the mere feeling that the world or the West was in terminal decline gave the film a resonance that its subsequent sequels lacked.\nBeyond the success of the film, Duren wrote that the impact of the film on popular culture can be seen in the way that many people accept the dispensationalist reading of the Book of Revelation as the correct interpretation whereas in fact, the dispensationalist interpretation was and still is rejected by many churches. Duren wrote that dispensationalism had once been a \"fringe\" theory within Protestant theology, but due to the popularity of The Omen it is now widely accepted as doctrine.Duren notes that in the film it has to be explained to Robert Thorn that the number 666 is the \"mark of the beast\" and speculates that audiences in 1976 were not familiar with this aspect of the Book of Revelation, but because of the film's popularity, the number 666 has entered popular culture and most people, even those of a secular bent, are aware of the sinister significance attached to the number.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds (Museum Bredius, The Hague).  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format.\n\nThe influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time.\nThe traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings.\nWhile his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer.Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals.

I admired the Francesco passages rather than feeling engrossed by them and occasionally it felt as if Smith's ideas were so clever they were in danger of getting in the way of the story. But there is no doubt that Smith is dazzling in her daring. The sheer inventive power of her new novel pulls you through, gasping, to the final page.\"\nLaura Miller, in The Guardian comments on duality of the novel: \"While I do not doubt the two halves of How to Be Both may be read in either order with satisfying results, once read, it's impossible to know what it would be like to first encounter it in the alternate order... How to Be Both is unforgettable. I can never know what it would be like to meet George before knowing Del Cossa, so that version of the novel is forever lost to me. It's a bit sad. But it was worth it.\"\nArifa Akbar in The Independent also comments on the dual narrative, writing that \"Smith has written a radical novel, one that becomes two novels, with discrete meanings, through its (re)ordering... How to be Both shows us that the arrangement of a story, even when it's the same story, can change our understanding of it and define our emotional attachments. We may have known this, but to see it enacted with such imagination is dazzling indeed. Those writers making doomy predictions about the death of the novel should read Smith's re-imagined novel/s, and take note of the life it contains.\"\nPatrick Flanery of The Telegraph finds that \"The pain of mourning and loss is seared into the lives of Smith\u2019s two motherless heroines, but despite the novel\u2019s refusal of consolation and the profound seriousness of the questions it explores, How to be Both brims with palpable joy, not only at language, literature, and art\u2019s transformative power, but at the messy business of being human, of wanting to be more than one kind of person at once. The possibilities unleashed by the desire to be neither one thing nor the other means that one may ever and always strive to be both. With great subtlety and inventiveness, Smith continues to expand the boundaries of the novel\".\nRon Charles of The Washington Post writes that \"This gender-blending, genre-blurring story, bounces across centuries, tossing off profound reflections on art and grief, without getting tangled in its own postmodern wires. It\u2019s the sort of death-defying storytelling acrobatics that don\u2019t seem entirely possible \u2014 How did she get here from there? \u2014 but you\u2019ve got to be willing to hang on...This sounds like a novel freighted with postmodern gimmicks, but Smith knows how to be both fantastically complex and incredibly touching.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The whistle blows at 6 AM, and three sailors emerge: Ozzie, Chip, and Gabey, excited for 24 hours of shore leave (\"New York, New York\"). Chip is excited to see all the sights that his father told him about after his trip to New York in 1934, with his decade-old guidebook by his side. Ozzie is interested in finding a date (or several) because Manhattan women are the prettiest in the world. Gabey is looking for one special girl, hopefully, one who reminds him of his 7th-grade girlfriend, Minnie Finchley. On the subway, the three spot a poster of Ivy Smith, \"Miss Turnstiles\" for June. Gabey, overcome with love for the picture, takes it with him. An old lady angrily tells him that she will have him arrested for vandalism and the three run off.\nGabey wants to meet Ivy Smith, despite Chip's protests that the city is too big for things like that to happen. Ozzie, recounting an incident where Gabey saved their lives, convinces Chip to help Gabey find her. Chip grudgingly agrees and Ozzie coaches Gabey on what to do once he meets Ivy (\"Gabey's Comin',\" performed in the 2014 Broadway revival). The three break up, Gabey to Carnegie Hall, Ozzie to the Museum of Modern Art, and Chip to the \"subway people.\" The three imagine what Miss Turnstiles must be like, and a ballet is performed in which Ivy demonstrates all the many different, contradictory, skills she has.\nThe little old lady finds a policeman and the two chase after the sailors.\nA young female cabbie named Hildy is found asleep in her cab by her irate boss S. Uperman. He fires her and tells her to return the cab in an hour or he will call the police. Looking for one last fare, she comes across Chip. It's love at first sight, at least for Hildy. She forcefully kisses Chip, but Chip wants nothing more than to find Ivy. Hildy tempts him into taking a tour of the city, but all the places he wants to go (the Hippodrome, the Forrest Theatre to see Tobacco Road, the New York City Aquarium, and the Woolworth Building) are either no longer in existence or no longer notable. The only place Hildy wants to take Chip is her apartment (\"Come Up to My Place\"). Uperman joins the lady and the cop in the chase, implying Hildy stole the cab.\nOzzie goes to the museum but mistakenly arrives at the Museum of Natural History instead of the Museum of Modern Art. There he meets a budding anthropologist, Claire de Loone. She is amazed at his resemblance to a prehistoric man and asks him for his measurements. He mistakes her scientific interest for romantic interest, but as she explains, she is engaged to be married to the famous Judge Pitkin W. Bridgework. Pitkin has taught her to learn to know men scientifically, but she, like Ozzie, often gets \"Carried Away.\" The two of them accidentally knock over a dinosaur. Waldo Figment, the professor who built the dinosaur, joins Uperman, the cop, and the lady in the chase.\nGabey mopes around the city. Without love, New York is nothing but a \"Lonely Town.\"\nAt Carnegie Hall, Ivy Smith is taking lessons from Madame Dilly, a drunk who clearly does not know vocal training. Ivy is not quite as glamorous as the Miss Turnstiles contest has made her out to be. In reality, while she is studying to do all the things they said she was, she is nothing more than a \"cooch dancer\" at Coney Island. When Madame Dilly leaves to refill her flask, Gabey enters. He asks Ivy to go out with him, and to his surprise, she accepts. Gabey leaves ecstatically. Madame Dilly advises Ivy to break the date as \"sex and art don't mix\" (\"Carnegie Hall Pavane\")\nOzzie accompanies Claire back to her apartment, where he meets Claire's fianc\u00e9, Pitkin W. Bridgework. They try desperately to explain what they are doing together, but Pitkin does not mind (\"I Understand\"). He leaves them alone to go to a meeting, reminding Claire that they are to meet at Diamond Eddie's to celebrate their engagement. The two take advantage of their alone time (\"Carried Away (reprise)\").\nHildy brings Chip and an armful of groceries back to her apartment, promising to cook for him. Chip insists that he must leave to find Ivy. She tells him to call the IRT, but they refuse to give Chip her address or phone number. He decides that he has tried hard enough, and he and Hildy attempt to get physical when her roommate, Lucy Schmeeler, home from work with a cold, intrudes. Hildy finally gets rid of her by convincing her to go to an air-cooled movie. Hildy seduces Chip, bragging about her many talents, not the least of which is her cooking (\"I Can Cook Too\").\nGabey's attitude has done a full 180, and he feels \"Lucky to Be Me.\" Ivy, about to meet Gabey at Nedick's, runs into Madame Dilly, who reminds her that if she doesn't do her cooch dance that night, she'll be fired, and won't be able to pay Madame Dilly for her lessons. Madame Dilly threatens to smear her reputation, and she is forced to stand Gabey up.\nChip and Ozzie both arrive at Nedick's with Hildy and Claire, both dressed as Ivy Smith. Gabey isn't fooled and tells them the story of how he met her. Just then, Madame Dilly arrives with a message from Ivy: she will not be coming because she instead elected to go to a fancy party. Gabey is alone and dejected, but Hildy tells him that she can get him a date: Lucy. The five go into a dance demonstrating the nightlife of the city.\n\nAct IIAt Diamond Eddie's, the dancers perform a number (\"So Long Baby\"). Gabey is still hung up on Miss Turnstiles, and Lucy hasn't shown up yet. A singer, Diana Dream, performs a very sad song, \"I Wish I Was Dead,\" which causes Gabey to feel even sadder. Lucy calls, having accidentally gone to the Diamond Eddie's in Yonkers. The group decides to go to the Congacabana at the suggestion of Claire, but on their way out, they run into Pitkin. Ozzie and Claire try to explain the situation, but as before, all Pitkin says is \"I Understand (reprise).\" The gang leaves for the Congacabana while Pitkin stays behind to pay the check.\nAt the Congacabana, Dolores Dolores (the same performer as \"Diana Dream\") sings the same sad song as before, in Spanish. Hildy interrupts her, saying she had gotten a request to sing. Hildy, as well as Ozzie, Claire, and Chip try to lift Gabey's spirits by reminding him that he can count on them (\"Ya Got Me\"). As they are about to depart for another nightclub, the Slam Bang Club, Pitkin arrives (\"I Understand (reprise)\"). Claire tells him once again to pay the check, also to wait for Lucy and come to the Slam Bang later.\nAt the Slam Bang Club, Madame Dilly is in a drunken stupor. Gabey asks her where Ivy is, and she lets it slip that she is at Coney Island. Gabey runs off to find her. Chip and Ozzie, afraid that he won't be able to get back to the ship on time, rush after him. On their way out, they come across Lucy and Pitkin. Claire once again leaves him to go with Ozzie. Pitkin recalls all the times in his life that he \"understood\" and realizes he's been played the fool by everyone, including Claire (\"Pitkin's Song (I Understand)\"). He also bonds with Lucy and the two of them join the chase along with the little old lady, the police officers, Figment, and Uperman.\nRiding the subway, Gabey dreams about Coney Island and Ivy. An extended dance sequence occurs with Ivy and a dream Gabey in a boxing match (\"Subway Ride/The Great Lover Displays Himself/The Imaginary Coney Island\").\nThe other four have just missed Gabey and are riding another subway car. They wonder about their future after the men have to go back to the ship (\"Some Other Time\").\nAt Coney Island, Ivy, along with several other girls, dances in a show called Rajah Bimmy's Harem Scarem (\"The Real Coney Island\"). Gabey sees Ivy and accidentally tears her already skimpy outfit off. She is arrested for indecent exposure as the chasers arrive and demand the others be arrested. Claire hopes Pitkin will get her out of the situation, but he no longer trusts her and has the three men brought to the naval authorities. The girls ask Pitkin if he's ever \"committed an indiscretion,\" which he staunchly refuses. Just then, he sneezes in the same way as Lucy Schmeeler, casting doubt on his claim.\nAs the clock chimes six, the sailors prepare to get back on the ship. Just then, the girls come running to them, telling them that Pitkin understood. They say a fond farewell as three new sailors leave the ship, eager to have their own adventures in New York City (\"New York, New York (reprise)/Finale Act II\").", "hasanswer": false}]}

They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale.

Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of Dateline NBC, one of which ran for two hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before the airing of the episode. Following the finale, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was filmed on the set of the Friends' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2 million for 30 seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the Seinfeld finale at $1.7 million.In the U.S., 52.5 million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the Seinfeld finale in 1998.

{"id": "91_1020", "question": "What genre is The Visitors?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_38871", "text": "The Birds resembles all the early plays of Aristophanes in key aspects of its dramatic structure. Such resemblances are evidence of a genre of ancient drama known as Old Comedy. Variations from these 'conventions' are significant since they demonstrate either a trend away from Old Comedy, a corruption in the text or a unique dramatic effect that the author intended. Variations in this play are found in the following conventions:\n\nAgon: The agon is a debate or formal argument constructed as a 'symmetrical scene', with two declaimed sections and two songs. The protagonist generally defeats the antagonist in the debate and this decides the outcome of the play long before the play actually ends. The agon in The Birds (lines 451\u2013626) is conventional in form but there is no antagonist \u2013 the two main speakers are Pisthetaerus and his friend Euelpides, with Pisthetaerus delivering a speech and Euelpides providing supportive comments. The birds provide a willing audience and they are easily won over to the protagonist's point of view. A similarly one-sided agon is found in the next surviving play, Lysistrata.\nParabasis: The parabasis is an address to the audience by the Chorus in the absence of any actors. Generally there is a long parabasis in the middle of the play, including a 'parabasis proper' in which the Chorus speaks as the author's representative on issues relating to his career, and usually there is a shorter parabasis near the end. In this play, the first parabasis (678\u2013800) and the second (1058\u20131117) are conventional in structure but the Chorus always speaks in character as birds. Instead of speaking about the poet in the 'parabasis proper', the birds speak about themselves, outlining their genealogy, their value to the audience and their effect on the audience's vocabulary \u2013 in all these topics however there are amusing echoes of things a Chorus would ordinarily say on behalf of the poet. This 'parabasis proper' is in fact almost a satire on the convention of a parabasis proper.\nUnwelcome Visitors: The protagonist's early victory in the agon generally tends to ease dramatic tension early in the play and this is usually offset to some extent by a stream of minor characters or 'unwelcome visitors' that have to be chased off by the triumphant hero. This play is exceptional in that there are three waves of unwelcome visitors \u2013 the first wave comes before the walls of Cloudcuckooland have been completed, the second wave comes immediately after and the third wave comes as a delegation from Zeus. This repetition is the reason why The Birds is much longer than the other surviving plays.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In his review, Ebert said the film \"is based on experience, situation and exploration\u2014not on conflict and threat\", and added:\nit would never have won its worldwide audience just because of its warm heart. It is also rich with human comedy in the way it observes the two remarkably convincing, lifelike little girls ... It is a little sad, a little scary, a little surprising and a little informative, just like life itself. It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.\nSteve Rose from The Guardian gave the film five stars, praising Miyazaki's \"rich, bright, hand-drawn\" animation and describing it as \"full of benign spirituality, prelapsarian innocence and joyous discovery, all rooted in a carefully detailed reality\".

An art dealer recognized his talent and saw to it that Jacob was able to work in the studio of Hubertus van Hove.  There he painted interiors as well as figurative and genre works. Van Hove took Maris under his wings and was not only his boss but also his new teacher.\nVan Hove moved to Antwerp and the nineteen-year-old Maris went with him. This relationship continued until his brother Matthijs received a royal subsidy and joined Jacob.  Together they rented space which also had room for their friend Lawrence Alma-Tadema. They took lessons at the Antwerp Academy and were able to sell some of their works. After this he traveled through Germany, Switzerland and France in 1861.\nLike many of the Hague School alumni, Jacob Maris had enormous success in the Netherlands and abroad. He sold the biggest part of his paintings to private collectors in the United States and in Scotland.\nIn 1857, Jacob Maris returned to the Hague, but Matthijs stayed another year in Antwerp before he again shared a studio with Jacob in The Hague. After they had earned enough money by copying eight royal portraits, they were able to go to Oosterbeek where they met Johannes Warnardus Bilders, his son Gerard, and others who later play important parts in the Hague School. \nThe brothers also went on a study trip together  to Germany, Switzerland and France.  \nWhen their money was spent, they again moved in with their parents and Jacob took more lessons at the Hague Academy of Art. \nIn the summer of 1864, Jacob again went to Oosterbeek and possibly to Fontainebleau and Barbizon.  \nFollowing this trip he lived in  Paris from 1865 until 1871, and then returned to the Netherlands when the Franco-Prussian War broke out.\n\nIn The Hague, he became a strong landscape painter painting rivers and landscapes with mills and towpaths, and beach views with fishing boats.   His stroke became broader and larger and his use of color became more subdued and directed towards portraying the atmospheric depiction of clouds. This part of has been compared to the seventeenth-century painters Jan van Goyen, Jacob Van Ruisdael and Johannes Vermeer. His way of working has been described in the following way: They say that he paints first and draws only afterwards. He applies the paint thickly, builds it up, fiddles around and messes with it-all gradually developing a harmony of colors that establishes the major directions. Only then does he complete his figures with lively, thin brush strokes. But the final touch is done with a master stroke, and in the end the entire work is as solid as the tightest drawing. Also, M. Philippe Zilcken said,  No painter has so well expressed the ethereal effects, bathed in air and light through floating silvery mist, in which painters delight, and the characteristic remote horizons blurred by haze; or again, the grey yet luminous weather of Holland, unlike the dead grey rain of England or the heavy sky of Paris. \nIn 1871, Maris became a member of the Pulchri Studio and would fill various administrative positions there. It was only after 1876 that he experienced any renown  in the Netherlands and from 1885 on he was a celebrated painter. As a leader of the Hague School his influence was enormous. Nevertheless, Willem de Zwart and possibly Bernard Blommers had been his only students.\nWhen he was in his sixties, Maris began to suffer from asthma and corpulence.  \nAt the advice of his doctors he went to take the waters at Karlsbad, where he suddenly died on 7 August 1899.

His second album Internal Exile released in October 1991, was flirting with styles but never got into a particular groove and locking into a direction. The album's music reflected Fish's indulgence in the vast regions of music that he wanted to explore as a solo artist; most notably Celtic music and folk styles. The acquisition of Chris Kimsey as producer could not save the project as he attempted to come to terms with a newly built studio and Fish plagued by bitterness and cynicism toward the industry. Polydor had rushed the album out with his acquiesence resulted in a fractured promotion campaign and low sales, and the UK promoter went bankrupt just as the tour was about to kick off. \nPolydor wanted a new studio album but Fish persisted and he decided to release an album of cover versions called Songs from the Mirror. Produced by James Cassidy, whom Fish met while both were working on Jeff Waynes Spartacus album. They started recording in summer 1992 while simultaneously writing material for the next studio album Suits, a cynical examination lyrically of the music business and executives who still fed Fish's cynical outlook on life. Songs from the Mirror, released in January 1993, became the last album on Polydor. But the album was a turning point for Fish, and fully prepared him for the Suits sessions, material which he had been rehearsing constantly on tour as he struggled to pay bills and musicians. Fish formed his own record company, Dick Bros. after advice from a medium who passed on messages from his grandfather. The Co. was named after the garage business he had started and Fish's father had run throughout his childhood. The first release was Sushi, a live album to follow the five official bootleg releases, on Battleside, a company that temporarily filled the gap between Polydor and Dick Bros., and provided Fish with a lifeline and a quality alternative to the illegal live bootlegs that had followed his career. \nHis confidence had grown and was excited about the new songs on Suits released in 1994, some of which were co-written by James Cassidy who had stayed on since producing the Songs from the Mirror album to assist employing his classical training and expertise with arrangements. It proved invaluable and together with his awareness and experience with modern production techniques the material was guaranteed to enter a new direction and to gain a momentum that would usher the solo career into a new era. Touring took precedent and Fish was well aware that road work was at the expense of writing a new studio album. He went for the break and opted for the two \"Best of's\", Yin and Yang, containing re-recorded material from the Marillion era and solo albums, to give Fish the fuel and introduction to countries he had never managed to reach so far with his career. Released in 1995 these albums allowed him to stay on the road for nearly two years plugging away and hoping for the breakthrough that would give him the space to take a breath and write new material. \nIt never happened until 1997 when, after a tour in Bosnia, playing to the UN troops he reached the stage where he had to get experiences out and onto paper. Fish was introduced to Steven Wilson, who although sympathetic to the progressive rock genre, had no intention of getting involved in a regressive album, which suited Fish fine and welcomed Wilson's influence with open ears. The writing sessions were open and new songs and approaches were generated from a healthy friction between Wilson and Fish as they fought for their identities in the material. Grooves and loops led the rhythmic foundations into what they described as \"Progressive Nouveaux\", still retaining the drama and tension associated with Fish's previous work, but taking it into a more modern setting with a new edge and aggression. With Calum Malcolm's mix and Elliot Ness engineering skills provided a technical quality to match the standard of the writing on Sunsets on Empire. But once again the problem of underfunded promotion and advertising was to foil Fish's plans and a 115 date tour in 22 different countries was set up to attempt to give the album the attention it deserved. Seven months after its release the tour ground to an exhausted conclusion in December 1997. With a combination of tour losses and bad debts from third parties, Fish could no longer survive as an independent artist releasing his albums through Dick Bros. He was effectively broke and financing the recording of the album Raingods with Zippos were beyond his means. \nFish was asked to take part in a writing retreat in France by Miles Copeland. Together with 23 songwriters from all over the world, Fish rediscovered himself and when he returned with new songs he was excited and eager to get on with the job of redefining his career, and writing the rest of the new album. Three songs were taken from the sessions in France for the set up for Raingods with Zippos, together with a 25-minute epic called \"Plague of Ghosts\" written together with Tony Turrell and Mark Daghorn featuring Steven Wilson on guitar, and two tracks written with his old friend Mickey Simmonds. Raingods with Zippos was released by Roadrunner Records in April 1999. The Raingods album is often hailed as one of Fish's greatest solo achievements along with his 1990 debut.In May 2001, Fish released his first studio album on his new independent label the Chocolate Frog Record Company, Fellini Days, which Fish co-wrote with John Wesley and John Young. Field of Crows was Fish's eighth solo studio album originally released in December 2003 and then to retail in May 2004. The album was mainly co-written with Bruce Watson and Irvin Duguid.Fish appeared at World Bowl XI, 14 June 2003, Hampden Park, Glasgow. His performance included a rousing rendition of \"Caledonia\" before kick-off. In 2005, he won a Celebrity Music edition of The Weakest Link, beating Eggsy of Goldie Lookin Chain in the final round, sharing \u00a318,750 with Eggsy's charity and his own.\nOn 26 August 2007, Fish performed at the 'Hobble on The Cobbles' show at the Market Square in Aylesbury. He was accompanied on stage by his four former Marillion bandmates from the classic line-up (Mark Kelly, Steve Rothery, Ian Mosley and Pete Trewavas) for one song: \"Market Square Heroes\". This was the first time they had performed together in nearly two decades. In a press interview following the event, Fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, claiming that \"Hogarth does a great job with the band ... We forged different paths over the 19 years.\"His album 13th Star was released on 12 September 2007 as a specially packaged pre-release version available to order from his website. A UK tour for this album commenced in March 2008, supported by Glyder. In February 2008, Fish was confirmed to be the Friday-night headline act at NEARFest X. He also appeared with BBC Radio 2's Bob Harris on GMTV to promote Childline Rocks, a charity concert.\nIn 2008, Fish presented a Friday evening radio show, Fish on Friday, for digital radio station Planet Rock. When the station was faced with closure, Malcolm Bluemel (with the help of Fish, Tony Iommi, Ian Anderson and Gary Moore) helped save Planet Rock by buying the station.On 9 June 2008, Fish embarked on his first full North American tour in eleven years. At each stop, he hosted a pre-show meet-and-greet with his fans.On 20 and 21 October 2012, Fish hosted Fish Convention 2012 in Leamington Spa. He performed two acoustic sets and two electric sets, including material from his then upcoming studio album, A Feast of Consequences. He also performed \"Grendel\", a fan-favourite Marillion B-side, twice. A Feast of Consequences was released in September 2013 to positive reviews, supported by the single \"Blind to the Beautiful\".\nFish celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Marillion album Clutching at Straws on tour in 2018, alongside debuting material from his then upcoming studio album Weltschmerz. A three track EP, A Parley With Angels, was released in September 2018.In April 2020, Fish revived his Fish on Friday show in the form of a weekly live video podcast, initially broadcast on Facebook (later simulcast on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter). Created during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep in touch with his fans and share stories from his career, the show was voted as the Event of the Year by Prog magazine readers in 2021. Fish on Friday remains active as of 2023, with new episodes of the show broadcast weekly.\nIn September 2020, Fish released Weltschmerz, his final studio album. The album was supported by the singles \"Weltschmerz\", \"Garden of Remembrance\" and \"This Party's Over\". The album received positive reviews and was commercially successful, having sold over 60,000 copies to date. Fish toured Weltschmerz and celebrated the 30th anniversary of A Vigil In A Wilderness of Mirrors as part of the Vigil's End tour in 2021. The tour was documented on the live album Vigil's End Tour 2021, released on physical formats in December 2022 and digitally in March 2023.In November 2023 Primary Wave Music struck a deal with Fish, to acquire the singer and lyricist\u2019s master royalties and writer\u2019s share for songs he wrote and performed with Marillion.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was praised for its unique gameplay and dark, deadpan humor. Eurogamer cited that \"the way the game progresses from being a simple set of perfunctory tasks to a full-on part of the Half-Life story is absolute genius\", while GameSpy noted, \"What Portal lacks in length, it more than makes up for in exhilaration.\" The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length. Aggregate reviews for the standalone PC version of Portal gave the game a 90/100 through 28 reviews on Metacritic. In 2011, Valve stated that Portal had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and The Orange Box, and from the Xbox Live Arcade version.The game generated a fan following for the Weighted Companion Cube\u2014even though the cube itself does not talk or act in the game. Fans have created plush and papercraft versions of the cube and the various turrets, as well as PC case mods and models of the Portal cake and portal gun. Jeep Barnett, a programmer for Portal, noted that players have told Valve that they had found it more emotional to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube than to harm one of the \"Little Sisters\" from BioShock. Both GLaDOS and the Weighted Companion Cube were nominated for the Best New Character Award on G4, with GLaDOS winning the award for \"having lines that will be quoted by gamers for years to come.\" Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation praised the game as \"absolutely sublime from start to finish ... I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly what I got, but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game\". He felt the short length was ideal as it did not outstay its welcome.Writing for GameSetWatch in 2009, columnist Daniel Johnson pointed out similarities between Portal and Erving Goffman's essay on dramaturgy, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, which equates one's persona to the front and backstage areas of a theater. The game was also made part of the required course material among other classical and contemporary works, including Goffman's work, for a freshman course \"devoted to engaging students with fundamental questions of humanity from multiple perspectives and fostering a sense of community\" for Wabash College in 2010. Portal has also been cited as a strong example of instructional scaffolding that can be adapted for more academic learning situations, as the player, through careful design of levels by Valve, is first hand-held in solving simple puzzles with many hints at the correct solution, but this support is slowly removed as the player progresses in the game, and completely removed when the player reaches the second half of the game. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Hamish Todd considered Portal as an exemplary means of game design by demonstrating a series of chambers after the player has obtained the portal gun that gently introduce the concept of flinging without any explicit instructions. Portal was exhibited at the Smithsonian Art Exhibition in America from February 14 through September 30, 2012. Portal won the \"Action\" section for the platform \"Modern Windows\".Since its release Portal is still considered one of the best video games of all time, having been included on several cumulative \"Top Games of All Time\" lists through 2018.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

The panel, for what was considered by 64 to be Nintendo's flagship game at the event, featured several big machines and sculptures, such as those for Banjo and Mumbo Jumbo. The Nintendo 64 games presented at E3 were lauded by Nintendo Power as \"pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment, innovation, and intensity\". Banjo-Kazooie was a major example, highlighting how its advanced technology created a Disney-esque \"rich, animated world full of fun animals and great music\", visuals containing \"rich textures, creative lighting,\" and dynamic music. The reaction from gamers and critics towards the game was generally positive, 64 magazine predicting it to be \"the biggest hit of the year.\" However, it was also met with skepticism as a rip-off of Super Mario 64 and overly cute, and despised its new name. The gaming community was also mystified by some of its concepts, such as the usage of a bird-bear duo for a Super Mario 64-esque genre, fart sound effects for speech, and Kazooie pooping out eggs as an attack.The game was then presented at the 1997 annual Nintendo Space World event, where the first five worlds were playable. Its panel had women that were dressed up as Banjo with shirts on. N64 Magazine gave a glowing review of the panel, admitting it to be the event's most absorbing experience, even moreso than the Zelda game that got the most attention from other gamers and journalists. They considered the worlds immersive due to its \"graphical opulence,\" such as the \"incredibly realistic ripples\" on the water, and choice of environments \"realistic\" even considering the cartoony characters. They also positively commented on its implementation of the dual-character mechanic (particularly how certain sections require a specific character unlike other games).Banjo-Kazooie was initially scheduled for a release in November 1997, in the US 24 November, but was delayed to give developers more time for polish. When Rare met Nintendo of America's Howard Lincoln at E3 1997, he was against a delay, complaining: \"We've committed $20 million to this campaign\". To fill that year's Christmas schedule, Lincoln told Rare to include Donkey Kong characters in an R.C. Pro-Am game they were developing at the time, turning it into Diddy Kong Racing (1997). Eurogamer called Diddy Kong Racing \"something of a testing ground for Rare's [Nintendo 64]-era heroes\", as it included Banjo and Conker as playable characters prior to featuring in their own games. In the following months, Rare released screenshots at such a rate that by May 1998, N64 Magazine suspected the game was completed besides testing.Banjo-Kazooie was released on 29 June 1998 in North America, 17 July 1998 in Europe, and 6 December 1998 in Japan as Banjo and Kazooie's Big Adventure (\u30d0\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u3068\u30ab\u30ba\u30fc\u30a4\u306e\u5927\u5192\u967a). The Japan date was shifted multiple times, set to be released before other territories in January 1998 as of November 1997, and moved to April months later. The UK date was also set to 16 March 1998 as of Christmas 1997, before being moved to July two months later. In Europe, the game was released in the summer, an active season for Nintendo 64 releases that followed a scarce period and included games of various genres, such as Quest 64 (1998), Mortal Kombat 4 (1998), Off Road Challenge (1998), Dezaemon 3D (1998) and Virtual Chess 64 (1998). It had a marketing budget of $10 million.Banjo-Kazooie performed well in both the UK and US. Virgin Megastore reported that the game was topping the UK charts as of 21 September 1998. In Japan, Banjo-Kazooie entered Famitsu's Top 10 sales charts for the week ending 13 December 1998, selling 74,000 copies for a total of 117,399. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, the game took home a \"Gold\" prize for revenues above \u20ac26 million in the European Union during 1998. As of March 2003, the game had sold more than 405,000 units in Japan. As of December 2007, it had sold more than 1.8 million copies in the US. As of 2021, Banjo-Kazooie worldwide sales were 3 million, making it the tenth highest-grossing Nintendo 64 game.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Genesis and Yes were directly influenced by the band's usage of the mellotron, and many King Crimson band members were involved in other notable bands: Bruford in Yes; Lake in Emerson, Lake & Palmer; McDonald in Foreigner; Burrell in Bad Company, and Wetton in U.K. and Asia. Canadian rock band Rush's drummer Neil Peart credited the adventurous and innovative style of Michael Giles as an influence on his own approach to percussion.King Crimson's influence extends to many bands from diverse genres, especially of the 1990s and 2000s. Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana, had stated that the album Red had a major influence on the sound of their final studio album In Utero. Tool are known to be heavily influenced by King Crimson, with vocalist Maynard James Keenan joking on a tour with them: \"Now you know who we ripped off. Just don't tell anyone, especially the members of King Crimson.\" Modern progressive, experimental, psychedelic and indie rock bands have cited them as an influence as well, including the Mars Volta, Primus, Mystery Jets, Fanfarlo, Phish, and Anekdoten, who first practiced together playing King Crimson songs. Steven Wilson, the leader of Porcupine Tree, was responsible for remixing King Crimson's back catalogue in surround sound and said that the process had an enormous influence on his solo albums, and his band was influenced by King Crimson. In November 2012 the Flaming Lips in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs released a track-by-track reinterpretation of In the Court of the Crimson King entitled Playing Hide and Seek with the Ghosts of Dawn. Colin Newman, of Wire, said he saw King Crimson perform many times, and that they influenced him deeply. The seminal hardcore punk group Black Flag acknowledge Wetton-era King Crimson as an influence on their experimental period in the mid-1980s. Melvin Gibbs said that the Rollins Band was influenced most by King Crimson, using similar chords. Bad Religion cites the lyrics of \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" on their single \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\" and the name of their record label, Epitaph (founded by their guitarist Brett Gurewitz), comes from the song of the same name on Crimson's debut album. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid considered Robert Fripp as one of his guitar influences.King Crimson have frequently been cited as pioneers of progressive metal and as an influence on bands of this genre, including Opeth, Mastodon, Between the Buried and Me, Leprous, Haken, the Ocean, Caligula's Horse, Last Chance to Reason, and Indukti. Members of metal bands Mudvayne, Voivod, Enslaved, Yob, Pyrrhon, and Pallbearer have cited King Crimson as an influence. Heavy experimental and avant-garde acts like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Neurosis, Zeni Geva, Ancestors, and Oranssi Pazuzu all cite King Crimson's influence.\nOther artists affected by King Crimson include video game composer Nobuo Uematsu, noise music artist Masami Akita of Merzbow, jazz guitarist Dennis Rea of Land, folktronica exponent Juana Molina, hip hop producer RJD2, hip hop and soul composer Adrian Younge, film director Hal Hartley, and folk-pop singer Ian Kelly.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He studied art at the studio of Albert Joseph Moore in Kensington but, unhappy with the teaching methods Aldin left after a month to study animal anatomy at the National Art Training School in South Kensington. After this he attended a summer school run by the animal painter and teacher, William Frank Calderon at Midhurst, Sussex. Aldin left when he developed rheumatic fever but shortly afterwards he sold his first drawing, which appeared in The Building News of 12 September 1890. This was followed by a dog show picture purchased by The Graphic in 1891. He rented a studio in Chelsea and in 1892 he began a long association with The Illustrated London News. Whilst at Chelsea he would often draw in the London Zoological Gardens and an early work on a tiger in the zoo which was drawn from life was found to be a copyright of a photograph by Gambier Bolton. He also did some work for Cadbury's advertising. Aldin was commissioned by The Pall Mall Budget in 1894 to illustrate the serialisation of stories from Rudyard Kipling's The Second Jungle Book.\nAt the invitation of the fine genre painter, Walter Dendy Sadler Aldin stayed at Chiddingstone where he made close friends with Phil May, John Hassall and Lance Thackeray and along with them, Dudley Hardy and Tom Browne, founded the London Sketch Club.\nThe birth of his son and daughter inspired a series of nursery pictures which together with his large sets of the Fallowfield Hunt, Bluemarket Races, Harefield Harriers and Cottesbrook Hunt prints brought him much popularity. This was enhanced by his ever expanding book and magazine illustrative work. He joined the Chelsea Arts Club and held his first exhibition in Paris in 1908. An exhibition in Paris in 1909 was received with much acclaim and extended his fame to a wider audience. He illustrated the 1910 edition of Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers. A popular book by Aldin was Sleeping Partners, a sequence of pastel drawings of his dogs on a couch. It included his Irish Wolfhound Micky, a puppy he purchased from Florence Nagle as a gift for his wife, and his favourite model, Cracker, a Bull Terrier with a dark patch over one eye. Aldin moved to the Henley area as his interest in hunting, horses and dogs increased and in 1910 he became Master of the South Berkshire Hunt as well as being associated with other local packs.

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds (Museum Bredius, The Hague).  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format.\n\nThe influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time.\nThe traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings.\nWhile his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer.Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples. This series of engravings had an important influence on the Dutch animal painter Paulus Potter, in particular the way in which van Laer was able to place figures, animals, buildings and trees in a coherent pictorial space.  A second set of 6 plates was entitled Horses and depicts the bleak lot of horses belonging to poor peasants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Not much is known about his roots, other than he grew up in a dojo with a boy called Yukinosuke, training in the ways of Japanese swordsmanship. Both were apparently raised by their 'master', and Kotaro reveals his parents have already died. Yukinosuke reveals, that when growing up, they were both of equal skill, with neither ever able to clearly defeat the other in sparring contests. Kotaro left suddenly one day, after his parents died. He has a laid back attitude to life and does not sit in the traditional seiza sitting position in the dojo.\nLin (Rin): Lin is a ninja who was orphaned as a child. Both she and her brother, Shin were taken in by a ninja clan and trained in the art of ninjutsu until they were strong enough and skilled enough to carry out missions as a spy for the Tokugawa shogunate government. She resents the 'kid' image Kotaro uses on her, despite her youth. She has feelings for Kotaro, which is revealed at the game's end.Kotaro's Path bosses:\n\nUnknown Ronin: The first boss in Kotaro's story, Kotaro finds the ronin killing a shogunate ninja (Genzo). This ronin has no other description besides the scars on his face and completely white eyes.It is possible he is Sasaki Kojiro due to the fact that a long sword named Monohoshizao is obtained after defeating him, which was the name of the nodachi that Kojiro used in real life.\n\nMuga: Muga is the high priest of the Temple. Due to his body being host to the horrific 'soul bugs', he has been transformed into a giant and bizarre monster. Muga surprises Kotaro in the Temple, having knocked Kurenai unconscious, saying she will make a fine gift to Lord Tohjo. When asked what Lord Tohjo has to do with anything, Muga tells Kotaro that it does not matter because he will die soon anyway. Before their battle begins, Muga cracks his knuckles, saying that he has been praying to test his new powers. He is the second boss in Kotaro's path.\nYukinosuke: Yukinosuke is Kotaro's childhood friend. Along with Kotaro he trained under his 'master' in kenjutsu, and could not best Kotaro, although Kotaro could not beat him either. He secretly harbours a deep feeling of resentment towards this fact, and strives for a way to defeat Kotaro (though not to kill him). Some time after Kotaro left, he turned to Lord Tohjo and he gave him a soul bug, giving him more power. Despite this, the soul bug has not deformed him like other hosts, and he despises the soul bug.\nUrabe: A sorcerer who is enlisted to help in the creation and spread of the soul bugs. He has is a distinct boss due to the fact he does not wield a weapon or fight with his hands rather he attacks with a variety of magical spells. But after defeating him he transforms via the power of the soul bugs into a naked hunchback with an open spine that ends with a scorpion stinger and also gains the ability to breathe fire. He also has an electric left eye which may be the source of his power.\nMiyamoto Musashi (optional boss): The only samurai (later revealed to be a ronin) who can wield two swords at once. He challenges Kotaro Hiba to a duel of honor at Ganryu Beach. If the player chooses to fight him he reveals he is not like the previous bosses faced, rather he is a ronin who just wants to fight Kotaro and he even goes to say that the events that are happening in the fiefdom \"is of no concern to my swords\". Defeating him earns a thanks before Musashi dies, as well as obtaining his two swords which can be equipped and used. These are the only swords in the game which can be used together in battle. The player must fight Musashi before fighting Yukinosuke, or he will get tired of waiting and leave.\nLord Tohjo: Lord Tohjo is the ruler of the village's fiefdom. He has contacted Urabe and enlisted his help to create the soul bugs for him. He is a master is s\u014djutsu (Japanese spear art) and possibly j\u016bkend\u014d. Tohjo has unnatural power, and can heal himself using magic. After defeating him he too is revealed to have a soul bug which causes him to sprout arms which are electric in nature as well as deform himself in a way. This is where the game ends whether the player chooses Kotaro or Lin's path for the first time: the latter infected form can only be fought by playing through the second character's path via loading up the finished saved game.Lin's Path bosses:\n\nCastle Head Guard: Lin finds Hanzo, a fellow shogunate ninja, dying from a wound inflicted by the Head Guard. The Guard then finds the two, and begins the battle with Lin. He is not alone in this boss battle as he calls upon his subordinates to come from every direction; however, he can be easily separated out among the other swordsmen as he is the only one wearing a blue outfit. He does not have any unblockable attacks.\nUndead Genzo: In Kotaro's path, he is revealed to be killed by the Unknown Ronin. This fact is unknown to Lin who is happy to see her friend alive, but after he pulls his basket hat he is shown to be an undead who is bent on destroying Lin.\nKarasu: A beautiful female ninja who is the head of a group of ninjas called Ravens. She is known for her skill in the art of ninjitsu as well as for her trademark battle dance. Defeating her engages the player in another boss battle where she is shown to be a soul bug's host, which of course allows her access to more powers. After her final defeat she reveals Lin's brother Shin is with Lord Tohjo; according to her \"it will be a tearful reunion\". Her name means \"Crow\" in Japanese.\nThe Three Wolverines: These are three Wolverine Ninja (named so because of their claw-like weapons) who are much more powerful than their normal counterparts. They are summoned to attack Lin by Oda, after her attempt to kill Lord Tohjo fails. Both Oda and Lord Tohjo then escape, leaving the three Wolverines to finish Lin. They attack very effectively as a team and even have teleport abilities. However, unlike many bosses, the Three Wolverines do not possess an unblockable attack.\nShin: Lin's elder brother appears also as a boss. True to Karasu's words it is a \"tearful reunion\" as Lin finds herself one on one with her brother, as he is infected with the soul bug which causes him to fight against his little sister. Very skilled fellow who has a good arsenal of fancy moves, he has an ability which allows him to send the shuriken acting like a boomerang.\nTwo Soul Worms: After killing the infected villagers Lin fights two huge worms who look like some amalgamation of the dead bodies. Although they burrow into the ground, these Soul Worms are very easy to defeat compared to many of the game's other bosses.\nInfected Lord Tohjo: After meeting his apparent death by the hands of Kotaro Hiba. Tohjo reveals he too is infected with the soul bug and sprouts six arms while he exudes an unholy aura, He also has in each of his arms a weapon that corresponds to an earlier boss that Lin have faced. Note: he can only be fought by playing through a finished savegame with one character's path already finished. By loading the savegame and picking the second character's path, they will encounter the final bosses. It is up to the second character to send him back to Hell.\nRyu Oda: Ryu Oda is a \"military scholar\" according to Kotaro Hiba and is also the main villain behind the soul bugs and the plan of conquering feudal Japan. He remains behind the scenes only appearing every now and then to some of the soul bug hosts as in the case of Yukinosuke and Urabe. He can be fought by either Kotaro or Lin, depending on which character was picked as the second path in a savegame where one character's path is already finished.\nInfected Ryu Oda: Ryu Oda shows to the reunited Lin and Kotaro that he is not only infected with the soul bugs but has also become the nest for them. After revealing his plans he mutates into a hideous multi-faced monster. Once Infected Lord Tohjo is defeated with the second character, the player will be given the option to fight this final boss with either Lin and Kotaro.After defeating Ryu Oda and saving feudal Japan from the soul bugs, both Kotaro and Lin perform their final duties to their fallen friend and brother, respectively, and in the end decide to stay with each other.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1063", "question": "What genre is John Jackson?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_40489", "text": "Dangerous is a new jack swing, R&B and pop album, which incorporates elements of several other genres, including industrial, funk, hip hop, electronic, gospel, classical, and rock. In a 1992 interview with Ebony magazine, Jackson said, \"I wanted to do an album like Tchaikovsky\u2019s Nutcracker Suite. So that in a thousand years from now, people would still be listening to it.\" Much of the album contains samples from CDs that Riley had created himself using a variety of instruments.The album features catchy pop hooks and choruses while also introducing underground sounds to a mainstream audience. The album's tone is noted by critics as gritty and urban,  with sounds including synthetic basslines, scratching, and drum machine percussion, as well as unconventional sounds like honking vehicle horns, sliding chains, swinging gates, breaking glass, and clanking metal. Throughout the album Jackson also implements beatboxing, scat singing, and finger snapping. The album is considered by Joe Vogel in PopMatters to be an artistic change for Jackson, because of its focus on socially conscious material, and a broader range of sounds and styles. The car sound effects on \"She Drives Me Wild\" were taken from a sample CD, and was the first time Riley used unusual sounds in place of the drums on a song.The album featured Jackson rapping for the first time. The inclusion of Wreckx-n-Effect and hip-hop rhythms were attempts to introduce Jackson to a younger generation of urban listeners. Riley was a pioneer of new jack swing, and he was hired by Jackson specifically for his work in the genre. Riley co-produced half the songs on the album. Swedien said of Riley, \"He'd come in with a groove, we'd say it wasn't exactly right, and there would be no complaining. He'd just go back and then come back in and blow us away with something like 'Dangerous'.\" In recordings with Bottrell, the sounds were more diverse (e.g. \"Black or White\" and \"Give In to Me\"). The rap in \"Black or White\" was written and performed by Bottrell, credited under the pseudonym \"L.T.B.\" Jackson hummed melodies and grooves before leaving the studio, while Bottrell developed on these ideas with drum machines and samplers, including an Akai S1000. Bottrell operated a Neve console and two 24-track Studer analog tape machines to draft ideas and demos. He then used a 32-track Mitsubishi machine to assemble the album.\n\nThe lyrics for Dangerous were more varied than those of Jackson's previous records. Opening track \"Jam\" features a dense, swirling Riley track, propelled by horn samples and a subtle scratch effect. Jackson had recorded a basic idea for the song on a DAT, to which he asked Riley to develop. Riley learned that Heavy D was Jackson's favourite rapper at the time, and suggested that he was brought in to contribute a rap. The ballads, \"Keep the Faith\" (composed by Jackson, Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard) and the self-composed \"Will You Be There\" had sounds of gospel, while \"Heal the World\" and \"Gone Too Soon\" were softer pop ballads. \"Gone Too Soon\", written by Larry Grossman and Buz Kohan, is a tribute to Ryan White following his death due to AIDS in 1990. The album also includes songs of other personal nature, especially in songs such as \"She Drives Me Wild\", \"Remember the Time\", \"Can't Let Her Get Away\", \"Who Is It\" and \"Give In to Me\". The title track's subject is similar to that of \"Dirty Diana\" with the song focusing on a seductress. Though Jackson sang about racial harmony in some of his songs with the Jacksons, \"Black or White\" was the first song where the lyrics were interpreted with the context of his own changing skin color. In \"Why You Wanna Trip on Me\", Jackson juxtaposed social ills to his own alleged eccentricities that were covered in the press at the time, asking critics and the tabloid media why they were focusing on the cult of celebrity rather than the multitude of serious problems in the world. Riley performed the guitar parts on an Ovation acoustic, and expected Jackson to have someone brought in to re-record them, but was surprised that Jackson liked what he had put down.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds (Museum Bredius, The Hague).  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format.\n\nThe influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time.\nThe traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings.\nWhile his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer.Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples. This series of engravings had an important influence on the Dutch animal painter Paulus Potter, in particular the way in which van Laer was able to place figures, animals, buildings and trees in a coherent pictorial space.  A second set of 6 plates was entitled Horses and depicts the bleak lot of horses belonging to poor peasants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Wolfe, the first of many Locus reviewers to discuss the book at time of publication, compares the novel at many points with Willis's Lincoln's Dreams and writes:\n\nApart from its simple virtues as a compelling story on an irresistible theme, Connie Willis's big, ambitious new novel Passage should be of particular interest to her readers because of the ways in which it recapitulates major preoccupations and techniques of her career to date, and because in it she seems fiercely determined to show us everything she's got... Each makes historical research a major vector of narrative suspense, with specific historical details\u2014the Civil War in Lincoln's Dreams, the sinking of the Titanic here\u2014treated as though they were clues in a murder mystery.\nWolfe continues: Like Doomsday Book (1992), it grapples with one of the grandest of all themes, death, and uses the inability of major characters to communicate key bits of information to each other as another suspense device. Like Willis's comic short fiction, it pokes fun at institutional culture\u2014in this case hospitals, with their mazelike architecture and ego-driven politics\u2014and at such ghoulish aspects of pop culture as afterlife gurus like John Edwards\" (i.e., John Edward) \"and self-help manuals for the recently bereaved.\"\nFaren Miller wrote in Locus: \n\nWhile the subject matter and setting of Passage allow Willis to display her characteristically unsentimental poignancy ... she can also poke fun at matters of life and death... The book's multiplying internal and external mazes provide an emblem of human complexity, foolishness, and deeper terrors, some reaching from beyond death. Jonathan Strahan of Locus praises the novel's \"seriousness\", \"clear-eyed humor\" and its \"amusing portrayal of what it's like to be in a big hospital\", which is itself a \"confusing, overwhelming portrait,\" as parts of what it makes \"her most ambitious novel\". He adds, \"At the three-quarter point of Passage, Willis does something that no reviewer should leak but it is much of what makes the book worth reading. What she attempts is to find a way to look at death and life after death in a way that doesn't conflict with matters of faith, but which also is consistent with the fundamentally rational underpinnings of science fiction.\"SciFi.com describes Passage as \"an emotionally exhausting trip\" that is ultimately \"a rewarding experience.\" Laura Miller, writing for Salon, says that \"its construction is a marvel of ingenuity and \u2014 what's even more remarkable, given the wizardry of Willis' storytelling \u2014 its intellectual honesty is impeccable... You won't find the beautiful sentences of more-celebrated 'novelists of ideas' here, though the ideas themselves are far better, more daring and more original, than those chewed over by most literary heavyweights. The dialogue can sound a trifle canned, the minor characters feel a mite thin (not that many novels of ideas don't share these flaws, too), which explains in part why Passage seems to hover between genre and genius. Given how rare a searching intelligence like Willis' is among today's novelists, does it really matter?\"The SF Site review judges that the novel \"starts slowly, and it's too long. Willis' trademark habit of making some set of frustrating everyday-life details a recurring motif or running joke (in this case, the difficulty of navigating the hospital corridors, plus the never-open cafeteria) is over-extended here...\"; conversely, reviewer Steven Wu felt that \"Part One of the book is masterful, with several chilling scenes, a compelling mystery, and a doozy of a cliffhanger ending. But then, only a third of the way through the book, things begin slowing down.\"\nThe A.V. Club's reviewer writes: There's certainly nothing comforting about Passage, which steeps its characters in death of all kinds \u2014 swift and sudden, prolonged and painful. Willis' satirical flair originally has Landry [sic] and Wright running around like The Three Stooges, juggling impossible schedules in an impossible environment and careening amidst exaggeratedly colorful characters in every chapter. A mid-book twist, however, takes the story into darker and more memorable territory, helping turn Passage into a complex, finely crafted, haunting story that makes the light at the end of the tunnel impossible to take lightly.\nA reviewer from Scientific Gems wrote of the novel, \"it is well-written, it has an interesting plot, and it has useful things to say about the nature of science and the nature of medicine. One piece of good advice, for example: 'Joanna says you should only say what you saw, not what anybody else says you should see.'\" [Spoken by Maisie Nellis] \"Indeed, the importance of truth is underscored repeatedly in the book.

They are often considered to be one of the definitive alternative hip hop acts, being one of the first alternative hip hop acts to break into the mainstream. According to Forbes, their success helped establish Ruffhouse Records as a major record label. Consequence noted Fugees for putting Haiti on the hip hop map. Alternative Press argued that the group paved the way for modern alternative music and stated \"If you listen to modern hip-hop today, so many of the new faces went to the Fugees' School of Songwriting.\"While Matthew Ismael Ruiz of Pitchfork, noted the group for removing negative connotations of Haitian immigration and the word 'Refugee', stating that \"The Fugees managed to diversify the voice of the ghetto, one often depicted in a single dimension. They reclaimed pride for Haitians worldwide, a heritage maligned for its postcolonial poverty and strife but still remembered as the setting for the new world\u2019s first successful revolt of enslaved people against their oppressors. Their sound was multifaceted because they were, too, their music diverse, just like the Black experience.\" The Ringer noted that Fugees delivered political messages and brought hip hop to the mainstream in their music by blending elements of pop, soul, dancehall and Caribbean music, making it more palpable for a wider audience without making the message dense, stating \"Fugees disguised resistance as art, the same way that enslaved Africans once hid martial arts from their colonial masters by pretending that they were a dance.\"\nWriting for The Recording Academy, music journalist Kathy Iandoli wrote about the impact of the group on the hip hop genre stating: \"As hip-hop's East and West Coasts continued their tussle, their lighter-hearted approach to socially conscious rap curtailed any overarching assumptions that hip-hop was going down a \"bad road\".

Together, by juxtaposing live instrumentation, soulful melodies and abstract bars, The Fugees gave hip-hop a renewed spirit and propelled it to a different kind of mainstream\".The group has sold over twenty-two million records worldwide, and are one of the biggest-selling hip hop groups of all time.

Former United States President Barack Obama, named the Fugees single \"Ready or Not\" his favorite song ever. Their album The Score was placed on the list of 200 Definitive Albums in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (2007) by National association of recording merchandisers (NARM). \"Ready or Not\" was named among the Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll (2018) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Ament said that the cover came from the idea on \"how cool to have a yield sign where there's nothing to yield to\", and the place was a road on the way to his Montana home which he considered perfect for the photo.The album title is rooted in the idea of \"yielding to nature\", a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, \"I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more comfortable within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me \u2013 yielding, letting something else happen and going with it.\" Vedder said, \"Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, and then you have to think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you.\"The indie rock band BOAT parodied the album's cover art, among several others, on its 2011 release Dress Like Your Idols.\nPearl Jam themselves also parodied the album\u2019s cover art on their 2023 Record Store Day release, Give Way, a live album recorded during their March 5, 1998, Melbourne, Australia concert, which features an Australian Give Way sign on its cover instead of a Yield one.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Harper's niece (Young Joan) enters and claims that she can't sleep. After a few attempts by her aunt to get her back in bed, she tells Harper that she just came back into the house after climbing out of her window to investigate a sound that she heard. Joan says that she just witnessed her uncle, Harper's husband, loading bloody children and other people into the back of a lorry. After repeated attempts to censor what Joan saw, Harper tells her that the uncle is saving the children and taking them to a safer place. She tells Joan that she can never tell anyone about what she saw because it would put all of their lives in danger. Harper claims they are on the good side and are making the world a better place.\nAct 2, Scene 1 is roughly 15 years later in a factory where an adult Joan has just begun her professional career as a milliner. Her co-worker Todd is an established hatter and is experienced in the field. Various days at the factory are seen, with the hats that Joan and Todd are making in various stages of completion over time. Todd and Joan exchange basic conversation about this body of work and about their previous works. Todd says that the company has been pushing for hats to be created quicker for the parades; they used to have two weeks to finish a hat but now they only have one.\nScene 2: Joan and Todd learn more about each other through a discussion about their current hat designs. Todd brings up a hypothesis that the way the company gets contracts is corrupt, claiming there is a certain person's brother-in-law that is involved. Joan wants to know more, but Todd doesn't want to talk about it at work. Joan changes the topic, saying she does not like to watch the trials at night. Todd says he watches them every night while drinking Pernod, or absinthe.\nScene 3: Todd and Joan speak about different hat genres: Animal and Abstract. Joan changes the subject and asks why Todd doesn't do something (regarding the corruption). He says he spends days wondering what he should do.\nScene 4: Joan and Todd compliment each other on their almost completed hats. Todd announces he is going to talk to \"him\" (someone working above Todd). He says he is going to talk about the brother-in-law and hint at the possibility of leaking information to a friend of his who is a journalist. He say that if he lost his job, he'd miss Joan.\nScene 5 shows the completed hats of Todd and Joan on the heads of prisoners being marched to have the hats \"judged\" in the trials.\nScene 6 returns to the factory. Joan states that she can't believe that she won. She says she doesn't understand why more aren't kept, because they could be re-used. Todd says that keeping more hats would put them out of work. Joan thinks it is sad that all the hats are burned with the bodies. Todd says that the hats are metaphorical for life. He is not bothered that only three out of nearly 300 hats that he has created made it to the museum. He loves making beauty that disappears. Todd brings up his meeting with \"him\". \"He\" said, \"These things must be thought about\". Todd wonders if \"he\" was talking about the content of their meeting, or if he should fire Todd. Joan reminds Todd about the journalist he knows. Joan hypothesizes that the whole industry is corrupt. She says that if Todd is fired, she will resign. Todd almost tells Joan that he loves her, but quickly changes to saying that he loves beads.\nAct 3, Scene 1 finds Harper and Todd at Harper's house waiting for Joan to return. They discuss the paranoia caused by not knowing what side various aspects of nature is on. They are very worried about Joan who eventually returns in a very frazzled state. She delivers a monologue about her fear of every natural thing on her journey (a stream, horses, light, and dark). She does not know whose side of the war they are on.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The first parody was the 1964 film Carry On Spying, which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind (Charles Hawtry) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor). One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine, was released in 1965. The eponymous hero is a rough-edged, petty crook turned spy, and was what academic Jeremy Packer called an \"anti-Bond\", or what Christoph Lindner calls \"the thinking man's Bond\". The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry. The four \"Matt Helm\" films starring Dean Martin (released between 1966 and 1969), the \"Flint\" series starring James Coburn (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1969), while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the Austin Powers series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the Johnny English trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.\n\nFollowing the release of the film Dr. No in 1962, the line \"Bond ... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\". In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere. In 1965, Time magazine observed \"James Bond has developed into the biggest mass-cult hero of the decade\".\nThe 25 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 27 Bond films have grossed over $7.04 billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\".Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy, and Get Smart.Considered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort. From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond\u2013style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady. Bond has been commemorated numerous times on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their March 2020 series to mark the 25th Bond film release.Throughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. \"Bondmania\", a term deriving from the adjacent \"Beatlemania\" and initiated in 1964 following the enormous success of Goldfinger, described the clamour for Bond films and their related products, from soundtrack LPs to children's toys, board games, alarm clocks playing the Bond theme, and 007-branded shirts. In 2018, a James Bond museum opened atop the Austrian Alps. The futuristic museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in S\u00f6lden at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above sea level.The real MI6 has an ambiguous relationship with Bond. The films may attract job applicants who may be unsuited for espionage, while dissuading more-qualified candidates. While serving as Chief of SIS, Alex Younger said that were Bond to apply for a MI6 job \"he would have to change his ways\". Younger said, however, that the franchise had \"created a powerful brand for MI6 ... Many of our counterparts envy the sheer global recognition of our acronym\", and that being depicted to global audiences as a \"ubiquitous intelligence presence\" was \"quite a force multiplier\". The Russian Federal Security Service so envied Bond that it created an annual award for fictional depictions of Russian spies.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the first entry in the Mother series. It is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but is set in the late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to put an end to the paranormal phenomena that recently spiraled the country into disarray. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.\nWriter and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mother's concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. A North American version of the game was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released globally as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015 and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022.\nMother was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies and received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score from Famitsu magazine. Mother was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, but many considered its sequel Mother 2: G\u012bgu no Gyakush\u016b (known outside as EarthBound) to be similar and a better overall implementation of Mother's gameplay ideas, with the game's high difficulty level polarizing critics, along with balance issues.

During this time, martial artist Bob Wall, a friend and collaborator of Bruce, observed that Lee hit with power and had good footwork. At age eight, after his father's death, Bruce's disciple Dan Inosanto trained Lee. According to Jeff Imada who at the time was helping with children's classes at Inosanto's Kali Institute, the fact that he was the son of one of its founders was kept quiet; Lee had difficulty focusing due to seeing his father's photos taking so much space in his studio. Imada said Lee stopped training in his mid-teens to play soccer. Richard Bustillo also trained Lee during his teens and said that Lee worked hard and was always respectful. Lee said that with his training Arnis with Inosanto he specialized in both Kali and Escrima and lasted three to four years.In 1986, Lee said that he was training in Yee Chuan Tao, a relaxation-based martial art, with a trainer named Mike Vendrell. Lee said that it consisted of exercises such as slow sparring, Chi sao practice; they also worked on a wooden dummy, as well as Vendrell swinging a staff at him while he would duck or jump over. He said later that the exercise helped him be less tense.Also in the 1980s, Lee returned to Dan Inosanto's Academy. Lee said he did a few amateur fights but did not seek to compete in tournaments. He would bring a camera to Inosanto's studio, both would choreograph fights for Lee's films and would allow him to see how various moves played out on screen. During this time, Lee also trained in weapon-based martial arts such as Eskrima and Silat. In 1991, Lee was certified by the Thai Boxing Association. While his main goal was dramatic acting, he credited his skill in martial arts to have helped him to get roles that require it.During the filming of The Crow, Lee said he did cardiovascular exercises to the point of exhaustion using a jump rope, running, riding a LifeCycle, or using a StairMaster, after which he would train at Inosanto's academy where he took Muay Thai classes.According to Lee's mother, years prior to his death Lee became consumed with his father's written philosophy, taking lengthy notes. When asked which martial arts he practiced, he responded:\n\nWhen people ask me that question, I usually say that my father created the art of Jeet Kune Do and I have been trained in that. However, that's a little too simple to say because Jeet Kune Do was my father's very personal expression of the martial arts. So I always feel a little bit silly saying I practice Jeet Kune Do, although I certainly have been trained in it. It would be more accurate to say that I practice my own interpretation of Jeet Kune Do, just as everyone who practices Jeet Kune Do does.\nIn August 1992, Bruce Lee biographer John Little asked Brandon Lee what his philosophy in life was, and he replied, \"Eat\u2014or die!\" Brandon later spoke of the martial arts and self-knowledge:\n\nWell, I would say this: when you move down the road towards mastery of the martial arts\u2014and you know, you are constantly moving down that road\u2014you end up coming up against these barriers inside yourself that will attempt to stop you from continuing to pursue the mastery of the martial arts. And these barriers are such things as when you come up against your own limitations, when you come up against the limitations of your will, your ability, your natural ability, your courage, how you deal with success\u2014and failure as well, for that matter. And as you overcome each one of these barriers, you end up learning something about yourself. And sometimes, the things you learn about yourself can, to the individual, seem to convey a certain spiritual sense along with them.\n...It's funny, every time you come up against a true barrier to your progress, you are a child again. And it's a very interesting experience to be reduced, once again, to the level of knowing nothing about what you're doing. I think there's a lot of room for learning and growth when that happens\u2014if you face it head-on and don't choose to say, \"Ah, screw that! I'm going to do something else!\"\n\nWe reduce ourselves at a certain point in our lives to kind of solely pursuing things that we already know how to do. You know, because you don't want to have that experience of not knowing what you're doing and being an amateur again. And I think that's rather unfortunate. It's so much more interesting and usually illuminating to put yourself in a situation where you don't know what's going to happen, than to do something again that you already know essentially what the outcome will be within three or four points either way.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

It depicts a merry company known as a buitenpartij, i.e. a scene of people from the middle class enjoying an outdoor party rather than the lowly peasant scenes that were often the subject of genre paintings.  Another example is the Merry company (At Lempertz auction of 21 November 2009, lot 1018B). The male and female participants in this composition are wearing clothes in the latest fashion such as high hats, puffed pants and ruff collars. They are enjoying themselves in the outdoors in a garden with plenty of food, drink, music and dance.  The scene also includes a black page and a jester.  The composition includes allusions to the aristocratic pursuit of hunting such as the dog in the foreground and the falcon on the right.  Some couples on the right have separated themselves from the revelers at the table and their amorous intentions are all too clear.\nIn most cases the moralizing message of a 'buitenpartij' is to warn the viewers to distance themselves from the pleasures and excesses depicted, as these should be morally condemned as a frivolous waste of time and as worldly vanity. One of the origins of the type of the \"buitenpartij\" is the pictorial tradition of religious representations of a Biblical subject such as \"The Prodigal Son\", in which a moral story is told through depictions of drunken feasts with erotic overtones.

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain.

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain.

Such resemblances are evidence of a genre of ancient drama known as Old Comedy. Variations from these 'conventions' are significant since they demonstrate either a trend away from Old Comedy, a corruption in the text or a unique dramatic effect that the author intended. Variations in this play are found in the following conventions:\n\nAgon: The agon is a debate or formal argument constructed as a 'symmetrical scene', with two declaimed sections and two songs. The protagonist generally defeats the antagonist in the debate and this decides the outcome of the play long before the play actually ends. The agon in The Birds (lines 451\u2013626) is conventional in form but there is no antagonist \u2013 the two main speakers are Pisthetaerus and his friend Euelpides, with Pisthetaerus delivering a speech and Euelpides providing supportive comments. The birds provide a willing audience and they are easily won over to the protagonist's point of view. A similarly one-sided agon is found in the next surviving play, Lysistrata.\nParabasis: The parabasis is an address to the audience by the Chorus in the absence of any actors. Generally there is a long parabasis in the middle of the play, including a 'parabasis proper' in which the Chorus speaks as the author's representative on issues relating to his career, and usually there is a shorter parabasis near the end. In this play, the first parabasis (678\u2013800) and the second (1058\u20131117) are conventional in structure but the Chorus always speaks in character as birds. Instead of speaking about the poet in the 'parabasis proper', the birds speak about themselves, outlining their genealogy, their value to the audience and their effect on the audience's vocabulary \u2013 in all these topics however there are amusing echoes of things a Chorus would ordinarily say on behalf of the poet. This 'parabasis proper' is in fact almost a satire on the convention of a parabasis proper.\nUnwelcome Visitors: The protagonist's early victory in the agon generally tends to ease dramatic tension early in the play and this is usually offset to some extent by a stream of minor characters or 'unwelcome visitors' that have to be chased off by the triumphant hero. This play is exceptional in that there are three waves of unwelcome visitors \u2013 the first wave comes before the walls of Cloudcuckooland have been completed, the second wave comes immediately after and the third wave comes as a delegation from Zeus. This repetition is the reason why The Birds is much longer than the other surviving plays.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1999, in responding to the lyrics that made it famous, the city of Winslow erected a life-size bronze statue and mural commemorating the song at the Standin' on the Corner Park. The statue stands near a lamp post, the male figure securing an acoustic guitar between his right hand and the shoe of his right foot. Above his head, a metal sign, crafted in the style of U.S. Route shields, displays the words \"Standin' on the corner\". The trompe-l'\u0153il mural on the wall behind the statue is that of a storefront, and includes what would appear to be the reflection of a red flatbed Ford pickup truck driven by a blonde-haired woman. The second floor of the mural features an eagle perched in one window on the left and a man and woman (apparently the man on the corner and woman in the truck) embracing in another window on the right.  The site has become a landmark that attracted many visitors to the town.There has, however, been some confusion about the location of original incident that inspired the story in the lyrics. In an interview with Matthew Ziegler, Browne related that it took place in Flagstaff, Arizona, at the Wienerschnitzel (now the Dog Haus) at the corner of East Rte. 66 and Switzer Canyon.  According to Browne, a young woman cruised by in a Toyota pickup and looked at him and the image stuck with him. Browne had told Frey about the woman in the truck, and Frey then used the incident to add the line about the woman to the song.  Browne, however, also stated in an interview with Los Angeles Times that it was always Winslow where his automobile had malfunctioned, although \"the image of that girl driving a truck was an image that came from east\" (i.e., East Flagstaff). The lines are therefore an amalgamation of two different events.On September 24, 2016, a life-sized tribute statue to Glenn Frey was added to the Standin' on the Corner Park in Winslow, Arizona, to honor his songwriting contributions to \"Take It Easy\".  Funds for the new statue, which depicted Frey as he appeared in the 1970s, were raised by \"Mark & NeanderPaul\" (Mark Devine & Paul Marshall), the morning show from Phoenix classic rock station 100.7 KSLX, the city of Winslow, and the Standin' on the Corner Foundation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A brawl ensues between Toby's gang and another gang, which ends with both sides fleeing just before police arrive. Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well as her other friends Emily and Sam is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison performs a blowjob on her boyfriend.\nThe next day, Allison meets with her father, Stuart, at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to let Toby go.\nThe next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house. Before they leave, Hector informs Allison of a motel where his crew regularly party, and invites her to stop by if she wishes. The next day, Eric continues his film project at Allison's home, with Allison turning his interview of her into a bizarre mind-game.\nThat evening, Allison meets up with Hector again in a store, and he shows her around his neighborhood, while talking about his family and lifestyle. His guided tour abruptly ends when the police arrive in force, ostensibly on a drug bust. Allison winds up being arrested with the other present gang members, but \u2013 save for an argument with her parents and Toby \u2013 is let off the hook. The experience only serves to increase Allison's fascination with the inner-city lifestyle. The night after her release, Allison and Emily agree to head downtown the next evening to hang out with Hector's crew.\nThe two meet up with Hector and his gang at a motel, and a night of partying and drinking results in Allison and Emily asking Hector if they can join his crew. Hector informs them of their initiation; to join the gang, the two must roll a dice; the number they roll corresponds to the number of gang members they must have sex with.\nAllison rolls a one, Emily rolls a three. Hector and Allison pair off, but Allison has second thoughts and refuses to have sex with him, and is thrown out of the room by Hectors brother when she tries to get Emily to leave with her. Emily eagerly engages in sex with Hector. His brother stands at the door waiting his turn while Allison sits outside pouting. Hector signals his brother to join in as the third member enters the room. Allison hears Emily cry out and runs into the room. You see Hector and his brother having sex with Emily for a brief moment. You can tell they are hurting Emily as she screams and gets away from them. Allison tries to comfort her but Emily just collapses and cries in her arms. All three men flee the room, yelling at the girls. Hector stops and screams at Allison asking her what she wants, leaving the two distraught women.\nThe next day, Allison returns to the motel and confronts Hector over the previous night, but he responds by saying he didn't do anything wrong; that he only did what she and Emily had asked him to do. At that moment, a woman shows up at the door, surprising Allison, much to the amusement of Hector, who mocks Allison for thinking he had feelings for her, and calling her a poser who only knows how to play games and nothing about the realities of gang life.\nThe same day Emily is shown at a police station accusing Hector and his crew of gang rape. Allison is brought in for questioning, but claims to know nothing about a rape. Hector is subsequently arrested, and members of his crew vow to seek out and silence Allison and Emily, but wind up getting lost in Bel-Air. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang are shown posing with guns in front of Eric and his video camera, making clear on their intent to seek revenge on Hector's crew. Eric later shows Allison the footage, and Allison subsequently calls Toby and makes an ill-fated attempt to convince him that there was no rape and what he is doing is foolish.\nAllison informs Emily of what Toby plans to do and reveals to Emily's parents the events at the motel. This initially upsets Emily to the point of nearly attempting suicide, but eventually the two reconcile. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang arrive at Hector's motel and bust in violently, but only succeed in frightening a group of Latina women and a baby. Toby tries to work up the nerve to shoot them, but, consumed by their desperate pleas to not hurt the baby, realizes he can't and storms out.\nOn their drive home, the gang passes the SUV containing the members of Hector's crew that had been looking for Allison and Emily. The two gangs exchange looks, and the screen subsequently fades to black. After a few seconds the sounds of tires squealing, people shouting and gunfire are heard.\nWith Eric's film project complete, Allison concludes by stating that teens will be teens, but if adults are willing to reach out to them to connect and give them even just a small amount of insight, it's like that they now suddenly know everything.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It collects accounts from the hearings, including testimony from witnesses \u2014 some of it vivid and disturbing \u2014 and documents the progress of the Commission, including several scandals in the press. At the same time, the book follows Krog's personal experience during this period, including the effects on her personal life and mental health, as she attempts to grapple with the country's bloody history, with the unfolding social and political landscape of democratic South Africa, and with moral questions about complicity, guilt, forgiveness, and responsibility.\n\nThese moral questions especially preoccupy Krog because she is a white Afrikaner who retains a strong attachment to Afrikaans culture and history, even as she is horrified by the ravages of Apartheid. (The book is dedicated to \"every victim who had an Afrikaner surname on her lips.\") Her sense of belonging in the new South Africa depends on the possibility of constructing a new Afrikaner identity. Krog is also occupied by questions about language: about the inadequacy of any language to express the depth of suffering experienced under Apartheid, and particularly about the association of her native tongue, Afrikaans, with Apartheid. She asks, \"How do I live with the fact that all the words used to humiliate, all the orders given to kill, belonged to the language of my heart?\" In reflecting on these questions, Krog draws on the moral philosophy, and notably the philosophy of ubuntu, of such figures as President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was the head of the Commission. She is occasionally deeply moved by exhibitions of these philosophies, and she admires Tutu in particular, calling him \"the compass\" and the core of the Commission \u2014 most importantly, \"It is he who finds language for what is happening.\" For example, as Krog watches Tutu plead personally with Winnie Mandela to testify truthfully, she has an intense emotional reaction: Ah, the Commission! The deepest heart of my heart. Heart that can only come from this soil \u2014 brave \u2014 with its teeth firmly in the jugular of the only truth that matters. And that heart is black. I belong to that blinding black African heart. My throat floats up in tears \u2014 my pen falls to the floor, I blubber behind my hand, my glasses fog up \u2014 for one brief, shimmering moment this country, this country is also truly mine. She writes of the Commission, \"here the marginalised voice speaks to the public ear, the unspeakable is spoken \u2014 and translated \u2014 the personal story brought from the innermost depths of the individual binds us anew to the collective.\" However, she also criticises various aspects of the Commission, for example pointing out the inadequacy of the government's approach to reparations and the exploitation of the hearings for political purposes.\nKrog ultimately judges herself and other whites to have been complicit in Apartheid's crimes against humanity.

The band drew inspiration from a wide variety of music, incorporating elements of classical, jazz, folk, heavy metal, gamelan, blues, industrial, electronic, experimental music and new wave. They exerted a strong influence on the early 1970s progressive rock movement, including on contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis, and continue to inspire subsequent generations of artists across multiple genres. The band earned a large cult following.Founded by Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, Greg Lake, Ian McDonald and Peter Sinfield, the band initially focused on a dramatic sound layered with Mellotron, McDonald's saxophone and flute, and Lake's bass and powerful lead vocals. Their debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King (1969), remains their most commercially successful and influential release, with a potent mixture of jazz, classical and experimental music. Following the sudden simultaneous departures of McDonald and Giles, with Lake also leaving very shortly afterwards, the next two albums In the Wake of Poseidon and Lizard (both 1970) were recorded during a period of instability in the band's line-up. A settled band of Fripp, Sinfield, Mel Collins, Boz Burrell and Ian Wallace recorded Islands in 1971, though in mid-1972, Fripp let go of this line-up and changed the group's instrumentation and approach, drawing from European free improvisation and developing ever more complex compositions. With Bill Bruford, John Wetton, David Cross and, briefly, Jamie Muir, they reached what some saw as a creative peak on Larks' Tongues in Aspic (1973), Starless and Bible Black (1974), and Red (1974). King Crimson disbanded at the end of 1974.\nAfter seven years of inactivity, King Crimson was reborn in 1981 with another change in musical direction. The new band comprised Fripp, Bruford and new members Adrian Belew and Tony Levin. They drew influence from African music, gamelan, post-punk and New York minimalism. This band lasted three years, resulting in the trio of albums Discipline (1981), Beat (1982) and Three of a Perfect Pair (1984). Following a decade-long hiatus, they reformed in 1994, adding Pat Mastelotto and Trey Gunn for a sextet line-up Fripp called \"The Double Trio\". The double trio participated in another three-year cycle of activity that included the release of Thrak (1995), and multiple concert recordings. There was a hiatus between 1997 and 2000. Four members of the double trio reunited in 2000 as a more industrial-oriented King Crimson, called \"The Double Duo\", releasing The Construkction of Light (2000) and The Power to Believe (2003). After a five-year hiatus, the group expanded (in the person of new second drummer Gavin Harrison) for a 2008 tour celebrating the 40th anniversary of their 1968 formation.\nFollowing another hiatus (2009\u20132012), during which Fripp was thought to be retired, King Crimson came together again in 2013; this time as a septet (and, later, octet) with an unusual three-drumkit frontline, and new second guitarist and singer Jakko Jakszyk.

Unlike his friend David Philby, Alexander would rather do pure research than work in the world of business. After a mugger kills his fianc\u00e9e Emma, he devotes himself to building a time machine that will allow him to travel back in time to save her. After completing the machine in 1903, he travels back to 1899 and prevents her murder, only to see her killed again when a carriage frightens the horses of another vehicle.\nAlexander realizes that any attempt to save Emma will result in her death through other circumstances. He travels to 2030 to discover whether science has discovered how to change the past. At the New York Public Library, holographic librarian Vox 114 insists time travel to the past is impossible. Alexander travels to 2037, when the accidental destruction of the Moon by lunar colonists has begun rendering the Earth virtually uninhabitable. While restarting the machine, he is knocked unconscious by debris and travels forward 800,000 years to the date 16 July 802,701 before reawakening.\nThe Earth has healed, and the human race has reverted to a primitive lifestyle. Some survivors, called \"Eloi\", live on the sides of cliffs of what was once Manhattan. Alexander is nursed back to health by a woman named Mara, one of the few Eloi who speak English. He observes the broken moon and realises that maybe his teachings led to this future. One night, Alexander and Mara's younger brother, Kalen, dream of a jagged-toothed face and a creature calling their name. Alexander informs Mara of the dream, and she tells him they all have that dream. She then notices that his watch is missing. The next day, the Eloi are attacked and Mara is dragged underground by ape-like creatures. They are called \"Morlocks,\" and they hunt the Eloi. In order to rescue Mara, Kalen leads Alexander to Vox 114, which is still functional after 800,000 years.\nAfter learning from Vox how to find the Morlocks, Alexander enters their underground lair through an opening that resembles the face in his nightmare. He is captured and thrown into an area where Mara sits in a cage. Alexander meets an intelligent, humanoid \u00dcber-Morlock, who explains that Morlocks descend from the humans who went underground after the Moon broke apart, while the Eloi evolved from those who remained on the surface. The \u00dcber-Morlocks are a caste of telepaths who rule the other Morlocks, who use the Eloi as food and breeding vessels.\nThe \u00dcber-Morlock explains that Alexander cannot alter Emma's fate; her death is what drove him to build the time machine in the first place, therefore saving her would be an impossibility due to temporal paradox. The \u00dcber-Morlock shows Alexander the time machine and tells him to go home. Alexander gets into the machine but pulls the \u00dcber-Morlock in with him, carrying them into the future as they fight. The \u00dcber-Morlock dies by rapidly aging when Alexander pushes him outside of the machine's temporal bubble. Alexander stops in 635,427,810, revealing a harsh, rust-colored sky over a wasteland of Morlock caves.\nAccepting that he cannot save Emma, Alexander travels back to rescue Mara. After freeing her, he starts the machine and jams its gears, creating a distortion in time. Pursued by the Morlocks, Alexander and Mara escape to the surface as the time distortion explodes, killing the Morlocks and destroying their caves along with the time machine. Alexander begins a new life with Mara and the Eloi, while Vox 114 helps him educate them.\nIn 1903, Philby and Mrs. Watchit, Alexander's housekeeper, discuss his absence in his laboratory. Philby tells Mrs. Watchit he is glad that Alexander has gone to a place where he can find peace, and he would like to hire her as a housekeeper. She accepts until Alexander returns. Mrs. Watchit bids Alexander farewell, and Philby leaves, looking toward the laboratory affectionately; then proudly throws his bowler hat away in tribute to Alexander's objection to blind conformity.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1147", "question": "What genre is Kiss?", "ctxs": [{"id": "526_52634", "text": "From the start of writing the Buffy series, Joss Whedon asserted that it would never have a \"very special episode\" as in contemporary series Beverly Hills, 90210, The Wonder Years, or Party of Five, where the core cast of characters addresses a single issue (AIDS, drug abuse, or alcoholism, for example) and resolve all the problems at the end. Whedon was not interested in finding a life-affirming lesson for \"The Body\". Rather, he wanted to capture the isolation and boredom involved in the minutes and hours after finding a loved one has died, what he termed \"the black ashes in your mouth numbness of death\". He did not intend to resolve any religious or existential questions about the end of life, but wanted to examine the process in which a person becomes a mere body. Whedon's mother, a teacher, also died of a cerebral aneurysm, and he drew on his own experiences, and those of friends and other writers, in constructing the episode. He tried to achieve an \"unlovely physicality\" in \"The Body\" to portray the upsetting minutiae involved in attempting to comprehend what is incomprehensible.Small details became significant: to protect her dignity, Buffy pulls the hem of Joyce's skirt down after it rode up when she attempted CPR; the camera focuses on a breeze through wind chimes while Buffy vomits; to emphasize Buffy's isolation, the scene has no exterior establishing shots of the house.The opening sequence of \"The Body\" was also the closing scene of the previous episode, \"I Was Made to Love You\"; this is the only episode in the series that was first aired without a \"Previously on Buffy\" lead-in. The Christmas dinner scene was used both to contrast the stark reality of the rest of the episode and to avoid having the credits appear over the beginning scenes where Buffy is trying to revive her mother.The episode is presented in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar (Buffy). Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move through the house and calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, \"We're not supposed to move the body!\" Both Gellar and Trachtenberg (Dawn) were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, \"you try to separate it as best you can and at the same time it adds that extra layer\". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar \"at a fever pitch\", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure.Kristine Sutherland (Joyce) was informed during the third season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended to spend time in Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of \"The Body\" was strange and tense because she had been a regular character throughout the series and she was suddenly playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, but getting into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies.The most difficult scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession about what to wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences when he was at a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying that she was able to be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene.Whedon's rejection of the \"very special episode\" format impelled him to address the physicality of Willow and Tara's relationship within \"The Body\". Before this episode, they had held hands and danced on screen, but they had not kissed. A genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as the \"lesbian kiss episode\" in the 1990s, where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored. Whedon set out to acknowledge Willow's and Tara's affection without making it the primary focus of the show. For attempting this, he received resistance from the airing network, the WB. Whedon informed them that the kiss between Willow and Tara was \"not negotiable\". According to Whedon, the conversation about the kiss was approached by the network executives, who were concerned with the number of gay relationships on the network. Whedon countered that the kiss was \"true to character\" and said he would quit the show if the network forbade it. It was the only time during the series he threatened to do so.When Willow and Tara first met in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the relationship to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For the rest of the season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in \"The Body\", saying \"They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props when it came to the [characters' first] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy.\" Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was \"truly groundbreaking\"; no long speech, no huge discovery: \"Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world\". Tropiano calls it \"A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do.\"  Shortly before the end of the scene, while Xander is talking, Willow can be seen silently mouthing \"I love you\" to Tara.\nAudiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon expected to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence was similar to a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers \"the heart of the experience\" and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the \"whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters\". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality of dealing with the crisis. Whedon used another long tracking shot from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Originally aired by the Fox network on February 13, 2000, \"Closure\" received a Nielsen rating of 9.1 and was seen by 15.35 million viewers. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics; many felt that the final reveal was emotional and powerful, although some were unhappy with the resolution.\nThe show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship.

The Boer War of 1899 split the Liberal Party into Imperialist and Pro-Boer factions, with CB strongly critical of the use of concentration camps as 'methods of barbarism'. Campbell-Bannerman faced the difficult task of holding together the strongly divided party, which was subsequently and unsurprisingly defeated in the \"khaki election\" of 1900. Campbell-Bannerman caused particular friction within his own party when in a speech to the National Reform Union in June 1901 and shortly after meeting Emily Hobhouse, he described the concentration camps set up by the British in the Boer War as \"methods of barbarism\".The Liberal Party was later able to unify over its opposition to the Education Act 1902 and the Brussels Sugar Convention of 1902, in which Britain and nine other nations attempted to stabilise world sugar prices by setting up a commission to investigate export bounties and decide on penalties. The Conservative Government of Arthur Balfour had threatened countervailing duties and subsidies of West Indian sugar producers as a negotiating tool. The convention's intent was to lead to the gradual phasing out of export bounties, and Britain would then forbid the importation of subsidised sugar. In a speech to the Cobden Club on 28 November 1902, Campbell-Bannerman denounced the convention as threatening the sovereignty of Britain.\n\nIt means that we abandon our fiscal independence, together with our free-trade ways; that we subside into the tenth part of a Vehmgericht which is to direct us what sugar is to be countervailed, at what rate per cent. we are to countervail it, how much is to be put on for the bounty, and how much for the tariff being in excess of the convention tariff; and this being the established order of things, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in his robes obeys the orders that he receives from this foreign convention, in which the Britisher is only one out of ten, and the House of Commons humbly submits to the whole transaction. (\"Shame.\") Sir, of all the insane schemes ever offered to a free country as a boon this is surely the maddest.\nHowever, it was Joseph Chamberlain's proposals for Tariff Reform in May 1903 that provided the Liberals with a great and nationally resonating cause on which to campaign and unify, due to its protectionist nature. Chamberlain's proposals dominated politics through the rest of 1903 up until the general election of 1906. Campbell-Bannerman, like other Liberals, held an unshakeable belief in free trade. In a speech at Bolton on 15 October 1903, he explained in greater detail the reasoning behind Liberal support for free trade.\n\nWe are satisfied that it is right because it gives the freest play to individual energy and initiative and character and the largest liberty both to producer and consumer. We say that trade is injured when it is not allowed to follow its natural course, and when it is either hampered or diverted by artificial obstacles.... We believe in free trade because we believe in the capacity of our countrymen. That at least is why I oppose protection root and branch, veiled and unveiled, one-sided or reciprocal. I oppose it in any form. Besides we have experience of fifty years, during which our prosperity has become the envy of the world.\nIn 1903, the Liberal Party's Chief Whip Herbert Gladstone negotiated a pact with Ramsay MacDonald of the Labour Representation Committee to withdraw Liberal candidates to help LRC candidates in certain seats, in return for LRC withdrawal in other seats to help Liberal candidates. This attempt to undermine and outflank the Conservatives, which would prove to be successful, formed what became known as the \"Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact\". Campbell-Bannerman got on well with Labour leaders, and he said in 1903 \"we are keenly in sympathy with the representatives of Labour. We have too few of them in the House of Commons\". Despite this comment, and his sympathies with many elements of the Labour movement, he was not a socialist. One biographer has written that \"he was deeply and genuinely concerned about the plight of the poor and so had readily adopted the rhetoric of progressivism, but he was not a progressive\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Halloween popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. Halloween helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s. Due to its popularity, Halloween became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed, and that others like Scream parodied.The major themes present in Halloween also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in Halloween, there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.There are slasher films that predated Halloween, such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972),  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Black Christmas (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. Halloween, however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others. Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of Halloween,\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting. Rockoff considers the film \"the blueprint for all slashers and the model against which all subsequent films are judged.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

A tremendous success, Rinaldo created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed music director of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music (unconnected with the present day London conservatoire), a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance.Ottone, an opera by Handel presented for the Academy in January 1723, was the first time London audiences had seen the operatic superstars, castrato Senesino and soprano Francesca Cuzzoni, performing together in an opera, and had been an immense success, with demand for tickets far outstripping supply\nFlavio, following Ottone in the same year and with the same leading singers, did not create such a sensation as Ottone had, although it was successful enough with audiences to be revived by Handel in a subsequent season. One reason for this may have been Flavio's comparative brevity, as announced in the playbills by the AcademyAt the King's Theatre...this present Tuesday...will be performed a New Opera call'd, FLAVIUS...By reason of the shortness of the Opera, to begin exactly at Eight a-Clock.\nFlavio also mixes high tragedy with amorous intrigue and comic interludes, which was perhaps not what London audiences, who had become accustomed to heroic dramas on a consistent note of serious drama in Italian opera, were expecting.The work is lightly scored mostly for strings and continuo instruments only, with woodwinds being used sparingly. Handel's music treats some of the complications of the plot with mock-heroic irony, but the more serious passages produce intense dramatic music from the composer. 18th century musicologist Charles Burney praised the aria \" Amor, nel mio penar\" written for Senesino as Guido, torn between love and duty, as \"extremely pathetic\" and the aria for Emilia, \"Amante stravagante\" became a popular success as a separate song with English words fitted to it as \"See, see, my charmer flyes me\".During rehearsals for Flavio, the tenor Alexander Gordon became frustrated with Handel's direction of the music from the harpsichord and threatened to jump on the instrument, to which Handel replied \"Oh! Let me know when you will do that and I will advertise it. For I am sure more people will come to see you jump than to hear you sing.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.

She is attacked by a wolf-like creature, after she stops to check out a small figurine lying on the ground.\nLater that morning, police officer Nick Burkhardt (portrayed by David Giuntoli), and his partner Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby), are discussing Nick's plans to propose to his girlfriend. A woman walks by and while looking at Nick, her face changes to that of a non-human creature. Hank appears not to notice anything. They are then called to investigate the murder of the runner.\nAfter visiting the murder scene, Nick and Hank are working at a station of the Portland Police Department. There is a man being processed by another detective, and when Nick looks at him, his face momentarily changes into that of a beast. Nick is again the only one who sees this transformation.\nLater that night, Nick comes to his home to find his girlfriend, to whom he is preparing to propose, Juliette Silverton (Bitsie Tulloch), conversing with his aunt, Marie Kessler (portrayed by guest star Kate Burton), who had just come to town with a trailer. Nick finds out that Marie is dying of breast cancer, and she informs him that he is one of the last in a long line of people called Grimms, who can see beasts reminiscent of those about which The Brothers Grimm wrote. She is later attacked by one of those beasts, and Nick manages to shoot the creature who, upon dying, transforms back to a human. Badly injured, Marie gives Nick a key, which he is supposed to protect with his life.\nAt the hospital, Marie informs Nick more about his family and the Grimms, and she informs him that all he needs to know is in her trailer. He goes in the trailer that night and finds a various assortment of weapons and a book, which details encounters with various creatures and descriptions of what they are. When attempting to inform his aunt that he has previously seen some of the creatures about which he had read, he finds out she had slipped into a coma.\nNick then is informed of a case in which a young girl also wearing a red sweater is abducted on her way to her grandparents house (or school). He connects this to the previous case after finding the young girl's backpack in the woods and a boot print similar to one found at the crime scene of a murdured college student(as well as her shoe with her leg still attached). In the woods, he follows a trail that leads him to the house of a man, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), whom he arrests after seeing his face change. Monroe is found to be clean and then released, but Nick, being suspicious, returns to Monroe's house. After a scuffle, he has a conversation with Monroe, who turns out to be a reformed Blutbad, the same type of creature as the one that attacked the girls. Monroe agrees to help Nick solve the case. After following the scent of another Blutbad, Monroe leads Nick to the Blutbad's cabin in the woods. Monroe begins transforming against his own will and, fearing that he might attack either Nick or the girl, retreats.\nNick calls in Hank to investigate the cabin, and the two of them enter the cabin. Hank is initially dismissive of Nick's thoughts, as the Blutbad appears to be a simple postman named Errol Ditmarsch. However, upon exiting the cabin, Hank realizes that Ditmarsch was humming the same song found on the dead girl's iPod: Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) by The Eurythmics. They return to the cabin only to find the lights out, and nobody there. Then Ditmarsch attacks Hank in morphed form, but as he runs out of the cabin, Hank opens fire on him.

When Renard asks if Marie is dead, the woman says that because Nick was there to save Marie, Marie lived. Renard then tells her that they will have to try the attempt again in the hopes that Nick is not there and Marie is not conscious when they do so.

US Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison named Selena one of \"the spirited women who shaped [the United States].\"Selena became one of the \"most celebrated cultural products\" of the United States-Mexico borderlands. Selena was called the \"Queen of Tejano Music\", and was described as \"the most important and popular Tejano star of all time\". Her death was \"the most devastating loss\" in Tejano music history, according to Zach Quaintance of The Monitor. At the time of her death, Selena became one of the most widely known Mexican-American vocal artists and the most popular Latin artist in the United States. She had a \"cult-like\" following among Hispanics.Selena has been named one of the most influential Latin artists of all-time and has been credited for elevating a music genre into the mainstream market. Latin Post called the singer \"one of the most iconic artists in Latin American music history\", while The New York Times called her \"arguably the most important Latina musician in the country, on her way to becoming one of the most important, period.\" Selena became a household name in the United States and Mexico following her death and became part of the American pop culture. She became more popular in death than when she was alive.After her death, her popularity among the Hispanic population was compared to those of Marilyn Monroe and Madonna in Anglo-American culture. According to author Carlota Caulfield, Selena was \"one of the most popular Latina singers of the 1990s\". Selena's popularity was drawn in by the LGBT community and minority groups in the United States. The popularity of Tejano music waned after her death and has not recovered. John Lannert of Billboard said in an interview with Biography in 2007 that when Selena died the \"Tejano market died with her\".Dreaming of You, the crossover album Selena had been working on at the time of her death, was released in July 1995. It sold 175,000 copies on the day of its release in the U.S.\u2014a then-record for a female vocalist\u2014and sold 331,000 copies its first week. Selena became the third female artist to sell over 300,000 units in one week, after Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first album by a Hispanic artist to do so. Dreaming of You helped Selena to become the first solo artist to debut a posthumous album at number one. Dreaming of You joined five of Selena's studio albums on the Billboard 200 chart simultaneously, making Selena the first female artist in Billboard history to do so. The album was certified 59\u00d7 platinum (Latin field), for sales of 3.54 million album-equivalent units in the U.S. alone.As of 2017 it has sold over 2.942 million copies in the U.S. making it the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the country according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of 2015, the recording has sold five million copies worldwide. In 2008, Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle said its lead single, \"I Could Fall in Love\", had \"made the Tejano goddess a posthumous crossover star\". Her death was believed to have sparked an interest in Latin music by people who were unaware of its existence. It was also believed her death \"open[ed] the doors\" to other Latin musicians such as Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, and Shakira.In 1995, the United States Social Security Administration ranked the name Selena one of the 100 most popular names for newborn girls, and namesake Selena Gomez acknowledged Quintanilla's influence. In December 1999, Selena was named the \"top Latin artist of the '90s\" and \"Best selling Latin artist of the decade\" by Billboard for her fourteen top-ten singles in the Top Latin Songs chart, including seven number-one hits. She was the best-selling Latin female singer of the 1990s in the U.S. and Mexico. Selena was named \"Best Female Vocalist of the '80s\" and \"Best Female Vocalist of the '90s\" at the 2010 Tejano Music Awards. In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Selena at number 89 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Upon formation, the Mentors began to tour the Northwest, playing shows with their trademark executioner hoods (it was the idea of El Duce, who adored a horror movie called Mark of the Devil) and bawdy lyrics. In the early days of the band, El Duce would contact venues saying they were a Kiss cover band and send them a dubbed cassette with Kiss songs on it and say it was them, on one occasion he sent a copy of Deep Purple Live in Japan to what they thought was a club. It was later revealed to be a pizza place and they ended up playing a kid's birthday party, they were forced to stop after one song and were eventually given $50. Broy was in and out of the band during its early career due to his preoccupation with pursuing a degree in engineering. Other bassists from this era include Jeff Dahl, Chris Jacobsen (Jack Shit), and Mike Dewey (Heathen Scum Wezda).Through Mystic Records, the Mentors released their first EP, The Trash Bag, in 1983. Their first live album, Live at the Whiskey/Cathey de Grande, came out the following year; both records were produced by Phillip (Philco) Raves. In 1985, they signed to Death Records, a subsidiary of Metal Blade, and released their debut studio LP, You Axed for It!, with Broy returning on the bass. During this time, Hoke maintained a strong public presence, making a controversial appearance alongside fellow metal band GWAR on The Jerry Springer Show, where Hoke's band, beliefs, and public image were criticized.The Mentors did not achieve true notoriety until the 1985 Congressional hearings orchestrated by Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). The relatively obscure Mentors caught the attention of the PMRC with their song, \"Golden Shower\", prompting a reading of some of its lyrics on the Congressional floor.\nBroy was briefly replaced by bassists Wayne Daddio (\"Ripper\"), Ed Danky (\"Poppa Sneaky Spermshooter\"), Lucinda Rezabek (\"Scum Bitch\"), and\nKeith McAdam (\"Zippy\"), but later returned to the group. In 1989, the Mentors released their third album, Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Roll, a faux-live record. This album caught the attention of the band Revolting Cocks, who invited the Mentors on tour with them.They released Rock Bible in 1990, with Rick Lomas (\"Insect On Acid\") sitting in on drums. To the Max followed the next year. Clark Savage (\"Moosedick\") often filled in for Hoke on drums at live shows, as Hoke's alcoholism had made it difficult for him to play drums and sing simultaneously, eventually taking the position as drummer while Hoke became vocalist exclusively.\nThe Mentors remained sporadically active thereafter. Hoke began a solo career, while Carlson formed the band Jesters of Destiny. In 1997, while being interviewed for the documentary film Kurt and Courtney, Hoke claimed that Courtney Love had offered him $50,000 to kill her husband Kurt Cobain, whose death was ruled a suicide. Two days after being interviewed, Hoke died after being struck by a freight train while intoxicated. His death was alternately described as an accident and a suicide, however, some conspiracy theorists have claimed there is evidence suggesting foul play.Carlson, Broy and Savage continued the band and were joined by guitarist Jeff Solberg (\"Sickie J\") and vocalist Jake Huber (\"El Rapo\"), releasing Over the Top in 2005. In 2006 Singer and drummer Marc DeLeon (\"Mad Dog\"), of the Mentors tribute band The Mantors, replaced Huber and, later, Savage. 2009 saw the release of Ducefixion, their eighth full-length record. DeLeon left the Mentors in 2014 during the making of full-length documentary film called The Mentors: Kings of Sleaze Rockumentary, directed by April Jones.\nOn May 25, 2017, the Mentors released The Illuminaughty, their first studio album in eight years, with Broy and Lomas sharing the vocal duties.\nIn 2019, a documentary about the band and Hoke, The El Duce Tapes, was released to the festival circuit, featuring unreleased interviews with Hoke from 1990-91 and discussing the Mentors in the context of modern-day cancel culture. The film was released on Blu-ray, streaming and limited-edition VHS in 2020.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The track is driven by strummed acoustic instruments such as guitar and mandolin. It incorporates piano and violin accents which culminate in a full string section. Marissa R. Moss of Rolling Stone called the song a \"country crossover moment\".The lyrics for \"Breathe\" are about heartbreak and the loss of a close friendship. In the song's verses, the narrator acknowledges that people change and grow apart, though she is upset because she knows the person \"like the back of her hand.\" In the song's refrains, she realizes the need to remain strong and breathe in order to live without the person. Ken Tucker of Billboard believed \"Breathe\" was a \"love-gone-wrong song.\"According to Swift, \"Breathe\" is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, \"when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end.\" Swift explained, \"It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do.

It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout.\" Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.

{"id": "91_1183", "question": "What genre is Godzilla?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_41399", "text": "Godzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of Japanese popular culture worldwide and remains an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the kaiju subset of the tokusatsu genre. Godzilla's vaguely humanoid appearance and strained, lumbering movements endeared it to Japanese audiences, who could relate to Godzilla as a sympathetic character, despite its wrathful nature. Audiences respond positively to the character because it acts out of rage and self-preservation and shows where science and technology can go wrong.In 1967, the Keukdong Entertainment Company of South Korea, with production assistance from Toei Company, produced Yongary, Monster from the Deep, a reptilian monster who invades South Korea to consume oil. The film and character has often been branded as an imitation of Godzilla.Godzilla has been considered a filmographic metaphor for the United States, as well as an allegory of nuclear weapons in general. The earlier Godzilla films, especially the original, portrayed Godzilla as a frightening nuclear-spawned monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the possibility of recurrence.As the series progressed, so did Godzilla, changing into a less destructive and more heroic character. Ghidorah (1964) was the turning point in Godzilla's transformation from villain to hero, by pitting him against a greater threat to humanity, King Ghidorah. Godzilla has since been viewed as an anti-hero. Roger Ebert cites Godzilla as a notable example of a villain-turned-hero, along with King Kong, Jaws (James Bond), the Terminator and John Rambo.Godzilla is considered \"the original radioactive superhero\" due to his accidental radioactive origin story predating Spider-Man (1962 debut), though Godzilla did not become a hero until Ghidorah in 1964. By the 1970s, Godzilla came to be viewed as a superhero, with the magazine King of the Monsters in 1977 describing Godzilla as \"Superhero of the '70s.\" Godzilla had surpassed Superman and Batman to become \"the most universally popular superhero of 1977\" according to Donald F. Glut. Godzilla was also voted the most popular movie monster in The Monster Times poll in 1973, beating Count Dracula, King Kong, the Wolf Man, the Mummy, the Creature from the Black Lagoon and the Frankenstein Monster.\nIn 1996, Godzilla received the MTV Lifetime Achievement Award, as well as being given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004 to celebrate the premiere of the character's 50th anniversary film, Godzilla: Final Wars. Godzilla's pop-cultural impact has led to the creation of numerous parodies and tributes, as seen in media such as Bambi Meets Godzilla, which was ranked as one of the \"50 greatest cartoons\", two episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and the song \"Godzilla\" by Blue \u00d6yster Cult. Godzilla has also been used in advertisements, such as in a commercial for Nike, where Godzilla lost an oversized one-on-one game of basketball to a giant version of NBA player Charles Barkley. The commercial was subsequently adapted into a comic book illustrated by Jeff Butler. Godzilla has also appeared in a commercial for Snickers candy bars, which served as an indirect promo for the 2014 film. Godzilla's success inspired the creation of numerous other monster characters, such as Gamera, Reptilicus of Denmark, Yonggary of South Korea, Pulgasari of North Korea, Gorgo of the United Kingdom and the Cloverfield monster of the United States.Dakosaurus is an extinct sea crocodile of the Jurassic Period, which researchers informally nicknamed \"Godzilla\". Paleontologists have written tongue-in-cheek speculative articles about Godzilla's biology, with Kenneth Carpenter tentatively classifying it as a ceratosaur based on its skull shape, four-fingered hands, and dorsal scutes and paleontologist Darren Naish expressing skepticism, while commenting on Godzilla's unusual morphology.Godzilla's ubiquity in pop culture has led to the mistaken assumption that the character is in the public domain, resulting in litigation by Toho to protect their corporate asset from becoming a generic trademark. In April 2008, Subway depicted a giant monster in a commercial for their Five Dollar Footlongs sandwich promotion. Toho filed a lawsuit against Subway for using the character without permission, demanding $150,000 in compensation. In February 2011, Toho sued Honda for depicting a fire-breathing monster in a commercial for the Honda Odyssey. The monster was never mentioned by name, being seen briefly on a video screen inside the minivan. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society christened a vessel the MV Gojira. Its purpose is to target and harass Japanese whalers in defense of whales in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The MV Gojira was renamed the MV Brigitte Bardot in May 2011, due to legal pressure from Toho. Gojira is the name of a French death metal band, formerly known as Godzilla; legal problems forced the band to change their name. In May 2015, Toho launched a lawsuit against Voltage Pictures over a planned picture starring Anne Hathaway. Promotional material released at the Cannes Film Festival used images of Godzilla.Steven Spielberg cited Godzilla as an inspiration for Jurassic Park (1993), specifically Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), which he grew up watching. Spielberg described Godzilla as \"the most masterful of all the dinosaur movies because it made you believe it was really happening.\" Godzilla also influenced the Spielberg film Jaws (1975). Godzilla has also been cited as an inspiration by filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Tim Burton.A  carnivorous dinosaur from the Triassic period was named Gojirasaurus in 1997. The main-belt asteroid 101781 Gojira, discovered by American astronomer Roy Tucker at the Goodricke-Pigott Observatory in 1999, was named in honor of the creature. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 11 July 2018 (M.P.C. 110635). The largest megamullion, located 600 kilometres to the south-east of Okinotorishima, the southernmost Japanese island, is named the Godzilla Megamullion. The Japan Coast Guard played a role in name, reaching an agreement with Toho. Toho's Chief Godzilla officer Keiji Ota stated that \"I am truly honored that (the megamullion) bears Godzilla's name, the Earth's most powerful monster.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Folha de S.Paulo's S\u00e9rgio S\u00e1 Leit\u00e3o pointed out Sepultura's increasing compositional skills, drawing attention to how the band's occasional use of restraint benefited their songs as a whole.The international pop press also took notice of Brazil's premiere metal group. Top British weeklies such as the Melody Maker and NME wrote lengthy articles on the band, praising them. A Melody Maker journalist wrote: \"Sepultura is [...] a Brazilian metal band which seems to be in the verge of getting big \u2013 maybe even bigger than Slayer, their only true rival.\" Genre-specific magazines also reacted positively to the group. Germany's Thrash elected Sepultura the best band in the world, defeating major contenders Metallica and Slayer. Sepultura were also prominently featured on the biggest metal publications of the time, such as Kerrang!, Rock Hard and Metal Forces. Select gave the album a five out of five rating, referring to it as a \"a classic example of rock music as pure cathartic release\" and that \"few metal LPs released this year, if any, will triumph over Arise.\"Arise was the first Sepultura record to enter the Billboard charts, at number 145.

In 2001, it won a second certification: silver in the United Kingdom, for selling in excess of 60,000 copies.Throughout the years, Arise has been continuously praised by the music press, not only as a landmark release of Sepultura's career, but of extreme metal in general. In November 1996, Q magazine stated that \"Arise remains their thrash high water mark, sounding like an angry man throwing tools at a urinal while reading the Book of Revelations [sic].\" AllMusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia considered Arise as \"a classic of the death metal genre.\" The album also appeared in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2006), edited by writer Robert Dimery. In January 2016, 25 years since the album's release, Arise was inducted into Decibel magazine's \"Hall of Fame\", becoming the third Sepultura album to receive such award, the previous two being Roots and Beneath the Remains. This induction would make Sepultura the first band to have at least three of their albums featured in the Decibel Hall of Fame. Decibel would further go on to proclaim Arise as the greatest album of 1991. Adam McCann of Metal Digest noted: \"The band had created a monster with their previous album Beneath the Remains, but Arise was the album which broke them through to the big mainstream MTV era with tracks like 'Dead Embryonic Cells', 'Desperate Cry' and the title track which would lay the foundation for Sepultura's mid 90's success with the band poised to conquer the world.

Alternative rock subgenres such as industrial rock and industrial metal are umbrella terms predominantly used to describe the band's career in general. Ministry has been classified under many other genres, including EBM/industrial dance, techno-rock, hard rock, heavy metal, speed metal, thrash metal, and electro-industrial; their early output has been categorised as new wave, synth-pop, dance-pop, electronic dance, and dark wave.  In the April 1989 issue of Spin Magazine, an author Michael Corcoran labelled the band as \"industrial disco\"; in 1994, writer Simon Glickman used this term as well. AllMusic's Steve Huey states that, previous to Nine Inch Nails' rise to mainstream popularity, \"Ministry did more than any other band to popularize industrial dance music, injecting large doses of punky, over-the-top aggression and roaring heavy metal guitar riffs that helped their music find favor with metal and alternative audiences outside of industrial's cult fan base.\" Despite frequent descriptions of the band's music as industrial, Jourgensen disputed the use of this tag in several publications since the early 1990s, preferring instead to identify his style as \"aggro\", and, much later \"industrious\".Despite Jourgensen's dislike of touring, Ministry are noted for their live performances, featuring extended versions of songs (as evidenced on In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up) and disturbing visual imagery. MTV also recognized the band as an influential heavy metal act, highlighting the use of sampling during their heyday. Alternative Press included Ministry in their 1996 list of 100 underground inspirations of the past 20 years, stating that they merged \"metal, samples, synths, and the 100-mph sound of urban paranoia, they pretty much created industrial music as we know it.\" Jourgensen revealed in 2008 that Ministry music is mostly on drop D and standard E tuning.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Feminist scholar Susan J. Douglas criticized the show in her book The Rise of Enlightened Sexism for its continuation of a negative female body image, claiming that \"it made all too explicit the narrow physical standards to which women are expected to conform, the sad degree to which women internalize these standards, the lengths needed to get there, and the impossibility for most of us to meet the bar without, well, taking a box cutter to our faces and bodies\".Author Alice Marwick believes that this program is an example of \"body culture media\", which she describes as \"a genre of popular culture which positions work on the body as a morally correct solution to personal problems\". Marwick also suggests that cosmetic reality television encourages viewers to frame their family, financial, or social problems in bodily terms, and portrays surgical procedures as an everyday and normal solution. The Swan draws from cultural discourses of plastic surgery and self-improvement culture to frame cosmetic surgery as \"a morally appropriate means to achieving an authentic self\".

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

Nakata also incorporated his post-Shibuya-kei sound, which he had previously used for songs produced with Perfume during their time as an indies idol group, into the tracks on Game.According to Perfume, they were unaware of the techno genre prior to Game; A-Chan stated in an interview with Bomb Magazine, \"Well, we have just gotten to the point where we got to like techno music.

Goi self-financed the film as he believed that investors wouldn't fund it due to the violent script. It was shot over a week in 2008 with a small crew of only five people and a budget of $35,000. It had \"no motion picture lighting equipment, no grip equipment, no professional sound recording equipment\" to have a \"raw\" and realistic feel to it. The vast majority of the cast were adolescents, and Goi required that their parents be on the set during filming due to the graphic nature of the film.The majority of the cast were inexperienced or first-time actors. The casting was intentional, as Goi wanted the characters to be portrayed by non-recognizable actors for the film to have an \"air of reality.\" Rachel Quinn, a seventeen-year-old aspiring actress, and dancer got cast in the eponymous role of Megan Stewart. Amber Perkins, who had previously only done background work for television shows and commercials, was cast in the lead role of Amy Herman. This role marked her feature film debut. The role of the villain, Josh, was given to Australian actor Dean Waite.In the controversial photographs used in the film, Quinn is legitimately wearing the torture device. Quinn describes wearing the headgear as her worst memory of filming. She attests this is because it was physically uncomfortable and mentally traumatizing when she realized what she was portraying. As the photographs are reality-based, Quinn asked Goi to show her the inspiration behind them. Upon seeing the real-life photographs she was reenacting, she began crying on the set. Quinn spent several hours having the special effects for Megan's corpse reveal applied to her and had to wear oversized white contact lenses that essentially blinded her when shooting in the barrel. Goi was very particular about the makeup direction for Megan's corpse. He wanted the audience to be able to tell that it's her, that she looked realistically dead, and to show that she suffered tremendously in the process of dying.The basement scenes were challenging for Perkins. Quinn agreed to stay on the set, making it a more comfortable environment for her. Goi has stated that Waite's scenes were difficult to film for the actor. In particular, the rape scene of the Amy character was difficult for him, which required several reshoots. Goi recollects Waite becoming frustrated and cursing upon being told they had to refilm it.

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It also received the annual Best Role-Playing Game, Best Game Music and Best PlayStation Game awards, and nominations for Best Game Story and Best Graphics, Artistic. IGN gave the game a score of 9.7, and Cross appeared 89th in its 2008 Top 100 games list. Famitsu rated the game 36 out of 40 from four reviewers.Fan reaction was largely positive, though certain fans complained that the game was a far departure from its predecessor, Chrono Trigger; Chrono Cross broke convention by featuring more characters, fewer double and triple techs, fewer instances of time travel, and few appearances of Trigger characters and locations. Producer Hiromichi Tanaka and director Masato Kato were aware of the changes in development, specifically intending to provide an experience different from Chrono Trigger. Kato anticipated and rebuffed this discontent before the game's release, wondering what the Chrono title meant to these fans and whether his messages ever \"really got through to them\". He continued, \"Cross is undoubtedly the highest quality Chrono that we can create right now. (I won't say the 'best' Chrono, but) If you can't accept that, then I'm sorry to say this but I guess your Chrono and my Chrono have taken totally different paths. But I would like to say, thank you for falling in love with Trigger so much.\" Tanaka added, \"Of course, the fans of the original are very important, but what innovation can come about when you're bound to the past? I believe that gameplay should evolve with the hardware.\" Kato later acknowledged that he could have \"shown more empathy to the player\" by making the story less complex, and acknowledged fans who felt the game was a departure from Chrono Trigger, noting that one can still \"equally enjoy the game.\" He later reflected in 2015 that \"the bashing was terrible\" in reference to fans' push-back on featuring so many playable characters, acknowledging the complaint that recruiting all characters required several playthroughs.During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences nominated Chrono Cross for the \"Game of the Year\", \"Console Game of the Year\", and \"Console Role-Playing\" awards.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When her brother Jason Gioberti (Harry Townes) dies from a fall in the winery, his son Chase Gioberti (Robert Foxworth) arrives to claim his inherited portion of Falcon Crest. The rivalry between Angela and Chase \u2014 whom Angela sees as an interloper \u2014 sets the tone for much of the series.\nSurrounding Angela are her daughters, Julia (Abby Dalton) and Emma (Margaret Ladd), and her lazy playboy grandson, Lance Cumson (Lorenzo Lamas), who aids her in her battles against Chase. Julia is chief winemaker, though often feels oppressed by her domineering mother. Kind-natured Emma does not work in the family business, but is emotionally troubled. Julia's son Lance loves money and yearns for power, but lacks Angela's discipline and determination. Her ever-tightening grip on him eventually sends him to work for his grandfather's newspaper, The San Francisco Globe.  Aiding Angela in her quest for more power is her crooked lawyer, Phillip Erikson (Mel Ferrer), who would later become her second husband.\nChase's wife Maggie (Susan Sullivan) is a freelance writer who later works at The New Globe newspaper; their grown son Cole (William R. Moses) works at the winery with Chase, and daughter Vickie (Jamie Rose, later Dana Sparks) is just finishing school. Eventually realizing that she would not gain control over Chase's land anytime soon, Angela hopes to enlarge her empire by forcing Lance into an arranged marriage with Melissa Agretti (briefly played by Delores Cant\u00fa, later by Ana Alicia), heiress to the much-coveted Agretti Vineyards. Scheming Melissa becomes embroiled in a love triangle with Lance and Cole, even marrying Lance while pregnant with Cole's child.\nIn the second season, a true rival for Angela arrives in the form of conniving Richard Channing (David Selby), the illegitimate son of Angela's ex-husband Douglas Channing and Chase's mother. He inherits most of his father's shares in the family newspaper after Douglas dies, and uses his new wealth and power to seek retribution against both Angela and Chase for always treating him like an outcast.

Doublespeak and groupthink are both deliberate elaborations of doublethink, and the adjective \"Orwellian\" means similar to Orwell's writings, especially Nineteen Eighty-Four. The practice of ending words with \"-speak\" (such as mediaspeak) is drawn from the novel. Orwell is perpetually associated with 1984; in July 1984, an asteroid was discovered by Anton\u00edn Mrkos and named after Orwell.\nReferences to the themes, concepts and plot of Nineteen Eighty-Four have appeared frequently in other works, especially in popular music and video entertainment. An example is the worldwide hit reality television show Big Brother, in which a group of people live together in a large house, isolated from the outside world but continuously watched by television cameras.\nIn November 2012, the United States government argued before the US Supreme Court that it could continue to utilize GPS tracking of individuals without first seeking a warrant. In response, Justice Stephen Breyer questioned what that means for a democratic society by referencing Nineteen Eighty-Four, stating \"If you win this case, then there is nothing to prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the United States.

According to NASA Astronaut Michael J. Massimino, who took part in Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions STS-109 and STS-125, \"nothing was out of place, nothing was missing. There was a one-of-a-kind wirecutter we used on one of my spacewalks and sure enough they had that wirecutter in the movie.\"\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin called the visual effects \"remarkable\" and he hoped that the film would stimulate the public to find an interest in space again, after decades of diminishing investments into advancements in the field: I was so extravagantly impressed by the portrayal of the reality of zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen\u2014maybe not quite that vigorous\u2014but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft. Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said: The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly is a testament to the verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing.\n\nFormer astronaut Chris Hadfield was critical of Gravity's portrayal of astronauts, particularly its depiction of Bullock's character, saying \"When she's faced with a problem, she's panicking and has no idea what to do. George Clooney is driving around like some sort of space cowboy and he's the only one who has any idea what's going on.

A lot of it\u2014the lyric and the concept\u2014came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of Grapefruit.\" When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon told Sheff that Dick Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind \"Imagine\".\nThe concept of positive prayer ... If you can imagine a world at peace, with no denominations of religion\u2014not without religion but without this my God-is-bigger-than-your-God thing\u2014then it can be true ... the World Church called me once and asked, \"Can we use the lyrics to 'Imagine' and just change it to 'Imagine one religion'?\" That showed [me] they didn't understand it at all. It would defeat the whole purpose of the song, the whole idea.\n\nWith the combined influence of \"Cloud Piece\" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as \"a humanistic paean for the people\". Blaney wrote, \"Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential.\" Rolling Stone's David Fricke commented: \"[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class.\"Lennon stated: \"'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually The Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.\" He told NME: \"There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realise that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British socialism.\" Ono described the lyrical statement of \"Imagine\" as \"just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people.\" Rolling Stone described its lyrics as \"22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself\".An original piano musical motif, later called \"John's Piano Piece\", close to the final one was created in January 1969 during the Let It Be sessions. Lennon finished composing \"Imagine\" one morning in early 1971, on a Steinway piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park estate in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session. Described as a piano ballad performed in the soft rock genre, the song is in the key of C major. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F. Each repetition of this pattern is rounded with a short, distinctive piano riff that ascends chromatically from A to B. The 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C. The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar outro begins with F, then G, before resolving on C.

{"id": "91_1226", "question": "What genre is North?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She is sent to Sword & Cross, a reform school, when a boy is killed in a fire, which she is blamed for starting. Upon her arrival at Sword & Cross she meets Daniel and Cam, both of whom she falls for. However, she is drawn to Daniel and feels as if she knows him from somewhere but what she discovers is beyond her imagination. Luce has actually been Daniel's lover in past lives but they are both cursed and every time Luce learns of her past and gets close to being with Daniel, she dies. She is friendly and beautiful and despite falling for Cam in the beginning, she realizes her love for Daniel is very powerful and strong as she has loved him for thousands of years. Due to the fact that her parents haven't had her baptized in her current incarnation, she's no longer able to re-incarnate, hence breaking the cycle.\nDaniel Grigori \u2013 Daniel is a fallen angel\u2014a heavenly being who chose to side with neither God nor Satan at the beginning of time\u2014instead he chose love. He is also Luce's romantic interest. He feigns disinterest in Luce, trying to ignore her for her own safety, due to a curse that has spanned since the beginning of time, but eventually gives in as he can't stay away from her. He is very secretive about Luce's past but it is mainly to do with the fact that he's scared that if she learns of it too quickly, she will die. He has watched her die many times and he doesn't want to lose her again. His love for Luce is very strong and he has a rocky friendship with Cam due to Cam trying to get Luce. He is supposedly the only Fallen Angel that has yet to choose a side and apparently, if he chooses one, the balance will tip as he was supposedly very high up on the throne in heaven.\nCameron 'Cam' Briel \u2013 Cam is the antagonist of the story and Luce's other romantic interest.

She is later killed by Miss Sophia, the librarian. She is human and it is unknown if she found out about the Fallen Angels before she was killed.\nGabrielle 'Gabbe' Givens \u2013 Gabbe is a very beautiful and graceful fallen angel at the school. Luce dislikes Gabbe at first because she believes that she is dating Daniel, though Gabbe is unerringly gracious towards her and is actually one of the few people telling Daniel to stop distancing himself from Luce. She has an angelic appearance and is described as having a southern accent. She chose to side with God.\nRoland Sparks \u2013 Roland, like the others, is a fallen angel. He is Daniel's friend at the school. He, like Cam and Molly, are considered \"demons,\" fallen angels who side with Lucifer, which surprises Luce as he isn't like the other two. He is much nicer and doesn't seem at all 'evil'. He is able to smuggle anything into Sword & Cross but it is unknown how.\nMary Margaret 'Molly' Zane \u2013 Molly is another fallen angel who stayed mostly on Lucifer's side. She is very aggressive and antagonistic towards most of the students at the reform school. She tries to warn Luce away from Daniel several times. It is unknown why she wants to separate the two, but it could be due to the fact that she wants Daniel to choose Lucifer's side to tip the scales, and Luce is his distraction.\nSophia Bliss \u2013 Miss Sophia is the school's librarian. She appears to like Luce and Penn, considering them good students. She teaches the Religion and has very strong beliefs on the subject. It is later discovered that she is in fact one of the 24 Elders of Zhsmaelin, a radical heavenly sect, and has the highest position. She turns out to be evil. She kills Penn and tries to kill Luce too until Daniel, Arianne and Gabbe save her. Sophia escapes.\nRandy \u2013 Randy is an attendant at Sword & Cross. She is described as being very masculine.

She attends school, works with under privileged inner city children and lives with her two roommates.  Camille has been dating Calvin, who looks up to Camille's father and appears to be following him into medicine.  It is also understood that Camille will follow Calvin and work in some type of medical field.  Her life is considered by her and people around her to be \"normal\" and what is expected.\nThen, on her 21st birthday, she is attended to at a gas station by Billy Ryan Gallo, a mechanic during the day who turns out to be a blues musician at night.  When Camille shows up at Thelma's Bar later that evening, Billy formally introduces himself and then serenades her from the stage, much to her surprise and the amusement of her roommates.\nCamille runs into Billy again when she is out with Calvin and Billy is playing at the restaurant/casino.  Impressed with Billy's style, Calvin asks if he can buy Billy a drink and Billy joins them at their table and does not let on that he already has met Camille.  After a short conversation, Billy invites both to Thelma's Bar the following evening, but Calvin declines saying he will be out of town.\nThe next day, Camille goes alone to Thelma's and watches again as Billy takes the stage and appears to be singing only to her.  When his set is complete, Billy asks if Camille will go out and about New Orleans, a town where Camille has lived for over ten years but has never experienced.  The night sees Camille and Billy visiting clubs, riding around, laughing, dancing and being very free and comfortable with each other.  They then go to a club where she is handed a mic and spontaneously sings with a powerful voice that leaves Billy awed.\nAs the chemistry between the two heats up, Camille retreats back to her safe world and Billy, respecting her decision, asks if she would consider singing in his new band.  Camille agrees and the two begin a musical friendship.  They decide to try their act out at Camille's college's open mic night, with Billy playing guitar and Camille singing.  During the song, Camille captures the gaze of both Billy and the audience and when the song is complete, they receive a standing ovation.  Afterwards, energised by their performance, Camille stares at Billy and unexpectedly kisses him.  Billy kisses her back and questions if she knows who she wants to be with.  Camille confidently tells Billy she wants to be with him and the two kiss again.\nWith this sudden change in her life, Camille realises that she wants to continue working with the inner city children and not head off to some college to pursue a career in medicine.  Newly inspired, Camille goes to tell her parents and is surprised to find Calvin and his parents at their house, with Calvin asking her to marry him.  Overwhelmed by the pressure and her parents\u2019 happiness, Camille agrees to marry Calvin and opts out of her desired career choice.  She then meets with Billy and displays the engagement ring.  Furious with Camille for not standing up for what she wants and trying to make everyone happy but herself, Billy ends their friendship.\nTwo weeks later, at the engagement party, Camille's roommates observe Camille and find that their friend isn't herself and the whole event just \"doesn't feel right.\"  They take Camille aside and tell her that at any point she wants to leave, they will help drive her away.\nThe party is an upscale social event attended by what Calvin calls \"very important people.\"  Camille decides to serenade Calvin with a love song and everyone in the audience is amazed by her talent except for Calvin and her father, who appear to be engrossed in their own conversation.  While she sings, Camille's thoughts turn to Billy as she watches Calvin ignore her performance.  When the song ends, she announces to everyone that she is not in love with Calvin, but with a man who \"really sees her.\"  She calls off the engagement and drives away with her roommates.\nCamille goes back to her place, changes clothes and drives to find Billy at the gas station.  He is standoffish towards her and asks her to leave but she stays and shows him her bare ring finger.  Billy softens, understanding the enormity of what Camille did. He questions if this is for real.  She smiles and says yes, as the two kiss and hug and finally appear as a couple.\nThe movie ends with Camille and Billy Ryan at Thelma's Bar, this time on stage together for the first time, in front of their friends and both of their mothers, singing a Love Song.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Other reviews were not so positive. Writers for The Motion Picture Guide focused more on the negative stereotypes presented in the film. \u201cStereotypes abound in this foolish, witless western, a production misusing the fine black talent in its cast.\" The later reviews are significantly more positive. On Rotten Tomatoes, Buck and the Preacher holds a rating of 84% from 43 reviews with the consensus: \"Sidney Poitier's directorial debut may be more steady than inspired, but Harry Belafonte's live-wire performance and a Black perspective on classic Western tropes make for a refreshing addition to the genre.\"According to Poitier, the film was not an immediate success financially. The film was made on a budget of $2 million and Poitier claimed that it broke even at the box office. In fact, some alleged that the poor financial reception resulted in Poitier losing a film deal with Columbia Pictures. The initial lackluster response from audiences may have been caused by how different Buck is than typical Blaxploitation heroes such as Shaft and Coffy who live in contemporary society. The old west setting may have been too far removed from the African American audiences viewing the film. Additionally, the fact that white heroes were typically the centerpieces of American westerns may have also contributed to the foreignness of the film to its target audience.In Philip Powers 2020 book \"Sidney Poitier Black and White\" he devoted a chapter to the making of Buck and the Preacher illustrating the fact that the film was far from the financial flop some have claimed, drawing millions of Americans to buy a ticket to see it in theatres. Powers also revealed the full range of reviews after it was released. While Poitier's \"direction of Buck and the Preacher received mixed reviews... [it was] due to the fact that most film critics and reviewers in 1972 didn\u2019t have a basic understanding of what a director does, from pre-production through to the end of post-production \u2013 and unfortunately it remains as true today as it was then \u2013 the comments about Poitier\u2019s effort as a first-time director are interesting for their historical context more than their perspicacity.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was named the best adventure game of 2005 by Computer Games Magazine, GameSpy, PC Gamer, and IGN; Adventure Gamers ranked it fifty-seventh of all time. Game Informer listed Fahrenheit last among ten video game openings. Garnett Lee of 1Up.com praised the \"disturbing\" and graceful nature of the story as well as its combination with the gameplay, saying Fahrenheit had set a new standard for future aims of doing so. GameSpot's Alex Navarro highlighted the layers of context and \"heartfelt meaning\" to its use of cinematic gameplay. He enjoyed the narrative, dubbing it \"deep, captivating\", and, echoing Lee, \"disturbing\". The character development, art style, voice acting, and music also saw approval from Navarro. Raymond M. Padilla at GameSpy declared that \"it's so good that it just might save a dying genre\", regarding the plot and main characters to be well-written and the voice cast as one of the best of the year. The controls were admired for their accessibility, while the score was complimented for its \"moody and captivating\" qualities. Writing for GameZone, Ronnie Hobbs liked that the controls helped with narrative immersion, and that this created an emotional connection to the characters. Hobbs' verdict read: \"Despite its flaws, Indigo Prophecy is the definitive interactive story, and not only does it perfect the genre, it redefines it\". Charles Onyett, reviewing the game for IGN, thought it succeeded in its effort to provide a movie-like experience. The feature of multiple playable characters was believed to have worked well, the action choreography and voice acting impressed him, and the soundtrack was described as gripping.Conversely, Lee expressed dislike to the \"rather weakly implemented Metal Gear Solid-like stealth sections\" and Fahrenheit's final third, which he perceived to be rushed. Navarro agreed with Lee on the ending and sneak sequences, criticising the former for its incoherent aspects and latter because it lacked engagement, matching the reason he disapproved of the puzzles. Additionally, Navarro complained that the graphics were unsightly. Padilla disparaged the PC version for being worse than its console counterparts, calling the keyboard and mouse setup \"not fun\". He noted that button commands would sometimes distract from on-screen events. As with Navarro, Padilla termed the graphics an \"undeniable flaw\". Hobbs found it difficult to endure the \"awkward\" camera angles and \"questionable\" character movements. Onyett noticed the same control problem, opining that this could become \"difficult and tedious\". He was displeased with the effects of playing on a computer and, like Lee and Navarro, took issue with the last portions of the game. Onyett chastised the graphics' \"fuzzy\" edges and \"bland\" textures along with the \"stilted and awkward\" animations.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Pulling together in the midst of a very cold winter, the band members concentrated on making the album they themselves wanted to make.

So we were saying 'fuck it, let's just do what we think is right. Let's not try to be somebody else, let's not try to have a radio hit anymore.'\" The lone possible concession to commercial interests was the upbeat rocker \"Midnight Highway\", which Wolf described as \"sort of a semi-commercial attempt\" and \"a little too happy for my tastes.\"Much of the rest of the album is angry and defiant in tone, especially the profanity-laced \"Son of a Bitch\". Udo describes that song's lyrics as \"absolutely anti record company.\" Wolf explains why this particular song was the only one to not have its lyrics printed inside the album: \"On the initial release we thought it would be a good idea to just put 'Censored' on the liner notes for the song to avoid any controversy. Well, it turns out it caused more controversy that way with everyone wanting to know who censored it.\" An alternate version titled \"Born to Be Whipped\" was recorded with tamer lyrics.

The group had a unique sound, centered around the high lead tenor voice of Nolan Strong. Besides \"The Wind\", the Diablos were known for many songs, such as \"Adios My Desert Love\", \"Can't We Talk This Over\", \"Mambo of Love\", \"If I\", \"Harriet\", \"I Am With You\", \"Goodbye Matilda\", \"I Wanna Know\", \"Beside You\", \"Mind Over Matter\", and \"The Way You Dog Me Around\".The group formed at Central High School in Detroit around 1950 and originally consisted of Strong (lead tenor), Juan Gutierrez (tenor), Willie Hunter (baritone), Quentin Eubanks (bass), and Bob \"Chico\" Edwards (guitar). The Diablos name is said to have come from a book, El Ni\u00f1o Diablo (The Devil Child), that Strong was reading for a high-school book report. In late 1953, the Diablos went into Detroit's Fortune Record Studios to cut some demo sides, with the hopes of furthering their career. Their hopes were realized even more quickly than they expected. Those demos impressed Jack and Devora Brown, owners of Fortune, who immediately signed the group to record for their label. Their first recording for Fortune was the Devora Brown-penned \"Adios My Desert Love\", a cha-cha influenced tune.But it was their second Fortune record that established the group as R&B legends. Written by the group members, \"The Wind\" had a haunting sound, with the group chanting \"blow wind\" in harmony behind Strong's delicate tenor lead, and smooth and sexy talking bridge. Following the release of \"The Wind\", Guitierrez and Eubanks left the group, to be replaced by Nolan's brother Jimmy on tenor and George Scott on bass. Over the next two years this configuration of Diablos turned out several records, including \"Route 16\", \"Do You Remember What You Did\", \"Daddy Rockin' Strong\", \"The Way You Dog Me Around\", \"You Are\", and \"A Teardrop From Heaven\".By late 1956, more changes occurred.

Although not quite 16 at the time, Jay Johnson was already a veteran singer, having sung bass with Williams' \"new\" group on \"Bacon Fat\", \"Just Because of a Kiss\", \"Mean Jean\", and \"Bobby Jean\". (Williams' \"new\" group consisted of Gino Parks, Bobby Calhoun, Steve Gaston, and Johnson.)Strong was impressed and the Diablos had their new bassman. Jay Johnson's first session with the Diablos was on \"Can't We Talk It Over\" and \"Mambo of Love\", recorded in late 1956 and released in 1957. By the time the first Fortune of Hits album came out, Jay Johnson had already replaced Scott with the group. Unfortunately, the picture on the album cover did not reflect this change, and shows the group with Scott instead of Johnson. This oversight may be a factor in many believing that Jay Johnson did not join the group until several years later. In fact, Johnson is heard on bass on more Diablos recordings than either Eubanks or Scott. Among these are: \"Beside You\", \"Mind Over Matter\", \"Everything They Said Came True\", \"Welcome Baby to My Heart\", \"I Wanna Know\", \"If I Could Be With You\", \"Since You're Gone\", \"Harriet\", \"Harriette It's You\", \"I Am With You\", \"Are You Making a Fool Out of Me\", \"You're My Happiness\", \"Village of Love\", \"For Old Times Sake\", \"My Heart Will Always Belong to You\", and \"Come Home Little Girl\". On \"Village of Love\", Johnson also provided the bass on the original Fortune version by Nathaniel Mayer & the Fabulous Twilights.Also in late 1956, about the time Jay Johnson joined the group, Strong departed for a two-year stint in the army. While Nolan was in the service, the Diablos released one single without him, \"Harriet\", backed with \"Come Home Little Girl\", featuring Hunter on lead. Without Strong, the Diablos' magic seemed to be missing and the record received little fanfare. After Strong returned from the service, the group recorded \"Harriette It's You\", but there were many changes to come. Fortune was focusing more of their attention on Strong, and not the Diablos group. In 1954, records showed \"The Diablos Featuring Nolan Strong\". Then billing changed to \"Nolan Strong & the Diablos\", and by 1962, when \"Mind Over Matter\" was climbing the charts, the label just read \"Nolan Strong\", although the Diablos were on the record, as prominent as ever. This lack of recognition along with financial inequities (lack of royalties and unequal pay to the group members versus Strong), inevitably lead to the group's demise.\nJust as Strong had been influenced by Clyde McPhatter, he was influential to Smokey Robinson, who was not the only one at Motown to have an appreciation for Nolan Strong & the Diablos. Berry Gordy had wanted to bring the Diablos into his fast-growing Motown complex. The deal never was finalised.\nThe group disbanded by 1964, with a few more record releases and reissues the following years.\nJimmy Strong died on January 29, 1970, at age 34. Edwards died March 17, 2001, at age 63. All other members, with the exception of Johnson, are also deceased.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the sequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film Alien, and the second film in the Alien franchise. Set in the far future, it stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship. When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first saw the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn are featured in supporting roles.\nDespite the success of Alien, its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from 20th Century Fox, and repeated management changes. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for Aliens in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for The Terminator (1984) and Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5 million budget, Aliens began principal photography in September 1985 and concluded in January 1986. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios. The difficult shoot affected the composer, James Horner, who was given little time to record the music.\nAliens was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver's performance garnered consistent praise along with those of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein. The film received several awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Weaver at a time when the science-fiction genre was generally overlooked. It earned $131.1\u2013183.3 million during its theatrical run, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1986 worldwide.\nAliens is now considered among the greatest films of the 1980s, and among the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made, arguably equal to or better than Alien. It is credited with expanding the franchise's scope with additions to the series' backstory and factions such as the Colonial Marines. It inspired a variety of merchandise, including video games, comic books and toys.

A lot of it\u2014the lyric and the concept\u2014came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of Grapefruit.\" When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy magazine, Lennon told Sheff that Dick Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind \"Imagine\".\nThe concept of positive prayer ... If you can imagine a world at peace, with no denominations of religion\u2014not without religion but without this my God-is-bigger-than-your-God thing\u2014then it can be true ... the World Church called me once and asked, \"Can we use the lyrics to 'Imagine' and just change it to 'Imagine one religion'?\" That showed [me] they didn't understand it at all. It would defeat the whole purpose of the song, the whole idea.\n\nWith the combined influence of \"Cloud Piece\" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as \"a humanistic paean for the people\". Blaney wrote, \"Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential.\" Rolling Stone's David Fricke commented: \"[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class.\"Lennon stated: \"'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually The Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement.\" He told NME: \"There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realise that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British socialism.\" Ono described the lyrical statement of \"Imagine\" as \"just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people.\" Rolling Stone described its lyrics as \"22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself\".An original piano musical motif, later called \"John's Piano Piece\", close to the final one was created in January 1969 during the Let It Be sessions. Lennon finished composing \"Imagine\" one morning in early 1971, on a Steinway piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park estate in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session. Described as a piano ballad performed in the soft rock genre, the song is in the key of C major. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F. Each repetition of this pattern is rounded with a short, distinctive piano riff that ascends chromatically from A to B. The 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C. The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar outro begins with F, then G, before resolving on C.

Penderecki was interested in freedom from conventional aspects of music\u2014namely meter, rhythm, harmony, melody, and form. Important works from this period, particularly Anaklasis (1959\u201360), Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1960), and Fluorescences (1961\u201362), were experimental compositions characterized by blocks of sound of varying dynamics, extended techniques on acoustic instruments, and tone clusters.By the early 1970s, however, Penderecki began to move away from the avant-garde movement, claiming in an interview in 2000, \"we pushed music so far in the sixties that even for myself, for me, I closed the door behind me, because there was no way to do anything more than I have done... I decided that there is no way that I can move on.\" Acknowledging that he had pushed the limits, Penderecki began to rediscover the neo-Romantics while working as a conductor in the 1970s. He specifies, \"The kind of music I was conducting influenced my own music very much... During this time I began to have my Romantic ideas, partly because I was conducting Bruckner, Sibelius, and Tchaikovsky.\" At this point in his career, Penderecki's music begins to feature melodic expression, lyricism, and dramatic character.Penderecki felt that the early 1970s represented a major shift in his compositional style. Important to this shift was the composer's renewed emphasis on \"tradition.\" Penderecki attributed the importance of tradition to Artur Malawski, his composition teacher from 1954\u201357, who balanced contemporary techniques with more conventional musical forms. Penderecki echoed Malawski's compositional philosophy: \"The general principles at the root of a work's musical style... the integrity of a musical experience embodied in the notes the composer is setting down on paper, never change. The idea of good music means today exactly what it meant always.\" In 1973, he also stated he was in search of a new direction, one which resolved to \"gain inspiration from the past and look back on my heritage.\" For Penderecki, tradition also served as an \"opportunity to [overcome the] dissonance between the artist and the audience.\"The symphony particularly became an essential genre for Penderecki starting in the early 1970s, stating that his \"third style period\" began with his first symphony. From the 1970s on, Penderecki described the importance of the symphony in various ways, for instance explaining that his second symphony of 1980 \"referred fully to the late-nineteenth century symphonic tradition...\" He also stated in 2000, \"...It's very clear that I'm trying to continue this tradition, this Romantic tradition\" when describing his symphonic compositions. A passage from his collected essays Labyrinth of Time confirms this sentiment: \"I would like to continue the music that was cast at the beginning of the [twentieth] century: the tradition of writing symphonies.\" More importantly, however, Penderecki saw the genre as a kind of synthesis of traditional and contemporary styles, calling the symphony \"that musical ark which would make it possible to convey to coming generations what is best in our twentieth-century tradition of the composing of sounds.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Born in Covington, Tennessee, he released a record on Sun Records in 1956, just after Elvis Presley.\nYelvington began performing in local venues at the age of 14, having learned to sing and play guitar as a boy. His voice was a baritone, somewhat comparable to Ernest Tubb (one of Yelvington's major influences). He continued with mostly local engagements into his 20s, and was passed over for military service in World War II because of his health. In the late 1940s, he began playing with Reece Fleming's band, The Tennesseans, at the Memphis Gem Theater. This group disbanded in 1952, and several of its members, including Yelvington, picked up with local troupe the Star Rhythm Boys. They performed daily on local radio and had a steady and popular gig at the Clover Club north of Covington, but family attachments prevented most of the players from traveling or touring with the group. Yelvington began playing side gigs in Memphis whenever he wasn't playing with the Star Rhythm Boys.\nYelvington and guitarist Gordon Mashburn first heard word of Sam Phillips's Sun Records in 1953, and arranged a meeting. Philips was initially unimpressed with Yelvington and the Star Rhythm Boys, because he was not interested in recording straight-ahead country music; however, he thought the band had potential, and had them audition a large number of songs. The first cut he recorded with them was a blues number written by Stick McGhee called \"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\". The result was a record with blues roots and a blues feel but a steel guitar that sounded unmistakably country. This recording was issued on Sun Records immediately after Elvis Presley's \"That's All Right Mama\". Phillips did not give Yelvington promotional backing, and so he and the band self-marketed the record to local stations, to little avail. The record was picked up neither by blues nor by country radio stations, each of which seemed to think it sounded too much like the other.\n\"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" was one out of only two records Yelvington cut for Sun. In 1955 he released a single, \"Yakety Yak\" (not the same tune as \"Yakety Yak\" by The Coasters), on competitor Meteor Records. The record was released under the name Mac Sales and the Esquire Trio so as to avoid legal action by Phillips, to whom he was still contractually obliged. In 1956, Yelvington recorded again with Sun, releasing the rockabilly track \"Rockin' With My Baby\".\nYelvington, now in his late thirties, was not excited about the rockabilly sound, and by 1958 he and his band members parted ways. Yelvington struck out on his own as a solo artist, but had no luck and eventually quit music, concentrating on raising his family of five children. He was essentially forgotten until the 1980s, when popular music historians began digging into the Sun back catalogue; fans and concert promoters attempted to bring him out of retirement. His career saw a resurgence in Memphis as a rockabilly revivalist, and in 1997, he released his first full-length album at the age of 79. By the time of his death in 2001, in Memphis, he was regarded as an elder statesman of country music and rockabilly.\nA live show in the Netherlands during his first European tour in 1988 was taped and released on Collector Records (CLCD 4403) in 1991. In 2006, Bear Family Records reissued his Sun Records recordings on compact disc.\nOn February 22, 2018, the song \"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" b/w \"Just Rolling Along\" by Malcolm Yelvington and the Star Rhythm Boys was accepted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.", "hasanswer": true}]}

They judge the film is \"even more eccentric\" than director Seijun Suzuki's Branded to Kill (1967), which Atsushi Yamatoya helped write. According to the Weissers, despite several very erotic scenes, because the film emphasizes a hard-boiled mystery plot rather than sexploitation, it is not technically a pink film.Jasper Sharp writes that the film shows how versatile the pink film genre could sometimes be, calling it \"probably the most idiosyncratic work the genre has ever produced\", and noting that it out-does Suzuki's Branded to Kill in terms of \"dreamlike illogicality\". Of the plot, Sharp writes that, in spite of its disjointed nature, \"as with Suzuki's film, there is clearly some method behind the onscreen madness\". Sharp remarks that a comparison with Suzuki's better-known film is inevitable. Besides the sharing of a main character's name (\"Joe\") with the star of Suzuki's film (Joe Shishido), Sharp lists some similarities between the films: \"the striking high-contrast monochrome cinematography; the quirky, hard-boiled performances; the hypnotic disjunction between sound and image; the use of montage to construct a surreal, alien-looking landscape that bears little resemblance to any recognisable vision of Japan; and the atonal jazz soundtrack, full of chaotic fanfares that blare out to punctuate the action.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Astaire had already created an early dream dance on film with \"I Used To Be Color Blind\" in Carefree (1938), and had worked with Minnelli on a dream ballet insert for the \"Limehouse Blues\" number from Ziegfeld Follies (1945).

He follows the song with a very brief solo dance routine around the harp.\n\"Coffee Time\": A jazzy and exuberant dance routine for Astaire, Bremer, and chorus, blending complex repeated syncopated rhythms (inspired by Loring's idea of setting a five-count dance phrase against a four-count musical phrase) in a visually elaborate setting incorporating a wavy black and white dance floor (designed by Irene Sharaff) and chorus dancers dressed in brightly colored costumes.

At its first showing the film received abundant praise and \"some of the best responses of the festival,\" but Xan Brooks of The Guardian, who gave it a positive review, said it \"can't win, won't win\" Cannes's top prize. Brooks explained that \"[I]t's too self-consciously retro, too much a series of cool, blank surfaces as opposed to a rounded, textured drama,\" but said that it was his \"guilty pleasure\" of the 2011 competition, labeling it an enjoyable affair. He said,\n\nOver the past 10 days we've witnessed great art and potent social commentary; the birth of the cosmos and the end of the world. Turns out what we really wanted all along was a scene in which a man gets his head stomped in a lift. They welcome it in like a long-lost relation.\nThe film was greeted with hoots and howls of joy from the media, with viewers cheering on some of the scenes featuring extreme violence. Drive received a 15-minute standing ovation from the crowd. The festival awarded Refn best director for Drive.Drive was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival (LAFF) on June 20 at its gala screenings program. It was among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos, from more than 30 countries, to be shown during the festival.

The film was also screened during FilmDistrict's studio panel presentation at the San Diego Comic-Con function. A secret screening for Drive was held at London's Empire Big Screen during the middle of August.

The Lion is/was played by an audience member, while a member of the cast chosen before production acted as an MC that would read the directions for the Lion to follow.  Before the play starts, the cast spends time talking and interacting with the audience at the Courtroom Theatre, and some cast members hand out coloured juggling balls, to be used to pick the Lion from the audience.  An audience member is called upon at the start of the play to choose a colour (red, green, blue or yellow), and the person holding that colour ball is then chosen as the lion.  During the 2nd act (the march to Rome) the remaining balls could be thrown down onto the \"stage\" where each ball would call out a different response.  For instance, if the yellow ball was the Lion, the green ball might pull a story, while the blue or red ball would call for what a cast member is thinking of at that particular time.

Unbeknownst to the conductor, who assumes Claudin can support himself, the musician has used all his money to help anonymously fund voice lessons for Christine Dubois, a young soprano to whom he is devoted. Meanwhile, Christine is pressured by Inspector Raoul Dubert to quit the Opera and marry him. But famed opera baritone Anatole Garron hopes to win Christine's heart despite this. Christine considers them both good friends but doesn't openly express if she loves them.\nIn a desperate attempt to earn money, Claudin submits a piano concerto he has written for publication. After weeks of not hearing any response about his concerto, he becomes worried and returns to the publisher, Maurice Pleyel, to ask about it. Pleyel rudely tells him to leave. Claudin hears his concerto being played in the office and is convinced that Pleyel is trying to steal it; unbeknownst to him, a visiting Franz Liszt had been playing and endorsing the concerto. Enraged, Claudin strangles Pleyel. Georgette, the publisher's assistant, throws etching acid in Claudin\u2019s face, horribly scarring him forever. Now wanted for murder, Claudin flees into the sewers of the Opera and covers his disfigurement with a prop mask stolen from the Opera house, thus becoming the Phantom.\nDuring a performance of the opera Amour et Gloire, The Phantom drugs a glass of red wine which prima donna Mme. Biancarolli drinks, knocking her unconscious and asleep. The director puts Christine in her place, and she dazzles the audience with her singing. Biancarolli, who suspects that Garron and Christine are responsible for drugging her, orders Raoul to arrest them, but he says he cannot because there is no evidence. Biancarolli says she will forget the affair only if Christine is replaced as understudy and her performance is not mentioned in the papers. The following night, the Phantom kills Biancarolli and her maid, and the opera is subsequently closed.\nAfter some time, the opera's owners receive a note demanding that Christine replace Biancarolli. To catch the Phantom, Raoul comes up with a plan: not let Christine sing during a performance of the (fictional) Russian opera Le prince masqu\u00e9 du Caucase (\"The Masked Prince of the Caucasus\") to lure the Phantom out into the open. Garron plans to have Liszt play Claudin\u2019s concerto after the performance, but the Phantom strangles one of Raoul's men and heads to the auditorium's domed ceiling. He then brings down the large chandelier on the audience, causing chaos. As the audience and the crew flee, The Phantom takes Christine down underground. He tells Christine that he loves her and she will now sing all she wants, but only for him.\nRaoul, Anatole, and the police begin pursuing them underground. Just as the Phantom and Christine arrive in his lair, they hear Liszt and the orchestra playing Claudin's concerto. The Phantom plays along with the melody  on his piano orchestra. Christine watches, realizing the concerto was written around the melody of a lullaby she has known since childhood. Raoul and Anatole hear the Phantom playing and follow the sound. Overjoyed, the Phantom urges Christine to sing, which she does. While the Phantom is distracted by the music, Christine sneaks up and pulls off his mask, revealing his disfigured face. At that same moment, Raoul and Anatole break-in. Claudin grabs a sword to fight them with. Raoul fires his gun at Claudin, but Anatole knocks Raoul's arm, and the shot hits the ceiling, causing a cave-in. Anatole and Raoul escape with Christine, while Claudin is seemingly crushed to death by the falling rocks.\nLater, Anatole and Raoul demand that Christine choose one of them.

It is the first entry in the Mother series. It is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but is set in the late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to put an end to the paranormal phenomena that recently spiraled the country into disarray. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.\nWriter and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mother's concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. A North American version of the game was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released globally as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015 and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022.\nMother was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies and received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score from Famitsu magazine. Mother was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, but many considered its sequel Mother 2: G\u012bgu no Gyakush\u016b (known outside as EarthBound) to be similar and a better overall implementation of Mother's gameplay ideas, with the game's high difficulty level polarizing critics, along with balance issues. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com wrote that Mother importantly generated interest in video game emulation and the historical preservation of unreleased games. The game was re-released in Japan on the single-cartridge compilation Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance in 2003.", "hasanswer": false}]}

To develop the comic, photographs had to be processed manually on a photomechanical tone and then transferred to paper, being fully colorized in the late 1980s.Jetpac was followed by two sequels: Lunar Jetman (1983) and Solar Jetman (1990). The latter was not released for the ZX Spectrum, and a version for the Commodore 64 was finished but never released following disappointing sales of the original NES version.Since its release, Jetpac has been included in a number of other games developed by Rare.

The game was retained in the April 2015 Virtual Console re-release of Donkey Kong 64 on the Wii U, despite the property being technically owned by Microsoft.

She meets with him and asks him for information about his mother, but learns to her surprise that William does not know his mother's history or even that she was Jewish, believing only that she had been a French farm girl. Listening in amazement, William rejects the story and dismisses Julia. Later, everything is confirmed to William by his dying father, Richard, including Sarah's suicide. He gives William Sarah's journals and notes, telling him Sarah immediately had William baptized right after his birth, fearing that \"being Jewish\" was a threat to him and explaining that \"...we're all a product of our history.\" The key to the cupboard is among the items handed to him by his father.\nJulia, having given up hope of having another child after years of unsuccessful attempts to conceive, discovers she's pregnant. Her husband, though in the midst of an affair, selfishly leaves their life with their 12-year-old daughter, Zoe, as he does not want to have another child at this point in life.

A 32X version was also reportedly under development by Sega, but was never released. Ports of the arcade game were released for Nintendo 3DS on March 12, 2015, and Nintendo Switch on January 9, 2019.Former Sega arcade director Akira Nagai has credited Out Run and similar games for Sega's arcade success in the 1980s. According to Nagai, \"Out Run, in particular, was really amazing for its time... Suzuki went on to make After Burner and a number of other games, but Out Run is still talked about with a special kind of wonder. With the taikan games, Sega's arcade business, which had been Sega's lowest performer in sales, gradually started to rise... For me personally, Hang-On and Out Run are my most memorable titles. They helped lift the arcade industry out of its slump, and created entirely new genres\". The game's title has been adopted as a name for the synthwave music genre, which is also known as \"outrun\" music, inspired by the game's soundtrack which is selectable in-game as well as the game's 1980s aesthetic. French musician Kavinsky named his debut album OutRun (2013) after the game.The game has been listed among the best games of all time by Next Generation, Retro Gamer, Stuff, Time, G4, Killer List Of Videogames, Yahoo!, and NowGamer. In 2017, GamesRadar+ ranked the game 31st on their \"Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time\". Writing in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Joao Diniz Sanches praised Out Run's \"unforgettable design and expertly tuned game balance\", describing the game as \"the consummate exhibit in an oversubscribed genre\" and \"one of the purest and most joyous experiences in video gaming\". In 2015, Out Run appeared at 4th place on IGN's list of The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever, behind Pole Position, Gran Turismo and Virtua Racing. According to Luke Reilly, traces of Out Run DNA can be found in series like Test Drive, Need for Speed, Project Gotham Racing and Burnout as well as modern racers like the Forza Horizon games and DriveClub. According to Jacopo Prisco of Wired UK, the influence of Out Run \"is still being felt on consoles, in music, and in movies\". Along with its influence on a wide range of racing games from Need for Speed and Gran Turismo to Project Gotham Racing and Forza Horizon, the game's selectable radio music has become commonplace in video games such as Grand Theft Auto series as well as the choice to drive through alternate paths in racing games.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Linnaeus's hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey.\nLinnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on 12 May 1732, just before he turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near G\u00e4vle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Ume\u00e5, Lule\u00e5 and Tornio. He returned from his six-month-long, over 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica. However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system.In Flora Lapponica Linnaeus's ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora. The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with Flora Lapponica as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described Flora Lapponica as \"the most classic and delightful\" of Linnaeus's works.It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was travelling, Linnaeus remarked: \"If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.\"In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna.

They probably all contributed as a team to some of the larger commissions later attributed to Francesco. His sister Maria Cecilia married the pre-eminent Veneto-European painter of his epoch, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.\nIn 1735, Guardi moved to the workshop of Michele Marieschi, where he remained until 1743. His first certain works are from 1738, for a parish at Vigo d'Anuania, in Trentino. In this period he worked alongside his older brother, Gian Antonio. The first work signed by Francesco is a Saint Adoring the Eucharist (c. 1739).\n\nHis works in this period included both landscapes and figure compositions. His early vedute show influence both from Canaletto and Luca Carlevarijs. On 15 February 1757, he married Maria Mattea Pagani, the daughter of painter Matteo Pagani. In 1760 his brother Gian Antonio died and his first son, Vincenzo, was born. His second son, Giacomo, was born in 1764.\nIn 1763 he worked in Murano, in the church of San Pietro Martire, finishing a Miracle of a Dominican Saint clearly influenced by Alessandro Magnasco in its quasi-expressionistic style.\nFrancesco Guardi's most important later works include the Doge's Feasts, a series of twelve canvases celebrating the ceremonies held in 1763 for the election of Doge Alvise IV Mocenigo. In his later years, Canaletto's influence on his art diminished, as shown by the Piazzetta in the Ca' d'Oro of Venice. In circa 1778, he painted the severe Holy Trinity Appearing to Sts. Peter and Paul in the parish church of Roncegno.\n\nIn 1782 Guardi was commissioned by the Venetian government six canvases to celebrate the visit of the Russian Grand Dukes to the city, of which only two remain, and two others for that of Pope Pius VI.

The first parody was the 1964 film Carry On Spying, which shows the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included James Bind (Charles Hawtry) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor). One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine, was released in 1965. The eponymous hero is a rough-edged, petty crook turned spy, and was what academic Jeremy Packer called an \"anti-Bond\", or what Christoph Lindner calls \"the thinking man's Bond\". The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry. The four \"Matt Helm\" films starring Dean Martin (released between 1966 and 1969), the \"Flint\" series starring James Coburn (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1969), while The Man from U.N.C.L.E. also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the Austin Powers series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the Johnny English trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.\n\nFollowing the release of the film Dr. No in 1962, the line \"Bond ... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\". In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by Empire and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by Premiere. In 1965, Time magazine observed \"James Bond has developed into the biggest mass-cult hero of the decade\".\nThe 25 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 27 Bond films have grossed over $7.04 billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\".Television also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include I Spy, and Get Smart.Considered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort. From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond\u2013style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady. Bond has been commemorated numerous times on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their March 2020 series to mark the 25th Bond film release.Throughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. \"Bondmania\", a term deriving from the adjacent \"Beatlemania\" and initiated in 1964 following the enormous success of Goldfinger, described the clamour for Bond films and their related products, from soundtrack LPs to children's toys, board games, alarm clocks playing the Bond theme, and 007-branded shirts. In 2018, a James Bond museum opened atop the Austrian Alps. The futuristic museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in S\u00f6lden at 10,000 ft (3,048 m) above sea level.The real MI6 has an ambiguous relationship with Bond. The films may attract job applicants who may be unsuited for espionage, while dissuading more-qualified candidates. While serving as Chief of SIS, Alex Younger said that were Bond to apply for a MI6 job \"he would have to change his ways\". Younger said, however, that the franchise had \"created a powerful brand for MI6 ... Many of our counterparts envy the sheer global recognition of our acronym\", and that being depicted to global audiences as a \"ubiquitous intelligence presence\" was \"quite a force multiplier\". The Russian Federal Security Service so envied Bond that it created an annual award for fictional depictions of Russian spies.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Russian symphonies are not German symphonies, he maintains, and the fact they may function along different parameters than their German counterparts does not make them any less valid on a musical or experiential level. Critics and musicologists agree universally that Tchaikovsky was not able to manipulate sonata form along the lines of a Mozart or Beethoven. This was a fact the composer himself bemoaned on more than one occasion. Though he received a Western European\u2013style musical education, he still faced a native set of musical rules and traditions that did not conform at all to Western ones. Rather than ignore his native music and look Westward as his teacher Anton Rubinstein had done or forgo the West as much as possible as The Five did, he chose to face the problem from both sides head\u2013on.\nThe truth is, Wood writes, despite the composer's occasional self-indictments, Tchaikovsky did master \"form\" as he actually understood and could manage it from a compositional level. Warrack calls Tchaikovsky's solution to large-scale composition \"a compromise with sonata form.\" Wood maintains that what the composer called his \"mountains of padding\" were simply inseparable from his initial conceptions\u2014from his process of starting with an extra-musical program and from there deducing musical motives of widely divergent moods and character to be somehow worked into one movement. The alternative method was allowing his second theme to arise after and at the same time from the first, may have never occurred to him. However, it may have been equally likely that Tchaikovsky's compositional method never occurred to Mozart.While Tchaikovsky may have been incapable of writing absolute music, his real challenge was that while he was conscious of his formal shortcomings and continued striving for an unreached perfection, his actual ideal never really changed. Because the ideal never changed, the problems to which Tchaikovsky addressed himself never really changed, either. In this sense, it could be argued that he never really grew or matured. Nevertheless, Tchaikovsky discovered a method by which to circumvent what he perceived as formal shortcomings and put his emotional life to work in large-scale abstract structures.", "hasanswer": false}]}

For two reasons, Kon thought that the original could not be adapted into a movie. One reason was that the novel Paprika was too voluminous to fit into a single film, and the other reason was that over ten years had already passed since the novel was published, and many creators had already embodied the ideas inspired by Paprika in various media, not just in films. Therefore, Kon decided to first make the original into a simple form, and then incorporate ideas from the original as well as from Tsutsui's other works into the frame. Kon believed that the charm of the original lay in the dream scenes, and that the film would only be complete if the dream world was portrayed in rich detail with expressions that he believed only visual images could provide. The descriptions of dreams in the novel were supplemented by explanations in the text. However, in the case of visual works, which show the images of dreams flowing one after another, explanation would hinder the flow.In order to create a glamorous image for the entire film, and still devote enough time to portraying the dream scenes without introducing the characters, Kon, in contrast to the previous film, used voice actors who were well known for their voice acting and whom he deemed to fit the characters' image.The budget was approximately 300 million yen, and the production took about two and a half years from planning to completion.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In terms of gameplay, IGN critic Ryan Caffrey found it just as good as the previous Peggle games but was a bit dismayed with the levels not having as many \"crazy gimmicks and wild themes\". In a favorable review, Game Revolution found Peggle 2 the wrong type of game for its console-launch price: \"Replaying boards over and over again for the perfect score or binging through the entire campaign of puzzles in one sitting can leave you feeling numb to PopCap\u2019s incessant celebration.\" Eurogamer's Christian Donlan and GameZone's Mike Splechta noted frame-rate issues, Splechta also panning the game's Kinect mode was criticized by for being \"rather pointless\".The board challenges and trial levels were praised for their difficulty and adding replay value and variety to Peggle 2. Game Revolution stated it made the game \"an excellent chaser for Xbox One\u2019s more hardcore experiences\", and Edge found the trial levels \"a delightful change of pace: you know there\u2019s a solution, that what it tells you to do is possible, and as such they require a lot more thought than the fire-and-forget nature of traditional Peggle\". The multiplayer mode was well-received but also faulted by reviewers for its sparsity, lagging issues, and (most commonly) not allowing local play. Caffrey disliked the removal of the two-player Duel mode of the previous games, and Reiner criticized the multiplayer mode for occasionally dropping the player in the middle of online rounds where he's \"forced to play the majority of the game in a losing position until a new one starts\". The automatic saving of clips of shots in the Xbox One was heavily criticized for overdriving the GameDVR system. Caffrey described the PlayStation 4 port as better than the Xbox One version for having less overscan issues and a manual clip-saving feature, where the automatic saving of clips in the Xbox One version overdrove the GameDVR system; in addition, he appreciated the game's use of the DualShock 4's light bar for being \"very much in the spirit of Peggle's joyous attitude.\"The addition of presence and animation to the masters was praised by several critics. Mark Walton of GameSpot called their reactions \"absolutely hilarious\", Destructoid's Chris Carter \"a really simple thing that made me smile constantly, and made each Master more endearing\". Caffrey cheerfully commented on the increased screen time and \"extra personality\" of the new masters, placing Jeffrey and Gnorman's power-ups as highlight; however, he was disappointed with the little number of playable masters and the rejection of characters from previous games. Joystiq also criticized the little number of masters for not keeping the gameplay \"fresh\", arguing the higher amount of masters in prior Peggle games \"meant that you were always adapting to new tricks and strategies, a feeling that only expanded further as you replayed old levels with new masters\". While Digital Spy considered the new power-ups \"much more powerful and visually striking\", Donlan found them disheartening as \"they don't make you rethink the game in\", but claimed Berg to be an exception: \"His animation is glorious [...] and with deep freeze you get a fleeting glimpse of the game Peggle 2 could have been if the designers had been a little more ambitious.\" Jeffrey was called a favorite master by Carter for being a take on the film The Big Lebowski (1998).Walton, in addition to the gameplay, was also enthusiastic towards the presentation, including its music and \"colorful and imaginative backdrops\"; he noted that it was \"brilliantly designed to stimulate the senses, and give you a real feeling of accomplishment, even for the smallest of tasks\", which made Peggle 2 as \"fun and as accessible as humanly possible.\" Carter called the visuals \"vibrant, crisp, and full of character\", noting its varied and detailed backgrounds and calling the soundtrack \"easily PopCap's best work by far\". Official Xbox Magazine UK was enthusiastic towards the audio, particularly its \"twisted classical\" fever themes of the master and the goat sounds of Jeff's levels. Splechta also applauded the visuals and sound but found them \"disappointing\" for a next-generation console game, reasoning that they were more suitable in a mobile game. Donlan made several nitpicks in commenting on the presentation; he found the \"colourful cartoon fantasy\" background artworks too simple in comparison to the strange \"sort of rustic smokiness\" that added \"richness\" to levels of its predecessors, was slightly turned off by levels of most masters not playing \"Ode to Joy\" during a fever, and claimed Bjorn looked like \"a leering idiot.\"During the 17th Annual D.I.C.E.

Bergman, for his part, told William Wolf, of New York, that after being taken on a tour of the Garment District, he was taken by the chaotic nature of the environment, and imagined how a college professor like himself (Bergman holds a PhD in American history) would have managed if forced into such hectic surroundings, and the plot developed from the juxtaposition of a crazed world with an ordered personality.So Fine also received positive pre-release attention due to the main plot device, the see-through buttocks of the jeans (which, in the film, become a mass hysteria and take the nation by storm). Costume designer Santo Loquasto said he'd intentionally constructed the design as a sendup of those coming out of \u201cFashion Avenue,\u201d the stretch of Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, which runs through the traditional Garment District. In one scene, an elaborate commercial for the jeans, choreographed by Grover Dale, plays out. Loquasto had designed a custom set, wildly illuminated and featuring dozens of models in the see-through jeans, arching towards the camera. Loquasto amusedly observed that despite he and the filmmakers intentionally aiming to be outrageous, he was amazed to regularly return from the set and find television commercials he felt were even more so.Wolf reporting in a piece published several months before So Fine\u2019s release, visited the Filmways Studio and found the pairing of Richard Kiel and Mariangela Melato entertaining in a scene he viewed. Wolf's article highly praised Bergman, considering him (along with Albert Brooks, another active comedy filmmaker of the 1980s) one of the few positive contributors to the comedy genre in film.Bergman's previous writing credits were for Blazing Saddles (which Bergman initially sold to Warner Bros. as Tex X, a play on Malcolm X) and The In-Laws, neither of which Bergman had felt positively about, yet both of which were commercial and critical successes. In a New York interview, Bergman said that after his experiences with Blazing Saddles and The In-Laws, he was sure that So Fine was going to be a big hit, so he decided that he would direct the film, in order to be certain that what he thought of as a surefire screenplay would transition to the big screen with his vision intact. Pre-screenings were positive, but two weeks after the film's release (on September 25, 1981), Bergman was disappointed to see the film gone from the theaters. Bergman attributed the failure to the high-brow styling of his comedy being mismatched with its low-brow trappings.\nO'Neal was cast at the suggestion of Warner Bros. His fee was a reported $2 million. Berman later said, \"He\u2019s a great physical comedian. First of all, Warner Brothers wasn\u2019t going to let me do the picture unless we had a major star in it.

He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds (Museum Bredius, The Hague).  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format.\n\nThe influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time.\nThe traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings.\nWhile his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer.Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples. This series of engravings had an important influence on the Dutch animal painter Paulus Potter, in particular the way in which van Laer was able to place figures, animals, buildings and trees in a coherent pictorial space.  A second set of 6 plates was entitled Horses and depicts the bleak lot of horses belonging to poor peasants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Pitchfork editors ranked \"Vogue\" as the 115th best song of the 1990s, praising it for how unapologetically it celebrated queer life at the height of the AIDS epidemic. Rolling Stone listed the track as one of the \"500 Best Songs of All Time\" at number 139, while they named it the 11th greatest dance song of all time. The song was placed by Billboard on the number four spot on its list of \"60 Top LGBTQ Anthems of All Time\", and as part of the 65th anniversary of Billboard Hot 100, the magazine's staff ranked \"Vogue\" as the 186th best pop song that appeared on the chart. Slant Magazine ranked it at number 10 on their \"Best Singles of the '90s\" list, and number three in the list of the 100 Greatest Dance Songs. Music critic Jody Rosen from Slate included \"Vogue\" as one of Madonna's \"ten essential songs for new or aspiring fans\". Time called it \"the most famous fashion song of all time\", although the song was not specifically about the Vogue magazine. It was named the most iconic female dance moment in history in a list elaborated by The Daily Telegraph.\nMany critics and academics agree that with the song, Madonna brought voguing into mainstream culture, and also view it as one of the first mainstream pop culture works to spotlight elements from the queer, Black and Latino-led ballroom scene. Boston.com's Scott Kearnan noted that although Madonna has occasionally been accused of cultural appropriation for taking vogue mainstream, \"she never obfuscated or demeaned its roots\", and completed that \"even at an especially homophobic time, Madonna's gay dancers were shown as front, center, and fabulous, striking a pose alongside the most famous woman on Earth.\" Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone had similar thoughts, criticizing the mainstream's willingness to seriously engage with that culture and craft only when it is presented by white people, but stated that it \"doesn't mean one can\u2019t still revel in the song's brilliance, nor do they necessarily suggest anything malicious on Madonna's part\", as she \"approached 'Vogue' with a clear admiration and respect for the ballroom world.\" For Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, \"Vogue\" was \"the beginning of a new phase for Madonna. It was as if she got a sense of her immortality, and her true power. Feeling secure in her status as a mainstream artist, she began to play with that power and challenge her audience.\" James Rose of Daily Review agreed, writing that with the song Madonna began \"a phase of her career that oscillates between cynical self-exploitation and courageous self-expression. Raunchy videos, explicitly themed lyrics and boudoir beats became de rigueur for the lady now arguably bearing the biggest name in popular music.\"Before Madonna popularized the dance, voguing was performed mostly in bars and disco of New York City on the underground gay scene. According to O'Brien, when \"Vogue\" became the \"Number 1 hit of that summer, [it was] played in clubs across the globe, from London to New York to Bali\", also pointing out that it \"rode the crest of the newly emerging dance craze, where club culture, house music and techno met the mainstream. 'Vogue' reflected the new hedonism; positive, upbeat, and totally inclusive\". Liam Hess of Vogue commented that \"this subcultural movement had officially boiled over into the zeitgeist\" as \"many were mimicking the playful, exaggerated gestures of the Harlem ballrooms\" around the world. Steven Canals, the co-creator of TV series Pose stated, \"If we're looking at the history of ballroom and specifically that moment in time, what Madonna did was bring ballroom to the mainstream. She introduced the world to this community who, up until that point in time, had been a subculture.\" Voguing has since become a prominent dance form practised worldwide, and many female performers have followed Madonna's footsteps, adopting the dance style and incorporating it into their music videos and performances.The song is also noted for bringing house music into mainstream popular music, as well as for reviving disco music after a decade of its commercial death. Erick Henderson of Slant Magazine explained that the song was \"instrumental in allowing disco revivalism to emerge, allowing the denigrated gay genre to soar once again within the context of house music, the genre disco became in its second life.\" Sal Cinquemani of the same publication wrote that the song was \"making its impact all the more impressive (it would go on to inspire a glut of pop-house copycats) and begging the question: If disco died a decade earlier, what the fuck was this big, gay, fuscia drag-queen boa of a dance song sitting on top of the charts for a month for?\" According to Tom Breiham of Stereogum, \"Vogue\" was certainly the first number-one house track ever. He added, \"House, like voguing itself, had been a relatively underground club phenomenon a few years earlier, and it had only started to make inroads into the mainstream. As far as this column is concerned, that breakthrough might be the main legacy of 'Vogue'\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

O'Leary, Black Dynamite's former army and CIA partner, reinstates him into the agency because they do not want him seeking vengeance by himself. While trying to get to the bottom of Jimmy's murder, he finds out that his brother was actually working undercover for the CIA. Black Dynamite also discovers the shady organization is filling the black orphanages with heroin. He declares war on local drug dealers and successfully cleans up the streets, earning him the affection of Gloria, a Black Power activist who works at the local orphanage.\nAfter discovering the government's involvement in the drug ring, Black Dynamite steals the ledger belonging to corrupt Congressman James which details illegal shipments to a warehouse. Black Dynamite and his team (consisting of close friend Bullhorn, street hustler Cream Corn, militant leader Saheed, and three militants) storm the warehouse to capture a big shipment. They learn of a top-secret operation called \"Code Kansas\", but there are no drugs in the warehouse. They find only \"Anaconda\" brand malt liquor, a government-produced brand that, according to the advertising slogan, \"Gives You Ooooooo!\". In a diner, they decipher the slogan and uncover \"Code Kansas\" as a plan to literally emasculate African-American men through Anaconda Malt Liquor, which is formulated to \"give (you) a little dick\". The militant Gunsmoke, who has fallen victim to the liquor's effect, is killed to put him out of his misery. Returning to the warehouse, Black Dynamite finds O'Leary is part of the evil plan but is just following orders. He kills O'Leary before acquiring his next lead to find the source of the \"Code Kansas\" plan.\nBlack Dynamite heads to Kung Fu Island, where he discovers that his old nemesis, Fiendish Dr. Wu, is responsible for creating the secret formula found in Anaconda Malt Liquor. In a protracted battle which kills Saheed, the three militants, and Bullhorn, Black Dynamite discovers the true identity of the mastermind of the entire operation - the White House.\nBlack Dynamite then travels to the White House (in the process, Cream Corn is killed by the Secret Service) and confronts President Richard Nixon, who has been giving the orders from the beginning. Black Dynamite engages Nixon in a kung-fu battle. Nixon gets the upper hand when he dishonestly pulls John Wilkes Booth's gun, but the ghost of Abraham Lincoln appears and disarms Nixon with kung-fu. After defeating Nixon in a fair fight, Black Dynamite threatens to expose Nixon as the subject of a series of bondage and cross-dressing photographs. The president begs to be killed but Black Dynamite refuses to give him \"the easy way out\" and has Nixon watch out for his people. The film concludes with a monologue from Black Dynamite on his quest for justice as Gloria and Pat Nixon watch on rapturously.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Humans have had limited success understanding the left-behind bits of Heechee technology found there and elsewhere. The Gateway Corporation administers the asteroid on behalf of the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the New People's Asia, the Venusian Confederation, and the United States of Brazil.\nNearly a thousand small, abandoned starships are located at Gateway. By extremely dangerous trial and error, humans have partially learned how to operate them. The controls for selecting a destination have been identified, but nobody knows where a particular setting will take the ship, how long the trip will last, or even if enough fuel is available to get back. Those who choose to risk their lives cram the limited space with equipment and hopefully enough food for the trip, but sometimes it is not enough, and they have to resort first to cannibalism, and if that is not enough, to suicide. Attempts at reverse engineering to find out how the ships work have ended only in disaster, as has changing the settings in midflight. Most settings lead to useless or lethal places. A few, however, result in the discovery of new Heechee artifacts and habitable planets in other star systems, making the crews extremely wealthy. The vessels were made in three standard sizes, which can hold a maximum of one, three, or five people. Some \"threes\" and many \"fives\" are armored. Each ship includes a lander to visit a planet or other object if one is found.\nDespite the risks, many people on impoverished, overcrowded Earth dream of going to Gateway. Robinette Stetley Broadhead is a young food shale miner who wins a lottery, giving him enough money to purchase a one-way ticket to Gateway. Once there, he is frightened of the danger and puts off going on a mission as long as he can. In the meantime, he becomes romantically involved with two different women, eventually settling on Gelle-Klara Moynlin, his co-enabler in fearful delaying. Eventually, he starts running out of money, and although still terrified, he goes out on three trips. The first, with Klara and three others, is unsuccessful, and afterwards tension rises between them until he gives her a vicious beating. On the second trip, he goes by himself and inadvertently makes a discovery through unauthorized experimentation when he becomes infuriated after reaching Gateway Two, a smaller version of Gateway with only about 150 ships. He is awarded a sizable bonus because his route saves about 100 days of travel time; the windfall is partially offset by the large penalty for incapacitating his ship. On his third trip, the Gateway Corporation tries something different \u2013 sending two armored fives, one slightly behind the other, to the same destination, one rejected by most ships' computers; each crewmember is promised a million-dollar bonus. Bob signs up in desperation, along with Klara, with whom he has reconciled.\nWhen the ships arrive, their crews find to their horror that they are in the gravitational grip of a black hole without enough power to break free. One person devises a desperate escape plan: Move everyone into one ship and thrust the other toward the black hole with an explosion in a lander, thus gaining enough of a boost to escape. They work frantically to transfer unnecessary equipment to make room for everyone in one ship, but Broadhead finds himself alone in the wrong ship when time runs out. He closes the hatch so that the plan can proceed. However, his ship is the one that breaks free.\nBroadhead returns to Gateway and is awarded all the mission bonuses. He feels such enormous survivor guilt for dooming his crewmates, especially Klara, that he suppresses his memories of what happened, but he is very disturbed and miserable, though he does not understand why, so back on Earth as a wealthy man, he seeks therapy from an artificial intelligence Freudian therapist program, which he names Sigfrid von Shrink.\nThe narrative alternates in time between Broadhead's experiences on Gateway and his sessions with Sigfrid, converging on the traumatic events near the black hole and Broadhead finally remembering them so he can begin to heal. Sigfrid helps him realize that due to the gravitational time dilation of the black hole's immense gravity field, time is passing much more slowly for his former crewmates and none of them have actually died yet. Broadhead, however, concludes that this means that they will still be alive when he dies, with Klara still believing that he betrayed them to save himself.\nAlso embedded in the narrative are various mission reports (usually with fatalities), roster openings, technical bulletins, and other documents Broadhead might have read on Gateway, adding to the verisimilitude.  The economic side of living at Gateway is presented in detail, commencing with the contract all explorers must enter into with the Gateway Corporation, and including how some awards are determined.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others. We've simply done whatever we've wanted to do, and we've all decided to be happy with the results.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film has been commended for its strong female lead, saying actress \"Priscilla Dean in this picture is a film revelation...

It is not the inspired symbology of the cross alone, but the prophecy of Chang Lo that frames the outcome.\u201d\nFilm critic Alec Charles remarks upon the significance of the \u201ccross-kite\u201d imagery that may foreshadow Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s use of crucifix configurations in Battleship Potemkin (1925) where two condemned sailors hang from the yardarms:\n\n\u201cFive years earlier than Eisenstein, Browning had employed a similar piece of [Christian] symbolism (in the form of a shattered kite) suggesting that the film\u2019s two thieves [Dapper Bill and Silky Molly] might, in a squalid, broken and unglamorous way, find their own salvation...and escape the fate of [crucifixion]...the possibility of advancing an athletic comparison...authorizes a reading of Browning\u2019s discontinuities as intentional [and] anticipating Eisenstein\u2026\u201d", "hasanswer": false}]}

Halloween popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. Halloween helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s. Due to its popularity, Halloween became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed, and that others like Scream parodied.The major themes present in Halloween also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in Halloween, there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.There are slasher films that predated Halloween, such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972),  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Black Christmas (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. Halloween, however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others. Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of Halloween,\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting.

{"id": "91_1378", "question": "What genre is Savage?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Ueda's original inspiration for Ico was a TV commercial he saw, of a woman holding the hand of a child while walking through the woods, and the manga series Galaxy Express 999, where a woman is a guardian for the young hero as they adventure through the galaxy, which he thought about adapting into a new idea for video games. He also cited his work as an animator on Kenji Eno's Sega Saturn game Enemy Zero, which influenced the animation work, cinematic cutscenes, lighting effects, sound design, and mature appeal. Ueda was also inspired by the video game Another World (Outer World in Japan), which used cinematic cutscenes, lacked any head-up display elements as to play like a movie, and also featured an emotional connection between two characters despite the use of minimal dialog. He also cited Sega Mega Drive games, Virtua Fighter, Lemmings, Flashback and the original Prince of Persia games as influences, specifically regarding animation and gameplay style. With the help of an assistant, Ueda created an animation in Lightwave to get a feel for the final game and to better convey his vision. In the three-minute demonstration reel, Yorda had the horns instead of Ico, and flying robotic creatures were seen firing weapons to destroy the castle. Ueda stated that having this movie that represented his vision helped to keep the team on track for the long development process, and he reused this technique for the development of Shadow of the Colossus, the team's next effort.\nUeda began working with producer Kenji Kaido in 1998 to develop the idea and bring the game to the PlayStation. Ico's design aesthetics were guided by three key notions: to make a game that would be different from others in the genre, feature an aesthetic style that would be consistently artistic, and play out in an imaginary yet realistic setting. This was achieved through the use of \"subtracting design\"; they removed elements from the game which interfered with the game's reality. This included removing any form of interface elements, keeping the gameplay focused only on the escape from the castle, and reducing the number of types of enemies in the game to a single foe. An interim design of the game shows Ico and Yorda facing horned warriors similar to those who take Ico to the castle. The game originally focused on Ico's attempt to return Yorda to her room in the castle after she was kidnapped by these warriors. Ueda believed this version had too much detail for the graphics engine they had developed, and as part of the \"subtracting design\", replaced the warriors with the shadow creatures. Ueda also brought in a number of people outside the video game industry to help with development. These consisted of two programmers, four artists, and one designer in addition to Ueda and Kaido, forming the base of what is now known as Team Ico. On reflection, Ueda noted that the subtracting design may have taken too much out of the game, and did not go to as great an extreme with Shadow of the Colossus.After two years of development, the team ran into limitations on the PlayStation hardware and faced a critical choice: either terminate the project altogether, alter their vision to fit the constraints of the hardware, or continue to explore more options. The team decided to remain true to Ueda's vision, and began to use the Emotion Engine of the PlayStation 2, taking advantage of the improved abilities of the platform. Character animation was accomplished through key frame animation instead of the more common motion capture technique. The game took about four years to create. Ueda purposely left the ending vague, not stating whether Yorda was alive, whether she would travel with Ico, or if it was simply the protagonist's dream.The cover used for releases in Japan and PAL regions was drawn by Ueda himself, and was inspired by the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico and his work The Nostalgia of the Infinite. Ueda believed that \"the surrealistic world of de Chirico matched the allegoric world of Ico\". The North American version lacks this cover as well as additional features that become available after the player completes the game once. The development team was unable to provide Ueda's cover or the additional features such as the two-player mode in time for Sony's planned North American release date, but included them for the later releases in Japan and PAL regions. Since release, the North American cover has been considered one of the worst pieces of cover art for video games in contrast to the game's quality and the Japanese/PAL cover. On reflection, Yasuhide Kobayashi, vice-president of Sony's Japan Studio, believed the North American box art and lack of an identifiable English title led to the game's poor sales in the United States, and stated plans to correct that for the release of The Last Guardian. For its original release, a limited edition of the game was available in PAL regions that included a cardboard wrapping displaying artwork from the game and four art cards inside the box. The game was re-released as a standard edition in 2006 across all PAL regions except France after the 2005 release of Shadow of the Colossus, Ico's spiritual sequel, to allow players to \"fill the gap in their collection\".Ico uses minimal dialogue in a fictional language to provide the story throughout the game. Voice actors included Kazuhiro Shind\u014d as Ico, Rieko Takahashi as Yorda, and Misa Watanabe as the Queen. Ico and the Queen's words are presented in either English or Japanese subtitles depending on the release region, but Yorda's speech is presented in a symbolic language. Ueda opted not to provide the translation for Yorda's words as it would have overcome the language barrier between Ico and Yorda, and detracted from the \"holding hands\" concept of the game. In the non-North American releases, playing through the game again after completing the game replaces the symbolic text with appropriate language subtitles.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\".

{"id": "91_1395", "question": "What genre is Listen to Me?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_40489", "text": "Dangerous is a new jack swing, R&B and pop album, which incorporates elements of several other genres, including industrial, funk, hip hop, electronic, gospel, classical, and rock. In a 1992 interview with Ebony magazine, Jackson said, \"I wanted to do an album like Tchaikovsky\u2019s Nutcracker Suite. So that in a thousand years from now, people would still be listening to it.\" Much of the album contains samples from CDs that Riley had created himself using a variety of instruments.The album features catchy pop hooks and choruses while also introducing underground sounds to a mainstream audience. The album's tone is noted by critics as gritty and urban,  with sounds including synthetic basslines, scratching, and drum machine percussion, as well as unconventional sounds like honking vehicle horns, sliding chains, swinging gates, breaking glass, and clanking metal. Throughout the album Jackson also implements beatboxing, scat singing, and finger snapping. The album is considered by Joe Vogel in PopMatters to be an artistic change for Jackson, because of its focus on socially conscious material, and a broader range of sounds and styles. The car sound effects on \"She Drives Me Wild\" were taken from a sample CD, and was the first time Riley used unusual sounds in place of the drums on a song.The album featured Jackson rapping for the first time. The inclusion of Wreckx-n-Effect and hip-hop rhythms were attempts to introduce Jackson to a younger generation of urban listeners. Riley was a pioneer of new jack swing, and he was hired by Jackson specifically for his work in the genre. Riley co-produced half the songs on the album. Swedien said of Riley, \"He'd come in with a groove, we'd say it wasn't exactly right, and there would be no complaining. He'd just go back and then come back in and blow us away with something like 'Dangerous'.\" In recordings with Bottrell, the sounds were more diverse (e.g. \"Black or White\" and \"Give In to Me\"). The rap in \"Black or White\" was written and performed by Bottrell, credited under the pseudonym \"L.T.B.\" Jackson hummed melodies and grooves before leaving the studio, while Bottrell developed on these ideas with drum machines and samplers, including an Akai S1000. Bottrell operated a Neve console and two 24-track Studer analog tape machines to draft ideas and demos. He then used a 32-track Mitsubishi machine to assemble the album.\n\nThe lyrics for Dangerous were more varied than those of Jackson's previous records. Opening track \"Jam\" features a dense, swirling Riley track, propelled by horn samples and a subtle scratch effect. Jackson had recorded a basic idea for the song on a DAT, to which he asked Riley to develop. Riley learned that Heavy D was Jackson's favourite rapper at the time, and suggested that he was brought in to contribute a rap. The ballads, \"Keep the Faith\" (composed by Jackson, Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard) and the self-composed \"Will You Be There\" had sounds of gospel, while \"Heal the World\" and \"Gone Too Soon\" were softer pop ballads. \"Gone Too Soon\", written by Larry Grossman and Buz Kohan, is a tribute to Ryan White following his death due to AIDS in 1990. The album also includes songs of other personal nature, especially in songs such as \"She Drives Me Wild\", \"Remember the Time\", \"Can't Let Her Get Away\", \"Who Is It\" and \"Give In to Me\". The title track's subject is similar to that of \"Dirty Diana\" with the song focusing on a seductress. Though Jackson sang about racial harmony in some of his songs with the Jacksons, \"Black or White\" was the first song where the lyrics were interpreted with the context of his own changing skin color. In \"Why You Wanna Trip on Me\", Jackson juxtaposed social ills to his own alleged eccentricities that were covered in the press at the time, asking critics and the tabloid media why they were focusing on the cult of celebrity rather than the multitude of serious problems in the world. Riley performed the guitar parts on an Ovation acoustic, and expected Jackson to have someone brought in to re-record them, but was surprised that Jackson liked what he had put down.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Harper's niece (Young Joan) enters and claims that she can't sleep. After a few attempts by her aunt to get her back in bed, she tells Harper that she just came back into the house after climbing out of her window to investigate a sound that she heard. Joan says that she just witnessed her uncle, Harper's husband, loading bloody children and other people into the back of a lorry. After repeated attempts to censor what Joan saw, Harper tells her that the uncle is saving the children and taking them to a safer place. She tells Joan that she can never tell anyone about what she saw because it would put all of their lives in danger. Harper claims they are on the good side and are making the world a better place.\nAct 2, Scene 1 is roughly 15 years later in a factory where an adult Joan has just begun her professional career as a milliner. Her co-worker Todd is an established hatter and is experienced in the field. Various days at the factory are seen, with the hats that Joan and Todd are making in various stages of completion over time. Todd and Joan exchange basic conversation about this body of work and about their previous works. Todd says that the company has been pushing for hats to be created quicker for the parades; they used to have two weeks to finish a hat but now they only have one.\nScene 2: Joan and Todd learn more about each other through a discussion about their current hat designs. Todd brings up a hypothesis that the way the company gets contracts is corrupt, claiming there is a certain person's brother-in-law that is involved. Joan wants to know more, but Todd doesn't want to talk about it at work. Joan changes the topic, saying she does not like to watch the trials at night. Todd says he watches them every night while drinking Pernod, or absinthe.\nScene 3: Todd and Joan speak about different hat genres: Animal and Abstract. Joan changes the subject and asks why Todd doesn't do something (regarding the corruption). He says he spends days wondering what he should do.\nScene 4: Joan and Todd compliment each other on their almost completed hats. Todd announces he is going to talk to \"him\" (someone working above Todd). He says he is going to talk about the brother-in-law and hint at the possibility of leaking information to a friend of his who is a journalist. He say that if he lost his job, he'd miss Joan.\nScene 5 shows the completed hats of Todd and Joan on the heads of prisoners being marched to have the hats \"judged\" in the trials.\nScene 6 returns to the factory. Joan states that she can't believe that she won. She says she doesn't understand why more aren't kept, because they could be re-used. Todd says that keeping more hats would put them out of work. Joan thinks it is sad that all the hats are burned with the bodies. Todd says that the hats are metaphorical for life. He is not bothered that only three out of nearly 300 hats that he has created made it to the museum. He loves making beauty that disappears. Todd brings up his meeting with \"him\". \"He\" said, \"These things must be thought about\". Todd wonders if \"he\" was talking about the content of their meeting, or if he should fire Todd. Joan reminds Todd about the journalist he knows. Joan hypothesizes that the whole industry is corrupt. She says that if Todd is fired, she will resign. Todd almost tells Joan that he loves her, but quickly changes to saying that he loves beads.\nAct 3, Scene 1 finds Harper and Todd at Harper's house waiting for Joan to return. They discuss the paranoia caused by not knowing what side various aspects of nature is on. They are very worried about Joan who eventually returns in a very frazzled state. She delivers a monologue about her fear of every natural thing on her journey (a stream, horses, light, and dark). She does not know whose side of the war they are on.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The group specialises in killing their victims using elaborate schemes that mask the murders as if they were accidents. Uncle (Stanley Fung), one of the team members, accidentally leaves a cigarette butt at the crime scene, and it is found by the Brain. After an argument, Uncle vows to quit smoking afterwards.\nThe team then gets a job from a son that wants to kill his own father, likely for insurance money. They plan an accident to kill their target via electrocution, but the plan requires for it be to raining at a specific time. The team tries to execute their plan many times but fail due to the rain falling later than necessary. During one run, Uncle smokes a cigarette and begins to show signs of Alzheimer's disease, forgetting that he made a vow to stop smoking. However, the rain falls on time, and the team decides to go forth with their plan. Uncle forgets to play his part in the murder, but the murder is successfully executed nonetheless.\nUnexpectedly, after the murder, a bus loses control and almost runs over the Brain. The Brain manages to get out of the bus's path, but the bus then runs over Fatty (Lam Suet), another member of the team, killing him on the scene. The Brain takes Fatty's belongings, with Fatty asking the Brain whether it really was an accident before he dies. The Brain then returns home to find police officers investigating his flat, which was broken into.\nThe Brain becomes paranoid and is convinced that everything was a setup. He trails the son to an insurance company the next day. The Brain sees the son arguing with an insurance agent (Richie Jen) over what appears to be money, leading the Brain to suspect that the insurance agent was behind the bus accident. The Brain rents a flat on the floor directly below the insurance agent's flat, and begins to perform secret surveillance on the agent.\nOne day, the Brain trails the client to find the Woman (Michelle Ye) picking up the payment for the job at a parking garage. However, only Fatty and the Brain should have known about the pick-up. The Woman explains to the Brain that Fatty had told her about the client, but the Brain, suspecting her betrayal, kills her and takes the money. After he leaves, as he is walking on the sidewalk, the client (the son) falls from the roof of the same building and is dead. The Brain develops further suspicion of the insurance agent, who he can see talking on the phone and later hear him talking about the client on the phone in his flat.\nIn a later date, the Brain receives a call from Uncle for help. However, the Brain is too late and finds Uncle severely injured, apparently dropping two stories from a building near the crime scene in the opening scene. The Brain decides to take revenge against the insurance agent and devises a scheme to kill the agent by reflecting the sun's rays to blind a car to run over the agent in what would appear to be an accident.\nHowever, in the middle of the plan's execution, there is a solar eclipse, blocking the sunlight. At this time, the Brain receives a call from Uncle in the hospital, who tells the Brain that Fatty's death really was an accident. Uncle had accidentally dropped a bag of toy balls that night, which led to the loss of control of the bus.\nRealizing he has made a mistake and that the agent is innocent, the Brain runs and tries to cover the windshield from reflecting light. The agent sees and recognises the Brain as he is running, but the Brain is too late, and a blinded driver runs over the agent's wife, killing her.\nOn a later date, as the Brain is leaving the rented flat, he is confronted and stabbed by the insurance agent in the staircase, who asks the Brain why he had to harm them.

It is the first entry in the Mother series. It is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but is set in the late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to put an end to the paranormal phenomena that recently spiraled the country into disarray. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.\nWriter and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mother's concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. A North American version of the game was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released globally as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015 and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022.\nMother was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies and received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score from Famitsu magazine. Mother was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, but many considered its sequel Mother 2: G\u012bgu no Gyakush\u016b (known outside as EarthBound) to be similar and a better overall implementation of Mother's gameplay ideas, with the game's high difficulty level polarizing critics, along with balance issues. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com wrote that Mother importantly generated interest in video game emulation and the historical preservation of unreleased games. The game was re-released in Japan on the single-cartridge compilation Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance in 2003.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_1400", "question": "What genre is The Era?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_9170", "text": "The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

They have been widely praised by critics for creating artistic statements with their music instead of aiming for mainstream success like many of their contemporaries did. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork remarked, \"popular guitar music in 2017 has been undeniably shaped by Brand New, a band who has served not just as damaged role models but as a formative musical influence.\" Writing for The Outline, Zoe Camp stated that \"they were increasingly sincere and self-aware in a genre where emotional histrionics were the default setting.

Olga, the manicurist, reveals that Mary's husband has been \"stepping out\" with a predatory perfume counter girl named Crystal Allen. Sylvia eagerly shares the news with Mary's friends and sets Mary up with Olga.\nMary is shattered to learn about Stephen's infidelity. Her mother urges patience and takes Mary to Bermuda with her, so she can take time to think. When they return, Mary goes to a couturier for a fitting. Crystal appears, ordering expensive clothes. Stephen is now keeping her.  At Sylvia's insistence, Mary confronts Crystal, who suggests that Mary keep the status quo unless she wants to lose Stephen in a divorce. Heartbroken and humiliated, Mary leaves. The gossip continues, exacerbated by Sylvia and their friend Edith, who turns the affair into a public scandal by recounting Sylvia's version of the story to a gossip columnist. Mary decides to divorce her husband despite his efforts to make her stay. As she packs to leave for Reno, Mary explains the divorce to Little Mary, who weeps alone in the bathroom.\nOn the train to Reno, Mary meets three women with the same destination and purpose: the dramatic, extravagant Countess de Lave; Miriam Aarons, a tough-cookie chorus girl; and, to her surprise, her shy young friend Peggy Day, who has been pushed into divorce by Sylvia. They all settle in at a Reno ranch, where they get plenty of commonsense advice from Lucy, the gruff, warm-hearted woman who runs the ranch. The Countess tells tales of her multiple husbands and seems to have found another prospect in a cowboy named Buck Winston. Miriam has been having an affair with Sylvia Fowler's husband and plans to marry him. Peggy discovers that she is pregnant, calls her husband, and happily plans to hurry home. Sylvia arrives at the ranch; Howard is suing her, thanks to recorded evidence of mental cruelty. When she discovers that Miriam is the next Mrs. Fowler, she attacks her, and a fight ensues.\nMary's divorce comes through, but Miriam tries to convince her that she should forget her pride and call Stephen. Before Mary can decide, Stephen calls to inform Mary that he and Crystal have just been married.\nTwo years later, Crystal, now Mrs. Haines, is taking a bubble bath and talking on the phone to her lover, Buck Winston, now a radio star and married to the Countess. Little Mary overhears the conversation before being shooed away by Crystal. Sylvia picks up the phone and hears the voice of Crystal's lover.\nMary hosts a dinner for her Reno buddies and her Manhattan friends\u2014excepting Sylvia\u2014celebrating Buck and the Countess's second anniversary. The Countess, Miriam, and Peggy urge Mary to come along to a nightclub, but she stays home. Little Mary inadvertently reveals how unhappy Stephen is and mentions Crystal's \"lovey dovey\" talk with Buck on the telephone. Mary is transformed, crying \"I've had two years to grow claws, Mother\u2014Jungle Red!\"\nIn the nightclub's ladies' lounge, Mary worms the details out of Sylvia and gets the news to a gossip columnist (played by Hedda Hopper). Mary tells the Countess that her husband Buck has been having an affair with Crystal, then informs Crystal that everyone knows what she has been doing. Crystal does not care. Mary can have Stephen back, since she will now have Buck to support her. The weeping Countess reveals that she has been funding Buck's radio career and that without her, he will be penniless and jobless. Crystal resigns herself to the fact that she will be heading back to the perfume counter, adding: \"And by the way, there's a name for you ladies, but it isn't used in high society\u2014outside of a kennel.\" Mary, triumphant, heads out the door, arms wide open to receive Stephen.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Journalist Chris Hedges also criticized the show in his 2009 book Empire of Illusion, writing \"The Swan's transparent message is that once these women have been surgically 'corrected' to resemble mainstream celebrity beauty as closely as possible, their problems will be solved\". Feminist scholar Susan J. Douglas criticized the show in her book The Rise of Enlightened Sexism for its continuation of a negative female body image, claiming that \"it made all too explicit the narrow physical standards to which women are expected to conform, the sad degree to which women internalize these standards, the lengths needed to get there, and the impossibility for most of us to meet the bar without, well, taking a box cutter to our faces and bodies\".Author Alice Marwick believes that this program is an example of \"body culture media\", which she describes as \"a genre of popular culture which positions work on the body as a morally correct solution to personal problems\". Marwick also suggests that cosmetic reality television encourages viewers to frame their family, financial, or social problems in bodily terms, and portrays surgical procedures as an everyday and normal solution. The Swan draws from cultural discourses of plastic surgery and self-improvement culture to frame cosmetic surgery as \"a morally appropriate means to achieving an authentic self\".

It was praised for its unique gameplay and dark, deadpan humor. Eurogamer cited that \"the way the game progresses from being a simple set of perfunctory tasks to a full-on part of the Half-Life story is absolute genius\", while GameSpy noted, \"What Portal lacks in length, it more than makes up for in exhilaration.\" The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length. Aggregate reviews for the standalone PC version of Portal gave the game a 90/100 through 28 reviews on Metacritic. In 2011, Valve stated that Portal had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and The Orange Box, and from the Xbox Live Arcade version.The game generated a fan following for the Weighted Companion Cube\u2014even though the cube itself does not talk or act in the game. Fans have created plush and papercraft versions of the cube and the various turrets, as well as PC case mods and models of the Portal cake and portal gun. Jeep Barnett, a programmer for Portal, noted that players have told Valve that they had found it more emotional to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube than to harm one of the \"Little Sisters\" from BioShock. Both GLaDOS and the Weighted Companion Cube were nominated for the Best New Character Award on G4, with GLaDOS winning the award for \"having lines that will be quoted by gamers for years to come.\" Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation praised the game as \"absolutely sublime from start to finish ... I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly what I got, but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest pitch black humor I've ever heard in a game\". He felt the short length was ideal as it did not outstay its welcome.Writing for GameSetWatch in 2009, columnist Daniel Johnson pointed out similarities between Portal and Erving Goffman's essay on dramaturgy, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, which equates one's persona to the front and backstage areas of a theater. The game was also made part of the required course material among other classical and contemporary works, including Goffman's work, for a freshman course \"devoted to engaging students with fundamental questions of humanity from multiple perspectives and fostering a sense of community\" for Wabash College in 2010. Portal has also been cited as a strong example of instructional scaffolding that can be adapted for more academic learning situations, as the player, through careful design of levels by Valve, is first hand-held in solving simple puzzles with many hints at the correct solution, but this support is slowly removed as the player progresses in the game, and completely removed when the player reaches the second half of the game. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Hamish Todd considered Portal as an exemplary means of game design by demonstrating a series of chambers after the player has obtained the portal gun that gently introduce the concept of flinging without any explicit instructions. Portal was exhibited at the Smithsonian Art Exhibition in America from February 14 through September 30, 2012. Portal won the \"Action\" section for the platform \"Modern Windows\".Since its release Portal is still considered one of the best video games of all time, having been included on several cumulative \"Top Games of All Time\" lists through 2018.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When the old man dies, his estate lawyers order Chance out.\nHe wanders aimlessly, discovering the outside world for the first time. An African-American youth points a knife at him; Chance ineffectually tries to click him out of existence with a TV remote control. Passing by a TV shop, Chance sees himself captured by a video camera in the shop window. Entranced, he steps backward off the sidewalk and is struck by a limousine chauffeuring Eve Rand, the glamorous and much younger wife of elderly business mogul Ben Rand. When she asks him his name she mishears \"Chance, the gardener\" as \"Chauncey Gardiner\".\nEve brings Chance to their palatial estate to be seen by Dr. Allenby, who is resident there caring for Ben, who is slowly dying from a blood disease. After checking Chauncey out, the doctor invites him to stay to keep an eye on him. \nChauncey\u2019s manners are old-fashioned and courtly, and he wears expensively-tailored but outmoded 1930s clothes he took from his former employer\u2019s attic. When Ben meets him he takes \"Chauncey\" for an upper-class, highly-educated businessman fallen on hard times. Ben admires him, finding him direct, wise and insightful.\nBen is also a confidant and advisor to the President of the United States, whom he introduces to Chauncey. In a discussion about the economy, Chance takes his cue from the words \"stimulate growth\" and talks about the changing seasons of the garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic political advice and quotes \"Chauncey Gardiner\" in a speech.\nChance now rises to national prominence, attends important events, develops a close connection with the Soviet ambassador, and appears on a talk show during which his detailed advice about what a serious gardener should do is misunderstood as his opinion on presidential policy. Louise tells other African Americans as they watch Chance on TV that he has \"rice pudding between the ears\" and that whiteness is all that is needed to succeed in America. The President is shown as sexually impotent with his wife when watching the show.\nThough Chance has now risen to the pinnacle of Washington society, the Secret Service and 16 other agencies are unable to find any background information on him. Meanwhile, Allenby becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that his mysterious identity may have a more mundane explanation. Allenby considers telling Ben, but remains silent when he realizes how happy Chance is making him in his final days.\nThe dying Ben encourages Eve to become close to \"Chauncey\". She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair, which happens to be on TV. When the scene ends, Chance stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies \"I like to watch,\" meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but masturbates for his voyeuristic pleasure, not noticing he has turned back to the TV and is imitating a yoga exercise on another channel.\nChance is present at Ben's death and shows genuine sadness. Questioned by Allenby, he admits that he \"loves Eve very much\" and also that he is just a gardener. When he leaves to inform Eve of Ben's death, Allenby says to himself, \"I understand.\"\nWhile the President delivers a speech at Ben's funeral, the pallbearers hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next presidential term, and unanimously agree on \"Chauncey\" as successor. Oblivious, Chance wanders off through Ben's wintry estate. He straightens out a pine sapling flattened by a fallen branch, then walks across the surface of a lake without sinking.

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

After making a choice in each node, the user is moved back to the tree with that node marked as completed. In this manner, the user progresses through the alter ego's entire life and examines what impact their decisions had. In the process of playing the game, the player's alter ego proceeds through seven phases with their respective experiences: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood, middle adulthood, and old age. Some of these experiences are disturbing, and can even lead to premature death (such as being raped and killed by a child molester), though most tend to be humorous.\nAlter Ego keeps track of certain player statistics throughout the game, which in turn affect the alter ego's ability to succeed at certain choices. For example, in the high school segment, the player might be given the choice of trying out for the school baseball team, or deciding instead to crack down and study harder to improve in math. This decision might change the alter ego's \"Physical\", \"Confidence\", and \"Intellectual\" statistics, which in future experiences might influence the alter ego's ability to get into college or succeed in social situations.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "91_1430", "question": "What genre is Network?", "ctxs": [{"id": "526_52634", "text": "From the start of writing the Buffy series, Joss Whedon asserted that it would never have a \"very special episode\" as in contemporary series Beverly Hills, 90210, The Wonder Years, or Party of Five, where the core cast of characters addresses a single issue (AIDS, drug abuse, or alcoholism, for example) and resolve all the problems at the end. Whedon was not interested in finding a life-affirming lesson for \"The Body\". Rather, he wanted to capture the isolation and boredom involved in the minutes and hours after finding a loved one has died, what he termed \"the black ashes in your mouth numbness of death\". He did not intend to resolve any religious or existential questions about the end of life, but wanted to examine the process in which a person becomes a mere body. Whedon's mother, a teacher, also died of a cerebral aneurysm, and he drew on his own experiences, and those of friends and other writers, in constructing the episode. He tried to achieve an \"unlovely physicality\" in \"The Body\" to portray the upsetting minutiae involved in attempting to comprehend what is incomprehensible.Small details became significant: to protect her dignity, Buffy pulls the hem of Joyce's skirt down after it rode up when she attempted CPR; the camera focuses on a breeze through wind chimes while Buffy vomits; to emphasize Buffy's isolation, the scene has no exterior establishing shots of the house.The opening sequence of \"The Body\" was also the closing scene of the previous episode, \"I Was Made to Love You\"; this is the only episode in the series that was first aired without a \"Previously on Buffy\" lead-in. The Christmas dinner scene was used both to contrast the stark reality of the rest of the episode and to avoid having the credits appear over the beginning scenes where Buffy is trying to revive her mother.The episode is presented in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar (Buffy). Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move through the house and calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, \"We're not supposed to move the body!\" Both Gellar and Trachtenberg (Dawn) were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, \"you try to separate it as best you can and at the same time it adds that extra layer\". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar \"at a fever pitch\", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure.Kristine Sutherland (Joyce) was informed during the third season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended to spend time in Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of \"The Body\" was strange and tense because she had been a regular character throughout the series and she was suddenly playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, but getting into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies.The most difficult scene for Whedon to film was Willow panicking in her dormitory room. Her obsession about what to wear to visit Buffy was inspired by Whedon's own experiences when he was at a loss for what tie to wear for a friend's funeral. He praised Alyson Hannigan's acting, saying that she was able to be consistently emotional in every take and make him and the crew cry every time. Whedon acknowledged his difficulty speaking on the DVD commentary while watching Hannigan in the scene.Whedon's rejection of the \"very special episode\" format impelled him to address the physicality of Willow and Tara's relationship within \"The Body\". Before this episode, they had held hands and danced on screen, but they had not kissed. A genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as the \"lesbian kiss episode\" in the 1990s, where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored. Whedon set out to acknowledge Willow's and Tara's affection without making it the primary focus of the show. For attempting this, he received resistance from the airing network, the WB. Whedon informed them that the kiss between Willow and Tara was \"not negotiable\". According to Whedon, the conversation about the kiss was approached by the network executives, who were concerned with the number of gay relationships on the network. Whedon countered that the kiss was \"true to character\" and said he would quit the show if the network forbade it. It was the only time during the series he threatened to do so.When Willow and Tara first met in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the relationship to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For the rest of the season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in \"The Body\", saying \"They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props when it came to the [characters' first] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy.\" Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was \"truly groundbreaking\"; no long speech, no huge discovery: \"Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world\". Tropiano calls it \"A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do.\"  Shortly before the end of the scene, while Xander is talking, Willow can be seen silently mouthing \"I love you\" to Tara.\nAudiences reacted more emotionally than Whedon expected to Emma Caulfield's performance. Anya's blunt innocence was similar to a plot twist, as viewers did not expect the depth of sensitivity that she portrayed in her monologue, which Whedon considers \"the heart of the experience\" and critic Noel Murray reiterates as the \"whole point of the episode in bolded, capital letters\". Xander's punching the wall and hurting his hand served to give the four in this scene something to concentrate on, to redirect their helplessness, which was another facet of the physicality of dealing with the crisis. Whedon used another long tracking shot from Joyce's face in the morgue following the doctor down the hall to speak with Buffy and the Scoobies to cement the reality of their being so close in proximity, as opposed to cutting shots to give the possibility that it was part of another set located somewhere else. The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Humans have had limited success understanding the left-behind bits of Heechee technology found there and elsewhere. The Gateway Corporation administers the asteroid on behalf of the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the New People's Asia, the Venusian Confederation, and the United States of Brazil.\nNearly a thousand small, abandoned starships are located at Gateway. By extremely dangerous trial and error, humans have partially learned how to operate them. The controls for selecting a destination have been identified, but nobody knows where a particular setting will take the ship, how long the trip will last, or even if enough fuel is available to get back. Those who choose to risk their lives cram the limited space with equipment and hopefully enough food for the trip, but sometimes it is not enough, and they have to resort first to cannibalism, and if that is not enough, to suicide. Attempts at reverse engineering to find out how the ships work have ended only in disaster, as has changing the settings in midflight. Most settings lead to useless or lethal places. A few, however, result in the discovery of new Heechee artifacts and habitable planets in other star systems, making the crews extremely wealthy. The vessels were made in three standard sizes, which can hold a maximum of one, three, or five people. Some \"threes\" and many \"fives\" are armored. Each ship includes a lander to visit a planet or other object if one is found.\nDespite the risks, many people on impoverished, overcrowded Earth dream of going to Gateway. Robinette Stetley Broadhead is a young food shale miner who wins a lottery, giving him enough money to purchase a one-way ticket to Gateway. Once there, he is frightened of the danger and puts off going on a mission as long as he can. In the meantime, he becomes romantically involved with two different women, eventually settling on Gelle-Klara Moynlin, his co-enabler in fearful delaying. Eventually, he starts running out of money, and although still terrified, he goes out on three trips. The first, with Klara and three others, is unsuccessful, and afterwards tension rises between them until he gives her a vicious beating. On the second trip, he goes by himself and inadvertently makes a discovery through unauthorized experimentation when he becomes infuriated after reaching Gateway Two, a smaller version of Gateway with only about 150 ships. He is awarded a sizable bonus because his route saves about 100 days of travel time; the windfall is partially offset by the large penalty for incapacitating his ship. On his third trip, the Gateway Corporation tries something different \u2013 sending two armored fives, one slightly behind the other, to the same destination, one rejected by most ships' computers; each crewmember is promised a million-dollar bonus. Bob signs up in desperation, along with Klara, with whom he has reconciled.\nWhen the ships arrive, their crews find to their horror that they are in the gravitational grip of a black hole without enough power to break free. One person devises a desperate escape plan: Move everyone into one ship and thrust the other toward the black hole with an explosion in a lander, thus gaining enough of a boost to escape. They work frantically to transfer unnecessary equipment to make room for everyone in one ship, but Broadhead finds himself alone in the wrong ship when time runs out. He closes the hatch so that the plan can proceed. However, his ship is the one that breaks free.\nBroadhead returns to Gateway and is awarded all the mission bonuses. He feels such enormous survivor guilt for dooming his crewmates, especially Klara, that he suppresses his memories of what happened, but he is very disturbed and miserable, though he does not understand why, so back on Earth as a wealthy man, he seeks therapy from an artificial intelligence Freudian therapist program, which he names Sigfrid von Shrink.\nThe narrative alternates in time between Broadhead's experiences on Gateway and his sessions with Sigfrid, converging on the traumatic events near the black hole and Broadhead finally remembering them so he can begin to heal. Sigfrid helps him realize that due to the gravitational time dilation of the black hole's immense gravity field, time is passing much more slowly for his former crewmates and none of them have actually died yet. Broadhead, however, concludes that this means that they will still be alive when he dies, with Klara still believing that he betrayed them to save himself.\nAlso embedded in the narrative are various mission reports (usually with fatalities), roster openings, technical bulletins, and other documents Broadhead might have read on Gateway, adding to the verisimilitude.  The economic side of living at Gateway is presented in detail, commencing with the contract all explorers must enter into with the Gateway Corporation, and including how some awards are determined.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "91_1446", "question": "What genre is Lutheran Worship?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_42403", "text": "Lutheran Worship is, essentially, a revision of the green-covered Lutheran Book of Worship of 1978 that was the common liturgical book and hymnal of the old Lutheran Church in America, American Lutheran Church, and Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, which later merged in 1988 to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The LCMS began work on the LBW in 1965 as a revision of TLH of 1941 and the other Lutheran churches' book, the Service Book and Hymnal (SBH) of 1958 and invited other Lutheran denominations in North America to participate in the creation of the hymnal. Due to disagreements and compromise with some of the other denominations involved in the project, however, the LBW was published in 1978 without the endorsement of the very church body which initiated its production, when more conservative leaders assumed leadership after 1974 amidst a theological controversy and schism. Following the rejection of the LBW, the LCMS quickly set about revising the new hymnal to remove the objectionable content, and LW was published in 1982. Lutheran Worship includes orders for Holy Communion entitled Divine Service I (a revised and updated version of the old The Common Service liturgy of 1888, which influenced the further development of American Lutheran liturgies and was incorporated in The Common Service Book of 1917, adopted by the old United Lutheran Church in America, a predecessor of the LCA to 1962), Divine Service II (two settings, very similar to liturgies included in the LBW), and Divine Service III (a brief outline of a service based on Martin Luther's German Mass).  It also includes orders for Matins, Vespers, and Compline, as well as services for Holy Baptism and Confirmation. There is also Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer, the Bidding Prayer, the Litany, the Lectionary, Luther's Small Catechism, Confession (Individual and Corporate), and a collection of Psalms. The bulk of the hymnal consists of 11 canticles and chants, 491 hymns, and 18 spiritual songs.\nDespite the revisions undertaken by the LCMS, many members and congregations still rejected LW due to what many viewed as unnecessary and awkward modifications in language to well-known materials. Objections centered on the modifications made to Divine Service I and a number of well-known hymns. Following the precedent set by the LBW and the common trend around North American Christianity at the time, archaic language was widely updated, resulting in worshipers frequently stumbling over hymn verses and passages that had been familiar to them for many years. Examples of hymns that were significantly altered in the new hymnal include \"My Faith Looks Up to Thee\", \"I Am Trusting Thee, Lord Jesus\", and \"We Give Thee But Thine Own\", all of which are well-known and familiar hymns among Lutherans but were heavily modified in LW (\"My Faith Looks Up to Thee\" is perhaps the most notorious example of all, as its first line was changed to \"My Faith Looks Trustingly\"). Additionally, many familiar hymns were set to new melodies that proved unpopular. Examples include \"Ride On, Ride On in Majesty\", \"The Day of Resurrection\", and \"God Loved the World So That He Gave\". In many ways, LW proved to be a major contributor to the controversies that tore at the LCMS in the later part of the twentieth century, as the synod suddenly found itself lacking unity even in the hymnal used in its congregations. By 1999, only 58% of the synod was using LW as its primary hymnal, with the majority of the remaining congregations retaining TLH and a handful of others using LBW or other hymnals such as SBH.\nLutheran Worship is commonly referred to as the \"Blue hymnal,\" because of its bound cover in contrast with TLH (or the SBH of 1958) - the \"Red hymnal\". The one notable exception to \"Lutheran Worship\" being blue is in the case of Concordia Lutheran Church in San Antonio, TX, whose founding pastor, the Reverend Doctor Guido Merkens, insisted at a synodical meeting that he wanted green covers. Not wanting to ruffle the feathers of the man who at that time had the fastest-growing LCMS church in the nation, a popular syndicated TV show known as \"Breakthrough,\" and a \"Television Sunday School\" with a wide audience, the Synod and publishers relented, and hundreds of \"Lutheran Worship\" hymnals were produced in a dark green color to match the color scheme of Dr. Merkens' church. A new hymnal published in 2006, Lutheran Service Book, is intended to replace both LW and TLH as the common hymnal of the LCMS. Concordia Publishing House has announced that all LW-related supplemental materials, including specialized accompaniment and large-print editions and the agenda, will go out of print when current supplies are depleted, although the pew edition will continue to be produced for the foreseeable future. LW remains an official hymnal of the LCMS, and it is unlikely that it will ever be formally decommissioned.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The plot revolves around members of the small town of Bridgton, Maine, who after a severe thunderstorm causes the power to go out the night before, meet in a supermarket to pick up supplies. While they struggle to survive, an unnatural mist envelops the town and conceals vicious, Lovecraftian monsters as extreme tensions rise among the survivors. The director revised the ending of the film compared to the novella's ending, a change to which King was amenable. Darabont also sought unique creature designs to differentiate them from his creatures in past films.\nFilming of The Mist began in Shreveport, Louisiana in February 2007. The film was released in the United States and Canada on November 21, 2007; it performed well at the box office and received positive reviews.Darabont has since revealed that he had \"always had it in mind to shoot The Mist in black and white\", a decision inspired by such films as Night of the Living Dead (1968) and the pre-color work of Ray Harryhausen.

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

I admired the Francesco passages rather than feeling engrossed by them and occasionally it felt as if Smith's ideas were so clever they were in danger of getting in the way of the story. But there is no doubt that Smith is dazzling in her daring. The sheer inventive power of her new novel pulls you through, gasping, to the final page.\"\nLaura Miller, in The Guardian comments on duality of the novel: \"While I do not doubt the two halves of How to Be Both may be read in either order with satisfying results, once read, it's impossible to know what it would be like to first encounter it in the alternate order... How to Be Both is unforgettable. I can never know what it would be like to meet George before knowing Del Cossa, so that version of the novel is forever lost to me. It's a bit sad. But it was worth it.\"\nArifa Akbar in The Independent also comments on the dual narrative, writing that \"Smith has written a radical novel, one that becomes two novels, with discrete meanings, through its (re)ordering... How to be Both shows us that the arrangement of a story, even when it's the same story, can change our understanding of it and define our emotional attachments. We may have known this, but to see it enacted with such imagination is dazzling indeed. Those writers making doomy predictions about the death of the novel should read Smith's re-imagined novel/s, and take note of the life it contains.\"\nPatrick Flanery of The Telegraph finds that \"The pain of mourning and loss is seared into the lives of Smith\u2019s two motherless heroines, but despite the novel\u2019s refusal of consolation and the profound seriousness of the questions it explores, How to be Both brims with palpable joy, not only at language, literature, and art\u2019s transformative power, but at the messy business of being human, of wanting to be more than one kind of person at once. The possibilities unleashed by the desire to be neither one thing nor the other means that one may ever and always strive to be both. With great subtlety and inventiveness, Smith continues to expand the boundaries of the novel\".\nRon Charles of The Washington Post writes that \"This gender-blending, genre-blurring story, bounces across centuries, tossing off profound reflections on art and grief, without getting tangled in its own postmodern wires.

Executive producer Guillaume de Fondaumi\u00e8re claimed it was the highest-rated in its genre since Grim Fandango (1998) and considered the release a commercial success, with over one million copies sold. It was named the best adventure game of 2005 by Computer Games Magazine, GameSpy, PC Gamer, and IGN; Adventure Gamers ranked it fifty-seventh of all time. Game Informer listed Fahrenheit last among ten video game openings. Garnett Lee of 1Up.com praised the \"disturbing\" and graceful nature of the story as well as its combination with the gameplay, saying Fahrenheit had set a new standard for future aims of doing so. GameSpot's Alex Navarro highlighted the layers of context and \"heartfelt meaning\" to its use of cinematic gameplay. He enjoyed the narrative, dubbing it \"deep, captivating\", and, echoing Lee, \"disturbing\". The character development, art style, voice acting, and music also saw approval from Navarro. Raymond M. Padilla at GameSpy declared that \"it's so good that it just might save a dying genre\", regarding the plot and main characters to be well-written and the voice cast as one of the best of the year. The controls were admired for their accessibility, while the score was complimented for its \"moody and captivating\" qualities. Writing for GameZone, Ronnie Hobbs liked that the controls helped with narrative immersion, and that this created an emotional connection to the characters. Hobbs' verdict read: \"Despite its flaws, Indigo Prophecy is the definitive interactive story, and not only does it perfect the genre, it redefines it\". Charles Onyett, reviewing the game for IGN, thought it succeeded in its effort to provide a movie-like experience. The feature of multiple playable characters was believed to have worked well, the action choreography and voice acting impressed him, and the soundtrack was described as gripping.Conversely, Lee expressed dislike to the \"rather weakly implemented Metal Gear Solid-like stealth sections\" and Fahrenheit's final third, which he perceived to be rushed. Navarro agreed with Lee on the ending and sneak sequences, criticising the former for its incoherent aspects and latter because it lacked engagement, matching the reason he disapproved of the puzzles. Additionally, Navarro complained that the graphics were unsightly. Padilla disparaged the PC version for being worse than its console counterparts, calling the keyboard and mouse setup \"not fun\". He noted that button commands would sometimes distract from on-screen events. As with Navarro, Padilla termed the graphics an \"undeniable flaw\". Hobbs found it difficult to endure the \"awkward\" camera angles and \"questionable\" character movements. Onyett noticed the same control problem, opining that this could become \"difficult and tedious\". He was displeased with the effects of playing on a computer and, like Lee and Navarro, took issue with the last portions of the game. Onyett chastised the graphics' \"fuzzy\" edges and \"bland\" textures along with the \"stilted and awkward\" animations.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, his obsession with racing makes him an outcast in the slow and cautious snail community, and a constant embarrassment to his older brother, Chet. One day after nearly getting killed by a lawnmower in an attempt to retrieve a fallen tomato, Theo wanders onto a freeway to admire the traffic and wishes upon a star to be fast (though said star is actually an airplane). Suddenly, he ends up sucked into the supercharger of a Chevrolet Camaro, fusing his body with nitrous oxide. Upon waking up, he possesses superspeed and other characteristics of a real car. However, his first time using his new speed ends with him crashing a boy's tricycle into his own garden crew\u2019s tomato garden, resulting in him and Chet getting fired from the crew.\nChet, while scolding Theo for his recklessness and racing obsession, is snatched by a crow, but Theo rescues him near a rundown strip mall called \"Starlight Plaza\". Both are captured by Tito Lopez, a taco truck driver who works at the Plaza, and are brought to a snail race held by him and his co-workers. Theo wins the race in a matter of seconds, astounding both the humans and snails alike, earning the respect of the snails, led by Whiplash, and firmly establishing the name \"Turbo\" as his own. Chet, however, is unhappy with his brother's new abilities and wants him to return to normal. Tito wants to revive Starlight Plaza, with Turbo as a main attraction, but Chet and coworker Angelo angrily dismisses him. Turbo convinces Tito to enter him in the Indy 500 as a competitor, and after the snails divert and strand a tour bus to see Turbo's superspeed, bringing impressive business, Tito\u2019s coworkers agree to put up the entrance fee and accompany them to Indianapolis.\nTito is initially refused entry into the race, but a chance meeting with Gagn\u00e9 allows Turbo to show off his speed, qualifying for the race via achieving a speed of 226 mph, becoming a sensation on social media and forcing the CEO of IndyCar to reluctantly let Turbo compete. The night before the race, after a heated argument with Chet, Turbo sneaks out to meet Gagn\u00e9, who reveals his true colors by demoralizing him, showing that all he cares about is winning, and warning him to back out of the race. The next day at the race, Chet is taken by a young boy and traps him in a glass to see the race, during which the more experienced competitors leave Turbo in last place. At a pitstop, Whiplash and his crew give Turbo a pep talk, advising him to stop racing like a car. Turbo uses his small size to his advantage and rapidly gains ground, but Gagn\u00e9 resorts to cheating and knocks him against the wall, damaging his shell and greatly weakening his superspeed.\nTurbo refuses to give up, and during the final lap and Turbo in the lead, Gagn\u00e9 drives over debris on the last turn and overtakes Turbo, inadvertently causing a crash involving most of the competitors, including Turbo, who wakes to find the race at a standstill but also his shell punctured and his superspeed gone, causing him to give up and hide in his shell. Surprised at seeing his brother losing hope, Chet, with a change of heart, escapes from the glass and meets with Whiplash's crew, and they encourage Turbo to continue. Turbo, inspired by his brother's newfound support, resumes the race. Gagn\u00e9 desperately pursues him by dragging his wrecked car, and attempts to kill Turbo by stepping on him, but Turbo narrowly wins the race by tucking and rolling with his shell.\nStarlight Plaza thrives from Turbo's fame, and all the businesses become spectacular successes and hold elaborate snail races. Whiplash's crew is given special propulsion aids for their shells, while Chet is the track referee and paramedic, and the garden snails have also received special shells of their own. Turbo discovers that his shell has healed, and his superspeed has returned, now ready to race once again.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Joan says that she just witnessed her uncle, Harper's husband, loading bloody children and other people into the back of a lorry. After repeated attempts to censor what Joan saw, Harper tells her that the uncle is saving the children and taking them to a safer place. She tells Joan that she can never tell anyone about what she saw because it would put all of their lives in danger. Harper claims they are on the good side and are making the world a better place.\nAct 2, Scene 1 is roughly 15 years later in a factory where an adult Joan has just begun her professional career as a milliner. Her co-worker Todd is an established hatter and is experienced in the field. Various days at the factory are seen, with the hats that Joan and Todd are making in various stages of completion over time. Todd and Joan exchange basic conversation about this body of work and about their previous works. Todd says that the company has been pushing for hats to be created quicker for the parades; they used to have two weeks to finish a hat but now they only have one.\nScene 2: Joan and Todd learn more about each other through a discussion about their current hat designs. Todd brings up a hypothesis that the way the company gets contracts is corrupt, claiming there is a certain person's brother-in-law that is involved. Joan wants to know more, but Todd doesn't want to talk about it at work. Joan changes the topic, saying she does not like to watch the trials at night. Todd says he watches them every night while drinking Pernod, or absinthe.\nScene 3: Todd and Joan speak about different hat genres: Animal and Abstract.

Joan states that she can't believe that she won. She says she doesn't understand why more aren't kept, because they could be re-used. Todd says that keeping more hats would put them out of work. Joan thinks it is sad that all the hats are burned with the bodies. Todd says that the hats are metaphorical for life. He is not bothered that only three out of nearly 300 hats that he has created made it to the museum. He loves making beauty that disappears. Todd brings up his meeting with \"him\". \"He\" said, \"These things must be thought about\". Todd wonders if \"he\" was talking about the content of their meeting, or if he should fire Todd. Joan reminds Todd about the journalist he knows. Joan hypothesizes that the whole industry is corrupt. She says that if Todd is fired, she will resign. Todd almost tells Joan that he loves her, but quickly changes to saying that he loves beads.\nAct 3, Scene 1 finds Harper and Todd at Harper's house waiting for Joan to return.

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\"Filmmaker Louis Lombardo has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.

Although the recordings for the album finished in June 1989, EMI Records decided to delay the release until 1990, to avoid collision with Marillion's album Seasons End, released in September 1989. Keyboardist Mickey Simmonds who had played with Mike Oldfield, co-wrote the songs on the album, and would continue to play with Fish on the tour. Also guitarist Janick Gers co-wrote the track \"View From the Hill\". Several well known musicians contributed to the album, including former Dire Straits guitarist Hal Lindes, who played guitar on most tracks and also contributed to the writing of three of the album\u2019s songs. Frank Usher, a Fish companion from pre-Marillion times, also contributed. Drums were played by Mark Brzezicki (Big Country) and John Keeble (Spandau Ballet), John Giblin contributed bass and Lu\u00eds Jardim contributed additional percussion. Backing vocals came from Tessa Niles, who had appeared on Clutching at Straws.\nMany of Fish's later works contain lengthy spoken-word lyrics, shorter examples of which can be heard on earlier Marillion albums. He has collaborated with Genesis founder Tony Banks on Banks's Still and Soundtracks albums, singing on the tracks \"Shortcut to Somewhere\", \"Angel Face\" and \"Another Murder of a Day\", co-writing the latter.\nHis solo career has never received the same recognition or attention, and to a lot of people he went missing soon after the Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors album, in February 1990, the album peaked at number 5 in the UK Albums Chart. After finishing the Vigil World Tour at Royal Albert Hall on 9 July 1990, Fish was to enter litigation with EMI records resulting in a High Court injunction that stopped him releasing new music for almost a year. The extensive touring cost him dearly and the decision to go ahead with building a new studio in his home in Haddington Scotland meant that funds were rapidly depleted along with his confidence and his creative energies. \nThe prospect of writing the follow-up for the new label, Polydor, filled him with dread. His second album Internal Exile released in October 1991, was flirting with styles but never got into a particular groove and locking into a direction. The album's music reflected Fish's indulgence in the vast regions of music that he wanted to explore as a solo artist; most notably Celtic music and folk styles. The acquisition of Chris Kimsey as producer could not save the project as he attempted to come to terms with a newly built studio and Fish plagued by bitterness and cynicism toward the industry. Polydor had rushed the album out with his acquiesence resulted in a fractured promotion campaign and low sales, and the UK promoter went bankrupt just as the tour was about to kick off. \nPolydor wanted a new studio album but Fish persisted and he decided to release an album of cover versions called Songs from the Mirror. Produced by James Cassidy, whom Fish met while both were working on Jeff Waynes Spartacus album. They started recording in summer 1992 while simultaneously writing material for the next studio album Suits, a cynical examination lyrically of the music business and executives who still fed Fish's cynical outlook on life. Songs from the Mirror, released in January 1993, became the last album on Polydor. But the album was a turning point for Fish, and fully prepared him for the Suits sessions, material which he had been rehearsing constantly on tour as he struggled to pay bills and musicians. Fish formed his own record company, Dick Bros. after advice from a medium who passed on messages from his grandfather. The Co. was named after the garage business he had started and Fish's father had run throughout his childhood. The first release was Sushi, a live album to follow the five official bootleg releases, on Battleside, a company that temporarily filled the gap between Polydor and Dick Bros., and provided Fish with a lifeline and a quality alternative to the illegal live bootlegs that had followed his career. \nHis confidence had grown and was excited about the new songs on Suits released in 1994, some of which were co-written by James Cassidy who had stayed on since producing the Songs from the Mirror album to assist employing his classical training and expertise with arrangements. It proved invaluable and together with his awareness and experience with modern production techniques the material was guaranteed to enter a new direction and to gain a momentum that would usher the solo career into a new era. Touring took precedent and Fish was well aware that road work was at the expense of writing a new studio album. He went for the break and opted for the two \"Best of's\", Yin and Yang, containing re-recorded material from the Marillion era and solo albums, to give Fish the fuel and introduction to countries he had never managed to reach so far with his career. Released in 1995 these albums allowed him to stay on the road for nearly two years plugging away and hoping for the breakthrough that would give him the space to take a breath and write new material. \nIt never happened until 1997 when, after a tour in Bosnia, playing to the UN troops he reached the stage where he had to get experiences out and onto paper. Fish was introduced to Steven Wilson, who although sympathetic to the progressive rock genre, had no intention of getting involved in a regressive album, which suited Fish fine and welcomed Wilson's influence with open ears. The writing sessions were open and new songs and approaches were generated from a healthy friction between Wilson and Fish as they fought for their identities in the material. Grooves and loops led the rhythmic foundations into what they described as \"Progressive Nouveaux\", still retaining the drama and tension associated with Fish's previous work, but taking it into a more modern setting with a new edge and aggression. With Calum Malcolm's mix and Elliot Ness engineering skills provided a technical quality to match the standard of the writing on Sunsets on Empire. But once again the problem of underfunded promotion and advertising was to foil Fish's plans and a 115 date tour in 22 different countries was set up to attempt to give the album the attention it deserved. Seven months after its release the tour ground to an exhausted conclusion in December 1997. With a combination of tour losses and bad debts from third parties, Fish could no longer survive as an independent artist releasing his albums through Dick Bros. He was effectively broke and financing the recording of the album Raingods with Zippos were beyond his means. \nFish was asked to take part in a writing retreat in France by Miles Copeland. Together with 23 songwriters from all over the world, Fish rediscovered himself and when he returned with new songs he was excited and eager to get on with the job of redefining his career, and writing the rest of the new album. Three songs were taken from the sessions in France for the set up for Raingods with Zippos, together with a 25-minute epic called \"Plague of Ghosts\" written together with Tony Turrell and Mark Daghorn featuring Steven Wilson on guitar, and two tracks written with his old friend Mickey Simmonds. Raingods with Zippos was released by Roadrunner Records in April 1999. The Raingods album is often hailed as one of Fish's greatest solo achievements along with his 1990 debut.In May 2001, Fish released his first studio album on his new independent label the Chocolate Frog Record Company, Fellini Days, which Fish co-wrote with John Wesley and John Young. Field of Crows was Fish's eighth solo studio album originally released in December 2003 and then to retail in May 2004. The album was mainly co-written with Bruce Watson and Irvin Duguid.Fish appeared at World Bowl XI, 14 June 2003, Hampden Park, Glasgow. His performance included a rousing rendition of \"Caledonia\" before kick-off. In 2005, he won a Celebrity Music edition of The Weakest Link, beating Eggsy of Goldie Lookin Chain in the final round, sharing \u00a318,750 with Eggsy's charity and his own.\nOn 26 August 2007, Fish performed at the 'Hobble on The Cobbles' show at the Market Square in Aylesbury. He was accompanied on stage by his four former Marillion bandmates from the classic line-up (Mark Kelly, Steve Rothery, Ian Mosley and Pete Trewavas) for one song: \"Market Square Heroes\". This was the first time they had performed together in nearly two decades. In a press interview following the event, Fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, claiming that \"Hogarth does a great job with the band ... We forged different paths over the 19 years.\"His album 13th Star was released on 12 September 2007 as a specially packaged pre-release version available to order from his website. A UK tour for this album commenced in March 2008, supported by Glyder. In February 2008, Fish was confirmed to be the Friday-night headline act at NEARFest X. He also appeared with BBC Radio 2's Bob Harris on GMTV to promote Childline Rocks, a charity concert.\nIn 2008, Fish presented a Friday evening radio show, Fish on Friday, for digital radio station Planet Rock. When the station was faced with closure, Malcolm Bluemel (with the help of Fish, Tony Iommi, Ian Anderson and Gary Moore) helped save Planet Rock by buying the station.On 9 June 2008, Fish embarked on his first full North American tour in eleven years. At each stop, he hosted a pre-show meet-and-greet with his fans.On 20 and 21 October 2012, Fish hosted Fish Convention 2012 in Leamington Spa. He performed two acoustic sets and two electric sets, including material from his then upcoming studio album, A Feast of Consequences. He also performed \"Grendel\", a fan-favourite Marillion B-side, twice. A Feast of Consequences was released in September 2013 to positive reviews, supported by the single \"Blind to the Beautiful\".\nFish celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Marillion album Clutching at Straws on tour in 2018, alongside debuting material from his then upcoming studio album Weltschmerz. A three track EP, A Parley With Angels, was released in September 2018.In April 2020, Fish revived his Fish on Friday show in the form of a weekly live video podcast, initially broadcast on Facebook (later simulcast on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter). Created during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep in touch with his fans and share stories from his career, the show was voted as the Event of the Year by Prog magazine readers in 2021. Fish on Friday remains active as of 2023, with new episodes of the show broadcast weekly.\nIn September 2020, Fish released Weltschmerz, his final studio album. The album was supported by the singles \"Weltschmerz\", \"Garden of Remembrance\" and \"This Party's Over\". The album received positive reviews and was commercially successful, having sold over 60,000 copies to date. Fish toured Weltschmerz and celebrated the 30th anniversary of A Vigil In A Wilderness of Mirrors as part of the Vigil's End tour in 2021. The tour was documented on the live album Vigil's End Tour 2021, released on physical formats in December 2022 and digitally in March 2023.In November 2023 Primary Wave Music struck a deal with Fish, to acquire the singer and lyricist\u2019s master royalties and writer\u2019s share for songs he wrote and performed with Marillion.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The size of the country is about 289.5 square miles (750 km2) and it is about 29 miles (47 km) long and 16 miles (26 km) wide.Known as \"The Nature Island of the Caribbean\" due to its lush scenery and varied flora and fauna, Dominica is largely covered by rainforest and is home to the world's second-largest hot spring, Boiling Lake. Within its borders lie two ecoregions: Windward Islands moist forests and Windward Islands xeric scrub. The most mountainous of the Lesser Antilles, its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters, the largest of these being (north-to-south) Morne aux Diables, Morne Diablotins (the highest on the island at 1,447 m), Morne Trois Pitons and Morne Anglais. Morne Trois Pitons National Park is a tropical forest blended with volcanic features; it was recognised as a World Heritage Site on 4 April 1995, a distinction it shares with four other Caribbean islands. The Calibishie area in the country's northeast has sandy beaches. Some plants and animals thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica's forests. The island has several protected areas, including Cabrits National Park, as well as 365 rivers. For a few years the government sought to encourage the island as an ecotourism destination, although the hurricane of 2017 has since changed these plans. The country had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.06/10, ranking it 166th globally out of 172 countries.There are two primary population centres: the capital Roseau (with 14,725 inhabitants in 2011) and Portsmouth (with 4,167 inhabitants in 2011). The main centres tend to be located around the coast, with the mountainous interior sparsely populated.Dominica is especially vulnerable to hurricanes as the island is located in what is referred to as the hurricane region. In 1979, Hurricane David struck the island as a Category 4 hurricane, causing widespread and extreme damage. On 17 August 2007, Hurricane Dean, a Category 1 hurricane at the time, hit the island.  A mother and her seven-year-old son died when a landslide caused by the heavy rains crushed their house. In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit estimated that 100 to 125 homes were damaged, and that the agricultural sector was extensively damaged, in particular the banana crop. In August 2015, Tropical Storm Erika caused extensive flooding and landslides across the island. Multiple communities were evacuated and upwards of 30 people were killed. According to a Rapid Damage and Impact Assessment prepared for Dominica by the World Bank, the total damage and losses from the storm were US$484.82 million or 90% of Dominica's yearly GDP. Category 5 Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017 and caused losses of approximately US$930 million or 226% of GDP.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In spite of the apparent conclusion, this was then followed by a weekly television series, V: The Series, from 1984 to 1985 that continued the story a year after The Final Battle. Johnson left V during production of The Final Battle due to disagreements with NBC over how the story should progress.In November 2005, Entertainment Weekly named V one of the 10 best miniseries on DVD. The article noted, \"As a parable about it-can-happen-here fascism, V was far from subtle, but it carved a place for lavish and intelligent sci-fi on TV. Its impact can still be felt in projects like Taken and The 4400.\" (The 4400's executive producer Scott Peters later helmed ABC's 2009 reboot.) In December 2008, Entertainment Weekly put V on its list \"The Sci-Fi 25: The Genre's Best Since 1982\", and called Visitor leader Diana's devouring a guinea pig \"one of the best TV reveals ever.\"For many years, Johnson has campaigned to revive V, and even wrote a sequel novel, V: The Second Generation, which picked up the story 20 years after the original miniseries (but omitted the events of The Final Battle and V: The Series). Warner Bros. Television (which owns the television rights to the V franchise) declined to make a continuation as Johnson had planned, and opted for a remake instead. A reimagining of V premiered on ABC on November 3, 2009, and ran for two seasons. Though Johnson was not involved in the remake, which featured all new characters, executive producer Scott Peters said that it would nod to the most iconic moments from the original franchise and may potentially include actors from the original in new roles. Both Jane Badler and Marc Singer appeared in the second season. As of 2009, Johnson has also said he is still moving ahead with his plans for a big-screen remake of his original V miniseries though no progress has been made.\nOn February 6, 2018, Desilu Studios announced that it would be producing a feature film of V. The film was to be written and directed by Kenneth Johnson and produced by John Hermansen, Barry Opper, and Johnson. Johnson added, \"We are delighted to team up with Desilu to bring the timeless \u2013 and timely \u2013 story of resistance against tyranny into the 21st century ... V will be the first of a cinematic trilogy, which will tell the full epic tale in the manner I always envisioned.\" However, in late 2018, CBS (owners of the Desilu name) reportedly had initiated legal action against Charles B.

In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like Images and 3 Women is just the size of the canvas.

This genre includes such critically revered films as Psycho, Repulsion, and Persona.\" Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to Altman's earlier film That Cold Day in the Park (1969) and his later 3 Women, declaring them a trilogy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Astaire had already created an early dream dance on film with \"I Used To Be Color Blind\" in Carefree (1938), and had worked with Minnelli on a dream ballet insert for the \"Limehouse Blues\" number from Ziegfeld Follies (1945). The dream ballet genre achieved popularity when Agnes de Mille choreographed a celebrated sequence for the 1943 stage hit Oklahoma!.\n\n\"This Is a Day for Love\": Bemelmans conducts the school pupils in their national anthem.\n\"Angel\": Conned into believing that Astaire is her guardian angel, Bremer sings this song of anticipation.\n\"Dream Ballet\": An extended (approximately 15 minute) routine for Astaire, Bremer, and various others, which Minnelli has described as, \"the first surrealistic ballet in film\". The Dali-esque scenery and the main characters (Astaire and Bremer) are dressed in pastel shades as are characters in harmony with them - such as the three handmaidens near the end. Most of the other characters - who have an aggressive, disruptive quality, and bring spiky dance rhythms into play - wear vivid primary colors making them stand out from the background scenery and from the main characters, adding to the powerful illusion of space - a quality remarked upon by New York Times dance critic James Martin at the time. In the middle of the ballet, Astaire inserts a romantic duet for himself and Bremer to \"Will You Marry Me\", performed by Bremer and the dubbed-in voice of Trudy Erwin, and much of the choreography of this section has been said to bear the signature of Astaire himself.\n\"Yolanda\": Astaire serenades Bremer with this attractive melody while playing the harp (dubbed by jazz harpist Bobby Maxwell). He follows the song with a very brief solo dance routine around the harp.\n\"Coffee Time\": A jazzy and exuberant dance routine for Astaire, Bremer, and chorus, blending complex repeated syncopated rhythms (inspired by Loring's idea of setting a five-count dance phrase against a four-count musical phrase) in a visually elaborate setting incorporating a wavy black and white dance floor (designed by Irene Sharaff) and chorus dancers dressed in brightly colored costumes.

Reporting from the time says that audiences connected with her first record almost immediately, and result being several hit singles, and multiple Dove nomination. As well, the album received critical acclaim, and \"an exponentially increasing grassroots fan base that propelled her career forward in great leaps\". Her self-titled debut album, released in 2004, was the highest selling female solo debut album for the year, and attracted GMA nominations for both Female Vocalist and New Artist of the Year. The radio single All I Need reached the number one position on the U.S. charts.She released her second album, Imagination, in August 2005. The CD prompted CCM Magazine to label her as \"the future of Christian music\".Dillon appears on the Music Inspired by The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe soundtrack of 2005, singing \"Hero\". One track from Imagination, entitled \"Dreamer\", is featured in the end credits for the 2005 film of the same name, starring Kurt Russell and Dakota Fanning).

As described by Dillon,Waking Up is the most joyful record I\u2019ve made... even though it revolves around themes of brokenness and this feeling of being really, really small in the presence of God. When the Lord is growing something in me, it feels like a lot of things are dying\u2014because they really are. And when the Lord is making things soft and vulnerable in me, it's really painful. But even so, I think this is the freest sounding project I\u2019ve created.Joining Ed Cash in the co-production of Waking Up were Will Hunt and John Alagia (an associate of John Mayer and Dave Matthews Band). As CBN.com explains,Influenced for years by penetrating and poetic writers like Rich Mullins, Keith Green, and Sara Groves, Bethany has tended to gravitate toward themes that require a measure of courage and open-heartedness to explore... Waking Up embraces big questions of suffering, barrenness, vulnerability, romance, and faithfulness. Like the writers Bethany has modeled herself after, she proves herself willing to live and create in that place of ambivalent tension that inevitably comes from refusing to settle for easy, feel-good answers.

Randall went on to found a church in New Durham, New Hampshire that we now recognize as the first Free Will Baptist Church in New England. Rev. Randall was instrumental in planting more than 50 churches throughout the region in his 28 years as a circuit riding preacher. The churches were organized into quarterly and yearly meetings that became a force in the revivals of the nineteenth century, missions, and education. \nBenjamin Randall is recognized as the leader of the Free Will Baptists, an indigenous American religious movement which ordained persons of color and women in the early days of the nineteenth century. The Free Will Baptists (also known as Free, General, Open Communion, and Antislavery Baptists) were aggressive church planters on the American frontier and embraced missions among immigrant and freedmen populations, as well as, spreading the gospel internationally.

Large-scale Jewish immigration from abroad, mainly from Eastern Europe took place during the British Mandate, though Jewish immigration started during the Ottoman period. The future of Palestine was hotly disputed between Arabs and Jews. In 1947, the total Jewish ownership of land in Palestine was 1,850,000 dunams or 1,850 square kilometres (714 sq mi), which is 7.04% of the total land of Palestine. Public property or \"crown lands\", the bulk of which was in the Negev, belonging to the government of Palestine may have made up as much as 70% of the total land; with the Arabs, Christians and others owning the rest.The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan proposed a division of Mandate Palestine between an Arab and a Jewish state, with Jerusalem and the surrounding area to be a corpus separatum under a special international regime. The regions allotted to the proposed Arab state included what became the Gaza Strip, and almost all of what became the West Bank, as well as other areas.\nThe Partition Plan was passed by the UN General Assembly in November 1947. The Partition Plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership, but rejected by the Arab leaders. The Arab League threatened to take military measures to prevent the partition of Palestine and to ensure the national rights of the Palestinian Arab population. One day before the expiration of the British Mandate for Palestine, on 14 May 1948, Israel declared its independence within the borders of the Jewish State set out in the Partition Plan. US President Harry Truman recognized the State of Israel de facto the following day. The Arab countries declared war on the newly formed State of Israel heralding the start of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. Arab countries announced \"an intervention in Palestine to restore law and order\", heralding the start of the 1948 Palestine War.After the 1947\u20131949 Palestine war, the 1949 Armistice Agreements established the separation lines between the combatants, leaving Israel in control of some of the areas designated for the Arab state under the Partition Plan, Transjordan in control of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Egypt in control of the Gaza Strip and Syria in control of the Himmah Area.\nIn 1950, Jordan annexed the West Bank. Only the United Kingdom formally recognized the annexation of the West Bank, excluding the case of East Jerusalem which was de facto recognized. In the Gaza Strip the Arab League formed the All-Palestine Government, which operated under Egypt occupation.\nArticle 24 of the Palestinian National Covenant of 1964, which established the Palestine Liberation Organization, stated: \"This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area\" (i.e. the areas of the former Mandate Palestine controlled by Jordan, Egypt and Syria, respectively).\nIsrael captured both territories in the 1967 Six-Day War, as well as other territory belonging to Egypt and Syria. Since then, these territories have been designated Israeli-occupied territories. Immediately after the war, on 19 June 1967, the Israeli government offered to return the Golan Heights to Syria, the Sinai to Egypt and most of the West Bank to Jordan in exchange for peace. At the Khartoum Summit in September, the Arab parties responded to this overture by declaring \"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel and no negotiations with Israel.\"UN Security Council Resolution 242 introduced the \"Land for Peace\" formula for normalizing relations between Israel and its neighbors. This formula was used when Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in 1979 in exchange for a peace treaty. While that treaty mentioned a \"linkage\" between Israeli\u2013Egyptian peace and Palestinian autonomy, the formerly Egyptian-occupied territory in Gaza was excluded from the agreement, and remained under Israeli control.\nThe Oslo Accords of the early 1990s between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority. This was an interim organization created to administer a limited form of Palestinian self-governance in the territories for a period of five years during which final-status negotiations would take place. The Palestinian Authority carried civil responsibility in some rural areas, as well as security responsibility in the major cities of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Although the five-year interim period expired in 1999, the final status agreement has yet to be concluded despite attempts such as the 2000 Camp David Summit, the Taba summit, and the unofficial Geneva Accords.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Awaiting the return of her husband Menelaus for 17 years \u2014 the ten of the Trojan War and another seven for the search \u2014 Helen remains faithful to Menelaus and the promises she has made him: Helen made two oaths, one to the Spartan river Eurotas and another on the head of Menelaus himself as sanctifying object. Menelaus also swears fidelity to Helen: so seriously do husband and wife take their vows that they agree to commit suicide and never marry another if their plans fail. Such importance to oath-keeping is consonant with general practice during the time period (Torrance, 2009). With these oaths, Helen and Menelaus declare their love for each other and their desire to live only with the other. These oaths prove their devotion and exemplify the importance of oaths. Given the play\u2019s humor and Euripides\u2019 general challenging of norms and values, it remains uncertain what our playwright\u2019s own views are.\nIdentity and Reputation: Throughout all the different permutations of the story of Helen and the Trojan War, what makes the Trojan war distinctive is the fact that it is always caused, somehow, by Helen as the supreme embodiment of female beauty, whether she is or is not physically in Troy and whether she acts as an enthusiastic partner of Paris or as a reluctant victim of his unwanted rape. Euripides expands more on this idea by presenting his play largely from Helen\u2019s point of view, revealing how she truly feels about being the symbolic villain of the Trojan War. Helen\u2019s character in the play is deeply affected by the losses of the people who have died fighting to bring her back to her homeland and husband and expresses this guilt frequently: \u201cThe wrecked city of Ilium / is given up to the teeth of fire, / all through me and the deaths I caused, / all for my name of affliction\u201d (lines 196-198). Despite this guilt, she also feels anger for being made into a symbol that people can project their hate on, even though they do not know her: \u201cI have done nothing wrong and yet my reputation / is bad, and worse than a true evil is it to bear / the burden of faults that are not truly yours\u201d (lines 270-272). Although she spends a lot of the beginning of the play feeling pity for the men who have died and herself as well, Euripides\u2019 Helen is independent, confident, and intelligent. She displays her ability to think on her feet as she formulates a workable plan to return home and as she rejects her husband Menelaus\u2019 cockamamy plans. Therefore, Euripides in his play portrays a living and breathing Helen filled with compassion and wit, not at all similar to the blameworthy person others believe her to be.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

After repeated attempts to censor what Joan saw, Harper tells her that the uncle is saving the children and taking them to a safer place. She tells Joan that she can never tell anyone about what she saw because it would put all of their lives in danger. Harper claims they are on the good side and are making the world a better place.\nAct 2, Scene 1 is roughly 15 years later in a factory where an adult Joan has just begun her professional career as a milliner. Her co-worker Todd is an established hatter and is experienced in the field. Various days at the factory are seen, with the hats that Joan and Todd are making in various stages of completion over time. Todd and Joan exchange basic conversation about this body of work and about their previous works. Todd says that the company has been pushing for hats to be created quicker for the parades; they used to have two weeks to finish a hat but now they only have one.\nScene 2: Joan and Todd learn more about each other through a discussion about their current hat designs. Todd brings up a hypothesis that the way the company gets contracts is corrupt, claiming there is a certain person's brother-in-law that is involved. Joan wants to know more, but Todd doesn't want to talk about it at work. Joan changes the topic, saying she does not like to watch the trials at night. Todd says he watches them every night while drinking Pernod, or absinthe.\nScene 3: Todd and Joan speak about different hat genres: Animal and Abstract. Joan changes the subject and asks why Todd doesn't do something (regarding the corruption). He says he spends days wondering what he should do.\nScene 4: Joan and Todd compliment each other on their almost completed hats. Todd announces he is going to talk to \"him\" (someone working above Todd). He says he is going to talk about the brother-in-law and hint at the possibility of leaking information to a friend of his who is a journalist. He say that if he lost his job, he'd miss Joan.\nScene 5 shows the completed hats of Todd and Joan on the heads of prisoners being marched to have the hats \"judged\" in the trials.\nScene 6 returns to the factory. Joan states that she can't believe that she won. She says she doesn't understand why more aren't kept, because they could be re-used. Todd says that keeping more hats would put them out of work. Joan thinks it is sad that all the hats are burned with the bodies. Todd says that the hats are metaphorical for life. He is not bothered that only three out of nearly 300 hats that he has created made it to the museum. He loves making beauty that disappears. Todd brings up his meeting with \"him\". \"He\" said, \"These things must be thought about\". Todd wonders if \"he\" was talking about the content of their meeting, or if he should fire Todd. Joan reminds Todd about the journalist he knows. Joan hypothesizes that the whole industry is corrupt. She says that if Todd is fired, she will resign. Todd almost tells Joan that he loves her, but quickly changes to saying that he loves beads.\nAct 3, Scene 1 finds Harper and Todd at Harper's house waiting for Joan to return. They discuss the paranoia caused by not knowing what side various aspects of nature is on. They are very worried about Joan who eventually returns in a very frazzled state. She delivers a monologue about her fear of every natural thing on her journey (a stream, horses, light, and dark). She does not know whose side of the war they are on.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the subsequent years since his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that \"West's melding of multiple genres into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music.\" West's rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound \"just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith\". Early in his career, West pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed \"chipmunk-soul\", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs.On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay. The record saw West diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing. Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005), arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007), synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013), gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021), and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Harper's niece (Young Joan) enters and claims that she can't sleep. After a few attempts by her aunt to get her back in bed, she tells Harper that she just came back into the house after climbing out of her window to investigate a sound that she heard. Joan says that she just witnessed her uncle, Harper's husband, loading bloody children and other people into the back of a lorry. After repeated attempts to censor what Joan saw, Harper tells her that the uncle is saving the children and taking them to a safer place. She tells Joan that she can never tell anyone about what she saw because it would put all of their lives in danger. Harper claims they are on the good side and are making the world a better place.\nAct 2, Scene 1 is roughly 15 years later in a factory where an adult Joan has just begun her professional career as a milliner. Her co-worker Todd is an established hatter and is experienced in the field. Various days at the factory are seen, with the hats that Joan and Todd are making in various stages of completion over time. Todd and Joan exchange basic conversation about this body of work and about their previous works. Todd says that the company has been pushing for hats to be created quicker for the parades; they used to have two weeks to finish a hat but now they only have one.\nScene 2: Joan and Todd learn more about each other through a discussion about their current hat designs. Todd brings up a hypothesis that the way the company gets contracts is corrupt, claiming there is a certain person's brother-in-law that is involved. Joan wants to know more, but Todd doesn't want to talk about it at work. Joan changes the topic, saying she does not like to watch the trials at night. Todd says he watches them every night while drinking Pernod, or absinthe.\nScene 3: Todd and Joan speak about different hat genres: Animal and Abstract. Joan changes the subject and asks why Todd doesn't do something (regarding the corruption). He says he spends days wondering what he should do.\nScene 4: Joan and Todd compliment each other on their almost completed hats. Todd announces he is going to talk to \"him\" (someone working above Todd). He says he is going to talk about the brother-in-law and hint at the possibility of leaking information to a friend of his who is a journalist. He say that if he lost his job, he'd miss Joan.\nScene 5 shows the completed hats of Todd and Joan on the heads of prisoners being marched to have the hats \"judged\" in the trials.\nScene 6 returns to the factory. Joan states that she can't believe that she won. She says she doesn't understand why more aren't kept, because they could be re-used. Todd says that keeping more hats would put them out of work. Joan thinks it is sad that all the hats are burned with the bodies. Todd says that the hats are metaphorical for life. He is not bothered that only three out of nearly 300 hats that he has created made it to the museum. He loves making beauty that disappears. Todd brings up his meeting with \"him\". \"He\" said, \"These things must be thought about\". Todd wonders if \"he\" was talking about the content of their meeting, or if he should fire Todd. Joan reminds Todd about the journalist he knows. Joan hypothesizes that the whole industry is corrupt. She says that if Todd is fired, she will resign. Todd almost tells Joan that he loves her, but quickly changes to saying that he loves beads.\nAct 3, Scene 1 finds Harper and Todd at Harper's house waiting for Joan to return. They discuss the paranoia caused by not knowing what side various aspects of nature is on. They are very worried about Joan who eventually returns in a very frazzled state. She delivers a monologue about her fear of every natural thing on her journey (a stream, horses, light, and dark). She does not know whose side of the war they are on.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

According to Hoffenberg, Terry Southern and I wrote Candy for the money.  Olympia Press, $500 flat.  He was in Switzerland, I was in Paris.  We did it in letters.  But when it got to be a big deal in the States, everybody was taking it seriously.  Do you remember what kind of shit people were saying?  One guy wrote a review about how Candy was a satire on Candide.  So right away I went back and reread Voltaire to see if he was right.  That's what happens to you.  It's as if you vomit in the gutter and everybody starts saying it's the greatest new art form, so you go back to see it, and, by God, you have to agree.\nSouthern had a different take on the novel's genesis, claiming it was  based on a short story he had written about a girl living in New York's Greenwich Village neighborhood, a Good Samaritan-type, who became involved with a hunchback. After he read Southern's story in manuscript form, Hoffenberg suggested the character should have more adventures. Southern suggested that Hoffenberg write a story about the girl, and he came up with the chapter in which Candy meets Dr. Krankheit at the hospital.\nHe wrote that and I began to write other chapters. Every once in a while, I would show him what I wrote. It was like telling jokes back and forth. Your hearing of the joke becomes as important as telling the joke. In that sense, it was such a good thing because there was this built-in obligation to write the next chapter. It was like returning a good favor. That approach worked quite well and was in perfect sync with the kind of creative work that people try to do together.\nThey finished the book in the commune of Tourrettes-sur-Loup France, in a cottage that Southern's friend Mordecai Richler rented for them.Southern and Hoffenberg battled Olympia Press publisher Maurice Girodias over the story's copyright after the book was published in North America by Putnam under the authors' own names and became a best-seller.\nIn 2006, Playboy Magazine listed Candy among the \"25 Sexiest Novels Ever Written\", and described the story as a \"young heroine's picaresque travels, a kind of sexual pinball machine that lights up academia, gardeners, the medical profession, mystics and bohemians.\"The novel was made into a film by Christian Marquand in 1968 as Candy.\nSeveral of the items depicted in this book were included by director Gail Palmer in the 1978 adult film The Erotic Adventures of Candy whose opening credits state it is based on Voltaire's Candide.\nThe book The Candy Men by Nile Southern, published in 2004 by Arcade Publishing, details the lives of Southern and Hoffenberg as they came to write, publish and then endure the wildly improbable success of the novel.

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman considered the text's playfulness \"exhilarating to many within the discipline [of literary criticism]\", acknowledging that to others it \"may prove a disadvantage\". Morris Dickstein, writing for The New York Sun, called it \"a dizzying commentary on the work of Hegel and Genet\".\nAccording to Jane Marie Todd, Glas is a study of literary genre, and its seeming defiance of genre \"allows this curious and challenging text [to offer] a direct contribution to literary theory: in both form and subject matter, it details a new way of viewing genre definitions.\" Derrida himself described the text as \"a sort of a wake,\" in reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Alan Roughley argues, It is clear that his reading of Joyce's text haunts the way in which Derrida has constructed his exploration of Hegel and Genet by positioning separate and discrete textual columns next to each other so that it is necessary to read intertextually and follow the ways in which the textual play operates across and between the margins or borders of the page(s) and space(s) separating the columns.\nJohn Sturrock, reviewing the English translation of Glas for The New York Times, commented that \"as a piece of writing it has no known genre\". In his estimation reading the book is \"a scandalously random experience\" given the problem of how to read the two printed columns\u2014consecutively or alternately from section to section. Though it is an \"exuberantly clever, punning text\", it \"asks too much of one's patience and intelligence; our defense against a text declaring itself to be unreadable may be to call its author's bluff and simply leave it unread.\" Sturrock praises the English translation (by Richard Rand and John P. Leavey Jr.), but notes that a text such as Glas by definition cannot be translated and that Glas in English \"mocks . . . the notion that translation achieves a semantic identity from one language to another.\" Sturrock's review was severely criticized in two responses: one writer reprimanded Sturrock for a \"dismissive account\", another pointed out that what Sturrock refers to as a \"random experience\" (of the text's format) is in fact reminiscent of the \"sacred texts of Judaism\". The English translation was praised by Ned Lukacher in Modern Language Notes as an \"almost absolutely singular and exemplary achievement\".Compellingly, Glas has often been cited as evidence that deconstruction might theorize hypertext or that hypertext might instantiate deconstruction. In the early 1990s, George Landow declared Derrida's radical book Glas should be understood as \"digitalized, hypertextual Derrida\", and MLA president J. Hillis Miller associated it with \"the new multi-linear multimedia hypertext that is rapidly becoming the characteristic mode of expression both in culture and in the study of cultural forms\". Whereas Mark Taylor argues that \"deconstruction theorizes writerly practices that anticipate hypertexts\", Geoffrey Bennington advises that if writing had a privileged empirical form for Derrida, it would be the computer\u2014yet on the other hand, \"hypertexts can just as well be presented as a fulfillment of a metaphysical view of writing\". Gregory Ulmer argues that Derrida's writings \"already reflect an internalization of the electronic media\", and Mark Poster holds that \"computer writing instantiates the play that deconstruction raises only as a corrective\". Moreover, as scholars like Peter Krapp observed, both Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines and Derrida's Glas look astonishingly similar and argue parallel points. Both books are the product of radical textual montage, using elaborate cut-and-paste strategies that caused problems in getting into print; both were reissued in the 1980s and hailed as influential for an entire generation: \"Both were vigorously misrepresented by acolytes and detractors and unfairly associated with exclusively text-based approaches to contemporary media.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

His father was at various times a laborer and a Saint Louis policeman.Green began studying guitar while he was in primary school. He received early instruction in guitar playing from his father, who played blues and folk music. He studied for a year with Forrest Alcorn, but he was mostly self-taught, learning from listening to records.\nHe first performed in a professional setting at the age of 13 as a member of a gospel music ensemble. Through his 20s, he was a member of jazz and R&B bands. His influences were Charlie Christian, Charlie Parker, Lester Young, and Jimmy Raney. Green's style mimicked that of a saxophonist, playing single note rather than chords.His first recordings were at the age of 28, in St. Louis with tenor saxophonist Jimmy Forrest for the United label, where Green played alongside drummer Elvin Jones. Green recorded with Jones for several albums in the mid-1960s. In 1959, Lou Donaldson discovered Green playing in a bar in St. Louis and hired him for his touring band. Green moved to New York at some point during 1959\u201360.\nDonaldson introduced Green to Alfred Lion of Blue Note Records. From 1961\u20131965 he was Blue Note's house guitarist. Rather than using Green as a sideman, as was the  Blue Note practice, Lion arranged for him to record as a group leader. However, due to Green's lack of confidence, the initial recording session was only released in 2001 as First Session.Despite the shelving of his first session, Green's recording relationship with Blue Note was to last, with a few exceptions, throughout the 1960s. From 1961 to 1965, Green made more appearances on Blue Note albums as leader or sideman than anyone else. His first album as a leader was Grant's First Stand. This was followed in the same year by Green Street and Grantstand. Grant was named Best New Star in the Down Beat Critics' Poll, in 1962. He often provided support to others musicians on Blue Note, including saxophonists Hank Mobley, Ike Quebec, Stanley Turrentine, and organist Larry Young.\nSunday Mornin' , The Latin Bit and Feelin' the Spirit are all concept albums, each taking a musical theme or style: gospel, Latin and spirituals respectively. Grant carried off his more commercial dates with artistic success during this period: Idle Moments (1963), featuring Joe Henderson and Bobby Hutcherson and Solid (1964), are described by jazz critics as two of Green's best recordings.\nMany of Green's recordings were not released during his lifetime. These include several albums with pianist Sonny Clark recorded in 1961\u20131962 included in The Complete Grant Green & Sonny Clark released by Mosaic in 1997, and two albums from 1964 (Matador and Solid) that featured McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones from the John Coltrane Quartet.\nIn 1966 Green left Blue Note and recorded for other labels, including Verve. From 1967 to 1969 he was inactive due to personal problems and the effects of heroin addiction.  In 1969 he returned to Blue Note but played mostly in R&B settings. His recordings from this period include the commercially successful Green Is Beautiful and the soundtrack to the film The Final Comedown.\nGreen spent much of 1978 in the hospital and, against the advice of doctors, went back on the road to earn money. While in New York to play an engagement at George Benson's Breezin' Lounge, he collapsed in his car of a heart attack and died on January 31, 1979. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, and was survived by six children, including his son Grant Green Jr., who is also a guitarist.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hohokam, Mogollon, and Ancestral Puebloan cultures were among those that flourished throughout the state. Many of their pueblos, cliffside dwellings, rock paintings and other prehistoric treasures have survived and attract thousands of tourists each year.\nIn 1539, Marcos de Niza, a Spanish Franciscan, became the first European to contact Native Americans. He explored parts of the present state and made contact with native inhabitants, probably the Sobaipuri. The expedition of Spanish explorer Coronado entered the area in 1540\u20131542 during its search for C\u00edbola. Few Spanish settlers migrated to Arizona. One of the first settlers in Arizona was Jos\u00e9 Romo de Vivar.Father Kino was the next European in the region. A member of the Society of Jesus (\"Jesuits\"), he led the development of a chain of missions in the region. He converted many of the Indians to Christianity in the Pimer\u00eda Alta (now southern Arizona and northern Sonora) in the 1690s and early 18th century. Spain founded presidios (\"fortified towns\") at Tubac in 1752 and Tucson in 1775.When Mexico achieved its independence from the Kingdom of Spain and its Spanish Empire in 1821, what is now Arizona became part of its Territory of Nueva California, (\"New California\"), also known as Alta California (\"Upper California\"). Descendants of ethnic Spanish and mestizo settlers from the colonial years still lived in the area at the time of the arrival of later European-American migrants from the United States.\nDuring the Mexican\u2013American War (1847\u20131848), the U.S. Army occupied the national capital of Mexico City and pursued its claim to much of northern Mexico, including what later became Arizona Territory in 1863 and later the State of Arizona in 1912. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) specified that, in addition to language and cultural rights of the existing inhabitants of former Mexican citizens being considered as inviolable, the sum of $15 million in compensation (equivalent to $528,230,769.23 in 2023) be paid to the Republic of Mexico. In 1853, the U.S. acquired the land south below the Gila River from Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase along the southern border area as encompassing the best future southern route for a transcontinental railway.What is now the state of Arizona was administered by the United States government as part of the Territory of New Mexico from 1850 until the southern part of that region seceded from the Union to form the Territory of Arizona. This newly established territory was formally organized by the federal government of the Confederate States on Saturday, January 18, 1862, when President Jefferson Davis approved and signed An Act to Organize the Territory of Arizona, marking the first official use of the name \"Territory of Arizona\". The Southern territory supplied the Confederate government with men, horses, and equipment. Formed in 1862, Arizona scout companies served with the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Arizona has the westernmost military engagement on record during the Civil War with the Battle of Picacho Pass (1862).\nThe Federal government declared a new U.S. Arizona Territory, consisting of the western half of earlier New Mexico Territory, in Washington, D.C., on February 24, 1863. These new boundaries would later form the basis of the state. The first territorial capital, Prescott, was founded in 1864 following a gold rush to central Arizona. The capital was later moved to Tucson, back to Prescott, and then to its final location in Phoenix in a series of controversial moves as different regions of the territory gained and lost political influence with the growth and development of the territory.Although names including \"Gadsonia\", \"Pimeria\", \"Montezuma\" and \"Arizuma\" had been considered for the territory, when 16th President Abraham Lincoln signed the final bill, it read \"Arizona\", and that name was adopted. (Montezuma was not derived from the Aztec emperor, but was the sacred name of a divine hero to the Pima people of the Gila River Valley. It was probably considered \u2013 and rejected \u2013 for its sentimental value before Congress settled on the name \"Arizona\".)Brigham Young, leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City in Utah, sent Mormons to Arizona in the mid- to late 19th century. They founded Mesa, Snowflake, Heber, Safford, and other towns. They also settled in the Phoenix Valley (or \"Valley of the Sun\"), Tempe, Prescott, and other areas. The Mormons settled what became northern Arizona and northern New Mexico. At the time these areas were in a part of the former New Mexico Territory.\nDuring the nineteenth century, a series of gold and silver rushes occurred in the territory, the best known being the 1870s stampede to the silver bonanzas of Tombstone, Arizona in southeast Arizona, also known for its legendary outlaws and lawmen. By the late 1880s, copper production eclipsed the precious metals with the rise of copper camps like Bisbee, Arizona and Jerome, Arizona. The boom and bust economy of mining also left hundreds of ghost towns across the territory, but copper mining continued to prosper with the territory producing more copper than any other state by 1907, which earned Arizona the nickname \"the Copper State\" at the time of statehood. During the first years of statehood the industry experienced growing pains and labor disputes with the Bisbee Deportation of 1917 the result of a copper miners' strike.", "hasanswer": false}]}

S.H.E's other contributions include songs in the soundtracks of Magical Love, The Rose, Reaching for the Stars, Tokyo Juliet, The Little Fairy, Hanazakarino Kimitachihe, and Bull Fighting. In 2008, they sang the ending theme for the film CJ7.\nThe group is also known for harmonizing between each other, but has no designated lead singer and has no leader. All three members have different vocal ranges to complement each other. Ella sings within the alto to mezzo-soprano range, while Hebe and Selina sing within the mezzo-soprano to soprano range, with Ella having the widest vocal range of the three.Most S.H.E songs fall into the category of pop music. Songs from this genre consist of light melodies, simple drum beats, and the occasional piano or synthesizer accompaniment. In Girls Dorm and Youth Society, acoustic guitar melody lines were used as well. While some slower songs, particularly those in Genesis, fall into the genre of R&B, high-tempo songs, such as \"Beauty Up My Life\", focus more on techno. S.H.E has also sung a few pop/rock songs, including \"Piquancy\" (Chinese: \u75db\u5feb), \"Super Star\", and \"Star Light\" (Chinese: \u661f\u5149). As their career progressed, S.H.E began mixing light-hearted pop ballads with elements of hip hop and dance. Attempts to fuse these genres started with songs such as \"If You're Happy, Then I'll Be Pleased\" (Chinese: \u4f60\u5feb\u6a02\u6211\u96a8\u610f), which contained a short rap segment, and evolved into songs such as \"Listen to Yuan Wei Jen Play Guitar\" (Chinese: \u807d\u8881\u60df\u4ec1\u5f48\u5409\u4ed6), which is composed entirely of rap with the exception of the chorus.", "hasanswer": false}]}

While waiting she finds Josh's pet cat, locked in a closet and dying from severe malnutrition. But when she rushes to tell him, she finds that he has committed suicide by hanging himself with an Internet cable.\nMattie and her friends begin to receive online messages from Josh asking for help, but assume that Josh's computer is still on and that a virus is creating the messages. Mattie learns that Josh's computer has been sold to Dex McCarthy, who finds a number of strange videos on the computer. Mattie receives a package that Josh mailed two days prior to his death. Inside are rolls of red tape and a message telling her that the tape keeps \"them\" out, although he does not know why. Later, Dex visits Mattie and shows her video messages that Josh was sending to Ziegler. Josh had hacked Ziegler's computer system and then distributed a virus.

In 2017, Pitchfork included it on their list of \"The Story of Goth in 33 Songs\". In his column, Rusty Pipes indicated the track to be as one of the early examples of art rock music. Sean Murphy of PopMatters considered it one of the 1967 songs that shaped prog rock.\"The End\" is performed into the pitches of the Mixolydian mode in the key of D, and incorporates aspects from Indian music. Krieger used an open guitar tuning, which he had learned from Ravi Shankar's music lessons at the Kinnara School of Music in Los Angeles, to create a sitar or veena sound; this enhances the raga rock mood. In his book, The Dawn of Indian Music, author Peter Lavezzoli writes that Krieger also developed with his tuning an \"Indian jhala style\" by rapidly strumming and alternating with the melody line.

Arc has since been released separately.\nWeld consists of rock and roll songs by Young and Crazy Horse, duplicating seven that had appeared on either Rust Never Sleeps or Live Rust from twelve years earlier. It also echoes those albums as Young, in both cases having spent most of a previous decade pursuing different musical avenues, returned to straightforward rock and roll via the Ragged Glory album with Crazy Horse, then celebrating that return with an accompanying live document and concert film. \n\nThe album includes Young's \"Gulf War\" version of Bob Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\", which has air raid sound effects. The tour coincided with the Gulf War, which had an impact on how the band played the songs, and influenced Young to make changes to the setlists, adding the violence themed songs \"Cortez the Killer\" and \"Powderfinger\". Young explains in a November 1991 interview with David Fricke for Rolling Stone: \"We were there all the way through it, and to me, that's what Weld is about. It's very brutal, especially the songs with the big endings. I was trying to create the sound of violence and conflict, heavy machinery, outright destruction. We were watching CNN all the time, watching this shit happen, and then going out to play, singing these songs about conflict. It was a hard thing. And I feel there was nothing else I could do. Whatever could bring people together was more important than me playing a new song. We couldn't go out there and just be entertainment.\"\nWeld was recorded by David Hewitt on Remote Recording Services' Silver Truck.\nNeil Young states that he permanently damaged his hearing while mixing this album.There was a brief release of the concert on VHS and laserdisc.

While hope is the most powerful of the seven emotions, Blue Lanterns must be near an active Green Lantern's power ring to tap into their own rings' full power. Otherwise, the rings are only capable of the default abilities of flight and a protective aura. This is because the power of hope is nothing without the willpower to enact it. The Blue Lantern's protective aura allows them to survive in space and other hostile environments and can be manipulated to a limited degree even without a Green Lantern present, using it to augment their strength and extending it to form a larger shield, but this ability is almost exclusively defensive. Blue rings must be activated by true hope before they will operate at their user's command.While under the influence of a nearby green power ring, a blue power ring has the same abilities as a green ring, plus some unique powers of its own. Blue Lanterns can heal wounds and regenerate lost body parts. The ring's power can be supplemented with the hope of other living beings; for instance, Saint Walker and Warth were able to reduce a dying sun's age by 8.6 billion years because of the hope emanating from the inhabitants of a nearby planet. A blue ring can negatively impact the performance of rings on the opposite side of the emotional spectrum. It can neutralize the corruptive effects of red power rings, block the energy-stealing properties of orange rings (as well as nullify its side effects on the bearer of it), and drain the power of yellow power rings. While at first it appeared that a blue ring could only charge a green power ring to twice its maximum power level which could also negatively impact a green ring, as close proximity to the Blue Central Power Battery would overcharge the ring, causing it to implode (taking the user's hand with it), it had been revealed that a blue ring can in fact charge any power ring as long as the users of the blue light wish to.

It is the sequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film Alien, and the second film in the Alien franchise. Set in the far future, it stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship. When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first saw the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn are featured in supporting roles.\nDespite the success of Alien, its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from 20th Century Fox, and repeated management changes. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for Aliens in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for The Terminator (1984) and Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5 million budget, Aliens began principal photography in September 1985 and concluded in January 1986. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios. The difficult shoot affected the composer, James Horner, who was given little time to record the music.\nAliens was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver's performance garnered consistent praise along with those of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein. The film received several awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Weaver at a time when the science-fiction genre was generally overlooked.

However, to the boy's amazement, the boulders begin to move off the tracks. Later the boy falls asleep only to be awoken by the train stopping and the sound of singing. Thinking he sees snow outside, the boy opens the windows but when he sticks out his hands to catch some, the boy realizes that it's actually torn up newspaper. The boy then notices \"strange creatures\" standing near the train who are responsible for the torn paper and singing. When the train resumes its journey, the boy falls back asleep only to be awoken at the train station where the boy is returns to his parents.\nIn the lower left quadrant, the story is titled, \"Problem Parents\". A brother and sister, with the sister serving as the narrator, know the routines of their parents who are predictable in their actions, such as leaving for work each day at 7 a.m. and returning home at 7 p.m. However, one night the children, and their dog, recognize that the parents are not their normal selves because they come home wearing newspaper costumes and singing She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain. The children's parents then find newspapers at home and, ignoring attempts at normal conversation topics, dress the children in newspaper also. The brother joins in the fun more quickly than his sister, who unsuccessfully attempts to jolt her parents back to normal. The narrator is horrified when her brother suggests they go out to dinner dressed as they are and manages to convince the other family members to leave the costumes at home. In the end, the narrator admits the experience is fun, though she finds her parents' antics \"exhausting\" when they ask her about her homework as she's heading to bed.The upper right quadrant's story is titled, \"A Waiting Game\", with the only text representing announcements from a loudspeaker.

Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis.\nThe actor Boris Karloff, well known for his association with the horror film genre, was chosen as host for the new series.  This was an idea taken from such U.S. anthology series as The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller (which Karloff himself had hosted) and was in line with what had been done for Armchair Mystery Theatre, which was introduced by Donald Pleasence.\nThree scripts for Out of This World, adaptations of Philip K.

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

Anderson, steamed under the Arctic ice cap to make the first crossing from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the North Pole. On August 3, 1958, she became the first vessel to reach the North Pole.For this accomplishment, Nautilus and her crew were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation, the first Presidential Unit Citation awarded in peacetime. The citation began with the words, \"For outstanding achievement in completing the first voyage in history across the top of the world, by cruising under the Arctic ice cap from the Bering Strait to the Greenland Sea\".Nautilus 90 North (1959, with Clay Blair) was the first book Anderson wrote about the Arctic missions of USS Nautilus. It was named for the radio message he sent to the Chief of Naval Operations to announce that Nautilus had reached the pole. His second book about these missions, The Ice Diaries: The Untold Story of the Cold War's Most Daring Mission (with Don Keith), was completed shortly before Anderson's death. This second book includes many previously classified details.\nOn March 17, 1959, the nuclear submarine USS Skate, under the command of Commander (later Vice Admiral) James F. Calvert, became the first submarine to surface at the North Pole. While there, her crew scattered the ashes of Arctic explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins. Calvert wrote the book Surface at the Pole about this and the other Arctic missions of USS Skate.\nThe film Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea begins with Seaview in the Arctic for the final phase of her sea trials, including a dive under the ice cap.\nTwo milestones in underwater exploration were achieved in 1960, the year before Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea was released. On January 23, 1960, Jacques Piccard and Lieutenant Don Walsh (USN), in the bathyscaphe Trieste, made the first descent to the bottom of the Challenger Deep. The Challenger Deep is the deepest surveyed spot in the world's oceans, and is located in the Mariana Trench, southwest of Guam. From February 16, 1960, to May 10, 1960, the submarine USS Triton, under the command of Captain Edward L. Beach, Jr., made the first submerged circumnavigation of the world. Triton observed and photographed Guam extensively through her periscope during this mission, without being detected by the U.S. Navy on Guam.In the film, Seaview fires a missile from a position northwest of Guam to extinguish the \"sky fire\".\nAt the time that Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea was made, the Van Allen radiation belts had only recently been discovered, and most of what the film states concerning them is fiction. Discoveries since then clearly invalidate what the film says: the Van Allen belts (actually somewhat more radiation-dense portions of the magnetosphere) are made up of sub-atomic particles trapped by the Earth's magnetic field in the vacuum of space and cannot catch fire, as fire requires oxygen, fuel, and an ignition source, all of which are insufficient in the Van Allen Belts. Unburned hydrocarbon emissions have never reached concentrations that could support a \"sky fire\".\nAt the beginning of the film, pieces of the polar ice cap are sinking, colliding with Seaview.

Linnaeus's hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey.\nLinnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala on 12 May 1732, just before he turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near G\u00e4vle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Ume\u00e5, Lule\u00e5 and Tornio. He returned from his six-month-long, over 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book Flora Lapponica. However, on the expedition to Lapland, Linnaeus used Latin names to describe organisms because he had not yet developed the binomial system.In Flora Lapponica Linnaeus's ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora. The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with Flora Lapponica as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described Flora Lapponica as \"the most classic and delightful\" of Linnaeus's works.It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was travelling, Linnaeus remarked: \"If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.\"In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna.

It's quite silly and horrid fun \u2013 and what I want is the best book about Buccaneers that can be had.\"Stevenson originally gave the book the title The Sea Cook. One month after conceiving of the book, chapters began to appear in the pages of the Young Folks magazine. After completing several chapters rapidly, Stevenson was interrupted by illness. He left Scotland and continued working on the first draft near London, where he and his father discussed points of the tale, and his father suggested elements that he included. The novel eventually ran in seventeen weekly installments from October 1, 1881, to January 28, 1882. The book was later republished as the novel Treasure Island and proved to be Stevenson's first financial and critical success. The Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who served four terms as British Prime Minister between 1868 and 1894, was one of the book's biggest fans; it was said that he stayed up all night to read it.\nThe growth of the desert island genre can be traced back to 1719 when Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe was published. A century later, novels such as S. H. Burney's The Shipwreck (1816), and Sir Walter Scott's The Pirate (1822) continued to expand upon Defoe's classic. Other authors in the mid-19th century continued this trend, with works including James Fenimore Cooper's The Pilot (1823). During the same period, Edgar Allan Poe wrote \"MS Found in a Bottle\" (1833) and \"The Gold-Bug\" (1843). All of these works influenced Stevenson's end product.Stevenson also consciously borrowed material from previous authors. In a July 1884 letter to Sidney Colvin, he wrote that \"Treasure Island came out of Kingsley's At Last, where I got the Dead Man's Chest \u2014 and that was the seed \u2014 and out of the great Captain Johnson's History of the Notorious Pirates.\" Stevenson also admits that he took the idea of Captain Flint's pointing skeleton from Poe's The Gold-Bug and he constructed Billy Bones's history from the \"Money-Diggers\" section (\"Golden Dreams\" in particular) of Tales of a Traveller by Washington Irving, one of his favorite writers.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the first entry in the Mother series. It is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but is set in the late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to put an end to the paranormal phenomena that recently spiraled the country into disarray. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.\nWriter and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mother's concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. A North American version of the game was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released globally as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015 and Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022.\nMother was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about 400,000 copies and received a \"Silver Hall of Fame\" score from Famitsu magazine. Mother was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, but many considered its sequel Mother 2: G\u012bgu no Gyakush\u016b (known outside as EarthBound) to be similar and a better overall implementation of Mother's gameplay ideas, with the game's high difficulty level polarizing critics, along with balance issues.

However, material since (and including) Oceanic has not been so often likened to Neurosis; in fact, it has become the case that it is Isis who are being imitated in a burgeoning post-metal scene.In terms of categorisation, Isis have been described as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing \u2013 the latter of which Turner describes as \"guitar theatrics\". However, post-rock arguably tends to have an essentially halcyon sound, one which rarely uses vocals and typically is devoid of distorted guitars. Isis, however, have origins in hardcore punk and metal, and use aggressive vocal styles similar to hardcore. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, ambient music, and post-rock, among others. Revolver critic Dan Epstein noted that \"though [Isis were] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres\". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that \"if I wanna listen to emotional music which I guess is contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that \u2013 something that is  emotional, powerful music.\"Turner, when asked to define Isis, described their sound as \"avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases\". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away from the use of specific genre labels \u2013 \"'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'\" When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits \"I never know what to say. I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag.\" Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as \"thinking man's metal\"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.\nDue to the difficulty in pigeonholing, some fans and critics label Isis as post-metal. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as Pelican, Cult of Luna and Callisto; however, Isis are often credited with the formulation of the genre with the release of Oceanic. In addition to the aforementioned, Isis has also been described as sludge metal, progressive metal, and even metalcore.Isis did not write their music for mainstream appeal according to guitarist Michael Gallagher: \"... we've never tried to be on the radio, and we've never tried to please others.

Halloween popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. Halloween helped to popularize the final girl trope, the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous, and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that Halloween is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s. Due to its popularity, Halloween became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, followed, and that others like Scream parodied.The major themes present in Halloween also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in Halloween, there is a theme of absentee parents but films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.There are slasher films that predated Halloween, such as Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972),  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Black Christmas (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. Halloween, however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others. Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of Halloween,\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting.

Ulvaeus mentioned in retrospect that the sessions were troubled, noting, \"It could be frosty sometimes.\" Lyngstad also commented that they were beginning to tire of working together.The members of ABBA and their personnel have memories of the recording sessions for this album being rather difficult. To begin with, their sound engineer Michael Tretow had to become accustomed to using the new 32-track digital recorder that had been purchased for Polar Music Studios. He said, \"Digital recording...cut out all the hiss, but it also meant that sounds were sharply cut off below a certain level. The sound simply became too clean, so I had to find ways of compensating for that.\"  The first three tracks for the album had already been recorded using analogue tape and therefore Tretow had to transfer all subsequent tracks from digital to analogue and back again to avoid a difference in quality.On its release, The Visitors reached the top of the charts in a number of territories but was not as successful as their previous albums.The Visitors was released as a Deluxe Edition in April 2012.

Although they refer to their first film, Blood Simple (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of detective fiction, the Coens wrote their next script, Raising Arizona (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a comedy but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls \"a pretty savage film.\" Their third film, Miller's Crossing (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a crime film. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from melodrama, love stories, and political satire.This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens insist the film \"does not belong to any genre.\" Ethan has described it as \"a buddy movie for the '90s.\" It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a coming of age story while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a K\u00fcnstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as \"a retro-surrealist vision.\"Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered an example of postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the film renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is \"typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material.\" In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a \"postmodern pastiche\" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films \"does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains.\"Certain elements in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a \"postmodern update\" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director Alfred Hitchcock in his film North by Northwest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The plans for an incorporated Globe were established in July 1876, with retail stores, banks, and Globe's first newspaper printing its first issue on May 2, 1878. By February 1881, Globe was the Gila County seat. Coming with Globe's new importance as the county seat came a stagecoach line linking it to Silver City, New Mexico.\nDue to Globe's relative isolation from the rest of Arizona and its proximity to the San Carlos Apache reservation, Globe remained a frontier town. Globe's history is laced with many historic events such as murders, stagecoach robberies, outlaws, lynchings, and Apache raids.

The film also documents a number of computer enthusiasts who drive across the United States searching for Miramax representatives and demonstrating their discontent with certain aspects of the bootleg script of Takedown they had acquired. One of their major points of criticism was that the script ended with Mitnick being convicted to serve a long-term prison sentence, while in reality, at the time the film's production, Mitnick had not yet even had a trial but nonetheless was incarcerated for five years without bail in a high-security facility.

Freedom Downtime tries to communicate a different view of the hacker community from that usually shown by the mainstream media, with hackers being depicted as curious people who rarely intend to cause damage, driven by a desire to explore and conduct pranks. The film questions the rationality of placing computer hackers who went \"over the line\" in the same environment as serious felons.\nIt also contains interviews with people related to Mitnick and hacker culture in general. The authors of Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier, ex-couple Katie Hafner and John Markoff, appear in very different roles. While Hafner's empathy for Mitnick is shown to have grown, Markoff continues to defend his critical book and articles in The New York Times newspaper about the hacker. Markoff is ridiculed as the narrator, director Goldstein (a hacker himself), points out his factual errors during the interview. Reba Vartanian, Mitnick's grandmother, also appears in a number of interview segments. Furthermore, lawyers, friends, and libertarians give their view of the story.

Priest's writing is gripping, and it's one of those rare books that reveal what writing is: manner and matter twinned and entwined.\"Elizabeth Hand described the book as \"exquisite ... an exceptionally frightening novel whose nightmare power derives from its chilling, almost clinical evocation of an historical reality with which we are all familiar, the London Blitz... a cliffhanger narrative of dual identities, betrayals, and shifting realities, as two versions of the twins' histories\u2014and England's, and the world's\u2014are woven together, like strands of DNA, to form a terrifying narrative. Priest has used doubles before to great effect, in his award-winning novel The Prestige; but The Separation trumps even that tale.

The woman notes that the sea (visible on the right side of the frame) is rising. After construction is completed, and after temporarily stopping the sea from eroding the castle away, the two decide to go on a journey to discover the cause behind the rising sea level. As they leave, the frames slowly fade to white, as the rising water begins to destroy the castle.\nThe two journey out, finding a river that they were unaware of; the couple follow the river and make observations as they go. While resting under a tree, the man finds the remains of a campsite, discovering that the area they were in had been inhabited. Later, they find another campsite and massive, oddly shaped trees with markings on one. They find a decrepit boat they could use to cross the river, but continue up into the mountains. While climbing a small hill, the man sees a snake and tumbles down on the woman. Further on, they hear chirping in a tree, and pause briefly to observe a bird and its chick in a nest. While resting at a miniature river, the woman discovers that they are on the cliff of a large waterfall. After contemplating it, they decide to discover what the mountains are like.\nThey climb up and eventually reach a small abandoned house. While there, the man is attacked by a big cat, which the woman routs with a piece of wood. The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. They decide that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain (where they see a structure) would be a better medical option than heading back home, so they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time-lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.\n\nThey find a small structure, and from its top the woman spots people. As they leave the structure, they think of their sand castle, wondering about its fate. The screen cuts to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then cuts back. After more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon the man and woman to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs them that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see someone to talk to. They rest along the way, where the man and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and there is a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader who, speaking the language of the protagonists to some extent, explains the reason for the sea rising. \nShe reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls \"the planet's mightiest river\" at bay, which is days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She shows them a map of the inland sea, and a drawing of the coastline as it had appeared in the distant past, and will appear again when the surrounding basin is flooded. This coastline is the same as the present-day western Mediterranean Sea, signifying that the story takes place long after the sea had been separated from the Atlantic Ocean and largely dried up.  \nThe leader explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they have no choice but to remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, the man and woman flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen.\nUpon returning home, the two characters attempt to coordinate an escape with their own people. A girl appears in a boat she constructed from wood used in the sand castle from the beginning of the story; this causes the tribe to abandon their original plans and instead attempt to float up the river. After expanding the boat, the group boards it and sets sail. Soon they join the remaining members of their tribe, who had been in their own smaller boat. After a night of drifting, while the others are still asleep, the man and woman spot land. When they reach it, the story ends with the man and woman, last to depart, going into the new wilderness to explore it, with the boat seen bobbing in the water.

{"id": "91_1604", "question": "What genre is The Great Moment?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_23375", "text": "Pulp Fiction quickly came to be regarded as one of the most significant films of its era. In 1995, in a special edition of Siskel & Ebert devoted to Tarantino, Gene Siskel argued that the work posed a major challenge to the \"ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas\". In Siskel's view,\n\nthe violent intensity of Pulp Fiction calls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are. Hitchcock's Psycho [1960], Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde [1967], and Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange [1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor for Pulp Fiction. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.\n\nKen Dancyger writes that its \"imitative and innovative style\" \u2013 like that of its predecessor, Reservoir Dogs \u2013 represents\n\na new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold \u2013 the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as the gangster films or Westerns, horror films or adventure films. And that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form, a different experience for the audience.\n\nIn a widely covered speech on May 31, 1995, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling \"nightmares of depravity\". Pulp Fiction was soon associated with his charges concerning gratuitous violence. Dole had not mentioned the film; he cited two less-celebrated movies based on Tarantino screenplays, Natural Born Killers and True Romance. In September 1996, Dole did accuse Pulp Fiction \u2013 which he had not seen \u2013 of promoting \"the romance of heroin\".Paula Rabinowitz expresses the general film industry opinion that Pulp Fiction \"simultaneously resurrected John Travolta and film noir\". In Peter Biskind's description, it created a \"guys-with-guns frenzy\". The film has also been labeled as a black comedy and a \"neo-noir\". Critic Geoffrey O'Brien, however, argued against the classification of Pulp Fiction into the neo-noir genre: \"The old-time noir passions, the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes, would be altogether out of place in the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that Tarantino conjures up. [It is] neither neo-noir nor a parody of noir.\" Similarly, Nicholas Christopher calls it \"more gangland camp than neo-noir\", and Foster Hirsch suggests that its \"trippy fantasy landscape\" characterizes it more definitively than any genre label. Regardless, the stylistic influence of Pulp Fiction soon became apparent. Less than a year after the picture's release, British critic Jon Ronson attended the National Film School's end-of-semester screenings and assessed the impact: \"Out of the five student movies I watched, four incorporated violent shoot-outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic 70s pop hits, two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once, and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies of The Brady Bunch before offing their victim. Not since Citizen Kane has one man appeared from relative obscurity to redefine the art of moviemaking.\" Among the first Hollywood films cited as its imitators were Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995), in which Tarantino acted, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995), and 2 Days in the Valley (1996). It \"triggered a myriad of clones\", writes Fiona Villella. Internationally, according to David Desser, it \"not only influenced a British brand of noir, but extended the noir vision virtually around the world\". Pulp Fiction's effect on film form was still reverberating in 2007, when David Denby of The New Yorker credited it with initiating the ongoing cycle of disordered cinematic narratives.According to Variety, the trajectory of Pulp Fiction from Cannes launch to commercial smash \"forever altered the game\" of so-called independent cinema. It \"cemented Miramax's place as the reigning indie superpower\", writes Biskind. \"Pulp became the Star Wars of independents, exploding expectations for what an indie film could do at the box office.\" The film's large financial return on its small budget\n\ntransform[ed] the industry's attitude toward the lowly indies ... spawning a flock of me-too classics divisions ... [S]mart studio executives suddenly woke up to the fact that grosses and market share, which got all the press, were not the same as profits ... Once the studios realized that they could exploit the economies of (small) scale, they more or less gave up buying or remaking the films themselves, and either bought the distributors, as Disney had Miramax, or started their own ... copy[ing] Miramax's marketing and distribution strategies.\n\nIn 2001, Variety, noting the increasing number of actors switching back and forth between expensive studio films and low-budget independent or indie-style projects, suggested that the \"watershed moment for movie stars\" came with the decision by Willis \u2013 one of Hollywood's highest-paid performers \u2013 to appear in Pulp Fiction.It has been described as a \"major cultural event\", an \"international phenomenon\" that influenced television, music, literature, and advertising. Not long after its release, it was identified as a significant focus of attention within the growing community of Internet users. Adding Pulp Fiction to his roster of The Great Movies in 2001, Roger Ebert called it \"the most influential film of the decade\". Four years later, Time's Corliss wrote much the same: \"(unquestionably) the most influential American movie of the 90s\".Several scenes and images from the film achieved iconic status; in 2008, Entertainment Weekly declared, \"You'd be hard-pressed, by now, to name a moment from Quentin Tarantino's film that isn't iconic.\" Jules and Vincent's \"Royale with Cheese\" dialogue became famous. It was referenced more than a decade and a half later in the Travolta vehicle From Paris with Love. The adrenalin shot to Mia Wallace's heart is on Premiere's list of \"100 Greatest Movie Moments\". The scene of Travolta and Thurman's characters dancing has been frequently homaged, most unambiguously in the 2005 film Be Cool, starring the same two actors. The image of Travolta and Jackson's characters standing side by side in suit and tie, pointing their guns, has also become widely familiar. In 2007, BBC News reported that \"London transport workers have painted over an iconic mural by 'guerrilla artist' Banksy ... The image depicted a scene from Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns.\" Certain lines were adopted popularly as catchphrases, in particular Marsellus's threat, \"I'm 'a get medieval on your ass.\" Jules's \"Ezekiel\" recitation was voted the fourth greatest movie speech of all time in a 2004 poll. One of the more notable homages to Jules \"Biblical\" quote was one Jackson himself played a part in, near the end of 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Jackson's character Col. Nick Fury, presumed dead, visits his own gravestone, on which, below Fury's name is inscribed \"The path of the righteous man ...\" Ezekiel 25:17. In 2019, it was reported that Dominic Cummings, special political adviser to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, quoted Jules by telling Conservative MPs to \"be cool like Fonzies\" as political pressure built to request an extension to the date of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.Pulp Fiction now appears in several critical assessments of all-time great films. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the best film of the past quarter-century. That same year, the American Film Institute's \"Ten Top Ten\" poll ranked it number 7 all-time in the gangster film genre. In 2007, it was voted 94th overall on the AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list. In 2005, it was named one of \"Time's All-Time 100 Movies\". As of September 2018, it is number 54 on Metacritic's list of all-time highest scores. The film ranks very highly in popular surveys. A 2008 Empire poll combining the opinions of readers, movie industry professionals, and critics named Pulp Fiction the ninth-best film of all time. In a 2006 readers' poll by the British magazine Total Film, it ranked as the number three film in history. It was voted as the fourth-greatest film of all time in a nationwide poll for Britain's Channel 4 in 2001. In 2015, Pulp Fiction ranked 28th on BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.", "hasanswer": false}]}
