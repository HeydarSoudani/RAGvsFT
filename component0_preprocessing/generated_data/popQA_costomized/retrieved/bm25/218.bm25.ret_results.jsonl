{"id": "218_1", "question": "In what city was Antoine Richard born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_40809", "text": "The original Little Prince was first published in 1943, and is the most famous work of the French aristocrat, writer, poet and pioneering aviator Count Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry . It is a poetic tale self-illustrated in watercolours in which a pilot stranded in the desert meets a young prince fallen to Earth from a tiny asteroid. The story is philosophical and includes societal criticism, remarking on the strangeness of the adult world. Though ostensibly a children's book, The Little Prince makes several profound and idealistic observations about life and human nature. For example, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry tells of a fox meeting the young prince during his travels on Earth. The story's essence is contained in the lines uttered by the fox to the little prince: On ne voit bien qu'avec le c\u0153ur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux. Other key thematic messages are articulated by The Fox, such as: \"You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed\" and \"It is the time you have devoted to your rose that makes your rose so important.\" The Fox's messages are arguably the most famous because of their nature of dealing with relationships. Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote and illustrated The Little Prince in New York City and Asharoken, N.Y. in mid-to-late 1942 while exiled in the United States after the Fall of France, with the manuscript being completed in October. It would be first published in early 1943 in both English and French, but only in the U.S. It would later appear in his native homeland of France posthumously, after the liberation of Paris, as all of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works had been banned in Nazi-occupied France. Since first being published the novella has been adapted to various media over the decades, including audio recordings, stage, ballet, and operatic works. The fantasy-musical film adaptation of The Little Prince was directed and produced by Stanley Donen, and stars Steven Warner in the title role, with Richard Kiley as the aviator, titled as The Pilot. Additional cast members included Bob Fosse as The Snake, Gene Wilder as The Fox, Donna McKechnie as the petulant, vain Rose, Joss Ackland as The King, and Victor Spinetti as The Historian. The film's desert sequences were shot on location in Tunisia. In real life, The Fox's character is believed to be based on one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's lovers, Sylvia Hamilton Reinhardt, with The Rose being attributed to the author's wife, the Countess Consuelo de Saint Exup\u00e9ry. The production was Lerner and Loewe's final musical. The music's creative team were dissatisfied with the film's Hollywood treatment, with Loewe refusing to visit London to supervise the arrangement and recording of the score.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was educated at Westminster School and Clare Hall, Cambridge, of which society he became a scholar, but was unable to take a fellowship, having inherited landed property at Boroughbridge from his uncle, Robert Waddilove , president of Barnard's Inn, whose name he assumed. He graduated BA in 1759, and MA in 1762. He was curate of Wotton in Surrey, and in 1767 rector of Whitby. From 1771 to 1779 he was chaplain to Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham, ambassador to the Court at Madrid, during which time he exchanged Whitby for Topcliffe, and appointed himself rector of Cherry Burton, both in Yorkshire.

He also wrote remarks on the pictures in the king of Spain's collection which had formerly belonged to Charles I of England, translated Mengs's Essay on Painting , and received from Infante Gabriel of Spain a copy of the translation of Salluse made by the prince. In 1775, while in Spain, he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, for which he wrote several papers, among them 'An Historical and Descriptive Account of Ripon Minster' At his death he left to the library of York Minster a magnificent copy of Falconer's 'Strabo,' and of the rare work Bibliotheca Ar\u00e1bica del Escurial. Waddilove was an active magistrate and zealous in his ecclesiastical duties; in one instance he was recorded as having destroyed a stage to prevent an illegal boxing match in the village of Grewelthorpe near Ripon. He was president of the Society for the Relief of the North Riding Clergy, and earnestly promoted its interests. His private charities were extensive, and he gave on several occasions large sums to increase the endowments of parishes in his own patronage or that of the chapter.

Previously, the region as a whole was known as District of Augusta. The town was initially known as \"Potter's Town,\" as the  area had been purchased by Scott Walker and Dave Walkow on July 15, 1789. In December 1856, and additional  were taken from Middlesex . Early settlers of the time included Rowes Perry, Benjamin Brown, Jesse Brown and Joshua Brown, Elias Gilbert, Jabez French, Abraham Lane, Isaac Lane and Jacob Lane, Francis Briggs and Peleg Briggs, Jr., Edward Craft, Charles VanWormer born 1789 the oldest son of Orende & Jan VanWormer, David Southerland and John Griffin. Around 1805, Griffin and Riggs operated an ashery store and a distillery north of Nettle Valley, on what would eventually become the Erwin Wells farm in 1929. Riggs left, and in 1812, Griffin sold the operation to his brother-in-law, Richard M. Williams. Williams became an associate judge of Yates County; he largely concentrated on the manufacture of potash and whisky, and died on June 4, 1837. Williams' son, Richard H. Williams, was elected to the state senate in 1845, and served for two years before his term was cut short by the adoption of the 1846 constitution. Luke Conley also built a distillery in Nettle Valley some time after his arrival in Potter in 1805. Around 1810, he sold this building to Arnold Potter, and it was moved to Potter's Hollow, or Yatesville. For five years, he worked for Judge Potter in payment for  on lot four of the second range. Mr. Conley was also associated with William B. Rochester and aided in laying the foundation for the first mill in Rochester, New York. In Potter Center around 1790, there was at first a double log tavern, operated by one Bingham, believed to be Col. Luther Bingham, which was located just north of the hamlet on what is now Middle Rd. The tavern sat on the knoll on the east side of the road and just north of the Potter Center Schoolhouse #11. Mr. Bingham operated the tavern even before wagon roads were open. He was succeeded by Alben Darby who remained many years and died there. Many older documents refer to \"Darby's Corners,\" which was the intersection of what we now call Simmons, Mothersell and Middle Rd. to the north of Potter Center. In 1798, Lindsey Warfield established the \"Warfield Neighborhood\" which included, in part, land that would later become the township of Middlesex. Mr. Warfield's residence was on a farm previously owned by Benjamin Watkins.  His house was at the southeast corner of Ward Simmons and NY Route 247. The foundation of a house still remains there. His son, Lindsey D. Warfield, is listed in the 1876 Yates County Atlas at that site. The house burned some time in the middle 19th century. It was most likely to be the second house that burned. Other early settlers in the Warfield Neighborhood were a Mr. Wesson, William Foster, and Abraham Florence. Others were James Southerland, Jacob Voorhees, Peter Lamoreaux, Hendrick VanWormer & wife Saartje who in 1796 settled on the Darwin B. Holbrook farm, which is now owned by the Pendleton family. Hendricks younger brother Jan VanWormer settled in abt 1801. Dr. Frederic Dutch was a native of Germany. He came to Potter around 1800 and settled on  that eventually became the hamlet of Voak or The Dutch Settlement Dr. Dutch was a German Lutheran and helped to organize the German Lutheran Church at Voak. It is important to distinguish that it was not a \"Dutch settlement.\" It was a settlement of German Lutherans.  At that location there is mention of the \"German Meeting House\" in 1816, where a Christopher Bergstresser settled near. Other smaller settlements were Moontown and Hoardtown, which were basically the same location. These were not established villages. They were settlements highly populated by the Moon and Hoard family. It was basically the area of the intersections of Voorhees, West Swamp and Reynolds roads. There was a church on the north side of the intersection of Voorhees and West Swamp as early as 1810. The 1876 Yates County Atlas has it located on what now is the Artlip property. The school was originally located on the southeast corner. Later it was on the southwest corner. In 1802 Dr. Jareb Dyer purchased  that extended from the Willis Dyer Corners, west of the road, north beyond what would later become Potter Center. At that time there were no houses nearer than Warfield's Corners to the north and Aberham Lane to the south. Samuel Wyman settled in Nettle Valley in 1809 where Enoch Bordwell and George Green built a sawmill and a log house. Sanford Strobridge came to Potter in 1826 and at first settled one mile north of Potter Center. He was a wheelwright and a chair maker. In 1838 he resided in Potter Center and owned a gristmill known as the \"Gully Mill\" located at the southeast corner of Hagerty Rd. and Rt. 364. His son George would later operate the gristmill. The foundation of that mill can still be found. Arnold Potter, a son of Judge William Potter built the first sawmill in 1794 at Potter Center. Sanford had eleven children. Sanford D. Strobridge; Lyman H. Strobridge, who planted the first vineyard in Potter; Samuel G. Strobridge, who lived where the old Olsen Farm is; George W. Strobridge, who was a wagon maker; and William M. Strobridge, who was a soldier killed in the American Civil War. The carriage or wagon shop owned by George W. Strobridge was located at the point where West Swamp Rd. and Rt. 364 meet. The carriage shop was a three-story building that was later opened in 1928 as the Blodgett Bean House. Still later that same building was used as a feed mill outlet for a milling company based in Rushville. It was torn down in 1968. Directly behind his wagon shop was a blacksmith shop belonging to Eben and Thomas Finch in 1825 and later. It was also a three-story building with a planked incline on the north side. The Strobridge sawmill site at Hagerty Rd and the grist mill further down stream were driven by water from Mill Brook. When the mills were in operation, they made use of a dike west of Hagerty Rd. that must have also served as a bridge for that same road. The dike held the water back to the marsh in the gully towards Middlesex. Another early mill was the sawmill that was upstream from the current Tony Hiler residence. This saw mill, based on location, was likely converted from the early grist mill shown in early maps. It was said to have wooden gears and no metal. Some of the beams and siding of the mill were used by Tony Hiler to repair his house, and make the lean-to additions. According to a conversation between Carl Simmons and Tony Hiler, the Simmons, Hiler and George Clark house were built from the wood cut at this mill. The Hiler house was built in 1850. The old or main part of the Simmons home was built in 1831. This is believed to be the sawmill referred to in a 1913 newspaper as being operated by Culver, Barber and Barrett. As early as 1868 the assessment records show the mill belonging to Barber and Burnett. By 1874 it was registered as belonging to Oscar Burnett. At some point it was also used as a feed mill. In 1825, Milton Finch bought a lot from Henry Husted and established a public house, or tavern, and a blacksmith shop in Potter Center which he and his father, Ebenezer Finch ran. The tavern was located where the McDonald Hotel stood. It was first known as Finch's Tavern. Cleveland\u2019s book states that he was succeeded by Mark Weare, and Weare by Peleg Thomas. In 1879, the tavern burned and was later replaced by the McDonald Hotel. On the same night the store of John W. Durham and the George Fitzwater building also burned. About 1836, Cyrus Daines, James Stout and one Silvernail purchased land in Potter Center off Henry Husted and each established a business and a residence. These were the first buildings in Potter Center. Daines opened a blacksmith shop, Stout, a shoe shop and Silvernail, a tailor shop. The first store was kept by James Turner who was succeeded by Cyrus Daines who continued until his death in 1870. Richard H. Williams built a house and store, which was long occupied by Daines. The 1876 Atlas shows that Daines's store was on the east side of the road across from the hotel. The garage owned by Henry Eckert was in Cyrus Dains\u2019s old store, which burned in 1931. Peleg Thomas built a store on the west side of the road, which was later used as a Union Store. In 1836 in Potter Center there was a Methodist church, a Baptist church, two blacksmith shops, two wagon shops, one harness shop, other mechanics and one store. In 1928 James Blodgett opened a bean plant at the location of the old Aaron Gleason and Hobart carriage shop. The Aaron Gleason and Hobart carriage shop was the same building as the previous George Strobridge carriage shop. A Post Office was established in Potter Center around 1835. It was located in several places, usually at the store of whomever was appointed Postmaster. Richard M. Williams was the first postmaster. It was his work that established a route from Canandaigua through Rushville, Potter, Naples, Blood's Corners, Liberty, and Prattsburg. He had stores at most of these locations.< The James Hobart House, Arnold Potter House, and Yatesville Methodist Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Graham of the Southern District of Florida, who also presided over the trial in this case.  Judge Graham also ordered the defendant to pay $103,490,005 in restitution to the FDIC, as receiver for Westernbank.  A federal court found Kachkar guilty of eight counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Kachkar, a Key Biscayne, Florida resident and the former CEO and Chairman of a now-bankrupt multinational pharmaceutical company, was sentenced to 30 years in prison followed by five years of supervised release yesterday for his role his role in a $100 million scheme to defraud Westernbank of Puerto Rico. The losses triggered a series of events leading to Westernbank's insolvency and ultimate collapse. According to evidence presented at trial, from 2005 to 2007, Kachkar served as chairman and CEO of Inyx Inc., a publicly traded multinational pharmaceutical manufacturing company.  Beginning in early 2005, Kachkar caused Westernbank to enter into a series of loan agreements in exchange for a security interest in the assets of Inyx and its subsidiaries.  Under the loan agreements, Westernbank agreed to advance money based on Inyx\u2019s customer invoices from \u201cactual and bona fide\u201d sales to Inyx customers, the evidence showed. The trial evidence showed that Kachkar orchestrated a scheme to defraud Westernbank by causing numerous Inyx employees to make tens of millions of dollars worth of fake customer invoices purportedly payable by customers in the United Kingdom, Sweden and elsewhere.  Kachkar caused these invoices to be presented to Westernbank as valid invoices.  Kachkar made false and fraudulent representations to Westernbank executives about purported and imminent repayments from lenders in the United Kingdom, Norway, Libya and elsewhere in order to lull Westernbank into continuing to lend money to Inyx, the evidence showed.  In fact, these lenders had not agreed to repay Westernbank\u2019s loan.  Kachkar made false and fraudulent representations to Westernbank executives that he had additional collateral, including purported mines in Mexico and Canada worth hundreds of millions of dollars, to induce Westernbank to lend additional funds, the evidence showed.  In fact, this additional collateral was worth barely a fraction of that represented by Kachkar. During the course of the scheme, Kachkar caused Westernbank to lend approximately $142 million, primarily based on false and fraudulent customer invoices.  The evidence showed that the defendant diverted tens of millions of dollars for his own personal benefit, including for the purchase of, among other things, a private jet, luxury homes in Key Biscayne and Brickell, Miami, luxury cars, luxury hotel stays, and extravagant jewelry and clothing expenditures.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This effort added more than two meters to the previous world record, fueling discussion and speculation regarding the likelihood of alterations to the javelin's design and flight characteristics. Proposed changes would finally take effect in 1986, following another two sizable improvements to the javelin world record; the first coming in 1983, when Tom Petranoff, then of the United States, added precisely three meters to Paragi's mark, and the other in 1984, when East German Uwe Hohn launched the 800\u00a0gram implement to 104.80 meters. Hohn's mark only came after the new design had already been officially proposed, and contrary to a popular myth had nothing to do with the change. Indeed, the primary reason for the change was to get rid of the then frequent flat or ambiguous landings, which often made it hard to assess if a throw should be declared legal, most famously in the high-profile case at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow where the eventual winner Dainis K\u016bla only progressed to the last three rounds with an apparently flat throw. Ambiguous landings were also much more difficult to measure accurately, compared to clearly legal ones where the javelin would stick in the ground at the landing spot. Paragi also competed at the Moscow Olympics. Even though his form had dipped a bit after another monster mark of 96.20 on 18 May 1980, there could be no question he was among the leading favorites. However, he had problems in the qualifying round, languishing more than five meters from a spot in the finals after two rounds with a sub-standard mark of 72.60, but saved himself by throwing 88.76 with his third and final attempt \u2013 the best mark in the whole qualifying competition by almost three meters.

Upon arrival, Betty finds herself being given the VIP treatment, including a massage given by a handsome man, only to be interrupted by Walter. After she explains the situation, both Betty and Walter agreed to spend time in the hotel, as long as Betty can finish her review.

She flees and runs out onto the street in a state of undress before succumbing to a mortal gunshot wound. Police detectives Joe Kojaku and Charlie Bancroft, partners and bachelors who share an apartment, are assigned to the case. They find a portrait in the dressing room of Sugar dressed in a kimono as a geisha, apparently preparing a Japanese-themed act. Joe and Charlie lead the police search for the man who had been helping Sugar develop her act. They interview student artist Christine Downes, better known as Chris, who draws a sketch of the man for them. With her aid, they track down Hansel, the man who did the portrait of the Sugar, and a wigmaker, Roma, who was to provide the wig for the stage act. Charlie begins to develop a romantic attraction to Chris. Joe worries for Christine's safety, fearing that her sketch of the suspect being broadcast on television could result in the killer also targeting her. When his suspicions prove correct and an attempt is made on Chris's life at the dormitory where she lives, Joe and Charlie bring her to stay in their apartment for her safety. Joe, too, begins to fall for Christine, and she returns his feelings. However, Joe is tormented by the conflict between his deep friendship with Charlie and his feelings for the girl he knows Charlie to be in love with. When Joe aggressively attacks Charlie during a kendo competition, following a frank conversation about Chris, Charlie's facial reaction makes Joe believe that he resents the interracial nature of the relationship. Joe decides to quit the force, disillusioned after having felt for so long that his partner was free of this kind of racial bias. Charlie confronts Joe, telling him that the look he saw on his face was a flash of hatred rooted in the envy and betrayal he felt over Chris's love for Joe, and not born of racism, but Joe doesn't believe him. Though Joe and Charlie had assumed Hansel to be the one who shot Sugar and attacked Chris, the culprit turns out to be Roma, who considered Sugar a threat to her relationship with Hansel because she misinterpreted a look on his face while he was watching Sugar's burlesque show. Joe relates this to Charlie and realizes that just as Roma saw what she wanted to in Hansel's face, Joe projected his own struggles with racism onto Charlie. After Roma's arrest, Joe asks Charlie if they can still be partners. He replies with a no, citing his irreconcilable feelings about Joe and Chris's relationship, but adding that he is, nevertheless, glad that Joe has \"wrapped up his own case\".

He built his first airship, the Willows No. 1, in 1905 when he was 19. It was first flown  from East Moors, Cardiff on 5 August 1905, the flight lasting 85 minutes. This was soon followed by an improved Willows No. 2, in which he landed outside Cardiff City Hall on 4 June 1910. No. 2 was re-built as No. 3 which he named the City of Cardiff before he flew it from London to Paris in 1910. This was the first airship crossing of the English Channel at night and the first from England to France. The journey was not without incident, including dropping the maps over the side during the night, and problems with the envelope caused the airship to land at Corbehem near Douai at two o'clock in the morning. With the help of the local French aviator Louis Breguet the airship was repaired and arrived at Paris on 28 December 1910. He celebrated New Year's Eve with a flight around the Eiffel Tower.

He is exposed to Father Vincenzo Giuliani's organized crime \"family\", the Camorra. At a christening celebration, he meets Celestina, aged four, and her mother Gina, a divorcee with whom Emilio begins to fall in love. Emilio is released from the priesthood. He trains the second Jesuit expedition to Rakhat, composed of Sean Fein, Danny Iron Horse, and John Candotti, in the K'San and Ruanja languages. Sandoz refuses to go. Gina is about to go on vacation, after which Emilio plans to marry her. Unfortunately, while Gina is on vacation, Emilio is beaten and kidnapped by Carlo, Gina's ex-husband and Celestina's father. Emilio is kept in a constantly drugged state on Carlo's ship, the Giordano Bruno. They are actually working for the Jesuits and the Vatican, who want Sandoz to return to Rakhat. It is extremely important that the Jesuits put right what they destroyed on Rakhat; the massacre of the first landing party and the violent revolution of the Runa serving class that followed, have caused a rift between the Society of Jesus and the rest of the Catholic Church. In fact, the Jesuit order has all but vanished completely. Back on Rakhat, there is an unexpected survivor of the massacre; Sofia Mendes Quinn, grievously injured but her pregnancy intact, has been hidden from the Jana'ata patrols at a concealed village called Trucha Sai . She commands Runa troops in the revolution and is their Joan of Arc figure. She has been sending packets of information back to the initial Earth voyage's asteroid ship Stella Maris, still in orbit around Rakhat, as was the normal practice of the original landing party. She has her baby with help from the locals. Soon, it is apparent that her son, Isaac, is autistic. He is most comfortable alone in natural environments, and she educates him via her computer tablet. Sometime later, the signal from the Stella Maris becomes inactive, but Sofia does not guess that it is because other Earthmen\u2014the United Nations Contact Consortium\u2014came to Rakhat and sent the ship home, let alone that Emilio Sandoz had been rescued and was aboard, headed back for the lengthy inquisition covered in The Sparrow. Up in Inbrokar's ornate capital city Galatna, Hlavin Kitheri, the Jana'ata Reshtar , has fulfilled his promise to ambitious tradesman Supaari. When Supaari gave Emilio to Hlavin as a gift, Hlavin arranged a marriage between Supaari and his sister, Jholaa. Having lived all her life in strict purdah and enforced ignorance, she is not even told of their plans until the wedding is actually occurring. The ceremony includes consummation in front of everyone \u2014 actually rape in this case, because Jholaa was unprepared for marriage and did not desire Supaari. She detests him, and when she has a daughter, Supaari is told that the infant is deformed, and by tradition he must kill it. But on first glance he can see it is a lie, and a set-up \u2014 a practical joke by Hlavin, to wipe out Supaari's new family line before it can begin. Remembering Anne, the doctor of the human landing party who became his friend, he names his little girl Ha'anala, \"like Anne\". Taking her, he leaves behind everything and goes to his family. There, he recognizes that he has no place among the Jana'ata. The Runa of Kashan village, where the revolution began, offer to keep him safe as a hasta'akala . He has worked with them for decades, selling their merchandise in the city of Gayjur. By law, a hasta'akala's patron must provide all his food. The Runa have been bred for many centuries as not only servants but food for the Jana'ata; but the vaKashani love Supaari to the point of volunteering to die for him and the child to eat . Supaari refuses their kind offer. Instead he takes Ha'anala to where Sofia is and becomes a spy, aiding in the extermination of his own species. Ha'anala is a brilliant, inquisitive little girl whom Sofia educates as she would any Jewish child. One day, Isaac leaves. Ha'anala finds him, but she recognizes that he will not go back, so she accompanies him. They stumble upon a group of Jana'ata people in the N'Jarr Valley in the mountains and stay with them. Ha'anala later marries Shetri Laaks, one of these people, and has many children, although several of them die due to malnutrition; Ha'anala refuses to eat Runa. Hlavin Kitheri, inspired partly by his encounter with Sandoz, begins to revolutionize Jana'ata society by abolishing the stultifying hierarchies, even establishing a sort of democracy. He seizes the Paramountcy, the highest office in Inbrokar, by killing his entire family and framing Supaari for the murders. One of his first steps is to educate all the women. He hears of an extraordinary Jana'ata female, Suukmel. She advises him; he wants her, but she refuses to give him more than the chance to foster a child, Rukuei, with her. In the terrible war that follows, Hlavin fights Supaari in hand-to-hand combat, without armor. Both die in the prelude to the epic loss of Inbrokar to the Runa. Suukmel departs with Rukuei and finds the N'Jarr Valley. There Jana'ata and Runa work together, trying to build a new culture based on individual choice. The Jana'ata there believe they must find food other than Runa, but many are starving. There are game animals they could hunt, but they run the risk of being captured and killed by the Runa. Emilio Sandoz returns to Rakhat aboard the Giordano Bruno to find that the Runa have killed nearly all the Jana'ata and taken control of the planet for themselves. The Jesuits expected they would have to assist the Runa in their war for independence, but the Runa have won independently. Sofia talks to Emilio. The N'Jarr Valley is found, and Sofia sends Runa troops there, convinced that Ha'anala is keeping Isaac, now 40, captive. Isaac is staying there by his own choice, continuing a long-term project on his mother's old computer tablet. Ha'anala dies in childbirth, but Sandoz saves the baby. The Jesuit Danny Iron Horse, a Lakota, works with Suukmel to arrange an Indian reservation-like setup for the remaining Jana'ata on Rakhat. In the end, Emilio and the Mafiosi return to Earth on the Giordano Bruno, bringing with them Rukuei Kitheri, a poet. Sofia dies, and Suukmel stays in the N'Jarr Valley with Ha'anala's children and Isaac, who thinks he has found proof of the existence of God in patterns of music created by overlapping the genomes of all three sentient species . Sandoz comes home. Time has passed \u2014 Gina is dead. At her grave, he is greeted by a lady who reveals herself as Gina's second daughter as well as his own daughter.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "218_73", "question": "In what city was Tim Alexander born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_76516", "text": "There is no information about Alexander's early life in the contemporary sources. Indeed, the only hint as to his existence in a Bulgarian source is an anonymous reference in Ephraim's Prayer Canon to the Tsar, where he is only mentioned as \u201cthe son of the tsar\u201d. It is uncertain whether Alexander was born to Ivan Shishman's first wife, Kira Maria, or to his second wife, a daughter of Prince Lazar of Serbia . Due to Alexander's first-born status, Bulgarian historian Petar Nikov conjectures that at some point before 1395, Alexander was made co-ruler by his father Ivan Shishman. This would have been in line with a custom that dates to the reign of Ivan Alexander , Ivan Shishman's own father. Alexander had a younger brother, Fruzhin, who, in contrast to Alexander, was a staunch opponent of the Ottomans and a Hungarian subject. In addition to Fruzhin, Alexander had other brothers and sisters, of whom practically nothing is known. The Fall of Tarnovo in 1393 and the subsequent subjugation of the entire Tarnovo Tsardom in 1395 resulted in the execution of Ivan Shishman by Sultan Bayezid I . Though his successor Alexander was spared by the Ottomans, he was forced into accepting Islam and was exiled to Asia Minor so as to keep him far from his father's previous domains. Alexander, subsequently referred to as Iskender in Ottoman sources, was installed as governor of Samsun and the neighbouring territories . These lands lay along the southern Black Sea coast, between Sinope and Trebizond, and had been recently conquered by Bayezid. Alexander possibly remained governor of Samsun until 1402, when this region was conquered by the Timurids in the wake of the Battle of Ankara on 20 July of that year. After the Timurid victory, the Samsun region came under the rule of the Seljuk prince \u0130sfendiyar. Alexander's subsequent fate is unknown until the end of the Ottoman Interregnum in 1413, when Mehmed I had established himself as ruler of the Ottoman Empire and had retaken the region of Smyrna on the eastern Aegean coast. Until then, Smyrna had been ruled by C\u00fcneyt, the bey of Aydin, who was exiled as governor of the previously Bulgarian city of Nikopol on the Danube. Alexander was installed as the ruler of Smyrna in C\u00fcneyt's place. He remained in charge of the city until 1418, when he attempted to suppress a rebellion to the south of Smyrna headed by Sheikh Bedrettin's follower B\u00f6rkl\u00fcce Mustafa. However, Alexander's forces proved insufficient for the purpose. His army was ambushed in a mountain gorge and suffered a great defeat, during which Alexander was killed. According to the theory of Bulgarian historian Plamen Pavlov, during his time as governor of Smyrna, Alexander may have been in active contact with his possible half-brother, the future Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople. From 1393 to 1416, Joseph was the metropolitan bishop of Ephesus, another city on the eastern Aegean coast located not far from Smyrna. Pavlov conjectures that Joseph's selection as patriarch may have been influenced by his ties to Mehmed I via Alexander. In Pavlov's opinion, it is also possible that titular Bulgarian tsar Constantine II's support for Mehmed was in some way related to his relative Alexander's position as an Ottoman governor.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "218_90", "question": "In what city was Mike Gregory born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_13766", "text": "Gregory was born around 540 in Rome, then recently reconquered by the Eastern Roman Empire from the Ostrogoths. His parents named him Gregorius, which according to \u00c6lfric of Eynsham in An Homily on the Birth-Day of S. Gregory, \"... is a Greek Name [sic], which signifies in the Latin Tongue, Vigilantius, that is in English, Watchful...\" The medieval writer who provided this etymology did not hesitate to apply it to the life of Gregory. \u00c6lfric states, \"He was very diligent in God's Commandments.\" Gregory was born into a wealthy noble Roman family with close connections to the church. His father, Gordianus, a patrician who served as a senator and for a time was the Prefect of the City of Rome, also held the position of Regionarius in the church, though nothing further is known about that position. Gregory's mother, Silvia, was well-born, and had a married sister, Pateria, in Sicily. His mother and two paternal aunts are honored by Catholic and Orthodox churches as saints. Gregory's great-great-grandfather had been Pope Felix III, the nominee of the Gothic king, Theodoric. Gregory's election to the throne of St Peter made his family the most distinguished clerical dynasty of the period. The family owned and resided in a villa suburbana on the Caelian Hill, fronting the same street as the former palaces of the Roman emperors on the Palatine Hill opposite. The north of the street runs into the Colosseum; the south, the Circus Maximus. In Gregory's day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned. Villas covered the area. Gregory's family also owned working estates in Sicily and around Rome. Gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the Caelian and these were described 300 years later by John the Deacon. Gordianus was tall with a long face and light eyes. He wore a beard. Silvia was tall, had a round face, blue eyes and a cheerful look. They had another son whose name and fate are unknown. Gregory was born into a period of upheaval in Italy. From 542 the so-called Plague of Justinian swept through the provinces of the empire, including Italy. The plague caused famine, panic, and sometimes rioting. In some parts of the country, over a third of the population was wiped out or destroyed, with heavy spiritual and emotional effects on the people of the Empire. Politically, although the Western Roman Empire had long since vanished in favor of the Gothic kings of Italy, during the 540s Italy was gradually retaken from the Goths by Justinian I, emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire ruling from Constantinople. As the fighting was mainly in the north, the young Gregory probably saw little of it. Totila sacked and vacated Rome in 546, destroying most of its population, but in 549 he invited those who were still alive to return to the empty and ruined streets. It has been hypothesized that young Gregory and his parents retired during that intermission to their Sicilian estates, to return in 549. The war was over in Rome by 552, and a subsequent invasion of the Franks was defeated in 554. After that, there was peace in Italy, and the appearance of restoration, except that the central government now resided in Constantinople. Like most young men of his position in Roman society, Gregory was well educated, learning grammar, rhetoric, the sciences, literature, and law; he excelled in all these fields. Gregory of Tours reported that \"in grammar, dialectic and rhetoric ... he was second to none....\" He wrote correct Latin but did not read or write Greek. He knew Latin authors, natural science, history, mathematics and music and had such a \"fluency with imperial law\" that he may have trained in it \"as a preparation for a career in public life\". Indeed, he became a government official, advancing quickly in rank to become, like his father, Prefect of Rome, the highest civil office in the city, when only thirty-three years old. The monks of the Monastery of St. Andrew, established by Gregory at the ancestral home on the Caelian, had a portrait of him made after his death, which John the Deacon also saw in the 9th century. He reports the picture of a man who was \"rather bald\" and had a \"tawny\" beard like his father's and a face that was intermediate in shape between his mother's and father's. The hair that he had on the sides was long and carefully curled. His nose was \"thin and straight\" and \"slightly aquiline\". \"His forehead was high.\" He had thick, \"subdivided\" lips and a chin \"of a comely prominence\" and \"beautiful hands\". In the modern era, Gregory is often depicted as a man at the border, poised between the Roman and Germanic worlds, between East and West, and above all, perhaps, between the ancient and medieval epochs.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Picking it up, he sees his mother materialize in a cloud of mist. Afterwards, he returns to High Bluff but doesn't speak of his encounter. The next day Holly's trap has not worked, and Will again hears the sound. Holly hears it briefly as well, but dismisses it. Will is then summoned by the emanation to the Lost City but this time Holly follows him.  In the chamber Will again witnesses the image of his mother while holding a blue stone. His mother calls for him, but he is interrupted by Holly, who sees nothing until she touches the blue crystal as well. Holding it together, they are both beckoned by their mother to \"come home,\" but then she quickly adds, \"Too late. Come tomorrow. Don't tell.\" Will explains to Holly that he wants to tell Rick about his discovery but for some reason he is unable to. Holly replies that she will tell their father if he does not and Will sincerely hopes that she can. Will theorizes that they were looking through a time doorway that is open to a period when she was still alive. When Holly asks why her image is not very clear, her brother suggests that it might be because they do not remember her very well.  With that the two siblings, clearly heartbroken, return to High Bluff together. The next morning the trap has failed again, but both Will and Holly display utter disinterest, and when Rick pries into the issue, Will yells at him and leaves. He returns to apologize for snapping at Rick and while Rick says that he understands, he suspects something.  The next evening Will and Holly again hear the sound and are drawn to the Lost City. Rick secretly follows after them. Inside the phantom of their mother again beckons them, this time accompanied by their father, dressed in a suit. They follow him and he leads them deeper into the tunnels. As they walk, his appearance occasionally flickers to that of a Sleestak from the viewpoint of the audience. Rick finds another pulsing blue crystal and see an illusion of his children cheerfully asking them to follow them and see what they have discovered. However, Rick is not easily deceived and angrily smashes the crystal onto the floor. Immediately the image disappears and he sees a Sleestak in the tunnel that appeared to be one of the time doorways. Realizing that his children are in great danger, he destroys the false matrix and chases after the Sleestak. He finds his children being led to the Sleestak god, and takes the blue stone from them immediately breaking the hypnotic spell. Rick shatters the crystal, knocking one Sleestak into the pit and grapples with another finally tossing it in as well. They escape the city and return to High Bluff. Rick surmises that the blue stones allow people to see what they love the most by exerting \"some form of hypnosis.\" Holly dismantles her trap, saying it reminds her too much of the trap into which they were nearly caught.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Rowland Whyte mentioned a dance at Hampton Court held in the presence chamber of Anne of Denmark. Mary Herbert, described as \"Lady Pembroke\", danced with a member of the count's entourage, Prince Henry, and the Earl of Perth. Whyte wrote \"No lady there did dance near so well as she did that day\". Whyte added that the sisters were reluctant to write to their parents themselves. They were joined at Hampton Court by Lady Mary Wroth and Lady Montgomery. The Talbot Papers, held in Lambeth Palace Library, include several references to Mary. It appears from a letter of 1603 that Sir Thomas Edmondes was instrumental in persuading her father of the advantages of her marrying Pembroke.

Leonard found Out of This World a welcome antidote to The Avengers, which had proved a difficult production; he recalled, \"It was a great pleasure to make, getting away from today and exploring the unrealities of tomorrow. An opportunity for the suspension of disbelief even in the here and now ambiance of television\". The budget for each episode averaged \u00a35,000. Shubik soon ran into difficulties finding material suitable for adaptation, a problem that had plagued earlier aborted attempts to get a similar series off the ground.  A useful contact Shubik made was with John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction, founder of the magazine New Worlds and agent for many British science fiction writers.  Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis. The actor Boris Karloff, well known for his association with the horror film genre, was chosen as host for the new series.  This was an idea taken from such U.S. anthology series as The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Thriller and was in line with what had been done for Armchair Mystery Theatre, which was introduced by Donald Pleasence. Three scripts for Out of This World, adaptations of Philip K. Dick's \"Impostor\" and Clifford D.

In a 2003 TV special of NOVA, Dutch professor of Criminal Law Theo de Roos stated: \"In the Lucia de B. case statistical evidence has been of enormous importance. I do not see how one could have come to a conviction without it\". The law psychologist Henk Elffers, who was used by the courts as expert witness on statistics both in the original case and on appeal, was also interviewed on the programme and stated that the chance of a nurse working at the three hospitals being present at the scene of so many unexplained deaths and resuscitations is one in 342 million. This value was wrongly calculated. If one wishes to combine p-values of the statistical tests based on data from three separate wards, one must introduce a correction according to the number of tests, as a result of which the chance becomes one in a million. Biased reporting meant that even this lower figure was invalid. Events were attributed to de Berk once suspicions began to fall on her, which could not have had anything to do with her in reality. The statisticians Richard D. Gill and Piet Groeneboom calculated a chance of one in twenty-five that a nurse could experience a sequence of events of the same type as Lucia de Berk. Philip Dawid, Professor of Statistics at the University of Cambridge , stated that Elffers  \"made very big mistakes. He was not sufficiently professional to ask where the data came from and how accurate the data were. Even granted the data were accurate, he did some statistical calculations of a very simplistic nature, based on very simple and unrealistic assumptions.

Stiles and Ellery later served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, \"This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.\" The Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches were also interested in establishing a college in Rhode Island\u2014home of the mother church of their denomination. At the time, the Baptists were unrepresented among the colonial colleges; the Congregationalists had Harvard and Yale, the Presbyterians had the College of New Jersey , and the Episcopalians had the College of William and Mary and King's College . Isaac Backus, a historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural trustee of Brown, wrote of the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia: James Manning arrived at Newport in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the charter for the college. Stiles' first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that their denomination would be underrepresented in the College Board of Fellows. A revised charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode Island General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in East Greenwich. In September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the corporation\u2014the college's governing body\u2014was held in Newport's Old Colony House. Governor Stephen Hopkins was chosen chancellor, former and future governor Samuel Ward vice chancellor, John Tillinghast treasurer, and Thomas Eyres secretary. The charter stipulated that the board of trustees should be composed of 22 Baptists, five Quakers, five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists\u2014including the college president\u2014\"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations.\" At the time of its creation, Brown's charter was a uniquely progressive document. Other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's charter asserted, \"Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction.\" The document additionally \"recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other [university charter] the principle of denominational cooperation.\" The oft-repeated statement that Brown's charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership is inaccurate; other college charters were similarly liberal in that particular. The college was founded as Rhode Island College, at the site of the First Baptist Church in Warren, Rhode Island. James Manning was sworn in as the college's first president in 1765 and remained in the role until 1791. In 1766, the college authorized Rev. Morgan Edwards to travel to Europe to \"solicit Benefactions for this Institution.\" During his year-and-a-half stay in the British Isles, the reverend secured funding from benefactors including Thomas Penn and Benjamin Franklin. In 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations. After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building. A building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He meets Alexandria, a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake, Alexander the Great. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day. The next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior, a muscular ex-slave named Otta Benga, an Italian explosives expert called Luigi, Charles Darwin with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic. Alexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing morphine from the hospital pharmacy. Roy intends to use the morphine to commit suicide because the woman he loves has left him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills. Roy asks what happened to the rest of the pills in the bottle, and Alexandria says she threw all but three of them down the toilet, having mistaken the \"E\" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a \"3\". The stories become a collaborative tale to which Alexandria also contributes. Alexandria herself becomes a character: while Roy is the masked bandit, she is his daughter. Roy talks Alexandria into stealing a bottle of morphine tablets locked in a fellow patient's cabinet, and then downs it all. He tells her she should leave after he takes them, but he knows she may not obey and may very well witness the death of the man she has come to view as her father. This does not come to pass, as the next morning Roy awakens from his sleep and realizes he is only alive because his neighboring patient is receiving a placebo rather than actual morphine. Alexandria, desperate to help Roy, sneaks out of bed to the pharmacy. She climbs onto the cabinet but loses her footing, falls, and sustains a severe head injury. She receives surgery, after which she is visited by Roy, where he confesses his deception. He encourages Alexandria to ask someone else to end the story, but she insists on hearing Roy's ending. Roy reluctantly begins the rest of the story. The heroes die one by one, and it seems that Governor Odious will be triumphant. Alexandria becomes upset, and Roy insists, \"It's my story.\" She declares that it is hers too and exerts some influence on the course of the tale. The epic tale comes to an end with only the Bandit and his daughter remaining alive and Governor Odious dying. But in one final twist, Roy, who has been crafting the story to manipulate Alexandria and cope with his anger, targets the character representing his ex-girlfriend. He blames her for orchestrating the story's pain and suffering as part of a \"test\" of the Bandit's love for her. The Bandit rejects her as an act of ultimate triumph. With the story complete, Roy and Alexandria, along with the patients and staff of the hospital, watch a viewing of the finished  \"flicker\" that Roy appeared in. With everyone laughing, only Roy's smile is broken in confusion when he sees that his life-threatening jump has been edited out of the film as another stuntman jumps instead. Alexandria's arm heals and she returns to the orange orchard where her family works. Her voice-over reveals that Roy has recovered and is now back at work again. As she talks, a montage of cuts from several of silent films' greatest and most dangerous stunts plays; she imagines all the stuntmen to be Roy.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He returned to the United States where he was engaged by Bryant Baker. In 1940 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1943. In 1941, De Lue won a competition to create sculpture for the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse Building in Philadelphia, and from then on he stopped being an assistant for other artists and only worked on his own commissions and creations. De Lue's works can be found in many museums across America. Like many other sculptors of his generation, he executed architectural works. He was also a prolific designer of medals and medallions. De Lue taught at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York City during the early 1940s. In 1960, he won two Henry Hering Awards, given by the National Sculpture Society for outstanding collaboration between a sculptor and an architect, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, and for the Stations of the Cross at the Loyola Jesuit Seminary in Shrub Oak, New York. In 1967, De Lue won the American Numismatic Society's J. Sanford Saltus Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Art of the Medal, known as the Saltus Award. Beginning in 1964, for many years De Lue was a Trustee of Brookgreen Gardens, as well as Chairman of the Art Committee. In his later years, De Lue and his wife Naomi lived in the Leonardo section of Middletown Township, New Jersey, a small shore town with a bayside beach and long-distance view of lower Manhattan. De Lue cited the 23rd Psalm and the words \"He leadeth me beside the still waters...\" as the inspiration by which he arrived in Leonardo from New York City.  Although he continued to maintain his NYC apartment, it was in his Leonardo studio that many of his largest statues were made.  One of the last was a commission by a private individual intended for the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas.  The bigger-than-life statue of Bowie, Travis and Crockett was considered \"too violent\" by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas for placement in a sacred chapel.  A compromise was sought, that the statue be installed outside the building in the large courtyard rather than inside.  DeLue and his patron, a wealthy Texan, preferred the statue be installed in the interior space for which it was made.  Unfortunately, the impasse was never resolved in De Lue's lifetime.

However, this balance came to an end when Barbatos escaped his bonds and allowed the rejected timelines to remain in some form of existence. Eventually, Barbatos is released onto the DC universe when Batman is treated with five unique metals, turning him into a portal to the Dark Multiverse, with this ortal also allowing Barbatos to summon an army of evil alternate Batmen known as the Dark Knights, led by a God-like Batman, who describe themselves as having been created based on Batman's dark imaginations of what he could do if he possessed the powers of his colleagues. Barbatos is a hooded, God-like being in the Dark Multiverse. Barbatos had previously visited Prime-Earth in the DC Multiverse and founded the Tribe of Judas, which would later become the Court of Owls. Sometime before returning to the Dark Multiverse, Barbatos encountered Hawkman/Carter Hall, and was hit by his mace. Barbatos tried to return to the Multiverse but the events of Final Crisis prevented him from doing so. However, after witnessing Bruce Wayne/Batman being sent back in time by Darkseid's Omega Beams, Barbatos realised the similarities between his and Bruce's Bat emblems and believed he could use him as a doorway. Barbatos' followers manipulated events in order for Bruce to be injected with four out of the five metals needed to create the doorway, and after the fifth was injected in the present day, Barbatos was able to transport himself and the Dark Knights to Prime-Earth to conquer it. The Batman Who Laughs is a version of Batman from Earth -22, a dark reflection of the Earth-22. In that reality, the Earth -22 Joker learned of Batman's identity as Bruce Wayne and killed most of Batman's other rogues along with Commissioner Gordon.

When Batman grappled with the Joker, it resulted in the latter's death as Batman is exposed to a purified form of the chemicals that gradually turned him into a new Joker, the process proving irreversible by the time Batman discovered what was happening to him. The Batman who Laughs proceeded to take over Earth-22, killing off most of his allies and turning Damian into a mini-Joker. The Batman Who Laughs seems to be the de facto leader or second-in-command of Barbatos' Dark Knights and recruited the other members. After arriving on Prime-Earth, the Batman Who Laughs takes control of Gotham and oversees events at the Challenger's mountain. He distributes joker cards to the Batman's Rogues, giving them the ability to alter reality and take over sections of the city. Accompanying him are Damian and three other youths whom he also calls his sons, all four being twisted versions of Robin, having intended to destroy all of reality by linking the Over-Monitor to Anti-Monitor's astral brain. But The Batman Who Laughs is defeated when the Prime Universe Batman is aided by the Joker, who notes the alternate Batman's failure to perceive this scenario due to still being a version of Batman. While assumed dead, the Batman who Laughs is revealed to be in the custody of Lex Luthor who offers him a place in the Legion of Doom. The Red Death is a version of Batman from Earth -52, originally an aged man who broke after the deaths of Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian. Believing he has a chance to prevent the loss of more loved ones, Bruce decides he needs the Flash's Speed Force to achieve this and equipped himself with the Rogues' equipment of capture the Flash. He is able to knock Barry out and ties him to the Batmobile which has a machine created from reverse-engineering the Cosmic Treadmill attached to it. Using this machine against Barry's wishes, Bruce drove straight into the Speed Force while absorbing Barry in the process. Horribly scarred and now suffering from a split-personality created from residual traces of the Earth -52 Barry's mind, the newly born Red Death tests his new powers but realises he cannot stop his Earth from its destruction until he is recruited by The Batman Who Laughs, who promises him a new Earth to live upon. After entering Prime-Earth, the Red Death arrives in Central City and is confronted by Iris West and Wally West, in which he uses his powers to slow Wally and age them both. The Flash confronts the Red Death and before the latter can attack, Doctor Fate saves Barry. The Red Death proclaims that he will save Central City and make it his new home. After Barry is transported to a 'sand'-filled cave beneath Central City, the Red Death arrives and reveals several Flashmobiles and chases after Barry. During the events of the Wild Hunt, the Red Death ceased when exposed by an energy wave from the release of a newly born universe with the restored -52 Barry eventually destroyed from the energy consuming him. The Murder Machine is a version of Batman from Earth -44, a dark reflection of the Earth-44. Distraught from having lost Alfred, Batman requested Cyborg to help him finish the Alfred Protocol, an A.I. version of Alfred. But the Alfred Protocol malfunctioned upon activation and began to multiply and kill all of Batman's Rogues Gallery. Bruce pleaded with Cyborg to help find a way to fix it but the latter refused. The Alfred Protocol began to merge with Bruce and the two became the Murder Machine, and his first act as this new entity was to kill Cyborg. After being recruited by the Batman Who Laughs, the Murder Machine arrives on Prime-Earth with the other Dark Knights. He proceeds to the Justice League's Watchtower and confronts Cyborg. After Cyborg is incapacitated by the other Dark Knights, the Murder Machine infects and converts the Watchtower as the Dark Knights' new base of operations. The Dawnbreaker is a version of Batman from Earth -32, a dark reflection of the Earth-32 where Batman became a Green Lantern. When Earth -32 Bruce lost his parents to Joe Chill, he is chosen by a Green Power Ring to become a Green Lantern. But Bruce's will overrides the ring's ban on lethal force and corrupts it, enabling him to use it to kill Chill and various criminals. After Bruce killed Gordon when eventually confronted, he wipes out the Green Lantern Corp and the Guardians of the Universe when they confront him. Bruce then entered his giant Green Lantern Power Battery and exits with a new outfit and moniker, the Dawnbreaker. However, he finds that his Earth has begun to collapse and he is met by the Batman Who Laughs who, after recruiting the Red Death and the Murder Machine, recruits the Dawnbreaker, promising him a new world to shroud in darkness. After arriving on Earth-0, Dawnbreaker heads to Coast City where he is confronted by Hal Jordan. Dawnbreaker tries to consume Hal Jordan in a 'blackout' but the latter is rescued by Doctor Fate. With Green Lantern gone, Dawnbreaker takes control of Coast City. The Dawnbreaker confronts Hal Jordan in a blacked out cave underneath Coast City, claiming that the Green Lantern oath is worthless in his cave. The Drowned is a version of Batman from Earth -11, a dark reflection of the reversed-gender Earth-11. Originally known as Batwoman, Bryce Wayne was in a relationship with Sylvester Kyle until he was killed by a metahuman. A revenge-driven Bryce spent 18 months hunting down every rogue metahuman before Aquawoman and the Atlanteans emerged from their self-imposed exile. While Aquawoman claimed her people came in peace, a skeptical Bryce declared war on Atlantis with the Atlanteans flooding Gotham in retaliation when their queen was killed. Bryce survived the disaster by performing auto-surgery on herself by introducing mutated hybrid DNA into her body, giving Bryce the ability to breath underwater, accelerated healing, and water manipulation. She also created an army of Dead Waters to fight for her. Donning a new attire, Bryce called herself The Drowned and successfully conquered Atlantis at the cost of flooding every city. After seeing her signal being lit, the Drowned met the Batman Who Laughs and recruits her as a Dark Knight. After arriving on Earth-0, the Drowned headed to Amnesty Bay, where she was confronted by Aquaman and Mera. The two were unable to combat the Drowned and her army of Dead Waters, with Mera becoming infected and controlled by the Drowned while Aquaman was saved by Doctor Fate. The Drowned proceeded to take control of Amnesty Bay. When Aquaman is transported fathoms below Amnesty Bay, the Drowned attacks him, revealing that the infected Mera has mutated into a gargantuan shark/crab/octopus creature. The Merciless is a version of Batman from Earth -12, a dark reflection of Earth-12 where Batman is in a relationship with Wonder Woman. Having killed Ares to avenge Wonder Woman when he assumed she died, the Earth -12 Batman acquired Ares's helmet and assumed that he can channel its power to war with justice and mercy rather than ruthless brutality. But it corrupted him and the 'Merciless' Batman ended up killing Wonder Woman while eliminating all his enemies. The Merciless is later depicted as destroying the Valhalla Mountain when Sam Lane, Amanda Waller, Steve Trevor and Mister Bones attempt a counter-attack against the Dark Batmen after the regular heroes have apparently failed. The Merciless confronts Wonder Woman after she is transported under the foundation of A.R.G.U.S Headquarters in Washington D.C., revealing his armory filled with the divine arsenal of the Gods he killed on his Earth. He reveals to her that his Diana taught him to fight and after he destroyed the Gods, the Merciless found Themyscria and fought them for three days. The Merciless also reveals that he ordered the Ferryman at the River Styx to gather every coin from every dead Amazon seeking passage into the afterlife which he melted into a giant golden drachma, which he strikes with a hammer, summoning the undead Amazons. The Devastator is a version of Batman from Earth -1, a dark reflection of Earth-1. When Superman turned evil and kills friend and foe alike along with Lois, the Earth-1 Batman injected himself with an engineered version of the Doomsday virus to stop the Kryptonian at the cost of his humanity as he transformed into a Doomsday-like monster. Despite his victory, the Devastator still feels remorse for not being able to protect Metropolis from Superman's wrath. The Batman Who Laughs offers The Devastator a second chance at saving those whom he feels are blindly inspired by Superman. Bruce infects the Earth-0 Lois Lane, Supergirl, and all of Metropolis with the Doomsday virus as he views it as the only way to protect them from Superman's strength and false prophecies. Along with the Murder Machine, the Devastator was sent to retrieve the Cosmic Tuning Tower, ripping it out of its foundation and throwing it outside the Fortress of Solitude. He is then confronted by the two Green Lanterns of Earth , The Flash/Wally West, Firestorm, and Lobo and he proceeds to incapacitate all except Lobo who he throws into the Sun. Grabbing the Cosmic Tuning Tower, the Devastator leaps into space and lands on the Challenger's Mountain, planting the tower on top of it.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He showed a great aptitude for art from an early age, and was for a while an informal pupil of George Morland. In 1807, he entered the schools of the Royal Academy , and exhibited at the Academy for the first time in the same year. In 1809 he was awarded a medal in the life school, and exhibited three pictures\\: Boy at Breakfast, Boys with a Bird's-nest and a Portrait of Master Lee as he spoke the Prologue at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1811, Collins sold a picture entitled The Young Fifer to the Marquis of Stafford for 80 guineas , and the next year produced the work which made him famous, The Sale of the Pet Lamb, which was sold for 140 forty guineas and engraved by S. W. Reynolds. He now became the chief support of his family after the death of his father and found some valuable patrons, especially Sir Thomas Freeman Heathcote, Sir John Leicester, Sir Robert Peel, Sir George Beaumont, and Lord Liverpool. In 1814 two pictures, The Blackberry Gatherers and The Birdcatchers won him an associateship of the Royal Academy . In 1815, Collins undertook a sketching tour of the coast near Cromer and produced a Scene on the Coast of Norfolk which was acquired by the Prince Regent.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?maker=13083&object=407233&row=0 |title=Scene on the Coast of Norfolk |publisher=Royal Collection}}</ref> In 1817 he visited Paris with Leslie and Washington Allston and painted The Departure of the Diligence from Rouen, and the Scene on the Boulevards \u2013 these were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818. He also painted several portraits about this time. In 1820, Collins was elected a Royal Academician , presenting as his diploma picture The Young Anglers. In 1822 he married Harriet Geddes, sister of the portrait painter Margaret Sarah Carpenter. He continued to exhibit with popularity and travel in England and Scotland. In 1826 he painted The Fisherman's Departure, , and in 1828 made a tour of the Netherlands and Belgium, living for short time in Boulogne in 1836. Rustic Hospitality was painted in 1834 and in 1836 Sunday Morning and As Happy as a King, the subject of the latter being suggested to Collins by the story of a country boy whose ideal of regal happiness was swinging on a gate all day and eating fat bacon. In September 1836, Collins left London for Italy, where he remained for two years, occupying himself with advancing his knowledge of painting, but he had to return due to illness. He then began a series of pictures depicting Italian life, including Poor Travellers at the door of a Capuchin Convent near Vico, Bay of Naples and A Scene near Subiaco, both exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839. They were followed in 1840\u20131841 by two New Testament subjects: Our Saviour with the Doctors in the Temple, and The Two Disciples at Emmaus. From 1840 to 1842 Collins was librarian to the Royal Academy and in 1843 moved to a large house at 1 Devonport Street, Hyde Park Gardens. In 1840 he visited Germany and in 1842 the Shetland Islands, the latter inspiring a series of illustrations for Sir Walter Scott's novel Pirate, which appeared in the \"Waverley\" edition of the book. In 1846 Collins's Early Morning was exhibited. Ruskin commented, \"I have never seen the oppression of sunlight in a clear, lurid, rainy atmosphere more perfectly or faithfully rendered, and the various portions of reflected and scattered light are all studied with equal truth and solemn feeling.\" Collins also produced some watercolours such as The Rat-catcher, Landing Fish, A Street in Naples and Kentish Peasant Girls, and did several etchings, most of which were given to the British Museum by Mrs. Collins, along with engravings of his best works.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was the second of eight children of James Cook , a Scottish farm labourer from Ednam in Roxburghshire, and his locally born wife, Grace Pace , from Thornaby-on-Tees. In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at Great Ayton, where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school. In 1741, after five years' schooling, he began work for his father, who had been promoted to farm manager. Despite not being formally educated he became capable in mathematics, astronomy and charting by the time of his Endeavour voyage. For leisure, he would climb a nearby hill, Roseberry Topping, enjoying the opportunity for solitude. Cooks' Cottage, his parents' last home, which he is likely to have visited, is now in Melbourne, Australia, having been moved from England and reassembled, brick by brick, in 1934. In 1745, when he was 16, Cook moved  to the fishing village of Staithes, to be apprenticed as a shop boy to grocer and haberdasher William Sanderson. Historians have speculated that this is where Cook first felt the lure of the sea while gazing out of the shop window. After 18 months, not proving suited for shop work, Cook travelled to the nearby port town of Whitby to be introduced to Sanderson's friends John and Henry Walker. The Walkers, who were Quakers, were prominent local ship-owners in the coal trade. Their house is now the Captain Cook Memorial Museum. Cook was taken on as a merchant navy apprentice in their small fleet of vessels, plying coal along the English coast. His first assignment was aboard the collier Freelove, and he spent several years on this and various other coasters, sailing between the Tyne and London. As part of his apprenticeship, Cook applied himself to the study of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, navigation and astronomy\u2014all skills he would need one day to command his own ship. His three-year apprenticeship completed, Cook began working on trading ships in the Baltic Sea. After passing his examinations in 1752, he soon progressed through the merchant navy ranks, starting with his promotion in that year to mate aboard the collier brig Friendship. In 1755, within a month of being offered command of this vessel, he volunteered for service in the Royal Navy, when Britain was re-arming for what was to become the Seven Years' War. Despite the need to start back at the bottom of the naval hierarchy, Cook realised his career would advance more quickly in military service and entered the Navy at Wapping on 17 June 1755. Cook married Elizabeth Batts, the daughter of Samuel Batts, keeper of the Bell Inn in Wapping and one of his mentors, on 21 December 1762 at St Margaret's Church, Barking, Essex. The couple had six children: James , Nathaniel , Elizabeth , Joseph , George and Hugh . When not at sea, Cook lived in the East End of London. He attended St Paul's Church, Shadwell, where his son James was baptised. Cook has no direct descendants\u2014all of his children died before having children of their own.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Debuting in June 1948, the show was originally broadcast from the Maxine Elliott Theatre on West 39th Street in New York City. In January 1953, it moved to CBS-TV Studio 50, at 1697 Broadway in New York City, which in 1967 was renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater . From 1936 to 1950, Studio 50 was a CBS Radio playhouse. Before that it was variously known as Manhattan Theatre, Billy Rose's Music Hall, and Hammerstein's Theatre . Television critics gave the new show and its host poor reviews. Harriet Van Horne alleged that \"he got where he is not by having a personality, but by having no personality.\" Sullivan had little acting ability; in 1967, 20 years after his show's debut, Time magazine asked, \"What exactly is Ed Sullivan's talent?\" His mannerisms on camera were so awkward that some viewers believed the host suffered from Bell's palsy. Time in 1955 stated that Sullivan resembled \"Yet,\" the magazine concluded, \"instead of frightening children, Ed Sullivan charms the whole family.\" Sullivan appeared to the audience as an average guy who brought the great acts of show business to their home televisions. \"Ed Sullivan will last\", comedian Fred Allen said, \"as long as someone else has talent.\" Frequent guest Alan King said, \"Ed does nothing, but he does it better than anyone else in television.\" A typical show would feature a vaudeville act , one or two popular comedians, a singing star, a hot jukebox favorite, a figure from the legitimate theater, and for the kids, a visit with puppet \"Topo Gigio, the little Italian mouse\", or a popular athlete. The bill was often international in scope, with many European performers augmenting the American artists. Sullivan had a healthy sense of humor about himself and permitted\u2014even encouraged\u2014impersonators such as John Byner, Frank Gorshin, Rich Little, and especially Will Jordan, to imitate him on his show. Johnny Carson also did a fair impression, and even Joan Rivers imitated Sullivan's unique posture. The impressionists exaggerated his stiffness, raised shoulders, and nasal tenor phrasing, along with some of his commonly used introductions, such as \"And now, right here on our stage...\", \"For all you youngsters out there...\", and \"a really big shew\" . The latter phrase was in fact in the exclusive domain of his impressionists, as Sullivan never actually spoke the phrase \"really big show\" in the opening introduction of any episode in the entire history of the series. Will Jordan portrayed Sullivan in the films I Wanna Hold Your Hand, The Buddy Holly Story, The Doors, Mr. Saturday Night, Down with Love, and in the 1979 TV movie Elvis. Sullivan played himself parodying his mannerisms as directed by Jerry Lewis in Lewis' 1964 film The Patsy. Sullivan inspired a song in the musical Bye Bye Birdie, and in 1963, appeared as himself in the film. In 1954, Sullivan was a co-host on a memorable TV musical special, General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Conner later sold the ground to John and Sarah Berry, who donated  of their land to Madison County on the condition that the county seat be moved from Pendleton to Anderson. John Berry laid out the first plat of Anderson on November 7, 1827. In 1828 the seat of justice was moved from Pendleton to Anderson. The city is named for Chief William \"Adam\" Anderson, whose mother was a Delaware Indian and whose father was of Swedish descent. Chief Anderson's name in Lenape was Kikthawenund meaning \"creaking boughs\". The Delaware village was known as Anderson's Town, though the Moravian Missionaries called it \"The Heathen Town Four Miles Away.\" Anderson was also known as Andersonton before being formally organized as Anderson. Introduction of internal improvements by the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act caused a growth in the population in 1837. In December, 1838, Anderson was incorporated as a town with 350 inhabitants. The Central Canal, a branch of the Wabash and Erie Canal, was planned to come through Anderson. Work continued on the canal during 1838 and the beginning of 1839, but work on the canal was soon suspended by the state following the Panic of 1837. The town again became a sleepy village until 1849 when it was incorporated a second time as a town. Many new commercial ventures located around the Courthouse Square. This incorporation was short-lived and Anderson once again went back to village status in 1852. However, with the completion of the Indianapolis Bellefontaine Railroad, as well as their station in 1852, Anderson burst to life. The third incorporation of Anderson as a town occurred on June 9, 1853. The population continued to increase. On August 28, 1865, with a population of nearly 1,300 people, Anderson was incorporated as a city. Between 1853 and the late 19th century, twenty industries of various sizes located there. On March 31, 1887, natural gas was discovered in Anderson. As the Indiana Gas Boom began, this discovery led new businesses that could use natural gas, such as glass-making, to move to the city. Anderson grew to such proportions that a Cincinnati newspaper editor labeled the city \"The Pittsburgh on White River.\" Other appellations were \"Queen City of the Gas Belt\" and \"Puncture Proof City.\" In 1897 the Interurban Railroad was born in Anderson. Charles Henry, a large stock holder, coined the term \"Interurban\" in 1893. It continued to operate until 1941. The year 1912 spelled disaster for Anderson: the natural gas ran out, due to the residents squandering their resources.  The city left its gas powered lights on day and night, and there are stories of a pocket of natural gas being lit in the river and burning for a prolonged period for the spectacle of it. The result of the loss of natural gas was that several factories moved out. The whole city slowed down. The Commercial Club was the forerunner of the present chamber of commerce. This club persuaded the Remy brothers to stay in Anderson and others to locate there. For decades, Delco Remy and Guide Lamp , which during World War II built the M3 submachine gun and the FP-45 Liberator pistol for the allies, were the top two employers in the city. From 1913 through the 1950s, the Ward-Stilson Company was one of the country's largest producers of uniforms, regalia, furniture and props for the Freemasons, the Odd Fellows and dozens of other U.S. fraternal organizations. The Church of God of Anderson located its world headquarters in Anderson in 1905. Anderson Bible School was opened in 1917, and this was separated from Gospel Trumpet in 1925. At the same time, it became known as Anderson Bible School and Seminary. In 1925, the name was changed to Anderson College and then to Anderson University in 1988. Over the years, 17 different types of automobiles were manufactured in Anderson with the Lambert family among the city's leaders in its development and Buckeye Gasoline Buggy the Lambert product. Many other inventions were perfected in Anderson including: the gas regulator , the stamp vending machine , clothes presser , \"Irish Mail\" handcars , flower car for funeral homes ), Sisson choke , and the vulcanizing process to retread tires . Anderson hosted a National Basketball Association franchise for the 1949\u201350 season, being one of the smaller cities to have had a major league franchise in a Big Four American sport.

He was the son of the painter Matthijs Bril the Elder.  Paul and his older brother Matthijs likely started their artistic training with their father in Antwerp. Paul may also have been a student of the Antwerp painter Damiaen Wortelmans who was specialised in the decoration of harpsichords. Matthijs moved to Rome probably around 1575. Here he worked on several frescoes in the Vatican Palace. It is believed Paul joined his brother in Rome around or after 1582. When Matthijs died in 1583, his brother likely continued his work, picking up many of Matthijs' commissions.  Paul's earliest known works date from the late 1580s.  He established his reputation with commissions from Pope Gregory XIII in the Collegio Romano.  His success was assured after Pope Sixtus V became his principal patron. Bril was part of a team specialized in landscape painting and thus participated in almost every assignment which entailed decorative landscapes, such as in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Vatican Palace and the Scala Santa. Another important early commission was the fresco cycle in the Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome of around 1599. Pope Clement VIII also became his patron and gave the artist a commission for a monumental seascape on the Martyrdom of St. Clement.  Paul Bril completed this commission  in the Vatican Palace\u2019s Sala Clementina in collaboration with the brothers Giovanni and Cherubino Alberti . In 1601 Paul received another major commission, to paint a series of large canvases featuring properties of the Mattei family.  Paul further painted landscape frescoes in the Casino dell'Aurora of the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome. His patrons were among the most influential people in Rome and included members from the Colonna, Borghese, Mattei and Barberini families in Rome as well as Cardinal Federico Borromeo in Milan, Cardinal Carlo de\u2019 Medici in Florence and Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga in Mantua. In 1621, Paul Bril became director of the Accademia di San Luca, the artists' academy in Rome. This was a clear sign of the high esteem in which he was held by his fellow artists in Rome as he was the first foreigner to hold this position. He had many students including his son Cyriacus Bril, Luigi Carboni, Balthasar Lauwers, Willem van Nieulandt II, Pieter Spierinckx, Agostino Tassi and Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom.  Karel Philips Spierincks may also briefly have been his pupil. Paul Bril died in Rome in 1626.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At this time Moses was born to his father Amram, son of Kehath the Levite, who entered Egypt with Jacob's household; his mother was Jochebed , who was kin to Kehath. Moses had one older sister, Miriam, and one older brother, Aaron. The Pharaoh had commanded that all male Hebrew children born would be drowned in the river Nile, but Moses's mother placed him in an ark and concealed the ark in the bulrushes by the riverbank, where the baby was discovered and adopted by Pharaoh's daughter, and raised as an Egyptian. One day, after Moses had reached adulthood, he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew. Moses, in order to escape the Pharaoh's death penalty, fled to Midian , where he married Zipporah. There, on Mount Horeb, God appeared to Moses as a burning bush, revealed to Moses his name YHWH and commanded him to return to Egypt and bring his chosen people out of bondage and into the Promised Land .  During the journey, God tried to kill Moses, but Zipporah saved his life. Moses returned to carry out God's command, but God caused the Pharaoh to refuse, and only after God had subjected Egypt to ten plagues did the Pharaoh relent. Moses led the Israelites to the border of Egypt, but there God hardened the Pharaoh's heart once more, so that he could destroy the Pharaoh and his army at the Red Sea Crossing as a sign of his power to Israel and the nations. After defeating the Amalekites in Rephidim, Moses led the Israelites to Mount Sinai, where he was given the Ten Commandments from God, written on stone tablets. However, since Moses remained a long time on the mountain, some of the people feared that he might be dead, so they made a statue of a golden calf and worshipped it, thus disobeying and angering God and Moses. Moses, out of anger, broke the tablets, and later ordered the elimination of those who had worshiped the golden statue, which was melted down and fed to the idolaters. He also wrote the ten commandments on a new set of tablets. Later at Mount Sinai, Moses and the elders entered into a covenant, by which Israel would become the people of YHWH, obeying his laws, and YHWH would be their god. Moses delivered the laws of God to Israel, instituted the priesthood under the sons of Moses's brother Aaron, and destroyed those Israelites who fell away from his worship. In his final act at Sinai, God gave Moses instructions for the Tabernacle, the mobile shrine by which he would travel with Israel to the Promised Land. From Sinai, Moses led the Israelites to the Desert of Paran on the border of Canaan. From there he sent twelve spies into the land. The spies returned with samples of the land's fertility, but warned that its inhabitants were giants.  The people were afraid and wanted to return to Egypt, and some rebelled against Moses and against God.  Moses told the Israelites that they were not worthy to inherit the land, and would wander the wilderness for forty years until the generation who had refused to enter Canaan had died, so that it would be their children who would possess the land. Later on, Korah was punished for leading a revolt against Moses. When the forty years had passed, Moses led the Israelites east around the Dead Sea to the territories of Edom and Moab. There they escaped the temptation of idolatry, conquered the lands of Og and Sihon in Transjordan, received God's blessing through Balaam the prophet, and massacred the Midianites, who by the end of the Exodus journey had become the enemies of the Israelites due to their notorious role in enticing the Israelites to sin against God. Moses was twice given notice that he would die before entry to the Promised Land: in Numbers 27:13, once he had seen the Promised Land from a viewpoint on Mount Abarim, and again in Numbers 31:1 once battle with the Midianites had been won. On the banks of the Jordan River, in sight of the land, Moses assembled the tribes.

{"id": "218_194", "question": "In what city was Edward Drinker Cope born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "218_29149", "text": "Edward Drinker Cope was born on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. The death of his mother when he was three years old seemed to have had little effect on young Edward, as he mentioned in his letters that he had no recollection of her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth. Edward was born and raised in a large stone house called \"Fairfield\", whose location is now within the boundaries of Philadelphia. The  of pristine and exotic gardens of the house offered a landscape that Edward was able to explore. The Copes began teaching their children to read and write while very young, and took Edward on trips across New England and to museums, zoos, and gardens. Cope's interest in animals became apparent at a young age, as did his natural artistic ability. Alfred intended to give his son the same education he himself had received. At age nine, Edward was sent to a day school in Philadelphia; at 12, he attended the Friends' Boarding School at Westtown, near West Chester, Pennsylvania. The school was founded in 1799 with fundraising by members of the Society of Friends , and provided much of the Cope family's education. The prestigious school was expensive, costing Alfred $500 in tuition each year, and in his first year, Edward studied algebra, chemistry, scripture, physiology, grammar, astronomy, and Latin. Edward's letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to manipulate his father, and he was, according to author and Cope biographer Jane Davidson, \"a bit of a spoiled brat\". His letters suggest he was lonely at the school\u2014it was the first time he had been away from his home for an extended period. Otherwise, Edward's studies progressed much like a typical boy\u2014he consistently had \"less than perfect\" or \"not quite satisfactory\" marks for conduct from his teachers, and did not work hard on his penmanship lessons, which may have contributed to his often-illegible handwriting as an adult. Edward returned to Westtown in 1855, accompanied by two of his sisters. Biology began to interest him more that year, and he studied natural history texts in his spare time. While at the school, he frequently visited the Academy of Natural Sciences. Edward often obtained bad marks due to quarreling and bad conduct. His letters to his father show he chafed at farm work and betrayed flashes of the temper for which he would later become well known. After sending Edward back to the farm for summer break in 1854 and 1855, Alfred did not return Edward to school after spring 1856. Instead, Alfred attempted to turn his son into a gentleman farmer, which he considered a wholesome profession that would yield enough profit to lead a comfortable life, and improve the undersized Edward's health. Until 1863, Cope's letters to his father continually expressed his yearning for a more professional scientific career than that of a farmer, which he called \"dreadfully boring\". While working on farms, Edward continued his education on his own. In 1858, he began working part-time at the Academy of Natural Sciences, reclassifying and cataloguing specimens, and published his first series of research results in January 1859. Cope began taking French and German classes with a former Westtown teacher. Though Alfred resisted his son's pursuit of a science career, he paid for his son's private studies. Instead of working the farm his father bought for him, Edward rented out the land and used the income to further his scientific endeavors. Alfred finally gave in to Edward's wishes and paid for university classes. Cope attended the University of Pennsylvania in the 1861 and/or 1862 academic years, studying comparative anatomy under Joseph Leidy, one of the most influential anatomists and paleontologists at the time. Cope asked his father to pay for a tutor in German and French to allow him to read scholarly works in those languages. During this period, he had a job recataloging the herpetological collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences, where he became a member at Leidy's urging. Cope visited the Smithsonian Institution on occasion, where he became acquainted with Spencer Baird, who was an expert in the fields of ornithology and ichthyology. In 1861, he published his first paper on Salamandridae classification; over the next five years he published primarily on reptiles and amphibians. Cope's membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences and American Philosophical Society gave him outlets to publish and announce his work; many of his early paleontological works were published by the Philosophical Society.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In his own words, the trip \"corrupted\" him, sparking a fascination with the possibilities of rock music. Upon his return to Cologne later that year, an inspired Schmidt formed a group with American avant-garde composer and flautist David C. Johnson and music teacher Holger Czukay with the intention of exploring his newly broadened horizons. Up to that point, the inclinations of all three musicians had been exclusively avant-garde classical. In fact, both Schmidt and Czukay had directly studied under the influential composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Schmidt chose to play organ and piano, while Czukay played bass and was able to record their music with a basic two-track tape machine. The group was soon fleshed out by guitarist Michael Karoli, a 19-year-old pupil of Czukay, and drummer Jaki Liebezeit, who had grown disenchanted with his work in free jazz groups.

His father later settled in Antwerp and was likely his first teacher. His brothers Frans Francken I and Ambrosius Francken I both became successful painters. According to the early 17th century biographer Karel van Mander, who referred to him three times using three different names, i.e. Ieroon Francken van Herenthals, Ieroon Vrancks, and Ieroon Franck, Francken was a pupil of Frans Floris. He probably went to work with Floris in the early 1560s. It is unclear whether he traveled to Italy after his training in Antwerp. Such a trip is suggested by a work of his hand dated 1565 that depicts a scene from the Carnival of Venice . From 1566 to 1572 he was in France where he was one of the masters employed to decorate the Palace of Fontainebleau. Cornelis Floris, the Antwerp architect and brother of Francken's master Frans Floris, sent his son to Paris in 1568 to train with Hieronymus Francken I.  Hieronymus became a master in Paris in 1570 and a naturalized French citizen in 1572.  This did not stop him from returning to Antwerp regularly. In 1571 he was back in Antwerp to finish the Adoration of the Magi that had been left unfinished by Frans Floris when he died in 1570.  In 1574 he is documented in Antwerp. In 1571 he collaborated with his younger brother Frans on a large Adoration of the Magi triptych which bears his monogram as well as that of his younger brother Frans.  The brothers included self-portraits in profile: Hieronymus on the left side and Frans on the right side of the triptych.   From 1578 until his death Hieronymus lived in Paris and Fontainebleau. In 1578 Hieronymus married for the second time.  His second wife was Fran\u00e7oise Miraille, the daughter of an Italian embroiderer who was also concierge of Madame de la Roche-sur-Yon in Tournon Street.  The couple went on to have seven children. In 1619 four of his children were recorded as still being alive.  His daughter Isabella was a history and genre painter.  He was successful and frequented higher middle-class circles.  It is possibly that he also operated a side business as an art dealer. Hieronymus was appointed court painter to the French court in 1594.  His service at the French court had already started before this date. In the course of his career he served a large number of kings and queens including Louise de Lorraine , Henry III of France , the Queen-mother Catherine de' Medici and Henry IV of France as well as Marie de' Medici .  Near the end of his life, in 1607, Hieronymus was elevated to the nobility and could from then onwards refer to himself as 'noble homme, peintre du roy' .

He received his first architectural commission at age 19 when he was selected to design the new wing of the Abdin Palace in Cairo by Tewfik Pasha. He became known around the world for his innovative use of color, his pointillist technique, and his decorative use of line. He designed buildings throughout the world from Esterhazy Castle in Hungary to the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York. Urban studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under Karl von Hasenauer. In 1890, he and his brother-in-law, Heinrich Lefler, were among the founders of the Hagenbund. Urban's early work with illustrated books was inspired by Lefler and, together, they created what are considered seminal examples of children's book illustration. Urban immigrated to the United States in 1911 to become the art director of the Boston Opera Company. He was already an accomplished international architect, illustrator and theatre set designer with over 50 productions from his home Vienna Royal Opera, the Champs Elys\u00e9e Opera, and Covent Garden. By applying points of primary colors side by side on the canvas backdrops he was able to create and light theatre sets of vivid color reminiscent of the works by Monet or Seurat. In 1914 he moved to New York City, where he designed productions for the Metropolitan Opera and the Ziegfeld Follies; he continued to design for Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. until 1931. William Randolph Hearst was an important client and supporter. He also co-produced with Richard Ordynski Percy MacKaye's \"Community Masque\" Caliban by the Yellow Sands. Beginning in 1917, he was frequently engaged as stage designer by the Metropolitan Opera of New York City. In all he created set designs for 47 new productions at the house through 1933. His many designs provided the opera company with a cohesive production style throughout the tenure of General Manager Giulio Gatti-Casazza. Many of Urban's settings remained in the company's repertoire into the 1950s. Soon his sets and innovative lighting caught the eye of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., who hired him to design the Follies in the 1920s. Urban went to work creating a stunning night-club with glass balconies, a moving stage, and rainbow lighting effects. This Danse de Follies soon became a blend of ideas and talent before serving in the Follies theatre. Urban had success after success in his creating of the Follies' sets, and William Randolph Hearst, a media tycoon, took notice and wanted to hire Urban to work on his films starring Marion Davies, his mistress, and previous Follies starlet. Hearst came to an understanding with his friend Ziegfeld that Urban's work for him would not interfere with any of the Follies productions. Urban worked on 25 films over the years. Urban died July 10, 1933, of a heart attack at his apartment at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, where he had been convalescing following surgery in May.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His father, Israel Minor, was a merchant who made a large fortune in the pharmaceutical business. As a young man, Robert Minor worked as a bookkeeper in New York City but decided to study art in his early thirties. After studying in New York with painter Alfred Cornelius Howland, Minor went abroad in 1871 to continue his artistic education.  He visited various galleries in England before traveling to Barbizon, France, where he studied under Diaz.  He later studied in Antwerp under Joseph Van Luppen and Hippolyte Boulenger. In 1874, he was vice president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 artistique et litt\u00e9raire of Antwerp. On his return to the United States in 1874, he opened a studio in New York.  He painted for many years out of his studio in the Old University Building of New York University.  Painting in the Adirondack Mountains and later in Waterford, Connecticut, Minor soon became known for his landscapes resembling the Barbizon School.  Under the influence of George Inness and Alexander Helwig Wyant, he also began to paint in a Tonalist style.  His painting Great Silas at Night displays his adoption of the Tonalist style while his lingering Barbizon style can be seen in A Hillside Pasture.   From the 1890s until his death, Minor exhibited frequently with the Tonalists in New York. In 1897, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Design, New York.  In 1900, Minor achieved the height of his success at the historic William T. Evans sale in 1900, where his painting The Close of Day fetched $3,050, the highest price for a landscape by a living American painter at that auction. Over the course of his lifetime, Minor was a member of the Society of American Artists and the Salmagundi Club.  He exhibited in New York, Brooklyn, Chicago, and elsewhere in the United States, as well as in the Royal Academy of London and the salons of Paris and Antwerp. Minor was plagued with bad health during the last decade of his life.

On the first day of the conference, The Steinettes introduce Dick Cavett, who is hosting his show on location and covering the details of the event.

Around that time, a businessperson named Colonel Cody arrives at the conference, and heads to Garnell's room to interrogate and find out her plans. Next morning, Harry finds out that Burbank is beginning to support Garnell, and thinks that this is not right.  Later on, while discussing breastfeeding and abortion with Brill, Burbank is astonished that Garnell and Brill were actually born male.  After serving in the Army, both had sex change operations in 1960.  Bobby Hammer, a dirty tricks specialist, actually concocted this revelation to trick Burbank. After another discussion with Brill, Burbank enters the empty convention hall, where Cody interrupts her.  He finds her title, and the ideals of the HealtH organization, worthless.  Ashamed and in tears, Burbank is shocked that he controls not only HealtH, but also the ongoing election; he even plans to rig the votes and the outcome.  She runs back to tell Wolff on Cody's scheme.  As the couple start making love, Burbank is worried that it will be all over for her if Garnell wins.  Harry, however, assures her that Garnell is still a woman anyway. On the fourth and final day, the results of the HealtH election are announced live on Cavett's show, and Esther Brill comes out as the victor.  Burbank and her ex-husband watch on from their balcony outside, and also take a glimpse at Cody proposing an offer to Brill.  Some time later, Cody, who turns out to be her harmless nut brother, gets into a fit of anger, knocking down everything in his path, and demands to get away immediately. With the HealtH convention over, another one involving hypnotists is taking root at the hotel.  Before he and the candidates leave, Cavett briefly greets Dinah Shore, the host on hand for this event.  As the HealtH sign is taken down in front of the hotel, the Steinettes perform a Broadway-style show tune that closes the film.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Joanne B. Freeman, a history professor at Yale, contrasted the show's Hamilton to the \"real Hamilton [who] was a mass of contradictions: an immigrant who sometimes distrusted immigrants, a revolutionary who placed a supreme value on law and order, a man who distrusted the rumblings of the masses yet preached his politics to them more frequently and passionately than many of his more democracy-friendly fellows\". Australian historian Shane White found the framing of the show's story \"troubling\", stating that he and many historian colleagues \"would like to imagine that Hamilton is a last convulsion of the founding father mythology\". According to White, Miranda's depiction of the founding of the United States \"infuses new life into an older view of American history\" that centered on the Founding Fathers, instead of joining the many historians who were \"attempting to get away from the Great Men story\" by incorporating \"ordinary people, African-Americans, Native Americans and women\" into a \"more inclusive and nuanced\" historical narrative in which Hamilton has a \"cameo rather than leading role\". Rutgers University professor Lyra Monteiro criticized the show's multi-ethnic casting as obscuring a complete lack of identifiable enslaved or free persons of color as characters in the show. Monteiro identified other commentators, such as Ishmael Reed, who criticized the show for making Hamilton and other historical personages appear more progressive on racial injustice than they really were. In The Baffler, policy analyst Matt Stoller criticized the musical's portrayal of Hamilton as an idealist committed to democratic principles, in contrast to what he characterized as the historical record of Hamilton's reactionary, anti-democratic politics and legacy. For example, Stoller cited Hamilton as a leader involved in the Newburgh conspiracy ; his development of a national financial system which, in Stoller's view, empowered the plutocratic elite; and his use of military force, indefinite detention, and mass arrests against dissenters during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1791. In 2007, history writer William Hogeland criticized Chernow's biography of Hamilton on similar grounds in the Boston Review. In 2018, Historians on Hamilton: How a Blockbuster Musical Is Restaging America's Past was published. Fifteen historians of early America authored essays on ways the musical both engages with and sometimes misinterprets history.

When he was one-year old, his family moved to the Long Island suburb Hicksville, in the town of Oyster Bay, where he and his younger sister, Judy, were raised in a section of Levitt homes. Joel's father, Howard Joel , a classical pianist and businessman, was born in Nuremberg, Germany, to a Jewish family, the son of merchant and manufacturer Karl Amson Joel. Howard was educated in Switzerland. His father had created a highly successful mail order textile business, Joel Macht Fabrik. To escape the Nazi regime, Howard's family emigrated to Switzerland. His father sold his business at a fraction of its value to emigrate. The family reached the United States via Cuba, because immigration quotas for German Jews prevented direct immigration at the time. In the United States, Howard became an engineer but always loved music. Joel's mother, Rosalind , was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to Jewish parents, Philip and Rebecca Nyman, who emigrated from England. Joel's parents met in the late-1930s at City College of New York at a Gilbert and Sullivan performance. He has said that neither of his parents had talked much about World War II, which were such dark years; it was not until later that he learned more about his father's family. After Rosalind and Howard Joel divorced in 1957, Howard returned to Europe, as he had never liked the United States, considering the people uneducated and materialistic. He settled in Vienna, Austria and later remarried. Joel has a half-brother, Alexander Joel, born to his father in Europe, who became a classical conductor there. Alexander Joel was the chief musical director of the Staatstheater Braunschweig from 2001 to 2014. Joel reluctantly began piano lessons at age four at his mother's insistence. His teachers included the noted American pianist Morton Estrin and musician Timothy Ford. Joel says that he is a better organist than pianist. As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so he could defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, winning 22 bouts, but abandoned the sport shortly after his nose was broken in his 24th boxing match. Although Joel's parents were Jewish, he was not raised in that religion. He attended a Roman Catholic church with friends. At age 11, he was baptised in a Church of Christ in Hicksville. He now identifies as an atheist. Joel attended Hicksville High School until 1967, but did not graduate with his class. He was playing at a piano bar to help support himself, his mother and sister, and missed a crucial English exam after playing a late-night gig at a piano bar the evening before. Although Joel was a comparatively strong student, at the end of his senior year he did not have enough credits to graduate. Rather than attend summer school to earn his diploma, Joel decided to begin a career in music: \"I told them, 'To hell with it. If I'm not going to Columbia University, I'm going to Columbia Records, and you don't need a high school diploma over there'.\" In 1992, he submitted essays to the school board in lieu of the missed exam. They were accepted, and he was awarded his diploma at Hicksville High's annual graduation ceremony 25 years after leaving.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Conner later sold the ground to John and Sarah Berry, who donated  of their land to Madison County on the condition that the county seat be moved from Pendleton to Anderson. John Berry laid out the first plat of Anderson on November 7, 1827. In 1828 the seat of justice was moved from Pendleton to Anderson. The city is named for Chief William \"Adam\" Anderson, whose mother was a Delaware Indian and whose father was of Swedish descent. Chief Anderson's name in Lenape was Kikthawenund meaning \"creaking boughs\". The Delaware village was known as Anderson's Town, though the Moravian Missionaries called it \"The Heathen Town Four Miles Away.\" Anderson was also known as Andersonton before being formally organized as Anderson. Introduction of internal improvements by the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act caused a growth in the population in 1837. In December, 1838, Anderson was incorporated as a town with 350 inhabitants. The Central Canal, a branch of the Wabash and Erie Canal, was planned to come through Anderson. Work continued on the canal during 1838 and the beginning of 1839, but work on the canal was soon suspended by the state following the Panic of 1837. The town again became a sleepy village until 1849 when it was incorporated a second time as a town. Many new commercial ventures located around the Courthouse Square. This incorporation was short-lived and Anderson once again went back to village status in 1852. However, with the completion of the Indianapolis Bellefontaine Railroad, as well as their station in 1852, Anderson burst to life. The third incorporation of Anderson as a town occurred on June 9, 1853. The population continued to increase. On August 28, 1865, with a population of nearly 1,300 people, Anderson was incorporated as a city. Between 1853 and the late 19th century, twenty industries of various sizes located there. On March 31, 1887, natural gas was discovered in Anderson. As the Indiana Gas Boom began, this discovery led new businesses that could use natural gas, such as glass-making, to move to the city. Anderson grew to such proportions that a Cincinnati newspaper editor labeled the city \"The Pittsburgh on White River.\" Other appellations were \"Queen City of the Gas Belt\" and \"Puncture Proof City.\" In 1897 the Interurban Railroad was born in Anderson. Charles Henry, a large stock holder, coined the term \"Interurban\" in 1893. It continued to operate until 1941. The year 1912 spelled disaster for Anderson: the natural gas ran out, due to the residents squandering their resources.  The city left its gas powered lights on day and night, and there are stories of a pocket of natural gas being lit in the river and burning for a prolonged period for the spectacle of it. The result of the loss of natural gas was that several factories moved out. The whole city slowed down. The Commercial Club was the forerunner of the present chamber of commerce. This club persuaded the Remy brothers to stay in Anderson and others to locate there. For decades, Delco Remy and Guide Lamp , which during World War II built the M3 submachine gun and the FP-45 Liberator pistol for the allies, were the top two employers in the city. From 1913 through the 1950s, the Ward-Stilson Company was one of the country's largest producers of uniforms, regalia, furniture and props for the Freemasons, the Odd Fellows and dozens of other U.S. fraternal organizations. The Church of God of Anderson located its world headquarters in Anderson in 1905. Anderson Bible School was opened in 1917, and this was separated from Gospel Trumpet in 1925. At the same time, it became known as Anderson Bible School and Seminary. In 1925, the name was changed to Anderson College and then to Anderson University in 1988. Over the years, 17 different types of automobiles were manufactured in Anderson with the Lambert family among the city's leaders in its development and Buckeye Gasoline Buggy the Lambert product. Many other inventions were perfected in Anderson including: the gas regulator , the stamp vending machine , clothes presser , \"Irish Mail\" handcars , flower car for funeral homes ), Sisson choke , and the vulcanizing process to retread tires . Anderson hosted a National Basketball Association franchise for the 1949\u201350 season, being one of the smaller cities to have had a major league franchise in a Big Four American sport. The Anderson Packers were a founding member of the NBA , but folded after one season. Like most other industrial cities in Indiana and the Rust Belt as a whole, Anderson suffered tremendously from deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, nearly 22,000 people were employed by General Motors in the 1970s; by 2006 this number had declined to fewer than 2,600. Anderson has since struggled with higher rates of poverty and unemployment.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Sister Aloysius, the strict conservative principal of the church's parish school, becomes concerned when she sees a boy pull away from him in the courtyard. Her sisters are told to be alert to suspicious activity in the school. Sister James, a young and naive teacher, receives a request for Donald Miller, an altar boy and the school's only African-American student, to see Flynn in the rectory. When he returns to class he's upset and she smells alcohol on his breath. Later, she sees Flynn placing an undershirt in Donald's locker. Reporting her suspicions to Aloysius, she says such suspicions disquiet her faith. Aloysius tells her that when you address wrongdoing, you take a step away from God, but in His service. Aloysius and James invite Flynn into the office supposedly to discuss the school's Christmas pageant. During their discussion, the women express drastically different perspectives on how the church should function with regard to the working class: Flynn believes they should relate to their parishioners more actively through shared interests and community activities, while Aloysius believes that the boundaries set by the clergy as distinct and different facilitating the relationship with the parishioners. Sister James is more with Flynn, to adapt to the changing times, to connect better with the kids. Eventually, Aloysius brings up Donald Miller, noting that he is the only Black child in the school, at risk of being singled out. She states that even Flynn gave him special treatment, like the private meeting they had last week. He becomes defensive over her insinuations and eventually reveals he called Donald to the rectory because he had been caught drinking Sacramental wine. Flynn had been keeping it quiet to protect Donald, but now that Aloysius has forced it out, he must be removed as an altar boy. James is greatly relieved to hear the explanation. Flynn's next homily is on the evils of gossip. Unconvinced, Aloysius meets with Donald's mother regarding her suspicions. When describing the potential abusive relationship between Donald and Flynn, she is shocked by Mrs. Miller's seeming ambivalence. Finally, the mother tearfully admits that Donald is gay, and fears his physically abusive homophobic father would kill him if he knew. She describes her difficult position: unable to protect her son from his father's violence, Flynn is the only male figure who has shown Donald any kindness. His position at the school shields him from bullies, and leaving the school now could compromise the better socioeconomic future the school can give Donald. She begs Aloysius to solve the situation by removing Flynn over Donald, but she is unsure of what she can do, given Flynn's entrenched position within the patriarchal senior clergy. Knowing she has spoken with Donald's mother, Father Flynn threatens to remove Aloysius from her position if she does not back down. She informs him she contacted a nun from his last parish, discovering a history of past infringements. He demands to know what proof she has, and she admits that all she has is her certainty. Flynn accuses her of insubordination and acting outside her duties. She threatens she will do whatever it takes to force him out, even if it means being thrown out of the church herself. Declaring his innocence, Flynn pleads, asking if she herself has never committed a mortal sin. Aloysius rejects his claims of innocence, threatening blackmail if he does not resign immediately. Acknowledging his downfall would be inevitable should he ignore her threats, he maintains he did nothing wrong, and her own certainty of wrongdoing is fallible. She demands Flynn request a transfer, which he does, delivering a final homily before departing. Some time later, Aloysius tells James that Flynn has since been appointed to a more prestigious position at a larger church. She reveals that she lied about contacting a nun at Flynn's former parish, reasoning that if it were false, the ruse would not have worked. To her, his resignation is proof of his guilt. James, still believing in Flynn's innocence, is shocked by her lie, but Aloysius restates that, \"In the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God,\" but adds that doing so comes with a price. She then breaks down, tearfully exclaiming, \"I have doubts...I have such doubts!\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Vilified as a homewrecker, she attracts the unyielding ire of Jack's furious ex-wife, Carolyn , who is revealed to also be pregnant . Emilia thinks that this is purely out of spite.

Other leaders, such as Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero of Spain, and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, openly criticized the president. Later in Bush's presidency, tensions arose between him and Vladimir Putin, which led to a cooling of their relationship. In 2006, most respondents in 18 of 21 countries surveyed around the world were found to hold an unfavorable opinion of Bush. Respondents indicated that they judged his administration as negative for world security. In 2007, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that during the Bush presidency, attitudes towards the United States, and towards Americans, became less favorable around the world. The Pew Research Center's 2007 Global Attitudes poll found that in only nine countries of 47 did most respondents express \"a lot of confidence\" or \"some confidence\" in Bush: Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Israel, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda.

Hardy's interest in the Napoleonic Wars continued throughout his life. While writing The Return of the Native, in 1878, Hardy visited the Reading Room of the British Museum and read contemporary accounts of the Napoleonic Wars. He noted his findings in what became known as \u2018The Trumpet-Major Notebook\u2019 . Hardy also met with Chelsea pensioners who had experienced the war first-hand. The Trumpet-Major, published in 1880 was born of that research. Evelyn Evans, daughter of the man who produced Hardy's plays, mentions that, shortly after the publication of The Dynasts, and while the first theatrical production of The Trumpet-Major was in rehearsal, in 1908, Hardy talked with veterans of Waterloo still alive and living in the neighbourhood. Unlike most Hardy novels, in which the essence of the story is fictional \u2013 though often with reference to contemporary matters \u2013 the real events of 1804-5 when Dorset was preparing for the palpable threat of French invasion near Weymouth permeate The Trumpet Major, a danger that only receded with victory at Trafalgar. Hardy was born in 1840, some 35 years after this period, and it's not hard to imagine him sitting, as a child, listening to first-hand accounts of life in Dorset during that time and the way in which it dominated local people's lives. The sense of these real recollections is woven into The Trumpet-Major \u2013 from Anne Garland and the old sailor watching out for the Victory in the English Channel, to the pervasive fear of press-gangs and imminent invasion, to the news freshly brought of the Battle of Trafalgar and death of Nelson, told with both intimacy and a sense of its historical momentousness. The love story at the centre of the novel plays like a complex dance, with the two brothers, John and Bob Loveday and the villainous Festus Derriman all trying to gain the hand of Anne Garland. The sense of impending peril, with the ultimate fate of the young men unknown, in a time of war, serves to make the lightness and comedy that runs through The Trumpet-Major bittersweet, but the novel is all the deeper and richer for that sense of a tragic epilogue.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Conner later sold the ground to John and Sarah Berry, who donated  of their land to Madison County on the condition that the county seat be moved from Pendleton to Anderson. John Berry laid out the first plat of Anderson on November 7, 1827. In 1828 the seat of justice was moved from Pendleton to Anderson. The city is named for Chief William \"Adam\" Anderson, whose mother was a Delaware Indian and whose father was of Swedish descent. Chief Anderson's name in Lenape was Kikthawenund meaning \"creaking boughs\". The Delaware village was known as Anderson's Town, though the Moravian Missionaries called it \"The Heathen Town Four Miles Away.\" Anderson was also known as Andersonton before being formally organized as Anderson. Introduction of internal improvements by the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act caused a growth in the population in 1837. In December, 1838, Anderson was incorporated as a town with 350 inhabitants. The Central Canal, a branch of the Wabash and Erie Canal, was planned to come through Anderson. Work continued on the canal during 1838 and the beginning of 1839, but work on the canal was soon suspended by the state following the Panic of 1837. The town again became a sleepy village until 1849 when it was incorporated a second time as a town. Many new commercial ventures located around the Courthouse Square. This incorporation was short-lived and Anderson once again went back to village status in 1852. However, with the completion of the Indianapolis Bellefontaine Railroad, as well as their station in 1852, Anderson burst to life. The third incorporation of Anderson as a town occurred on June 9, 1853. The population continued to increase. On August 28, 1865, with a population of nearly 1,300 people, Anderson was incorporated as a city. Between 1853 and the late 19th century, twenty industries of various sizes located there. On March 31, 1887, natural gas was discovered in Anderson. As the Indiana Gas Boom began, this discovery led new businesses that could use natural gas, such as glass-making, to move to the city. Anderson grew to such proportions that a Cincinnati newspaper editor labeled the city \"The Pittsburgh on White River.\" Other appellations were \"Queen City of the Gas Belt\" and \"Puncture Proof City.\" In 1897 the Interurban Railroad was born in Anderson. Charles Henry, a large stock holder, coined the term \"Interurban\" in 1893. It continued to operate until 1941. The year 1912 spelled disaster for Anderson: the natural gas ran out, due to the residents squandering their resources.  The city left its gas powered lights on day and night, and there are stories of a pocket of natural gas being lit in the river and burning for a prolonged period for the spectacle of it. The result of the loss of natural gas was that several factories moved out. The whole city slowed down. The Commercial Club was the forerunner of the present chamber of commerce. This club persuaded the Remy brothers to stay in Anderson and others to locate there. For decades, Delco Remy and Guide Lamp , which during World War II built the M3 submachine gun and the FP-45 Liberator pistol for the allies, were the top two employers in the city. From 1913 through the 1950s, the Ward-Stilson Company was one of the country's largest producers of uniforms, regalia, furniture and props for the Freemasons, the Odd Fellows and dozens of other U.S. fraternal organizations. The Church of God of Anderson located its world headquarters in Anderson in 1905. Anderson Bible School was opened in 1917, and this was separated from Gospel Trumpet in 1925. At the same time, it became known as Anderson Bible School and Seminary. In 1925, the name was changed to Anderson College and then to Anderson University in 1988. Over the years, 17 different types of automobiles were manufactured in Anderson with the Lambert family among the city's leaders in its development and Buckeye Gasoline Buggy the Lambert product. Many other inventions were perfected in Anderson including: the gas regulator , the stamp vending machine , clothes presser , \"Irish Mail\" handcars , flower car for funeral homes ), Sisson choke , and the vulcanizing process to retread tires . Anderson hosted a National Basketball Association franchise for the 1949\u201350 season, being one of the smaller cities to have had a major league franchise in a Big Four American sport. The Anderson Packers were a founding member of the NBA , but folded after one season. Like most other industrial cities in Indiana and the Rust Belt as a whole, Anderson suffered tremendously from deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, nearly 22,000 people were employed by General Motors in the 1970s; by 2006 this number had declined to fewer than 2,600.

Millar was a Scots spelling of the surname Miller, and the author pronounced his name Miller rather than Millar.

Back in Canada as a young adult, he returned to Kitchener, where he studied, and subsequently graduated from the University of Western Ontario with an Honors degree in History and English. He found work as a high school teacher. Some years later, he attended the University of Michigan and received a PhD in 1952.

The family moved from Kitchener to Santa Barbara in 1946. Millar began his career writing stories for pulp magazines and used his real name for his first four novels. Of these he completed the last, The Dark Tunnel, in 1944. After serving at sea as a naval communications officer from 1944 to 1946, Millar returned to Michigan, where he obtained his Ph.D. degree in literature. For his doctorate, Millar studied under poet W.H. Auden, who held mystery or detective fiction could rise to the level of literature and encouraged Millar's interest in the genre.

He was portrayed by Ukrainian-Canadian actor Hryhoriy Hladiy in the Ukrainian film Neskorenyi . Postage stamps and coins have been minted in his honour of the 100th anniversary of his birth.  Posthumously, he was awarded the UPA's highest decorations: the Gold Cross of Combat Merit First Class and the Cross of Merit in gold. In June 2017, the Kyiv City Council renamed the city's General Vatutin Avenue into Roman Shukhevych Avenue. On 5 March 2021, the Ternopil City Council named the largest stadium in the city of Ternopil after Roman Shukhevych as the Roman Shukhevych Ternopil city stadium. On 16 March 2021, the Lviv Oblast Council  approved the renaming of their largest stadium after Roman Shukhevych. Hero of Ukraine Award Roman Shukhevych was posthumously conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine by President Viktor Yushchenko on 12 October 2007. On 12 February 2009, an administrative Donetsk region court ruled the Presidential decree awarding the title to be legal after a lawyer had claimed that his rights as a citizen were violated because Shukhevych was never a citizen of Ukraine. President Viktor Yanukovych stated on 5 March 2010 he would make a decision to repeal the decrees to honor the title as Heroes of Ukraine to Shukhevych and fellow nationalist Stepan Bandera before the next Victory Day . Although the Hero of Ukraine decrees do not stipulate the possibility that a decree on awarding this title can be annulled, on 21 April 2010, Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals declared unlawful former Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko's decree of 12 October 2007 to award the Hero of Ukraine title to Roman Shukhevych. The court ruled that the former President had had no right to confer this title to Shukhevych, because Shukhevych had died in 1950 and therefore he had not lived on the territory of independent Ukraine . Consequently, Shukhevych was not a Ukrainian citizen, and this title could not be awarded to him. On 12 August 2010 the High Administrative Court of Ukraine dismissed suits to declare four decrees by President Viktor Yanukovych on awarding the Hero of Ukraine title to Soviet soldiers illegal and cancel them.

He is taken to a huge warehouse on the West Side of Manhattan, where he views what seem to be movie sets, with people acting on them.  It seems this is a project to learn whether it is feasible to send people back into the past by what amounts to self-hypnosis\u2014whether, by convincing oneself that one is in the past, not the present, one can make it so. As it turns out, Simon has a good reason to want to go back to the past\u2014his girlfriend, Kate, has a mystery linked to New York City in 1882. She has a letter dated from that year, mailed to an Andrew Carmody . The letter seems innocuous enough\u2014a request for a meeting to discuss marble\u2014but there is a note which, though half burned, seems to say that the sending of the letter led to \"the destruction by fire of the entire World\", followed by a missing word.  Carmody, the writer of the note, mentioned his blame for that incident.  He then killed himself. Si agrees to participate in the project, and requests permission to go back to New York City in 1882 in order to watch the letter being mailed .  The elderly Dr. E.E. Danziger, head of the project, agrees, and expresses his regret that he can't go with Si, because he would love to see his parents' first meeting, which also occurred in New York City in 1882. The project rents an apartment at the famous Dakota apartment building, which did not actually exist in 1882. Si uses the apartment as both a staging area and a means to help him with self-hypnosis, since the building's style is so much of the period in which it was built and faces a section of Central Park which, when viewed from the apartment's window, is unchanged from 1882. Si is successful in going back to 1882, at first very briefly, and then a second time he is able to take Kate with him. They travel by horse-drawn bus down to the old post office, and watch the letter being mailed by a man. They follow him, and learn that he lives at 19 Gramercy Park. Then they return to their base at the Dakota apartments and return to the present. Si is debriefed and carefully examined after each trip to the past, and as far as the project organizers can tell, his activities in the past are making no difference to the present.  He is encouraged to go back again.  He presents himself at 19 Gramercy Park as a potential boarder.  He is accepted, begins living there and learns that the man who mailed the letter is named Jake Pickering. He explores the Manhattan of the past for several days, sketching all the while\u2014he is an illustrator, and Finney inserts illustrations from the period into the book as Si's own. He goes on to learn that Pickering is blackmailing Carmody.  Si finds himself falling for the landlady's niece, Julia Charbonneau.  But he has a rival\u2014Pickering.  Eventually, Pickering makes a scene, having tattooed the name \"JULIA\" on himself, and Si soon leaves, to return to the present. Things aren't going as well in the present. One of the other participants in the project, having gone back to Denver some seventy years in the past, has made some unknown change in the past and thus a friend, whom he remembers, was never born. Danziger insists that the project be stopped.  When he is overruled, he resigns.  After Prien talks to him, Si sees no alternative other than to return to the past again, though he is troubled by Danziger's resignation. He is accepted back at Gramercy Park cheerfully, with even the dour Pickering happy.  It seems Pickering and Julia are now engaged. Si tells Julia that Pickering is a blackmailer. They go to Pickering's office and conceal themselves to watch the blackmail money being turned over by Carmody. Carmody brings only $10,000, rather than the demanded million dollars for the incriminating files. After knocking him out, Carmody ties up Pickering and sets out to look for the papers.  He realizes they are concealed amid many other files.  He patiently thumbs through the files, while Si and Julia agonize as the hours pass.  Finally, Carmody decides on a scheme\u2014burn the files.  He does so.  Pickering tries to save the files, but burns himself badly in the process.  To the pair's astonishment, Si and Julia burst forth, urging them to flee, and flee themselves. It is a huge fire, and Si and Julia find themselves trapped. They barely escape. Si learns that the building used to house the newspaper the New York World and one piece of the puzzle fits in\u2014the missing word in Carmody's note was \"Building\". After watching the efforts to fight the fire, in which many die, the shaken couple returns to Gramercy Park.  There is no sign of Pickering. [The burning of the New York World building is a factual historical event]. Two days later, the two are picked up by Police Inspector Thomas Byrnes, and then taken to Carmody's house. Terribly burned and bandaged, Carmody accuses them of murdering Pickering and starting the fire.  After they leave, Byrnes expresses indecision and lets them walk away\u2014only to yell \"The prisoners are escaping\" to the sergeant who accompanies him.  It is a set-up, the two are to prove their guilt by \"attempting to escape\".  As it turns out, police all over the island have already been provided with their description and photographs.  They are able to flee, but have no money and nowhere to go. They shelter in the as-yet-unassembled Statue of Liberty's arm, then standing in Madison Square. .  Si tells Julia the whole story, but she takes it as entertaining fantasy.  She is soon convinced otherwise, as Si brings them both into the present, and she observes the dawn from high inside the long-assembled statue, seeing a totally strange New York. They spend a day in the present, with a shocked Julia observing the things that have changed in ninety years, from clothing to television.  At last, they settle into Si's apartment.  He is ashamed to tell her the history of what has happened in the past ninety years, the horrible wars and the fact that there are areas of the city where no law-abiding citizen can safely go.  Julia must return home.  The two realize that the man whom they met at Carmody's house was in fact Pickering, who they could not identify because of the burns and bandages\u2014Carmody had actually died in the fire.  Armed with this knowledge, Julia can keep Pickering from having her arrested, lest he be exposed.  As 1882 is far more real to her than 1970, she returns to the past without needing any help from Si. Si goes to report in, and tells most of the story, concealing Julia's visit to 1970. They then give him an assignment\u2014to intentionally alter the past. Research has confirmed that Carmody was an acquaintance of Grover Cleveland's--and talked Cleveland out of buying Cuba from Spain. The military men now in effective control of the project conclude that if Pickering is exposed, he might never have influence with Cleveland, and the U.S. might never have to worry about Fidel Castro.  But after talking with Danziger, Si worries about the other effects the change might have, and Danziger makes him promise not to carry out the scheme.  Si returns to 1882.  Having learned from Danziger how his parents met by chance, Si interjects himself and prevents their meeting. Because the parents never meet, Danziger will never be born, and the project will never happen. Si walks away towards Gramercy Park and Julia, and away from 1970.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "218_365", "question": "In what city was John Keating born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_38609", "text": "\"When I Have Fears\" primarily explores death, the fear of it, and what it prevents Keats from doing. Using the phrase \"cease to be\" shows an emphasis on the life Keats will miss out on rather than simply death itself. The repetition of \"before\" represents the anxieties Keats has about what he cannot achieve before death. He fears he will no longer be able to write, witness the beauty of the world, or experience love or fame once he dies. While the poem ends with a slight resolution, with \"Love and Fame\" no longer mattering to Keats, it is a resolution found in isolation and excessive thought. The two do not matter to Keats because death is inevitable and will prevent him from making those achievements, so they sink away from Keats. References to nature also appear throughout the poem, including harvesting grain, the night sky, clouds, and the shore. Nature is a common theme in Romantic poetry, but in Keats' poem it demonstrates how essential and natural writing is to his being. The shore and water that love and fame sink within represent an expanse of fears that sit before Keats, giving the natural world a darker theme in those lines. The theme of creating coincides with references to nature and beauty. The first quatrain equates writing to harvesting grain. Thoughts are tangible items to be grown into \"high-piled books,\" as Keats feels he can allow his ideas to flourish if he only had a long enough life. The second quatrain contains more abstract concepts. Stars, cloudy symbols, shadows, reflect the intangible beauty of the world which Keats can also not attempt to understand because of a life cut short. The couplet shows abstract concepts of Love and Fame becoming tangible, though they sink to nothingness as Keats realizes he has no time to achieve them.", "hasanswer": false}]}

What follows is a series of questions and answers, typical of Plato's earlier dialogues, featuring Socrates' famous method of dialectics. First, he asks Agathon whether it is reasonable for someone to desire what they already have, like for example someone who is in perfect health to wish he were healthy . Agathon agrees with Socrates that this would be irrational, but is quickly reminded of his own definition of Love's true desires: youth and beauty. Putting the two together then, for Love to desire youth he must not have it himself, thus making him old, and for him to desire beauty, he himself must be ugly. Agathon has no choice but to agree. After this exchange, Socrates switches to storytelling, a departure from the earlier dialogues where he is mostly heard refuting his opponent's arguments through rational debating. Socrates tells of a conversation he had with a woman from Mantinea, called Diotima, who plays the same inquiring/instructing role that Socrates played with Agathon. Diotima first explains that Love is neither a god, as was previously claimed by the other guests, nor a mortal but a daemon, a spirit halfway between god and man, who was born during a banquet thrown by the gods to celebrate the birth of Aphrodite. One of the guests was Porus , the god of resource or plenty, who was passed out from drinking too much nectar, and it so happened that another deity arrived, Poverty, who came to the banquet to beg, and upon seeing Plutus lying unconscious took the chance to sleep with him, conceiving a child in the process: Love. Having been born at Aphrodite's birthday party, he became her follower and servant, but through his real origins Love acquired a kind of double nature. From his mother, Love became poor, ugly, and with no place to sleep , while from his father he inherited the knowledge of beauty, as well as the cunningness to pursue it. Being of an intermediary nature, Love is also halfway between wisdom and ignorance, knowing just enough to understand his ignorance and try to overcome it. Beauty then is the perennial philosopher, the \"lover of wisdom\" . After describing Love's origins, that provide clues to its nature, Diotima asks Socrates why is it, as he had previously agreed, that love is always that \"of beautiful things\" . For if love affects everyone indiscriminately, then why is it that only some appear to pursue beauty throughout their lives? Socrates does not have the answer and so Diotima reveals it: Beauty is not the end but the means to something greater, the achievement of a certain reproduction and birth , the only claim that mortals can have on immortality. This is true for men as well as animals that seek an appropriate place to give birth, preferring to roam in pain until they find it. Some men are pregnant in body alone and, just like animals, enjoy the company of women with whom they can have children that will pass on their existence. Others are pregnant in both body and mind, and instead of children they carry wisdom, virtue, and above all, the art of civic order . Beauty is also their guide, but it will be towards the knowledge needed to accomplish their spiritual births. In conclusion, Diotima gives Socrates a guide on how a man of this class should be brought up from a young age. First, he should start by loving a particular body he finds beautiful, but as time goes by, he will relax his passion and pass to the love of all bodies. From this point, he will pass to the love of beautiful minds, and then to that of knowledge. Finally, he will reach the ultimate goal, which is to witness beauty in itself, rather than representations , the true Form of Beauty in Platonic terms. This speech, in the interpretation of Marsilio Ficino in De Amore , is the origin of the concept of Platonic love.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A total of 3.4% of the non-Hispanic population identified with more than one race. Throughout its history, New York has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States. More than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924. The term \"melting pot\" was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians. In 1940, Whites represented 92% of the city's population. Approximately 37% of the city's population is foreign born, and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants as of 2013. In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates. The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city  were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago, while the Bangladeshi-born immigrant population has become one of the fastest growing in the city, counting over 74,000 by 2011. Asian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles. New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper. The New York City borough of Queens is home to the state's largest Asian American population and the largest Andean populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. The Chinese population constitutes the fastest-growing nationality in New York State; multiple satellites of the original Manhattan Chinatown, in Brooklyn, and around Flushing, Queens, are thriving as traditionally urban enclaves\u2014while also expanding rapidly eastward into suburban Nassau County on Long Island, as the New York metropolitan region and New York State have become the top destinations for new Chinese immigrants, respectively, and large-scale Chinese immigration continues into New York City and surrounding areas, with the largest metropolitan Chinese diaspora outside Asia, including an estimated 812,410 individuals in 2015. In 2012, 6.3% of New York City was of Chinese ethnicity, with nearly three-fourths living in either Queens or Brooklyn, geographically on Long Island. A community numbering 20,000 Korean-Chinese is centered in Flushing, Queens, while New York City is also home to the largest Tibetan population outside China, India, and Nepal, also centered in Queens. Koreans made up 1.2% of the city's population, and Japanese 0.3%.

Indians are the largest South Asian group, comprising 2.4% of the city's population, with Bangladeshis and Pakistanis at 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. Queens is the preferred borough of settlement for Asian Indians, Koreans, Filipinos and Malaysians, and other Southeast Asians; while Brooklyn is receiving large numbers of both West Indian and Asian Indian immigrants. New York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic White population of any American city. At 2.7\u00a0million in 2012, New York's non-Hispanic White population is larger than the non-Hispanic White populations of Los Angeles , Chicago , and Houston combined. The non-Hispanic White population was 6.6\u00a0million in 1940. The non-Hispanic White population has begun to increase since 2010. The European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse. According to 2012 census estimates, there were roughly 560,000 Italian Americans, 385,000 Irish Americans, 253,000 German Americans, 223,000 Russian Americans, 201,000 Polish Americans, and 137,000 English Americans. Additionally, Greek and French Americans numbered 65,000 each, with those of Hungarian descent estimated at 60,000 people. Ukrainian and Scottish Americans numbered 55,000 and 35,000, respectively.

Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City, with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic White population, enumerating over 30,000, and including more than half of all Central Asian immigrants to the United States, most settling in Queens or Brooklyn. Albanian Americans are most highly concentrated in the Bronx. The wider New York City metropolitan statistical area, with more than twenty million people, about fifty percent more than second-place Los Angeles, is also ethnically diverse, with the largest foreign-born population of any metropolitan region in the world. The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States, substantially exceeding the combined totals of Los Angeles and Miami. It is home to the largest Jewish and Israeli communities outside Israel, with the Jewish population in the region numbering over 1.5 million in 2012 and including many diverse Jewish sects, predominantly from around the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and including a rapidly growing Orthodox Jewish population, the largest outside Israel. The metropolitan area is also home to 20% of the nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, and 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns; the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American, Italian American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican American, Puerto Rican American, and South American and second-largest overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 4.8\u00a0million; and includes multiple established Chinatowns within New York City alone. Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Brazil were the top source countries from South America for legal immigrants to the New York City region in 2013; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean; Egypt, Ghana, and Nigeria from Africa; and El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America. Amidst a resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population had increased to approximately 1.3\u00a0million in the metropolitan area . Since 2010, Little Australia has emerged and is growing rapidly, representing the Australasian presence in Nolita, Manhattan. In 2011, there were an estimated 20,000 Australian residents of New York City, nearly quadruple the 5,537 in 2005. Qantas Airways of Australia and Air New Zealand have been exploring the possibilities of long-haul flights from New York to Sydney and Auckland, respectively, which would both rank among the longest non-stop flights in the world.

{"id": "218_390", "question": "In what city was Yugo Yoshida born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "526_47446", "text": "The two time periods are filmed in different styles. The 1920s scenes are slow, talky, with elements of kabuki theatre. They are accompanied by dramatic orchestral music, while Yoshida uses architectural elements to portray alienation and distant relations between the characters by filming their faces and bodies separated by windows, doors, and so on. On the other hand, the 1960s scenes are more avant-garde in terms of free-form visual approach and their psychedelic rock soundtrack. The film, however, does not use flashbacks, and instead deliberately complicates the distinction between past and present, allowing characters to cross these boundaries. He stated in an interview: \"I adopted a style that brings Osugi back into the contemporary period. Therefore, when Noe It\u014d at age 18 comes to Tokyo for the second time having been called by [the feminist activist] Raicho Hitatsuka, she arrives at the contemporary Shinbashi Station with the shinkansen in the background and takes a rickshaw through today's Ginza. Ultimately, the frames of past and present completely disappear, in this way, there is the sense that contemporary young women and Noe It\u014d are able to converse. Therefore, this is one way in which I challenge history.\" It is not just the framing of the film that brings historical characters into the present: the characters themselves reject the distinction at the opening of the film, when Eiko and Mako pun on the shared ko ending of their names, naming each other as alter-egos, and Mako refuses to take part in the interview as It\u014d's daughter. Instead, actress Mariko Okada takes on the role of Noe It\u014d herself. In this way, the film depicts It\u014d as \"derived from the contemporary Eiko's imagination\". To accentuate the notion of history being perceived falsely, the transitions between the two periods often feature characters seen from mirrors and reflected surfaces. For example, in the scene where It\u014d gets introduced to the staff journalist Hiraga Haruko, Yoshida frames their inverted reflections in a pond as they're conversing. This is part of a general aim among Yoshida and his avant-garde contemporaries to subvert viewer expectations by destabilizing simple, linear narratives, forcing the realization that what the spectator sees is a series of fabrications that can only be given meaning by the interpretation of the spectator themselves. This \"denial of the self\" is related to the \"death of the author\" concept. Mathieu Capel writes: \"does the past exist beyond the words that state and organize it? Is what we call \"world\" anything but a tracery of \"world views\"? Then, how unlikely would it be for It\u014d Noe and Eiko to meet in a contemporary setting? In a probably conscious way, Yoshida grasps the same questions as contemporary structuralist thinkers do, mostly their obsession of the \"text\", with logos as the leading organization principle.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159 was Chairman, Anton\u00edn \u0160vehla Vice-Chairman, Franti\u0161ek Soukup Managing Director and Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn Member of the Board. In the night from 27th to 28th, Vlastimil Tusar called Ra\u0161\u00edn from Vienna and said that Czech politics needs to go to the front and support fighters in endurance and not leaving. He knew that this is a sign of surrender. Ra\u0161\u00edn said: \u201cI was convinced that it will burst tomorrow.\u201d  In the morning, Ra\u0161\u00edn met \u0160vehla and others from the National Assembly. After they received Andr\u00e1ssyho n\u00f3ta , they decided to take the power before surrender. Today, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn is remembered as one of the Men of the 28th October , who together declared an independent Czechoslovakian state. Ra\u0161\u00edn was the first one who publicly announced the state in the place of National Assembly, he also was the author of the first law which established an independent state. In November 1918, the Revolutionary National Assembly was formed. On the first meeting, the members elected Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk as the President of the Republic and appointed Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159 Prime Minister. Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn was firstly supposed to be the Interior Minister but for his knowledge in economics, he was needed to take the Ministry of Finance because state finances were devastated by inflation. Journalist Ferdinand Peroutka pointed out that Ra\u0161\u00edn was not a pure economist but he has more political experience than for example Ra\u0161\u00edn\u2019s opponent doctor Karel Engli\u0161. January 1919, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn wrote to Edvard Bene\u0161: \"The population thinks that freedom means not paying taxes, no one is doing anything from executions, so I don't know how economics could be managed further,\" but at the same time state is relied on as on the solver of all problems. As a Minister for Finance, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn had efforts to back his proposed currency by gold. For that, he announced nationwide voluntary collection, where 64 kilograms of pure gold was obtained. At the beginning of 1919, Ra\u0161\u00edn closed borders and the isolated whole country from 26 February to 9 March and started to stamp all money from which he withholds some part as a government loan. For that 2 weeks, he was given rule over police and army. The goal was to disconnect currencies, lower volume of money in circulation and subordinate emission policy to a newly created state bank. After the left won the elections in 1919, Vladim\u00edr Tusar was appointed Prime Minister and Ra\u0161\u00edn became only Member of the Parliament. The second Vladim\u00edr Tusar\u2019s government was established in 1920 after the Constitution of Czechoslovakia was approved. Ra\u0161\u00edn still got a mandate for Czechoslovakian National Democracy that was also part of the Committee of Five . In the same year, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn published his book My Finance Plan describing Czechoslovakian financial history from Austria-Hungary till present days. Two years later he followed up with publications Financial and Economic Policy until the End of 1921 , and Inflation and Deflation . He was appointed Ministry for Finance in the government of Anton\u00edn \u0160vehla and introduced many measures against social benefits. He also criticized monetary compensations for the legionaries. Amidst an economic crisis, Ra\u0161\u00edn stressed the politics of deflation and a strong currency. High unemployment caused great animosity towards him, especially from the left. A fierce anti-Ra\u0161\u00edn campaign developed.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "218_404", "question": "In what city was Tim Armstrong born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "257_40365", "text": "National Wrestling Alliance and World Championship Wrestling Brad Armstrong started out in the National Wrestling Alliance's Gulf Coast territory, Southeastern Championship Wrestling in July 1980 at the age of 18. He was a face, or good guy, due to his good looks and superb wrestling ability. He feuded with Jerry Stubbs and Tom Prichard during his stay there and won the NWA United States Junior Heavyweight Championship there. Armstrong moved to the NWA's Georgia territory, Georgia Championship Wrestling, in 1984, where he feuded with Tom McCartney, Ted DiBiase alongside his father Bob and then \"White Lightning\" Tim Horner, with whom he formed The Lightning Express. Armstrong's in ring ability allowed him to take great advantage of a mix of technical wrestling and explosive speed in his style. It was during this time that Armstrong was involved in an angle with Tommy Rich. Rich was in a feud with Ted DiBiase. They had a \"loser leaves wrestling\" match that Rich lost. So, Rich put on a mask & came back as Mr. R. DiBiase insisted that Mr R. was really Rich. Then, on a TV match for Dibiase's NWA National Title, Rich visited announcer Gordon Solie during the match. Dibiase unmasked Mr R. to find that it was actually Armstrong. In all of the confusion, Armstrong pinned Dibiase to become NWA National Champion for his first of two times holding that belt. Armstrong held the NWA National Tag Team Championship twice that year, once with his father, and once with Horner. All three returned to Southeastern Championship Wrestling in 1985, before eventually joining the NWA's Mid-Atlantic territory, Jim Crockett Promotions, in late 1986. Armstrong feuded with Jimmy Garvin, locked horns with the Four Horsemen, and teamed with both his father and Horner at various times. In 1986, Brad went on his first tour of Japan for All Japan Pro Wrestling, to take part in a tournament to determine the first World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Brad made it to finals, but lost the match and the title to Hiro Saito on July 31. Armstrong then moved to Cowboy Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling / Universal Wrestling Federation, in 1986 where he won The North American Heavyweight Championship from Ernie Ladd in 1986 and losing it to Ted DiBiase a month later. In early 1987, Brad reunited with Tim Horner forming a tag team known as \"The Lightning Express, winning the UWF Tag Team Championship from future superstars Sting and Rick Steiner. They then feuded with the \"Sheepherders,\" later known as The Bushwhackers, Butch Miller and Luke Williams, to whom they eventually lost their belts. The Lightning Express then went back to Jim Crockett Promotions after the UWF was bought out by Crockett, but were not pushed, and Horner left for the WWF in late 1988. Armstrong bounced between singles wrestling, temporary tag teams, and sorting out personal issues for much of the next few years. After teaming with a returning Tim Horner during the summer of 1990, Armstrong announced on the August 4, 1990 edition of WCW Saturday Night that he would be forming a new tandem with Doug Furnas, and that they planned on challenging for the United States Tag-Team Championship. However Furnas would leave the company shortly thereafter, leaving Armstrong to continue his Lightning Express partnership with Tim Horner and to also occasionally team with David Sierra and Brad Anderson. In September 1990 he was split off as a singles wrestler again and rebranded The Candyman. Dressed in red and white tights and handing out candy to fans on his way to the ring, Armstrong began to receive his first significant singles push in the new WCW. He went undefeated, pinning Dutch Mantell, Buddy Landell, and James Earl Wright over the next two weeks. At the 1990 Halloween Havoc, Armstrong faced JW Storm , who was a recent addition to WCW and was also on an undefeated streak. The Candyman pinned Storm in what Jim Ross stated was an upset. The run finally ended on November 15, when The Iron Sheik upset The Candyman on a house show in Kansas City, Kansas. On Clash of Champions XXIII on November 20, The Candyman was defeated by the debuting Big Cat after the referee stopped the match. By the beginning of 1991 Armstrong had dropped the Candyman gimmick and had reunited with Tim Horner. In January 1991 the Lightning Express faced The Fabulous Freebirds at a World Championship Wrestling TV taping, going to a double disqualification. They would also face Arn Anderson and Barry Windham and The Royal Family during this period. On February 24 at WrestleWar 91 Armstrong was defeated by Bobby Eaton. In April 1991, the Fabulous Freebirds began speaking of a third member named Fantasia, who debuted at SuperBrawl I on May 19 to help the Freebirds capture the vacant WCW United States Tag Team Titles from the Young Pistols. Armstrong, under a mask and covered in black feathers, would quickly have his name changed to Badstreet . The three Freebirds then won the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, while Hayes and Garvin held the WCW United States Tag Team Championship. Armstrong never revealed his Badstreet identity on television. As a result, he was able to interfere on behalf of both sides during the Freebirds' win over the Young Pistols for the vacant U.S. Tag Team Championship at SuperBrawl I, firstly as himself on behalf of the Pistols then later as Fantasia on behalf of the Freebirds, all within the space of the same title match. In September 1991, Armstrong began to tour Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling, where he would tour Japan with ten times between 1991 and 1996. Later that year, Armstrong was given another masked gimmick, Arachnaman, who bore such a strong resemblance to Spider-Man that Marvel Comics threatened legal action, causing WCW to quickly drop the character. On July 5, 1992, Armstrong won the WCW Light Heavyweight Championship , by defeating Scotty Flamingo. He soon injured his knee during a tour of Japan in a match against The Great Muta in Sapporo, and was stripped of the title at the Clash of the Champions XX two months later. He returned weeks later, and remained with the company until early 1995. Armstrong returned in early 1995 teaming with Tim Horner wrestling on WCW Saturday Night and Worldwide. Smoky Mountain Wrestling and United States Wrestling Association In June 1995, Armstrong joined Smoky Mountain Wrestling. By August, he'd split his time between SMW in Knoxville and United States Wrestling Association in Memphis. Armstrong won both The USWA Heavyweight Championship and the SMW Heavyweight Championship three times during his stay. After SMW folded in December 1995, Armstrong wrestled regularly for the USWA until February 1996 when he returned to WCW. In December 1995, he toured Europe for Otto Wanz's Catch Wrestling Association, losing a CWA World Middleweight Championship match to champion Fit Finlay in the tenth round. Return to WCW Armstrong eventually returned to WCW in February 1996. At Slamboree, Armstrong unsuccessfully challenged Dean Malenko for the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship, despite a highly technical match, before leaving in November 1996 to tour with New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Upon his return to WCW in the summer of 1997, Brad had developed a heel turn, changing his look, sporting short hair and a goatee, and had developed a bad attitude and mean streak. By the end of the year, he developed a string of losses, which he claimed was blamed by the \"Armstrong Curse\". He lost to Goldberg at SuperBrawl VIII during Goldberg's undefeated streak. In 1999, he was repackaged as \"B.A.\", a member of The No Limit Soldiers stable. After the group disbanded, he embarked on a feud against Berlyn, who attacked Armstrong's brother Scott and badmouthed the United States of America. The feud ran through Halloween Havoc, where Armstrong defeated Berlyn. After Halloween Havoc, Vince Russo forced Armstrong to find a gimmick. He was later given the gimmick of \"Buzzkill\", as a hippie with a Tie-dye shirt and a takeoff of his brother Brian's gimmick, Road Dogg. As \"Buzzkill,\" Armstrong used an entrance theme similar to the one used by the New Age Outlaws in the WWF. The gimmick was less successful due to fans feeling it an imitation of the Road Dogg persona, as well as a lack of awareness that the two were brothers. He injured his knee in March 2000 in an accident backstage at a WCW Saturday Night taping, where Armstrong got run over by Juventud Guerrera and Psicosis, severely injuring his knee. After going through knee surgery, his WCW contract expired as the company was bought by WWF in 2001, and he retired from wrestling. Independent Circuit After WCW was bought by WWE in 2001, and quietly retired. He came out of retirement in 2003 and return to wrestling. His first match back was teaming with Greg Brown losing to Sonny Siaki and Masked Superstar on May 18 of that year in Columbus, Georgia. Wrestled in the independent circuit only in the Southeast in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. Armstrong started teaming with his dad and his brother Scott winning a couple of tag titles. On February 19, 2005 he defeated George South for the EWA Heavyweight Title. In 2005 and 2006 the Armstrongs feuded with the Midnight Express. Between 2007 and 2010 he feuded with Midnight Express member Dennis Condrey. In 2010, he began teaming with Ricky Morton winning the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team titles defeating Chris Hamrick and Jeff Lewis. His last wrestling match was on February 12, 2011 where he lost to Kyle Matthews in Villa Rica, Georgia. World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE On September 12, 2006, Armstrong signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment and began wrestling at ECW brand house shows against Eric P\u00e9rez and acting as a trainer to the younger members of the roster. In December, around the time rumors of ECW color commentator Tazz leaving the company began to circulate, Armstrong began to make sporadic appearances as a \"guest commentator\" on the brand. The three-man booth, originally for a single match on the December 19 episode before expanding to a full show on January 9, did not last and Armstrong resumed his role as a producer. While working as a producer for WWE, Armstrong continued to wrestle for various independent promotions in the Southeast. At the same time, Armstrong worked at a health store in Marietta and volunteered at Shiloh Hills Christian School in Kennesaw, performing various functions including serving as field trip monitor and assisting with car duty on campus.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Avildsen had won an Academy Award for directing Rocky ; veteran comedy writer Larry Gelbart had developed the hit TV series M*A*S*H ; and John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd had been stars of TV's Saturday Night Live and the film The Blues Brothers . The film's female leads were played by Cathy Moriarty, who had made her film debut in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull , and Kathryn Walker, who had been the girlfriend of Belushi's National Lampoon colleague Douglas Kenney . The production of Neighbors was troubled. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd switched their roles in pre-production, acting against type . Belushi and Aykroyd also argued constantly with director John G. Avildsen , and lobbied to have him removed from the picture. Belushi wanted either Aykroyd, himself or John Landis to direct the film. Avildsen also argued with producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, and screenwriter Larry Gelbart objected to the changes made to his screenplay by Dan Aykroyd. John Belushi's drug problems also impaired the film's production, and Neighbors proved to be Belushi's final film before he died of a drug overdose. Tom Scott was originally assigned to compose the score for Neighbors but was replaced by Avildsen's frequent collaborator Bill Conti. John Belushi unsuccessfully tried to have the film finish with a song written and performed by the punk rock group Fear . Music producing partners Steve Cropper and Bruce Robb remember recording the band's music, but nobody knows exactly what happened with the final soundtrack which was ultimately replaced in the film by Conti's more traditional movie score. \"How can I describe what it was like recording in the early days of punk?\" said music producer and Cherokee owner Bruce Robb. \"We had decided to track the song selection in order, and were on track 4 before the band realized they were all using different set lists. The irony is we couldn't tell.\" Upset with Belushi's antics and believing that Fear's music was inappropriate for Neighbors, the movie studio eventually forced the band off the soundtrack project. To make up for it, Belushi got them a guest spot on Saturday Night Live.

Mitchell Cohen of Creem gave another negative review, calling Jazz \"absurdly dull\" and filled with \"dumb ideas and imitative posturing\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said the album was not wholly bad, even finding \"Bicycle Race\" humorous, although he said Queen sounded like the band 10cc \"with a spoke, or a pump, up their ass\". In a retrospective assessment, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described it as \"one of their sleekest albums.\" He cited that the album's diversity and exaggeration made it \"more fun than any of their other albums.\" Alexis Petridis wrote in The Guardian, \"Jazz was hysterical in every sense of the word, but the music press comprehensively failed to get the joke, particularly in the US\". In 2006, Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times included it in his list of \"The Great Albums,\" describing it as \"a genre-hopping tour of diverse musical styles\" and concluded that \"What ultimately keeps me coming back to the album, however, is that ambiguous sexual energy running through all 13 tracks; the fact that each of them boasts more hooks than some bands have on an entire album, and the inviting sonic density of it all.\" When Loudersound ranked every Queen album from best to worst, Jazz came fourth, as they felt it presented \"some of the most satisfying moments in Queen's career.\" In a similar list of the band's greatest albums, Ultimate Classic Rock placed Jazz in third position. \"Whenever discussions take place about Queen's incredible string of classic albums throughout the late '70s,\" they wrote, \"1978's 'Jazz' is the one that often seems to get the shortest shrift, but tucked away behind its unusually nondescript cover art lies one of the band's finest albums.

{"id": "218_418", "question": "In what city was Mary Sanders born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_36026", "text": "Many scholars agree that Joseph, Jesus' father, died before Jesus began his ministry. Joseph is not mentioned at all in the Gospels during Jesus' ministry. Joseph's death would explain why in Mark 6:3, Jesus' neighbors refer to Jesus as the \"son of Mary\" . According to Theissen and Merz, it is common for extraordinary charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to come into conflict with their ordinary families. In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad , and this account is thought to be historical because early Christians would likely not have invented it. After Jesus' death, many members of his family joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church. G\u00e9za Vermes says that the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus arose from theological development rather than from historical events. Despite the widely held view that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels drew upon each other , other scholars take it as significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, Matthew and Luke. According to E. P. Sanders, the birth narratives in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads as though it was invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys. The contradictions between the two Gospels was probably apparent to the early Christians already, since attempts to harmonize the two narratives are already present in the earlier apochryphal infancy gospels , which are dated to the 2nd century CE. Sanders says that the genealogies of Jesus are based not on historical information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph.

Upon reaching home, he questions his wife about who their children's father is. The story switches to Gavin Nichols , an atheist, standing on a ledge as if to jump to his death. A small crowd forms below Gavin, and Hollis responds to the emergency. At first it looks like a regular suicide attempt. It is quickly revealed to be more complex than that, as Gavin explains to Hollis that he has no other choice than to jump, or somebody else will die. The story flashes back and describes the story of the love triangle between Gavin, Shana and Joe . Shana is the new girl at the hotel where Gavin works. She lives with her husband Joe in an apartment just down the hall from Gavin's. Joe is a fundamentalist Christian who infantilizes Shana. During a visit one night, Gavin and Joe discuss religion. Gavin neatly picks apart Joe's born again belief system, pointing out that most of the people on Earth would go to Hell, even Catholics, if Joe's faith were correct. Gavin points out that a Chinese child who dies in a traffic accident might never even know about Jesus, and therefore has no chance to be born again. Joe's response is that such an example is not proof of God's unfairness, but merely the reason why Christians are called to proselytize. Their discussion heats up into a full blown argument that ends when Shana asks Gavin to leave. At work, Shana notices Gavin consoling one of his grief-stricken employees with talk about God. He puts on a genuine act as a believer which helps calm the employee down. On a walk with Gavin one day, she confides in him that she used to be a drug addict and a prostitute. She ended up with a john one night who liked to have sex in empty churches. He beat her badly afterward, and Joe discovered her in the sanctuary. Joe helped her turn her life around, and she feels an immense debt of gratitude to him. She tells Gavin that Joe wants them to move to Uganda to spread God's word. Gavin and Shana spend more time with each other, and they eventually begin an affair. Joe quickly deduces what is going on and witnesses their assignations. He confronts Gavin as he is leaving for work and insists that he join him for a talk. In his apartment, Joe tells Gavin that he previously had a wife and two kids, but he would leave them at night to score drugs and hookers and do all kinds of depraved things. He lost his family and was drunk in a gutter when he was born again. He believes that, after God had already given him so much, God gave him Shana to take care of. He quotes Psalm 23 to Gavin and forces him at gunpoint to read Leviticus 20:10, \"If a man commits adultery with another man\u2019s wife\u2014with the wife of his neighbor\u2014both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death.\" Gavin counters with the story of the adulteress from John 8, whom Jesus saves by ordering only those without sin to cast a stone at her. Joe agrees that Gavin has a point, but he questions whether Gavin has the conviction to die for his beliefs. The next day, when Shana is supposed to leave Joe, Gavin is waiting for her to call. Joe calls Gavin instead and orders him to the top of a building. Joe has decided that, \"I'm more of an Old Testament kind of guy\", but instead of killing both Gavin and Shana, only one of them has to die. Joe has Shana at gunpoint and will kill her at noon if Gavin does not jump off the building. Lucetti grows increasingly desperate to save Gavin. He tells him more about his story, explaining that his wife committed adultery out of love and fear that she would lose her husband. She wanted their children to look as much like Lucetti as possible. So, she slept with his younger brother. Gavin scolds Lucetti for focusing too much on the pain of his wife's betrayal instead of the love that motivated her. He asks Lucetti to tell Shana he loves her before jumping off the building. The police find Joe and Shana in a hotel room with a direct view of Gavin's suicide. Joe is arrested.

In 1932 Mapy traveled to New York City and married childhood friend Fernando \"Papi\" Cort\u00e9s. Under contract to a theatrical troupe headlined by Dominican baritone Eduardo Brito, the couple traveled to Spain. After the company disbanded, the couple began performing in different teatro de revista companies, primarily in Barcelona. Mapy Cort\u00e9s made her film debut as one of the two female leads in the comedy Dos Mujeres y un Don Juan . By that time Cort\u00e9s had a nephew, Paquito Cordero, who would become a famed actor and producer in Puerto Rico. After the start of the Spanish Civil War, Mapy and Fernando Cort\u00e9s went to Marseilles before making their way down to Argentina. Following stops in Buenos Aires and Havana, where they appeared on stage and movies, the couple traveled to Mexico City. They made their stage debut as part of the Cantinflas revue and soon joined the growing Mexican film industry, which lacked established female stars. Back-to-back starring roles in three hit films - the Pan-American musical La liga de las canciones / The League of Songs , the nostalgia musical comedy \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 tiempos, se\u00f1or don Sim\u00f3n! / Oh, What Times, Don Simon! and the Cantinflas comedy El gendarme desconocido / The Unknown Policeman - quickly turned Mapy Cort\u00e9s into one of the most bankable leading ladies in Mexican cinema. Mapy also appeared in the U.S. State Department propaganda short film Mexican Moods. The short shows the couple performing at the luxurious Hotel Reforma in Mexico City circa 1941, when Mapy performed as part of the hotel's dinner show and Fernando acted as master of ceremonies. In the short, Mapy sings the Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez song \"Nada\" , which the couple later performed in the 1966 film Luna de miel en Puerto Rico as part of a tribute to the recently deceased composer. In 1942, Cort\u00e9s made her only foray into Hollywood cinema, playing a singer in the RKO wartime musical comedy Seven Days' Leave. Her eponymous character is engaged to Victor Mature's soldier character before he falls in love with a socialite played by Lucille Ball. After filming Seven Days Leave, Mapy Cort\u00e9s returned to Mexico City and played top-billed roles in contemporary romantic comedies and nostalgia musicals set during the Mexican Belle \u00c9poque. The 1945 Mapy Cort\u00e9s vehicle La p\u00edcara Susana / Mischievous Susana  marked the directorial debut of her husband Fernando, who remained very active as a comedy director in Mexican film and TV until his death in 1979, directing vehicles for popular Mexican comedians like Tin-Tan, Resortes, and la India Maria. While Fernando's demand as journeyman comedy director grew, Mapy's film career waned in the early 1950s with the rise of a younger generation of vedettes, rumberas and musical comedy stars. The couple received an invitation from \u00c1ngel Ramos, owner of El Mundo Enterprises, to help launch WKAQ-TV Telemundo Channel 2. On March 28, 1954, Puerto Rico received its first television transmission from Telemundo: a live broadcast of the Spanish comedy El caso de la mujer asesinadita, starring Mapy and directed by Fernando. The couple also starred in the station's first comedy show Mapy y Papi, an adaptation of the I Love Lucy format that also featured Maria Judith Franco and Mapy's nephew Paquito Cordero. Despite their success in Puerto Rican television, the couple decided to return to Mexico City, where they starred in a Mexican version of Mapy y Papi.

He was an intendant in Lille , Soissons , and Roussillon . Orry was named Controller-General of Finances in 1730 and combined this function with being director general of the B\u00e2timents du Roi in 1736, after the death of the duc d'Antin. Orry remained Controller-General until 1745, making him the longest continuously-serving holder of the office in the eighteenth-century. An able economist, Orry had to restore the dixi\u00e8me tax and declared the venality of municipal officials, successfully balancing the budget in 1739-40. Applying the principles of Colbert, he sought to develop the domestic manufacture of textiles and paper, and was involved in the production of porcelain in Vincennes in 1740. He supported trade with Canada and the Indies by reforming the statutes of the Compagnie des Indes. As director general of buildings, he established the bi-annual public Paris Salon, and became the vice-protecteur of  the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in April 1737. His directorship has, generally, been harshly judged. The marquis d'Argenson spoke with contempt of \"the bad, bourgeois taste of Monsieur Orry\". However, Orry's selection of Charles-Joseph Natoire in 1730 to decorate his ch\u00e2teau de La Chapelle-Godefroy reveals, on the contrary, a certain discernement in artistic matters: Natoire was one of the most promising young history painters, and his two main rivals - Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Carle Van Loo - were both abroad. As director general of Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es , Orry finished the Crozat canal and maintained and developed France's road system.  He sent to the intendants, in 1738, a detailed instruction on the duty for all inhabitants to spend a fortnight a year on the construction and maintenance of transport routes, classed in five categories. The corv\u00e9e made France's major road network the finest in Europe, and before the Revolution, a great part of the public roads existed thanks to this institution. This policy of improved communications also led to the completion of the Cassini map in 1744. Facing opposition from Madame de Pompadour, Orry resigned in 1745. He was the Treasurer of the Order of the Holy Spirit from February 1743 to his death in 1747.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was drafted in 1943 into the United States Army Air Forces, where he was an ordnance technician. His commanding officer had him write a history of his battalion after having seen the quality of his writing while censoring his mail. He remained in the Army Air Forces as a writer and historian until 1947. After leaving military service, he was hired as a reporter by Billboard in 1948, where he first covered the coin-operated machine beat and moved on to cover music. He was hired by Decca Records in 1956. When Horowitz was hired by Decca, the label had not been producing classical music, and it was Horowitz's efforts that enabled Decca to compete with Columbia Records and RCA Records. He served as director of classical artists and repertory from 1958 to 1971. In this role he produced recordings by organist Virgil Fox, violinists Erica Morini and Ruggiero Ricci, conductor Leopold Stokowski, New York Pro Musica and classical guitarist Andr\u00e9s Segovia. Some of Horowitz's best known recording were the works he did with Segovia at Decca and as an independent producer. The albums they produced included lute and vihuela pieces, as well as original works written for Segovia by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Manuel Mar\u00eda Ponce and Alexandre Tansman. Segovia won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1959 for the Golden Jubilee album they worked on. Segovia and Horowitz also collaborated on The Guitar and I, which was to include records with music on one side and autobiographical material on the other. The pair had produced the first two volumes in the planned series by 1971, when Decca ended its production of classical recordings. He returned to Billboard in 1973, serving variously as the publication's New York bureau chief, classical music editor and executive editor. After retiring from his editing responsibilities in the 1980s, he continued to write Keeping Score, a weekly column covering classical music until the early 1990s. After his retirement in 1994, Timothy White, then editor-in-chief at Billboard described Horowitz as \"one of the most distinguished and admired figures in the music industry, but also one of its modern architects, helping pioneer contemporary music journalism and criticism, as well as playing a consummate role as A&R executive and astute producer of some of the foremost classical artists of our era. Horowitz exemplifies the finest aspects of journalism and the arts. He was one of four survivors of American Airlines Flight 383 that crashed on approach to the Greater Cincinnati Airport on November 8, 1965 with 62 people on board. Horowitz died at age 92 on December 26, 2008 at his home in Closter, New Jersey.

According to Venator, Tishem was a remarkably erudite woman, fluent in Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and English and able to read Galen's original text. In 1558 in Antwerp, Tishem married a widowed and wealthy merchant and juror, Wouter Gruter , originally from Breda. They had four children, Jan being born in December 1560. Her husband co-signed the Compromise of Nobles in 1566, and to flee prosecution in the Spanish Netherlands, they moved to the Dutch Calvinist exile community of Norwich. Some biographies of Jan Gruter claim that Tishem was originally from Norwich herself, though Thijsmans/Thysmans was a regular Flemish patronymic. When their son enrolled at the new Leiden University in Holland in 1578/1579, Catherine and Wouter returned to Antwerp, but the Siege of Antwerp in 1584 made them flee again, this time to L\u00fcbeck and then Gda\u0144sk. Wouter Gruter died in Gda\u0144sk in 1588, and, according to Peter Fuchs, Catherine died in 1595.", "hasanswer": true}]}

November 2014 marked the first election under the new system. The Federal government had forced San Antonio and Dallas to abandon at-large systems before 1987; however, the court could not show a racist pattern in Austin and upheld the city's at-large system during a 1984 lawsuit. In five elections between 1973 and 1994 Austin voters rejected single-member districts. Austin formerly operated its city hall at 128 West 8th Street.

In 2012, Dr. John released Locked Down, a collaboration with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, who produced the record and played guitar on it. The album received very positive reviews for its raw, Afrobeat-influenced sound. The Los Angeles Times said that it showed Dr. John \"exiting a period of relative creative stagnation by creating something magical, the embodiment of everything he's done but pushed in a clear new direction\". It won a Grammy Award, as did Auerbach for producing it. In 2014, Dr. John released a Louis Armstrong tribute album, Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch, on Concord Records USA and Proper Records in Europe. Dr. John described the inspiration of the album as Louis Armstrong coming to him in a dream and telling him \"do my music your way\". The Los Angeles Times said, \"Tribute albums come and go, but it's a real rarity that can snap a listener to attention like Dr. John's new salute to jazz founding father Louis Armstrong.\" That spring, \"The Musical Mojo of Mac\", a New Orleans concert to honor Dr. John, was introduced by Brian Williams and kicked off by Bruce Springsteen singing \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", with Dr. John and an all-star band which included event producer Don Was on bass. Dr. John recorded \"Let 'Em In\" in the Paul McCartney tribute album The Art of McCartney. \"It's a wonder to behold, as the ageless Dr. John re-envisions \"Let 'Em In\" as a laconic come on, an invitation to party or maybe something more, once a few more glasses have been raised\", wrote Something Else. \"At the same time, he ends up lacing the song with darker feelings, as well.\" Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl interviewed Dr. John about music in the New Orleans-themed episode of their HBO series Sonic Highways \"\", wrote a Decider reviewer. From 2014 to 2016, Dr. John performed with an alternate band, including at a Hollywood Bowl tribute \"Yes We Can Can\" for his late friend Allen Toussaint on July 20, 2016.

In Paris he knew Charles Longuet, Louis-Auguste Rogeard, and Jules Vall\u00e8s. A reader of Joseph Proudhon writings, he met Proudhon, and joined the International Workingmen's Association. He went to study in Germany in 1866. At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he returned to  Paris. It was during the Siege of Paris that Vaillant met Auguste Blanqui. Vaillant opposed the Government of National Defence, and took part in the revolts on 31 October 1870 and 22 January 1871. He was one of the four editors of the Affiche Rouge calling for the creation of the Paris Commune. In the elections of February 1871 he stood as a revolutionary socialist candidate for the National Assembly but was not elected. In March 1871 he was elected by the 20th arrondissement to the council of the Commune where he oversaw work on education. Following the bloody suppression of the Commune in late May 1871, Vaillant fled France with Eug\u00e8ne Baudin for Great Britain where he was part of the Blanquist tendency of the First International. He was sentenced to death in absentia in July 1872 and did not return to France until the general amnesty of 1880.

The skull of Saint Peter is claimed to reside in the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran since at least the ninth century, alongside the skull of Saint Paul. In 1950, human bones were found buried underneath the altar of St. Peter's Basilica. The bones have been claimed by many to have been those of Peter. An attempt to contradict these claims was made in 1953 by the excavation of what some believe to be Saint Peter's tomb in Jerusalem. However along with this supposed tomb in Jerusalem bearing his previous name Simon , tombs bearing the names of Jesus, Mary, James, John, and the rest of the apostles were also found at the same excavation\u2014though all these names were very common among Jews at the time. In the 1960s, items from the excavations beneath St Peter's Basilica were re-examined, and the bones of a male person were identified. A forensic examination found them to be a male of about 61 years of age from the 1st century. This caused Pope Paul VI in 1968 to announce them most likely to be the relics of Apostle Peter. On 24 November 2013, Pope Francis presented part of the relics, consisting of bone fragments, for the first time in public during a Mass celebrated in St. Peter's Square.

Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad and asked her to marry him after their first date. They married approximately one month later on August 14, 1964. They quarreled over Sonji's refusal to join the Nation Of Islam. According to Ali, \"She wouldn't do what she was supposed to do. She wore lipstick; she went into bars; she dressed in clothes that were revealing and didn't look right.\" The marriage was childless and they divorced on January 10, 1966. Just before the divorce was finalized, Ali sent Sonji a note: \"You traded heaven for hell, baby.\" Ali's brother Rahman said that she was Ali's only true love and the Nation of Islam made Ali divorce her and Ali never got over it. On August 17, 1967, Ali married Belinda Boyd. Born into a Chicago family that had converted to the Nation Of Islam, she later changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called Belinda by old friends and family. They had four children: author and rapper Maryum \"May May\" ; twins Jamillah and Rasheda , who married Robert Walsh and has a son, Biaggio Ali, born in 1998; and Muhammad Ali Jr. . Rasheda's son Nico is a professional boxer. Ali was a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey in the early 1970s. At age 32 in 1974, Ali began an extramarital relationship with 16-year-old Wanda Bolton with whom he fathered another daughter, Khaliah . While still married to Belinda, Ali married Aaisha in an Islamic ceremony that was not legally recognized. According to Khaliah, Aaisha and her mother lived at Ali's Deer Lake training camp alongside Belinda and her children. In January 1985, Aaisha sued Ali for unpaid palimony. The case was settled when Ali agreed to set up a $200,000 trust fund for Khaliah. In 2001 Khaliah was quoted as saying she believed her father viewed her as \"a mistake\". He had another daughter, Miya , from an extramarital relationship with Patricia Harvell. By the summer of 1977, his second marriage ended due to Ali's repeated infidelity, and he had married actress and model Veronica Porch\u00e9. At the time of their marriage, they had a daughter, Hana, and Veronica was pregnant with their second child. Their second daughter, Laila Ali, was born in December 1977. By 1986, Ali and Porch\u00e9 were divorced due to Ali's continuous infidelity. Porch\u00e9 said of Ali's infidelity, \"It was too much temptation for him, with women who threw themselves at him, It didn\u2019t mean anything. He didn't have affairs \u2013 he had one-night stands. I knew beyond a doubt there were no feelings involved. It was so obvious, It was easy to forgive him.\" On November 19, 1986, Ali married Yolanda \"Lonnie\" Williams. Lonnie first met Ali at the age of 6 when her family moved to Louisville in 1963. In 1982, she became Ali's primary caregiver and in return, he paid for her to attend graduate school at UCLA. Together they adopted a son, Asaad Amin , when Asaad was five months old. In 1992, Lonnie incorporated Greatest of All Time, Inc. to consolidate and license his intellectual properties for commercial purposes. She served as the vice president and treasurer until the sale of the company in 2006. Kiiursti Mensah-Ali claims she is Ali's biological daughter with Barbara Mensah, with whom he allegedly had a 20-year relationship, citing photographs and a paternity test conducted in 1988. She said he accepted responsibility and took care of her, but all contacts with him were cut off after he married his fourth wife Lonnie. Kiiursti says she has a relationship with his other children. After his death she again made passionate appeals to be allowed to mourn at his funeral. In 2010, Osmon Williams came forward claiming to be Ali's biological son. His mother Temica Williams launched a $3\u00a0million lawsuit against Ali in 1981 for sexual assault, claiming that she had started a sexual relationship with him when she was 12, and that her son Osmon was fathered by Ali. She further alleged that Ali had originally supported her and her son financially, but stopped doing so after four years. The case went on until 1986 and was eventually thrown out as her allegations were deemed to be barred by the statute of limitations. According to Veronica, Ali admitted to the affair with Williams, but did not believe Osmon was his son which Veronica supported by saying \"Everybody in the camp was going with that girl.\" Ali biographer and friend Thomas Hauser has said this claim was of \"questionable veracity\". Ali then lived in Scottsdale, Arizona with Lonnie. In January 2007, it was reported that they had put their home in Berrien Springs, Michigan, which they had bought in 1975, up for sale and had purchased a home in eastern Jefferson County, Kentucky for $1,875,000. Both homes were subsequently sold after Ali's death with Lonnie living in their remaining home in Paradise Valley, Arizona. Lonnie converted to Islam from Catholicism in her late twenties. In an interview in 1974, Ali said, \"If they say stand and salute the flag I do that out of respect, because I'm in the country\". Ali would later say, \"If America was in trouble and real war came, I'd be on the front line if we had been attacked. But I could see that wasn't right.\" He also said, \"Black men would go over there and fight, but when they came home, they couldn't even be served a hamburger.\" Ali's daughter Laila was a professional boxer from 1999 until 2007, despite her father's previous opposition to women's boxing. In 1978, he said \"Women are not made to be hit in the breast, and face like that.\" Ali still attended a number of his daughter's fights and later admitted to Laila he was wrong. Ali's daughter Hana is married to Bellator middleweight fighter Kevin Casey. Hana wrote about her father, \"His love for people was extraordinary. I would get home from school to find homeless families sleeping in our guest room. He\u2019d see them on the street, pile them into his Rolls-Royce and bring them home. He\u2019d buy them clothes, take them to hotels and pay the bills for months in advance.\" She also said celebrities like Michael Jackson and Clint Eastwood would often visit Ali. After Ali met a lesbian couple who were fans of his in 1997, he smiled and said to his friend Hauser, \"They look like they\u2019re happy together.\" Hauser wrote about the story, \"The thought that Liz and Roz were happy pleased Muhammad. Ali wanted people to be happy.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He also played in the Vancouver-based band Crosstown Bus prior to joining BTO. Thornton joined the group in early 1974 during the supporting tour for the Bachman-Turner Overdrive II album, replacing Tim Bachman shortly after that album was released. Thornton made his live debut with BTO at a March 1974 televised event for Don Kirshner's In Concert program hosted by Don E. Branker. Thornton's first album with BTO was the highly successful Not Fragile LP, released in the fall of 1974. With Thornton's arrival, BTO began incorporating \"dual-lead\" guitar solos in many new songs, with Thornton playing the lead guitar parts along with primary lead guitarist Randy Bachman. Such solos were not a major feature on the band's first two albums. In interviews years later, Randy noted that Blair Thornton was a welcome addition: He was known for playing in the Eric Clapton/Bluesbreakers style. [He] was more advanced on the guitar than my brother Tim, who was basically a rhythm player who left all the lead to me. I'm not that good. I would repeat myself, my vocabulary is limited and I didn't have time to go out and learn. So Blair brought in a new style. We now had twin lead guitars, and that made my job a lot easier; it gave us more versatility. As a songwriter, Thornton contributed two compositions to the Not Fragile album: \"Givin' It All Away\" and an instrumental called \"Freewheelin'\" that also wound up as the B-side of the No. 1 hit \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\". He also co-wrote three songs for the follow-up 1975 album, Four Wheel Drive, including the title track , and co-wrote the Top 40 hit \"Take It Like a Man\" for the late 1975 album Head On. Two other songs on Head On, \"It's Over\" and \"Wild Spirit\", also credit Thornton and Turner as songwriters. Following Randy Bachman's departure from the group in 1977, Thornton took over as primary lead guitarist on their next two albums: Street Action and Rock n' Roll Nights , also contributing several compositions. Thornton rejoined the \"classic\" Not Fragile line-up in 1988 for a reunion tour. In 1991, Randy Bachman left the group again and this time was replaced by Vancouver guitarist-singer Randy Murray. This version of BTO proved to be the most enduring, as they toured together until the latter part of 2004. In 2014 Thornton along with original band members Fred Turner, Rob and Randy Bachman were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.

{"id": "218_518", "question": "In what city was Martin Behaim born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "218_25160", "text": "Behaim was born in Nuremberg on 6 October 1459, the oldest son of Martin Behaim and Agnes Schopper. The elder Martin was a merchant involved in long-distance trade within Europe, including Venice; in 1461 he was elected a senator of Nuremberg. Their son, as a member of a prominent and prosperous family, likely received a good education at one of the best grammar schools in the city. Contrary to later assertions, it is unlikely that he was ever a student of the famous Renaissance mathematician and astronomer, Regiomontanus. When his father died in 1474, Martin's uncle Leonhard sent him at the age of 15 to Mechelen, Flanders to gain experience as a textile merchant. There he joined the business of Jorius van Dorpp, a vendor of clothing. In 1477 they visited Antwerp where van Dorpp sold his wares to a German merchant; later that same year Behaim attended the Frankfurt fair with Bartels von Eyb, a friend of the family. Writing to his uncle in 1478, Behaim expressed a desire to improve his business prospects by moving to Antwerp, a leading center of the cloth trade.  The following year he moved to Antwerp and joined the cloth-dye-house of Fritz Heberlein, a native of Nuremberg. In 1484 Behaim moved to Portugal and set up residence in Lisbon. The circumstances behind this move are unclear but Lisbon was the hub of a wide-ranging trade network that included spices, slaves, and gold from Africa and it is likely that Behaim was looking for trading opportunities. He quickly found favor as a counselor in the court of King John II where he supposedly provided advice on navigation and astronomy. However, despite assertions by his early biographers, there is no evidence that Behaim made any significant contributions in these areas. Claims that he taught celestial navigation or introduced the Portuguese to new navigational instruments are belied by the fact that these technologies were already known and used by Portuguese mariners. He may have acted as an importer of scientific instruments, the finest of which were produced at that time in his native town of Nuremberg. On 18 February 1485 Behaim was knighted by John II, presumably for his contributions as adviser on navigation and astronomy but there is no record of the exact reasons for his honor. It appears that Behaim participated in a voyage to West Africa around 1485; however it is unlikely that he accompanied Diogo C\u00e3o on his second expedition as is sometimes claimed. It is more likely that he participated in a trading voyage to Guinea led by Jo\u00e3o Afonso de Aveiro. Following his marriage to Joana de Macedo in 1486, he resided on the Portuguese island of Faial in the Azores, where his father-in-law, Josse van Huerter, was Captain-donat\u00e1rio and leader of the Flemish community.  In 1490, Behaim returned to Nuremberg to settle a will case, and remained in the city for three years. He managed to convince leading members of the city council to finance the construction of his famous terrestrial globe under his direction. He returned to Faial in 1493 by way of Flanders and Lisbon, and he remained there until 1506. Behaim died in the hospice of Saint Bartholomew on 29 July 1507 while visiting Lisbon for business.", "hasanswer": false}]}

McKee was one of many ballplayers who appeared in the Major Leagues only during World War II. He made his major league debut on August 18, 1943, in a home doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals at Shibe Park. The best game of his short career, however, came on October 3, 1943, the last day of the season, when he started the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field and pitched a complete game, winning 11\u20133. The losing pitcher was Cookie Cuccurullo, who was making his major league debut. Then, at 17, McKee became the youngest pitcher in the 20th century to throw a nine-inning complete-game victory on the final day of the regular season, a feat no one has accomplished since. McKee made his last pitching appearance for the Phillies on September 26, 1944.

Its debut album Don't Metal with Evil was released in 1985 on the Motor City Metal label. In 1986, Halloween started work on its follow up to Don't Metal With Evil, Victims of the Night. However, the record was shelved until it was finally released on Molton Metal Records in 1997. In 1988, members Rick Craig and Bill Whyte left to pursue other careers. In 2000, Craig was asked to join the British band Humble Pie with Jerry Shirley to go on a U.S Tour. He also at the time was playing in the band NOON, in which he and Ean Evans were the primary songwriters. Their replacements were future Godsmack drummer Tommy Stewart and guitarist Billy Gray, who would go on to play in the Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti-based rock band Fair Game . Bill Whyte went on to open his own recording studio and later joined Detroit based band Abandon and released a 5-song EP called \"Project unrealty\" which was Recorded, produced and engineered by Bill Whyte. The band and EP got great reviews but Bill's time with the band was short-lived. In 1989, Halloween opened for Crimson Glory on a couple of dates on their Transcendence tour. In that same year, Halloween began work on a new album with Jon Drenning of Crimson Glory and Warren Wyatt management. The album never made it to the shelves. In 1990, Halloween recorded a 5 track demo entitled Vicious Demos with producer Rob Tylak, Stewart and Gray. The demo was released on cassette for show and promotion only and sold at Halloween shows. 1991 saw a new lineup for Halloween, with the additions of former Erebus guitarist Tim Wright, guitarist Donny Allen , and future Sponge drummer Billy Adams . That same year, Halloween released No One Gets Out. The next few years saw a period of silence in terms of recordings. In 1997, former members Rick Craig and Bill Whyte rejoined, and Victims of the Night was finally released. After that, the band found themselves in debt, so they released a demo compilation called 1031, A Number Of Things From.... The reunion was short-lived. Shortly after Whyte and Craig left once again. In that period bassist George Neal left only to return around 2004. A year before that, Tricks, Treats And Other Tales From The Crypt was released. Tricks, Treats And Other Tales From The Crypt is a compilation album released by Detroit-based Heavy Metal band Halloween in 2003.

Development of Hang-On began with a project brought to him by a colleague who asked him to implement a torsion bar into an arcade game design\u2014although the bar proved too difficult to implement in the final game design and springs were used instead.  Suzuki was given the freedom to decide what kind of game to design, and as a fan of cars and motorcycles, he chose to design a game where the arcade cabinet simulated an actual motorcycle and players would have to move side to side on the motorcycle in order to turn.  He also had a desire to make his game better than Pole Position, a Namco game which had beaten out Sega's Turbo in popularity.  In developing the game, Suzuki wanted to make his new motorcycle racing game a realistic experience.  His initial desire was to create a 3D game, though the technology of the time made full 3D environments impossible. Instead, he specified the design of Sega's new Super Scaler arcade system board\u2014initially known as Sega Hang-On hardware\u2014enhanced from the existing VCO Object system board that would utilize multiple CPUs and back end DSP compatibility to create 3D effects, while utilizing 16-bit graphics. The game achieves its 3D effects using a sprite-scaling technique. In designing the game, Suzuki had to decide on a style of motorcycle racing for the game.  Suzuki himself was a fan of dirt bikes, along with motocross and Enduro, and dirt bikes would later be used in Suzuki's Enduro Racer.  However, Sega's market research concluded that road-based GP 500 racing was more popular worldwide.  While Suzuki was doing research for the game, he admired the riding style of Freddie Spencer, who had just become the youngest person to win a motorcycling world championship at 21 years old.  According to Suzuki, \"Freddie Spencer's riding style, it was so nice.  And my game was like a homage. That's the reason I wanted to make it - Freddie Spencer, he rode a Honda bike, and I loved the way he hung on!\"  Two cabinet designs were made: a basic version with a handlebar and levers, and the deluxe cabinet which featured the full motorcycle to be tilted.  Suzuki had additional features he wanted to implement that could not be done due to cost, including a gyroscope to simulate motorcycle acceleration and deceleration. The title is derived from when the biker is turning and has to \"hang on\" to the bike while the bike is leaning, which Suzuki had read in a Japanese bike magazine.  Suzuki later learned the technique was called \"hang off\" in North America, but he chose to keep the former name. Hang-On is considered well-regarded for its music, which was composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi.  He came to Suzuki's attention after Suzuki heard he played in a band.  Suzuki wanted songs for the soundtrack to Hang-On that would be like what a band would play.  This led to Kawaguchi writing four songs for the game, including \"Theme of Love\", the game's theme song.  Kawaguchi made use of the hardware's PCM sampling and added drum samples to use Hang-On's Yamaha YM2203 sound chip to its maximum potential and create a more realistic soundtrack featuring rock music, which was uncommon in arcade games at the time.  He also created the game's sound effects.  Kawaguchi did not program his own music into the game; he instead wrote out his soundtrack by hand, made a demo, and gave that to the sound programmer.  He has said this was because he did not own a sequencer, and that this method was faster for him.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "218_533", "question": "In what city was Pieter van Laer born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "218_44404", "text": "Pieter van Laer was born in Haarlem as the second child of Jacob Claesz. Boddingh of Haarlem and Magdalena Heyns of Antwerp. He adopted the surname van Laer only later in life.  This surname was probably taken from his brother's godfather. He came from a well to do family and his parents operated a private school in Haarlem started by Magdalena's father, the well-known writer and publisher Peeter Heyns, after whom Pieter van Laer was named. His older brother was Roedolff van Laer, who also became a painter and was known as Roeland van Laer and Orlando van Laer. His youngest brother Nicolaes Bodding became known later in life as Nicolaes Boddingius and was a prominent schoolmaster and minister.  He also had two sisters called Barbara and Anthoynetta Pieter van Laer was possibly a pupil of Esaias van de Velde in Haarlem. His early work shows the influence of this painter as is evidenced by a drawing signed Pieter Bodink , which is close to van de Velde's style. He traveled to Rome in 1625 via France, likely in the company of his brother Roeland.  In 1626 their father is also recorded in Rome as a witness to a will. Here he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mostly Flemish and Dutch artists in Rome who were known for their initiation rituals, which involved a lot of drinking.  Pieter van Laer's nickname in Italy was Il Bamboccio, which means \"ugly doll\" or \"puppet\". This was an allusion to van Laer's ungainly appearance, as he is said to have had unusually long legs, short chest and almost no neck.  Pieter van Laer was also known for his pointed moustache.  Van Laer shared a home in the Via Margutta with Giovanni di Filippo del Campo, whose pupil he is said to have been according to certain art historians. However, such apprenticeship is unlikely since the two artists had approximately the same age.  He was also a close friend of Joachim von Sandrart in Rome. Through the works he created in Rome Pieter van Laer initiated a new style of genre painting.  Paintings in this new style were named Bambocciate after his nickname.  He became the inspiration and focal point around which likeminded artists congregated during his stay in Italy. The initial Bamboccianti included Jan Miel, Andries and Jan Both, Karel Dujardin, Johannes Lingelbach and the Italian Michelangelo Cerquozzi.  The Frenchman S\u00e9bastien Bourdon was also associated with this group during his early career. Other Bamboccianti include Michiel Sweerts, Thomas Wijck, Dirck Helmbreker, Jan Asselyn, Anton Goubau, Willem Reuter, Jacob van Staverden and Johan Filip Lemke. Pieter van Laer had a successful career in Rome.  He returned to the Netherlands c. 1639.  Here he lived chiefly in Amsterdam and later in Haarlem with his younger brother Nicolaes.  The date, place and cause of van Laer's death are unknown.  It must have occurred after 1641 when he is known to have made a drawing in a Haarlem song book. It is believed he travelled back to Italy around that time.  According to a statement in the testament of his sister made in 1654 there had not been any signs of life from Pieter van Laer in the previous 12 years.  The Italian biographer Giovanni Battista Passeri stated that van Laer died in the fall of 1642.  The Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken reported that van Laer became depressed at the end of his life and committed suicide by drowning.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as Babes in Arms , The Boys from Syracuse and Pal Joey .  Some of Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre:  On Your Toes was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot , while Pal Joey flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero.  Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as Rose-Marie , The Desert Song , The New Moon and Show Boat .  Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an Oscar for his song with Jerome Kern, \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\", which was included in the 1941 film Lady Be Good. By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, becoming unreliable and  prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.  Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was Oklahoma! .  Thomas Hischak states, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, that Oklahoma! is \"the single most influential work in the American musical theatre.  In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before Oklahoma! and what came after it.\"  An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, Oklahoma! would serve, according to Hischak, as \"the model for Broadway shows for decades\", and proved a huge popular and financial success.  Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair.  Film producer Samuel Goldwyn saw Oklahoma! and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which according to Rodgers \"was Sam's blunt but funny way of telling me that I'd never create another show as good as Oklahoma!\"  As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, \"We're such fools.  No matter what we do, everyone is bound to say, 'This is not another Oklahoma! \" Oklahoma! had been a struggle to finance and produce.  Hammerstein and Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theatre Guild, producers of the blockbuster musical, who together formed what they termed \"the Gloat Club\".  At one such luncheon, Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that they turn Moln\u00e1r's Liliom into a musical.  Both men refused\u2014they had no feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre.  In addition, given the unstable wartime political situation, they might need to change the setting from Hungary while in rehearsal.  At the next luncheon, Helburn and Langner again proposed Liliom, suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a Creole.  Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole dialect, filled with \"zis\" and \"zose\", would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics. A breakthrough came when Rodgers, who owned a house in Connecticut, proposed a New England setting.  Hammerstein wrote of this suggestion in 1945, I began to see an attractive ensemble\u2014sailors, whalers, girls who worked in the mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds, people who were strong and alive and lusty, people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans\u2014a libel I was anxious to refute\u00a0... as for the two leading characters, Julie with her courage and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest.  Liliom is, of course, an international character, indigenous to nowhere. Rodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about what they termed \"the tunnel\" of Moln\u00e1r's second act\u2014a series of gloomy scenes leading up to Liliom's suicide\u2014followed by a dark ending.  They also felt it would be difficult to set Liliom's motivation for the robbery to music.  Moln\u00e1r's opposition to having his works adapted was also an issue; he had famously turned down Giacomo Puccini when the great composer wished to transform Liliom into an opera, stating that he wanted the piece to be remembered as his, not Puccini's.  In 1937, Moln\u00e1r, who had recently emigrated to the United States, had declined another offer from Kurt Weill to adapt the play into a musical. The pair continued to work on the preliminary ideas for a Liliom adaptation while pursuing other projects in late 1943 and early 1944\u2014writing the film musical State Fair and producing I Remember Mama on Broadway.  Meanwhile, the Theatre Guild took Moln\u00e1r to see Oklahoma!  Moln\u00e1r stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt Liliom as beautifully as they had modified Green Grow the Lilacs into Oklahoma!, he would be pleased to have them do it.  The Guild obtained the rights from Moln\u00e1r in October 1943.  The playwright received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for \"personal services\".  The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Moln\u00e1r permit them to make changes in the plot.  At first, the playwright refused, but eventually yielded.  Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won, \"we could never have made Carousel.\" In seeking to establish through song Liliom's motivation for the robbery, Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in Pal Joey.  Rodgers and Hart had  overcome the problem  with a song that Joey sings to himself, \"I'm Talking to My Pal\".  This inspired \"Soliloquy\".  Both partners later told a story that \"Soliloquy\" was only intended to be a song about Liliom's dreams of a son, but that Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl.  However, the notes taken at their meeting of December 7, 1943 state: \"Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number for the end of the scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father, in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely.\" Hammerstein and Rodgers returned to the Liliom project in mid-1944.  Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing that no matter what they did, Moln\u00e1r would disapprove of the results.  Green Grow the Lilacs had been a little-known work; Liliom was a theatrical standard.  Moln\u00e1r's text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society.  A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy.  Hammerstein decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers.  He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in Liliom; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge.  \"This Was a Real Nice Clambake\" was repurposed from a song, \"A Real Nice Hayride\", written for Oklahoma! but not used. Moln\u00e1r's ending was unsuitable, and after a couple of false starts, Hammerstein conceived the graduation scene that ends the musical.  According to Frederick Nolan in his book on the team's works: \"From that scene the song \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" sprang almost naturally.\"  In spite of Hammerstein's simple lyrics for \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", Rodgers had great difficulty in setting it to music.  Rodgers explained his rationale for the changed ending, Liliom was a tragedy about a man who cannot learn to live with other people.  The way Moln\u00e1r wrote it, the man ends up hitting his daughter and then having to go back to purgatory, leaving his daughter helpless and hopeless.  We couldn't accept that.  The way we ended Carousel it may still be a tragedy but it's a hopeful one because in the final scene it is clear that the child has at last learned how to express herself and communicate with others. When the pair decided to make \"This Was a Real Nice Clambake\" into an ensemble number, Hammerstein realized he had no idea what a clambake was like, and researched the matter.  Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, \"First came codfish chowder\".  However, further research convinced him the proper term was \"codhead chowder\", a term unfamiliar to many playgoers.  He decided to keep it as \"codfish\".  When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line \"We slit 'em down the back/And peppered 'em good\".  He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front.  The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back.  Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back.  One error not caught involved the song \"June Is Bustin' Out All Over\", in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring\u2014they actually do so in the winter.  Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein's attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring. Rodgers early decided to dispense with an overture, feeling that the music was hard to hear over the banging of seats as latecomers settled themselves.  In his autobiography, Rodgers complained that only the brass section can be heard during an overture because there are never enough strings in a musical's small orchestra.  He determined to force the audience to concentrate from the beginning by opening with a pantomime scene accompanied by what became known as \"The Carousel Waltz\".  The pantomime paralleled one in the Moln\u00e1r play, which was also used to introduce the characters and situation to the audience. Author Ethan Mordden described the effectiveness of this opening: Other characters catch our notice\u2014Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, the widow who runs the carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat.  But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy\u2014the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying to the rhythm of Billy's spiel.  And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well.  They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Brazilian gold rush ushered in an influx of new settlers in search of veins of gold and gems, and later diamonds which come from the naturally occurring itacolumite rock that can be found in great numbers in the region. These helped to boost occupation of the inner lands and led to the foundation of several new villages. In 1697, the Portuguese used enslaved African labor to start building the Estrada Real, the \"royal road,\" that would connect the ports of cities of Rio de Janeiro and Paraty to the mineral-rich regions of Ouro Preto, Serro, and, at the northernmost point, Diamantina. In 1753 Rosa Egipc\u00edaca was enslaved and forced to work as a prostitute in a mine in the region, until she became ill and began to have religious visions. These visions led to her arrest and imprisonment and ultimately interrogation by the Inquisition. She recorded them in the first book to be written by a black woman in Brazil - Sagrada Teologia do Amor Divino das Almas Peregrinas. Prior to 1720, Minas Gerais was part of the captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente . The first capital of Minas Gerais, and seat of the local see, was the city of Mariana; it was later moved to Vila Rica. In the late 18th century, Vila Rica was the largest city in Brazil and one of the most populous in America. As the gold mines were exhausted over the 19th century, the city lost its importance; it was later renamed Ouro Preto and remained the state capital until the construction of the all-new, planned city of Belo Horizonte at the turn of the 20th century. The gold cycle left its mark in cities such as Mariana, Ouro Preto, Diamantina, Sabar\u00e1, Tiradentes and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del Rei. The relative isolation from European influence, added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals, helped the local people to develop their own style of art, which became known as Barroco Mineiro. Prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities. The most important artist of this period was Ant\u00f4nio Francisco Lisboa, who became known as Aleijadinho. His sculptural and architectural work, as exhibited in the Twelve Prophets and The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi in Ouro Preto, are highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside Europe at that time. In addition to art and architecture, there was an explosion of musical activity in Minas Gerais in the 18th century. Printed copies of European music, as well as accomplished musicians, made the journey to the area, and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication. Several composers worked in Minas Gerais in the 18th century, mainly in Vila Rica , Sabar\u00e1, Mariana, and other cities. Some of the names which have survived include Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita, Marcos Coelho Netto, Francisco Gomes da Rocha and Ign\u00e1cio Parreiras Neves; they cultivated a style related to the classical European style but marked by more a more chordal, homophonic sound, and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments. Guimar\u00e3es Rosa's literature is mostly situated in Minas Gerais, with locations widely located across the State rather than delimited and identifiable. This northern area began to be colonized and became accessible to colonists departing from Bahia up north, which made the Portuguese crown insert the region within the state of Minas Gerais's borders in order to prevent gold and diamond smuggling from people trying to avoid colonial taxation and oversight; thus the state of MG was closely watched by the crown because of its tax revenue. During the 18th century, mining exploration was strongly controlled by the Portuguese Crown, which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted . Several rebellions were attempted by the colonists, always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown. One of the most important was the Felipe dos Santos revolt that ended with his execution but also with the separation of Minas Gerais of S\u00e3o Paulo. The most notable one, however, was the Inconfid\u00eancia, started in 1789 by group of middle-class colonists, mostly intellectuals and young officers. They were inspired by the American and French Enlightenment ideals. The conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled. The most famous of them, Joaquim Jos\u00e9 da Silva Xavier , was hanged by order of Queen Maria I of Portugal, becoming a local hero and a national martyr of Brazil. The Minas Gerais flag\u2014a red triangle on a white background, along with the Latin motto \"Libertas qu\u00e6 sera tamen\", \"freedom albeit late\"\u2014is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the \"Inconfidentes\", as the rebels became known. In the economic history of Brazil, Minas Gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the Brazilian northeast to the southeast of the country, which still remains the major economic center. The large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of Portugal back to Brazil, progressively turning Rio de Janeiro into an important port city, from where these would be shipped to Portugal and where the Portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in 1808 after Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Portugal . Due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population\u2014famed for its reserved and balanced character\u2014Minas Gerais has also played an important role on national politics. During the 19th century, politicians such as Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio de Andrada e Silva were instrumental in the establishment of the Brazilian Empire under the rule of Dom Pedro I and later his son, Dom Pedro II. After the installation of the Brazilian Republic, during the early 20th century, Minas Gerais shared the control of the national political scene with S\u00e3o Paulo in what became known as the \"Coffee with Milk\" political cycle . Minas Gerais was also home to two of the most influential Brazilian politicians of the second half of the 20th century. Juscelino Kubitschek was president from 1956 to 1961, and he was responsible for the construction of Bras\u00edlia as the new capital of Brazil. Tancredo Neves had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in 1984 to be the first civil president after the 1964 military countercoup. However, he died after a series of health complications just as he was about to assume the position. Also, Itamar, Brazil's previous president, lived there, though he was not born in Minas.

More than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1924. The term \"melting pot\" was first coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. By 1900, Germans constituted the largest immigrant group, followed by the Irish, Jews, and Italians. In 1940, Whites represented 92% of the city's population. Approximately 37% of the city's population is foreign born, and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants as of 2013.

As a young man, Willard moved to Wellington, Ohio and began working for the wagon maker, E.S. Tripp. He began as a basic wagon painter, but eventually was allowed to paint elaborate decorations that were popular at the time. Willard joined the 86th Ohio Infantry in 1863 and fought in the American Civil War, but was not heavily involved. During this time, he painted several scenes from the war. After the war, Willard created a pair of paintings for Tripp's daughter, Addie, called Pluck and Pluck No. 2. The first of the two features three children being carted by a dog chasing a rabbit, while in the second, the children and their cart have crashed due to their reckless pursuit. These paintings, among earlier sketches, forged a relationship between him and photographer, James F. Ryder.

He was the third of four short-lived Later Zhao emperors after the death of his father Shi Hu . He is sometimes referred to by his title prior to becoming emperor, Prince of Yiyang .  Arguably, it was his machinations with his powerful adoptive nephew Shi Min against his brother Shi Zun that finally led to Later Zhao's downfall. Not much is known about Shi Jian prior to his father's death\u2014including who his mother was.  He was created the Prince of Dai in 333 after his father seized power from the founding emperor Shi Le's son Shi Hong in a coup, and after Shi Hu claimed the title \"Heavenly Prince\" in 337, he carried the title Duke of Yiyang.  He was repromoted to prince after his father claimed imperial title in early 349.  In 342, he was mentioned as one of the dukes whose guard corps was reduced by his brother Shi Xuan the crown prince, whose target was however actually Shi Tao the Duke of Qin.  In 345, he was mentioned as the commander of the Guanzhong region, and he imposed heavy taxes and labor burdens; further, he forced officials with long hair to pull out their hair to be made into hat decorations.  After his secretary submitted the hair to Shi Hu, Shi Hu recalled him and replaced him with his brother Shi Bao the Duke of Leping. In 349, after Shi Hu's death and succession by his youngest son, Shi Shi, the regent, Shi Shi's mother Empress Liu, tried to appease both Shi Jian and Shi Zun the Prince of Pengcheng by naming them to high posts.  However, Shi Zun was not placated, and he attacked the capital Yecheng and seized the throne, killing Shi Shi and Empress Dowager Liu.  During Shi Zun's brief administration, Shi Jian was an important member of the administration.  He was one of the princes summoned to a meeting called by Shi Zun before his mother Empress Dowager Zheng in which Shi Zun announced that he was going to execute their powerful adoptive nephew, Shi Min the Duke of Wuxing.  Shi Jian, who had perhaps already been in conspiracy with Shi Min, quickly sent Shi Min the news, and Shi Min surrounded the palace with his troops, capturing and killing Shi Zun.  He made Shi Jian the emperor.  However, actual power were in Shi Min's and his ally Li Nong 's hands. Shi Jian could not endure Shi Min's hold on power, and he sent his brother Shi Bao and the generals Li Song and Zhang Cai against Shi Min, but after they were defeated, Shi Jian pretended as if they acted independently and executed them all.  Another brother of his, Shi Zhi the Prince of Xinxing, then rose in the old capital Xiangguo , in alliance with the Qiang chieftain Yao Yizhong and the Di chieftain Pu Hong against Shi Min and Li Nong.  Shi Jian tried to then have the general Sun Fudu , a fellow Jie, attack Shi Min, but Shi Min quickly defeated him, and Shi Jian, trying to absolve himself, then ordered Shi Min to execute Sun.  Shi Min, however, began to realize that Shi Jian was behind Sun's attack, and he decided that he needed to disarm the Jie, who knew that he was not Jie but ethnically Chinese.  He ordered that all non-Chinese not be allowed to carry arms, and most fled Yecheng in light of the command.  Shi Min put Shi Jian under house arrest with no communication with the outside.  As the non-Chinese tribes continued to flee Yecheng, Shi Min saw that, in particular, the Xiongnu and the Jie would never support him, so he issued an order that if a Chinese killed a Hu and presented the head, he would be rewarded.  Some 200,000 died in the massacre\u2014including many Chinese who had high noses and thick beards. In 350, under duress from Shi Min, Shi Jian changed the name of the state from Zhao to Wei and the family name of the imperial clan from Shi to Li .  Many key officials fled to Shi Zhi.  Local generals throughout the empire effectively became independent, waiting for the war to resolve itself.  As Shi Min was engaging his troops against Shi Zhi's, Shi Jian made one final attempt against him\u2014ordering the general Zhang Shen to, after Shi Min left the capital, attack it.  However, Shi Jian's eunuchs reported this to Shi Min and Li Nong, and they quickly returned to Yecheng and executed Shi Jian, along with 28 grandsons of Shi Hu and the rest of the Shi clan.   Shi Min, restoring his father's original family name of Ran , then took the throne as the emperor of a new state, Wei .  Effectively, Later Zhao was over, although Shi Zhi would hold out at Xiangguo until 351, when he would be killed by his general Liu Xian , finally ending Later Zhao's last hope.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "218_575", "question": "In what city was Alton Montgomery born?", "ctxs": [{"id": "533_49088", "text": "\"The Jacket\" was written by Seinfeld co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and directed by Tom Cherones. The episode's storyline was based on one of David's personal experiences; when he was dating Monica Yates, she wanted him to meet her father, Richard Yates, a respected novelist. David had just bought a suede jacket, and met Richard Yates at the Algonquin Hotel. David stated in an interview that Richard Yates was \"...\u00a0every bit as intimidating as Alton Benes\". His story is similar to what happened in the episode, as, when they headed out to the restaurant, his jacket was ruined by the snow. Additional dialogue at the store where Jerry buys his jacket was cut before broadcast; it featured a reference to Gary Gilmore. The material was later included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. \"The Jacket\" is the only episode in which one of Elaine's parents appears; Louis-Dreyfus once suggested Mary Tyler Moore to portray Elaine's mother, but the character never appeared on the show. The episode also contains the first mention to Elaine's job as a manuscript reader for Pendant Publishing; in early drafts of the script, her job was an optician. Also in early drafts, in the final scene Kramer entered Jerry's house with a dove on his shoulder. The episode was first read by the cast on November 28, 1990 at 10:30 AM. It was filmed in front of a live audience on December 4, 1990. The episode was filmed at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season two premiere \"The Ex-Girlfriend\", all filming for the second season took place. The final scene in the episode, which showed Alton Benes singing \"Master of the House\" in his car, was pre-recorded on December 3, 1990, as it could not be filmed in front of an audience because it took place in a car. Lawrence Tierney was cast as Alton Benes. He was known for his bad-guy roles in films during the 1940s and 1950s, such as Dillinger, The Hoodlum and Born to Kill. Tierney's appearance in the episode is one of his only comedic roles. Cast and crew members were very impressed with his performance. However, they were frightened of him; during filming it was discovered that Tierney had stolen a butcher knife from the knife block in Jerry's apartment set. Various cast members remember Seinfeld encountering Tierney and stating \"Hey Lawrence, what do you got there in your jacket?\" Tierney, realizing he had been caught, tried to make a joke about how he thought taking the knife would be funny, by reenacting a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho , holding the knife above his head and making threatening motions towards Seinfeld. Cherones stated that, afterwards, Larry David would jokingly threaten to have Tierney back on the show if Cherones did his work badly.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was educated at St Paul's School, at Eton College, and at St John's College, Oxford. In 1714, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, where he was inducted by Newton. Rawlinson was a Jacobite and maintained a strong support for the exiled Stuart Royal family throughout his life.  In 1716 was ordained as a Deacon and then priest in the nonjuring Church of England , the ceremony being performed by the non-juring Usager bishop, Jeremy Collier.  Rawlinson was, in 1728, consecrated as a Bishop in the nonjuring church by Bishops Gandy, Blackbourne and Doughty.  On Blackbourne's death in 1741 he became the senior nonjuring Bishop in London and still maintained a congregation into the mid 1740s.  He was particularly concerned with collecting the history and archives of the nonjurors, but later squabbled with his fellow bishops in continuing the succession with the consecration of Robert Gordon. Rawlinson travelled in England and on the continent of Europe, where he passed several years, making very diverse collections of books, manuscripts, pictures and curiosities  of manuscripts, coins and curiosities, his books alone forming three libraries, English, foreign and Classical. Rawlinson was a friend of the antiquarian Thomas Hearne and, among his voluminous writings, published a Life of the antiquary Anthony Wood. Towards the end of his life, Rawlinson quarrelled with both the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. Cutting the Society of Antiquaries from his bequests, he began transferring his collections to the Bodleian. Among his collection was a copperplate known as the Bodleian Plate depicting structures in Williamsburg, Virginia. A series of almanacs in 175 volumes, ranging in date from 1607 to 1747 arrived in 1752\u201355. At his death, Rawlinson left to the Library 5,205 manuscripts bound in volumes that include many rare broadsides and other printed ephemera, his curiosities, and some other property that endowed a professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. The Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon was first appointed in 1795. He was also a benefactor to St John's College, Oxford. He died at Islington, London.

Her mother, Gladys Pearl Baker was from a poor Midwestern family who had migrated to California at the turn of the century. At the age of 15, she married John Newton Baker, an abusive man nine years her senior. They had two children named Robert and Berniece . She successfully filed for divorce and sole custody in 1923, but Baker kidnapped the children soon after and moved with them to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was 12, and met Berniece for the first time as an adult. Following the divorce, Gladys worked as a film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. In 1924, she married Martin Edward Mortensen, but they separated only some months later and divorced in 1928. The identity of Monroe's father is unknown, and she most often used Baker as her surname. Although Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, Monroe's early childhood was stable and happy. Gladys placed her daughter with evangelical Christian foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of Hawthorne. She also lived there for the first six months, until she was forced to move back to the city due to work. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends. In the summer of 1933, Gladys bought a small house in Hollywood with a loan from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation and moved seven-year-old Monroe in with her. They shared the house with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. In January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the Metropolitan State Hospital. She spent the rest of her life in and out of hospitals and was rarely in contact with Monroe. Monroe became a ward of the state, and her mother's friend, Grace Goddard, took responsibility over her and her mother's affairs. In the next four years, Monroe's living situation changed often. For the first 16 months, she continued living with the Atkinsons, and may have been sexually abused during this time. Always a shy girl, she now also developed a stutter and became withdrawn. In the summer of 1935, she briefly stayed with Grace and her husband Erwin \"Doc\" Goddard and two other families. In September 1935, Grace placed her in the Los Angeles Orphans Home. The orphanage was \"a model institution\" and was described in positive terms by her peers, but Monroe felt abandoned. Encouraged by the orphanage staff who thought that Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her legal guardian in 1936, but did not take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937. Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months because Doc molested her. She then lived brief periods with her relatives and Grace's friends and relatives in Los Angeles and Compton. It was Monroe's childhood experiences that first made her want to become an actor: \"I didn't like the world around me because it was kind of grim ... When I heard that this was acting, I said that's what I want to be ... Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I'd sit all day and way into the night. Up in front, there with the screen so big, a little kid all alone, and I loved it.\" Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Lower, in Sawtelle. She was enrolled in Emerson Junior High School and went to weekly Christian Science services with Lower. Monroe was otherwise a mediocre student, but excelled in writing and contributed to the school newspaper. Due to the elderly Lower's health problems, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in Van Nuys in around early 1941. The same year, she began attending Van Nuys High School. In 1942, the company that employed Doc Goddard relocated him to West Virginia. California child protection laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced having to return to the orphanage. As a solution, she married their neighbors' 21-year-old son, factory worker James Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday. Monroe subsequently dropped out of high school and became a housewife. She found herself and Dougherty mismatched and later stated that she was \"dying of boredom\" during the marriage. In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine and was stationed on Santa Catalina Island, where Monroe moved with him.", "hasanswer": false}]}
