The young Mario grew up with an intense love for music, especially opera and art songs. He also showed an early interest for composition, writing his first piece of music at the age of nine. As a teenager, he moved with his parents to C\u00f3rdoba, Veracruz, where he completed his basic education.Talavera then moved to Mexico City and joined the opera company, where he honed his vocal skills and achieved his dream of singing before large audiences opera works as Giacomo Puccini's La boh\u00e8me, that gave him the musical direction he had long coveted, although his main contribution was as a popular music songwriter rather than as an opera singer.During the decade of the 1920s, Talavera was part of several ensembles of traditional Mexican music, toured with the Orquesta T\u00edpica Presidencial, and organized and led various groups. Some of his most popular tunes include Amar en silencio, Arrullo, Bendita seas, China, El Nopal, Flor de Mayo, Jesusita la Vaquera and Muchachita m\u00eda. His most significant work at international level was Gratia Plena, with lyrics by the poet Amado Nervo, which was recorded in 1926 by the famous tenor Jos\u00e9 Mojica.In 1945 Talavera became a founding member of the SACM (Sociedad de Autores y Compositores de M\u00e9xico, for its acronym in Spanish) along with Alberto Dom\u00ednguez, Alfonso Esparza Oteo, Manuel Esper\u00f3n, Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez Esper\u00f3n, Agust\u00edn Lara and Consuelo Vel\u00e1zquez, among others.Talavera died in 1960 in Mexico City from advanced arteriosclerosis at the age of 74.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "639_20", "question": "Who was the composer of Symphony, K. 19b?", "ctxs": [{"id": "639_6096", "text": "The lost Symphony in C major, K. Anh. 222/19b, was probably written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in early 1765 in London. It is one of the twelve symphonies that Ludwig von K\u00f6chel only knew by its incipit in the Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel manuscript catalogue (p. 10, No. 68), which listed it as one of six symphonies (Nos. 65\u201370) sourced from Luigi Gatti (1740\u20131817), Court Kapellmeister in Salzburg from around 1782:\n\nThe instrumentation for the symphony is unknown, but Alfred Einstein speculated that it would have been the same as the contemporary known symphonies K. 16 and K. 19 (strings, 2 oboes, and 2 horns). In his third edition of the K\u00f6chel catalogue, he dated it to early 1765 in London, and opined that the incipit showed the influence of J. C. Bach's symphonies. His remarks were copied unchanged by the sixth edition of the K\u00f6chel catalogue. Neal Zaslaw agreed that the opening was characteristic of J. C. Bach in his book Mozart's Symphonies, but questioned if this was a legitimate method of dating works, given that the seven symphonies of J. C. Bach beginning in this march-like way were written later than Mozart's stay in London, that Mozart himself used similar openings in later works (e.g. in the twenty-sixth symphony, K. 184/161a), and that this style of opening was much used by other composers as well in the period. Thus he opines that a stylistical analysis cannot credibly be performed until the work is rediscovered.\nNevertheless, the wrapper used for the set of parts to enclose the K. 19 symphony in D had been used previously for a symphony in F (K. 19a) and then one in C (possibly K. 19b), as can be seen from the deletions and insertions on the title page, which suggested to Zaslaw that Mozart had written a C major symphony before K. 19 and that K. 19b should receive a lower K\u00f6chel number. Stephen Fischer however pointed out in his 1995 review of Zaslaw's book that the scores were parts rather than full scores, thus not constituting solid evidence for such a chronology. He also speculates that K. 19b may have been the symphony Maria Anna Mozart referred to when she remembered Wolfgang having \"composed his first symphony with all the instruments of the orchestra, especially Trumpets and Kettledrums\" when Leopold was dangerously ill. K. 16, though traditionally numbered as the first symphony, does not have this instrumentation: thus a lost work must be referred to. Though Zaslaw identified it with a possible E\u266d major symphony (\"No. 0\") possibly derived from pieces in the London Sketchbook (K. 15a\u201315ss), Fischer believed that the use of trumpets and timpani would be more likely for a C major symphony like K. 19b. Though the wrapper for K. 19 does not mention trumpets nor timpani, he notes that the set of parts was originally for an F-major symphony (K. 19a) and that Leopold may not have deemed it necessary to change the list of parts.\nThe authenticity of this symphony is more credibly shown by the source attribution to Gatti in the Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel manuscript catalogue, making it plausible that it was among the six sent to Donaueschingen by Leopold Mozart in 1767.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The game takes place over the course of a week, and consists of the player reading the story, occasionally making choices that affect the direction of the plot; on the sixth day, one of the characters dies, and the game moves back in time to the beginning, letting the player use knowledge from the first set of six days to make new choices, to try to prevent the death.\nThe game was directed by Takumi Nakazawa, planned and written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, and composed for by Takeshi Abo. Uchikoshi included science fiction elements, but was unable to make heavy use of them, as his superiors at KID thought that the game needed to focus on cute female characters in order to perform well commercially. Abo composed music based on his first impressions of reading the game's story, with a focus on its \"emotional flow\".

It was broadcast on TV Tokyo from October 1995 to March 1996. Evangelion is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm called the Second Impact, particularly in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3. The protagonist is Shinji Ikari, a teenage boy recruited by his father Gendo to the mysterious organization Nerv to pilot a giant biomechanical mecha called an Evangelion and fight against beings known as Angels.\nThe series explores the experiences and emotions of the Evangelion pilots and Nerv's members as they fight to prevent Angels from causing more cataclysms. In the process, they are called upon to understand the ultimate cause of events and the motives behind human action. The series has been described as a deconstruction of the mecha genre, and features archetypal imagery derived from Shinto cosmology as well as Jewish and Christian mystical traditions, including Midrashic tales and Kabbalah. The psychoanalytic accounts of human behavior put forward by Freud and Jung are also prominently featured.Neon Genesis Evangelion received critical acclaim, being widely considered one of the greatest anime series of all time, but was also subject to controversy. Particular controversy centered on its final two episodes, as the ending was deemed confusing and abstract to many viewers and critics alike. In 1997, Hideaki Anno and Gainax released the feature film The End of Evangelion, which serves as an alternate ending replacing the final two episodes. A series of four films, titled Rebuild of Evangelion, retelling the events of the series with different plot elements and a new ending, were released between 2007 and 2021.

He wrote the song in 1968 following the Beatles' Transcendental Meditation course in India with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an activity that he had led the group into undertaking. The lyrics serve as a response to the recrimination Harrison received from his bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney in the aftermath to the group's public falling out with the Maharishi, and as the Beatles launched their multimedia company Apple Corps. The band recorded the song amid the tensions that characterised the sessions for their 1968 double LP The Beatles (also known as the \"White Album\"). The track was completed in August 1968 but not included on the release.\nHarrison revisited \"Not Guilty\" in early 1978, shortly after participating in the Rutles' television satire of the Beatles' history, All You Need Is Cash. In contrast to the atmosphere surrounding the song's creation, this period was one of personal contentment for Harrison, who enjoyed the opportunity to debunk the myths surrounding his former band. The musical arrangement similarly differs in mood from the 1968 version; where the latter features distorted electric guitars and harpsichord, Harrison's version reflects his adoption of a mellow jazz-pop style. The other musicians on the recording include Neil Larsen and Willie Weeks.\n\"Not Guilty\" was known to be a Beatles outtake but the song was unheard by the public until the release of Harrison's 1979 album. The Beatles' version continued to be the subject of speculation among collectors. An edit of the band's recording was prepared for the aborted Sessions album in 1984 and became available on bootlegs before its official release on the Beatles' Anthology 3 outtakes compilation in 1996. The full version of the track, together with Harrison's May 1968 demo of the song, appears on the 50th Anniversary Edition box-set release of The Beatles.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He and producer Donald Kushner set up an animation studio to develop Tron with the intention of making it an animated film. To promote the studio itself, Lisberger and his team created a 30-second animation featuring the first appearance of the title character. Eventually, Lisberger decided to include live-action elements with both backlit and computer animation for the actual feature-length film. Various studios had rejected the storyboards for the film before Walt Disney Productions agreed to finance and distribute Tron. There, backlit animation was finally combined with the 2D computer animation and the live action.\nTron was released on July 9, 1982. The film was a moderate success at the box office, and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its groundbreaking visuals and acting but criticized its storyline as being incoherent. Tron received nominations for Best Costume Design and Best Sound at the 55th Academy Awards. It was however disqualified from the Best Visual Effects category because at the time the Academy felt that using computer animation was \"cheating\". Tron spawned multiple video games (including an arcade tie-in released shortly after the film), and as it became a cult film, a multimedia franchise including comic books. A sequel titled Tron: Legacy, directed by Joseph Kosinski, was released in 2010, with Bridges and Boxleitner reprising their roles and Lisberger acting as producer. This was followed by the XD animated series Tron: Uprising in 2012, set between the two films.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The original cast also included Francesco Bernardi who was known as Senesino.\nHandel had originally planned Alessandro to be his first contribution to the 1725/1726 season of the Royal Academy. However, Bordoni did not arrive in London in time to stage Alessandro, and Handel substituted his own Scipione in March and April 1726 until her arrival. The opera received its first performance on 5 May 1726 at the King's Theatre, London, and was received \"with great applause\".The story recounts Alexander the Great's journey to India and depicts him less in a heroic vein than as vainglorious as well as indecisive in matters of the heart.

It became a no. 2 chart hit for Jimmy Dorsey in 1957.\nThe version by Carl Ravell and his Orchestra, from a session on 4 June 1937, was the earliest recording of the song, although it is unclear whether it was the first released version.  The earliest popular versions of \"So Rare\" were the 1937 releases by Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians and by Gus Arnheim and his Coconut Grove Orchestra.Before it had been recorded or even published, Fred Astaire had sung \"So Rare\" on his radio show The Packard Hour. This was the recollection of Jess Oppenheimer, then a writer for the show, who recommended the song on behalf of his friend Jerry Herst, then an \"aspiring songwriter\". According to Oppenheimer, this led to \"So Rare\" being \"snapped up by a publisher who heard it on the program\".Since 1937, \"So Rare\" has been recorded by numerous artists, but it notably became a late-career hit in 1957 for Jimmy Dorsey, reaching #2 on Billboard magazine's pop charts, and #4 on the R&B singles chart.  Recorded on 11 November 1956 and released on the Cincinnati label Fraternity, Jimmy Dorsey's version, which had a decidedly rhythm and blues feel unlike the earlier versions, became the highest-charting song by a big band during the first decade of the rock and roll era. Credited on the label to \"Jimmy Dorsey with Orchestra and Chorus\", the vocals are by the Artie Malvin Singers. Billboard ranked this version as the No. 5 song for 1957.Less than two months after \"So Rare\" became a hit, Jimmy Dorsey died from lung cancer.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The film's director, Otto Preminger, had originally wanted to use Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Lady\" as the theme, but Raksin was not convinced that it was suitable. Angered, Preminger gave Raksin one weekend to compose an alternative melody. Raksin later said, and maintained for the rest of his days, that when, over that weekend, his wife sent him a \"Dear John\" letter, the haunting theme seemed to write itself.The lyrics were written by Johnny Mercer after the film made the tune popular, so he had to title the song \"Laura\". According to Mercer, he had not yet seen the movie when he wrote the lyrics but was aware that it was a romantic, somewhat haunting story.\nLaura is the face in the misty light, footsteps that you hear down the hall\nThe laugh that floats on the summer night that you can never quite recall\nAnd you see Laura on a train that is passing through, those eyes how familiar they seem\nShe gave your very first kiss to you, that was Laura but she's only a dreamThe song became a jazz standard and has been recorded more than 400 times.

The song is one of the most famous of the Second World War era, and resonated with servicemen going off to fight as well as their families and loved ones.\nThe song was published by Michael Ross Limited, whose directors included Louis Carris, Ross Parker and Norman Keen. Keen, an English pianist also collaborated with Parker and Hughie Charles on \"We'll Meet Again\" and many other songs published by the company, including \"There'll Always Be an England\" and \"I'm In Love For The Last Time\". The song's original recording featured Lynn accompanied by Arthur Young on Hammond Novachord (an early electronic keyboard), while a rerecording in 1953 featured a more lavish instrumentation and a chorus of British Armed Forces personnel.The song gave its name to the 1943 musical film We'll Meet Again in which Lynn played the lead role (see 1943 in music). Lynn's 1953 recording is featured in the final scene of Stanley Kubrick's 1964 film Dr. Strangelove \u2013 with a bitter irony, as the song accompanies a nuclear holocaust that wipes out humanity. It was also used in the closing scenes of the 1986 BBC television serial The Singing Detective. British director John Schlesinger used the song in his 1979 World War II film Yanks, which is about British citizens and American soldiers during the military buildup in the UK as the Allies prepare for the Normandy landings.\nDuring the Cold War, Lynn's recording was included in the package of music and programmes held in 20 underground radio stations of the BBC's Wartime Broadcasting Service (WTBS), designed to provide public information and morale-boosting broadcasts for 100 days after a nuclear attack. The song reached number 29 on the U.S. charts. Lynn sang the song in London on the 60th anniversary of VE Day in 2005.\nIn April 2020, a charity duet with Katherine Jenkins, released in 2014, reached number 72 on the UK Singles Chart, with proceeds going to National Health Service charities.

{"id": "639_721", "question": "Who was the composer of Secret of Mana?", "ctxs": [{"id": "91_38375", "text": "Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, the creator of the game's Game Boy predecessor, Final Fantasy Adventure. He has stated that he feels Secret of Mana is more \"his game\" than other projects he has worked on, such as the Final Fantasy series. The game was programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka. The team hoped to build on the foundation of Final Fantasy Adventure, and they included several modified elements from that game and from other popular Square titles in Secret of Mana. In addition to having better graphics and sound quality than its predecessor, the attack power gauge was changed to be more engaging, and the weapon leveling system replaced Final Fantasy Adventure's system of leveling up the speed of the attack gauge. The party system also received an upgrade from the first Mana game: instead of temporary companions who could not be upgraded, party members became permanent protagonists and could be controlled by other players. The multiplayer component was not a part of the original design, but was added when the developers realized that they could easily make all three characters human-controlled.The real-time battle system used in Secret of Mana has been described by its creators as an extension of the battle system used in the first three flagship Final Fantasy titles. The system for experience points and leveling up was taken from Final Fantasy III. According to Tanaka, the game's battle system features mechanics that had first been considered for Final Fantasy IV. Similarly, unused features in Secret of Mana were appropriated by the Chrono Trigger team, which (like Final Fantasy IV) was in production at the time. According to Tanaka, the project was originally intended to be Final Fantasy IV, with a \"more action-based, dynamic overworld\". However, it \"wound up not being\" Final Fantasy IV anymore, but instead became a separate project codenamed \"Chrono Trigger\" during development, before finally becoming Seiken Densetsu 2. Tanaka said that it \"always felt like a sequel\" to Final Fantasy III for him.Secret of Mana was originally planned to be a launch title for the SNES-CD add-on. After the contract between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add-on failed, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the competing PlayStation console, Square adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format. The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES game cartridge, which is much smaller than that of a CD-ROM. The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, believing that too much of the game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone. One of the most significant changes was the removal of the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product. The plot that remained was different from the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone. Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game. Secret of Mana was announced as being released in July 1993 as recently as that April, marketed as a \"Party Action RPG\", before eventually being released in August instead for the Japanese market. In South Korea, it was released the same month in August 1993.The English translation for Secret of Mana was completed in only 30 days, mere weeks after the Japanese release, and the North American localization was initially advertised as Final Fantasy Adventure 2. Critics have suggested that the translation was done hastily so that the game could be released in North America for the 1993 holiday season. According to translator Ted Woolsey, a large portion of the game's script was cut out in the English localization due to space limitations. To display text on the main gameplay screen, the English translation uses a fixed-width font, which limits the amount of space available to display text. Woolsey was unhappy that he had to trim conversations to their bare essentials and that he had so little time for translation, commenting that it \"nearly killed me\". The script was difficult to translate as it was presented to Woolsey in disordered groups of text, like \"shuffling a novel\". Other localizations were done in German and French. The Japanese release only named the three protagonists in the manual, while Western versions omitted the characters' names until the enhanced port on the iOS.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The first performance was at the Mendelssohn family home on 26 December 1829 before an audience of 120. As the composer considered the work a piece for a strictly private occasion, it was not published in his lifetime, despite his mother's urgings to the contrary, and no public performance took place until a production, two years after the composer's death, in Leipzig on 10 April 1851; the first performance in England was also in 1851, for which Chorley's translation was written.Mendelssohn himself conducted the first, private production, and all the roles were assumed by family members or associates of the composer, only one of whom, tenor Eduard Mantius, was a professional singer.

Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.\nCritics praised The Secret of Monkey Island for its humor, audiovisuals, and gameplay. Several publications list it among the greatest video games of all time. The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the Monkey Island series.

This AABA structure puts it in the thirty-two-bar format of American popular song.\nThe piano-and-bass introduction for the piece was written by Gil Evans for Bill Evans (no relation) and Paul Chambers on Kind of Blue. An orchestrated version by Gil Evans of this introduction is later to be found on a television broadcast given by Miles' first quintet (minus Cannonball Adderley who was ill that day) and the Gil Evans Orchestra; the orchestra gave the introduction, after which the quintet played the rest of \"So What\". The use of the double bass to play the central theme makes the piece unusual. This arrangement was later performed and recorded as part of the album Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall. \nWhile the track is taken at a very moderate tempo on Kind of Blue, it is played at a speedy tempo on later live recordings by the quintet, such as Miles Davis & John Coltrane The Final Tour: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 6, and even faster by Miles Davis's second quintet in the mid 1960's for example on Four & More.\nThe distinctive voicing employed by Bill Evans for the chords that interject the head: from the bottom up, three notes at intervals of a perfect fourth followed by a major third, has been given the name \"So What chord\" (shown below) by such theorists as Mark Levine.\n\nThe same chord structure was later used by John Coltrane for his standard \"Impressions\".

Harrison suspended work on the song, believing that with the tune having come to him so easily, it might have been a melody from another song. In I, Me, Mine, he wrote that the middle eight \"took some time to sort out\".The opening lyric was taken from the title of \"Something in the Way She Moves\", a track by James Taylor, another Apple Records artist. While Harrison imagined the composition in the style of Ray Charles, his inspiration for \"Something\" was his wife, Pattie Boyd. In her 2007 autobiography, Wonderful Today, Boyd recalls: \"He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful ...\" Boyd discusses the song's popularity among other recording artists and concludes: \"My favourite [version] was the one by George Harrison, which he played to me in the kitchen at Kinfauns.\"Having begun to write love songs that were directed at both God and a woman, with his White Album track \"Long, Long, Long\", Harrison later cited alternative sources for his inspiration for \"Something\". In early 1969, according to author Joshua Greene, Harrison told his friends from the Hare Krishna Movement that the song was about the Hindu deity Krishna; in an interview with Rolling Stone in 1976, he said of his approach to writing love songs: \"all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in her that you see.\" By 1996, Harrison had denied writing \"Something\" for Boyd. That year, he told a music journalist that \"everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie\" because of the promotional film accompanying the release of the Beatles' recording, which showed the couple together.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This AABA structure puts it in the thirty-two-bar format of American popular song.\nThe piano-and-bass introduction for the piece was written by Gil Evans for Bill Evans (no relation) and Paul Chambers on Kind of Blue. An orchestrated version by Gil Evans of this introduction is later to be found on a television broadcast given by Miles' first quintet (minus Cannonball Adderley who was ill that day) and the Gil Evans Orchestra; the orchestra gave the introduction, after which the quintet played the rest of \"So What\". The use of the double bass to play the central theme makes the piece unusual. This arrangement was later performed and recorded as part of the album Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall. \nWhile the track is taken at a very moderate tempo on Kind of Blue, it is played at a speedy tempo on later live recordings by the quintet, such as Miles Davis & John Coltrane The Final Tour: The Bootleg Series, Vol. 6, and even faster by Miles Davis's second quintet in the mid 1960's for example on Four & More.\nThe distinctive voicing employed by Bill Evans for the chords that interject the head: from the bottom up, three notes at intervals of a perfect fourth followed by a major third, has been given the name \"So What chord\" (shown below) by such theorists as Mark Levine.\n\nThe same chord structure was later used by John Coltrane for his standard \"Impressions\".
