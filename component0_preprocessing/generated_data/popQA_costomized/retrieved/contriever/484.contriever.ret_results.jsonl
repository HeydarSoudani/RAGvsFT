Simpson also highlighted the distinction between tempo and mode. \"Tempo\" encompasses \"evolutionary rates \u2026 their acceleration and deceleration, the conditions of exceptionally slow or rapid evolutions, and phenomena suggestive of inertia and momentum,\" while \"mode\" embraces \"the study of the way, manner, or pattern of evolution, a study in which tempo is a basic factor, but which embraces considerably more than tempo.\"\nSimpson's Tempo and Mode attempted to draw out several distinct generalizations:\n\nEvolution's tempo can impart information about its mode.\nMultiple tempos can be found in the fossil record: horotelic (medium tempo), bradytelic (slow tempo), and tachytelic (rapid tempo).\nThe facts of paleontology are consistent with the genetical theory of natural selection. Moreover, theories such as orthogenesis, Lamarckism, mutation pressures, and macromutations either are false or play little to no role.\nMost evolution\u2014\"nine-tenths\"\u2014occurs by the steady phyletic transformation of whole lineages (anagenesis). This contrasts with Ernst Mayr's interpretation of speciation by splitting, particularly  allopatric and peripatric speciation.\nThe lack of evidence for evolutionary transitions in the fossil record is best accounted for, first, by the poorness of the geological record, and, second, as a consequence of quantum evolution (which is responsible for \"the origin of taxonomic units of relatively high rank, such as families, orders, and classes\"). Quantum evolution built upon Sewall Wright's theory of random genetic drift.Tempo and Mode earned Simpson the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1944. Fifty years after its publication, the National Academy of Sciences commissioned a book entitled Tempo and Mode in Evolution: Genetics and Paleontology 50 Years After Simpson edited by Walter M.

It was republished in 1916 in Sandburg's first mainstream collection of poems, also titled Chicago Poems.\nSandburg moved to Chicago in 1912 after living in Milwaukee, where he had served as secretary to Emil Seidel, Milwaukee's Socialist mayor. Harriet Monroe, a fellow resident of Chicago, had founded the magazine Poetry in 1912.  Monroe liked and encouraged Sandburg's plain-speaking free verse style, strongly reminiscent of Walt Whitman.  Chicago Poems established Sandburg as a major figure in contemporary literature.Sandburg has described the poem as\na chant of defiance by Chicago... its defiance of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, London, Paris, Berlin and Rome. The poem sort of says \"Maybe we ain't got culture, but we're eatin' regular.\"\nThe Chicago Poems and its follow-up volumes of verse, Cornhuskers (1918) and Smoke and Steel (1920), represent Sandburg's attempts to create an American version of social realism, writing expansive verse in praise of American agriculture and industry. All of these tendencies are manifest in \"Chicago\" itself. Then as now, the city of Chicago was a hub of commodities trading and a key financial center for agricultural markets. The city was also a center of the meat-packing industry and an important railroad hub; these industries are also mentioned in the poem.\nOne of Chicago's many nicknames, \"City of the Big Shoulders,\" is taken from the poem's fifth line.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The exact date of its composition is unknown, but it is probable that Donne wrote this poem in the 1590s when he was a young law student at Lincoln's Inn, before he became a respected religious figure as Dean of St Paul's Cathedral. The poem uses the conceit of a flea, which has sucked blood from the male speaker and his female lover, to serve as an extended metaphor for the relationship between them. The speaker tries to convince a lady to sleep with him, arguing that if their blood mingling in the flea is innocent, then sexual mingling would also be innocent. His argument hinges on the belief that bodily fluids mix during sexual intercourse.According to Laurence Perrine, this poem, along with many other of Donne's poems, solidifies his place in the literary movement, creating what is now known as metaphysical poetry. Although the term was not found until after his death, it is still widely used and will continue to be traced back to work such as \"The Flea\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

Events such as the Uruguayan military coup forced Galeano into exile in Spain and Argentina; these exiles, in particular, may have been formative in Galeano's life and writing. The ruminations of this book were formed as a result of Galeano's desire to remember the past traumas and as well as to learn from them. Within this piece of nonfiction, he explores themes such as modern education systems, racism, sexism, poverty, economics, work, and societal fear. The pretense of the prose tends to be preoccupied with learning to rethink the contradictions of society; in a moment when outrageous circumstances are normalized, it is time to reconsider the understandings many people hold, which, in turn, informs the way such people view things. Though focusing on Latin America, Galeano uses what he has learned from the political and social environment within Latin America to understand injustices and social dynamics throughout the rest of the world.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Initially published in the United States by the Zuccotti Park Press as the first title in their Occupied Media Pamphlet Series in 2012, it was subsequently republished in the United Kingdom by Penguin Books later that year.\nAn academic linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Chomsky first achieved fame for his work as a political activist during the 1960s and 1970s. A libertarian socialist, Chomsky is a prominent critic of capitalism, the role of western media and the foreign policy of the U.S. government, dealing with such issues in bestsellers like Manufacturing Consent (1988), Hegemony or Survival (2003) and Failed States (2006). With the birth of the Occupy Movement \u2013 devoted to socio-political change \u2013 in 2011, Chomsky became a vocal supporter for the protesters, writing articles and giving speeches on their behalf, several of which were collected together and published as Occupy.\nThe book opens with an introductory editor's note by Greg Ruggiero, praising the Occupy movement and its potential for the greater democratization of society. This is followed by the text to Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, which he gave at Occupy Boston in Massachusetts. The third part of the book comprises Chomsky's interview with the New York University student Edward Radzivilovskiy, while the fourth contains the text of the InterOccupy conference call with Chomsky by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela. Part five offers an interview with Chomsky undertaken at the University of Maryland, while the book is rounded off by Chomsky's tribute to the late activist Howard Zinn and the National Lawyers Guild's legal advice to Occupy protesters.\nThroughout the book, Chomsky discusses what the Occupy movement is and what it is demanding, as well as advocating ways in which it could gain greater support and achieve governmental reforms, using historical examples as evidence.

The combined work divides the history of first-century Christianity into three stages, with the gospel making up the first two of these \u2013 the life of Jesus the Messiah from his birth to the beginning of his mission in the meeting with John the Baptist, followed by his ministry with events such as the Sermon on the Plain and its Beatitudes, and his Passion, death, and resurrection. \nMost modern scholars agree that the main sources used for Luke were a), the Gospel of Mark, b), a hypothetical sayings collection called the Q source, and c), material found in no other gospels, often referred to as the L (for Luke) source. The author is anonymous; the traditional view that Luke the Evangelist was the companion of Paul is still occasionally put forward, but the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters. The most probable date for its composition is around AD 80\u2013110, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The essay was possibly withheld because of the impending Wilde scandal. A Peep into the Past was never published in The Yellow Book. In 1894 Wilde was at the height of his fame.\nIn A Peep into the Past Beerbohm portrays Wilde as a staid old gentleman with a somewhat suspicious procession of page-boys passing backwards and forwards through his neighbourhood in Chelsea: \"Once a welcome guest in many of our Bohemian haunts, he lives a life of quiet retirement in his little house in Tite Street with his wife and two sons, his prop and mainstay, solacing himself with many a reminiscence of the friends of his youth\"... \"The old gentleman\" (Wilde was 39) continues to write; indeed, he \"has not yet abandoned his old intention of dramatising Salome...\"A cutting commentary on Wilde's club life, Beerbohm writes, \"He never nowadays even looks at the morning papers, so wholly has he cut himself off from the society, though he still goes on taking the Athenaeum, in the hopes that it may even now do the same to him.\" In 1894 The Athenaeum was London's premier club for eminent men of letters and science.

It tells how a group of leading French citizens, men and women included, joined together to form an unusual group, The Society of Mutual Autopsy, with the aim of proving that souls do not exist. The idea was that, after death, they would dissect each other and (hopefully) show a direct relationship between brain shapes and sizes and the character, abilities and intelligence of individuals. The book argues that this strange scientific pact, and anthropology itself, which the group's members helped to develop, had its genesis in aggressive, evangelical atheism.Essentially, The End of the Soul is a study of science and atheism in France in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. It illustrates how anthropology grew in the context of an impassioned struggle between the forces of tradition, especially the Catholic faith, and those of a more freethinking modernism, and posits that it became for many a secular religion. Among the figures discussed are novelist \u00c9mile Zola, statesman Leon Gambetta, American birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, and Arthur Conan Doyle.The End of the Soul received the Ralph Waldo Emerson Award for 2004 from the Phi Beta Kappa Society as a book that \"is an important contribution to knowledge, serious scholarship with a broad pertinence to the human condition.\"\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

The title refers to a more worldly and rationalist worldview, represented by a ball or sphere, and the cross representing Christianity. The first chapters of the book were serialized from 1905 to 1906 with the completed work published in 1909. The novel's beginning involves debates about rationalism and religion between a Professor Lucifer and a monk named Michael. A part of this section was quoted in Pope John Paul I's Illustrissimi letter to G. K. Chesterton. Much of the rest of the book concerns the dueling, figurative and somewhat more literal, of a Jacobite Catholic named Evan Maclan and an atheist Socialist named James Turnbull. Lynette Hunter has argued that the novel is more sympathetic to Maclan, but does indicate Maclan is also presented as in some ways too extreme. Turnbull, as well, is presented in a sympathetic light: both duelists are ready to fight for and die for their antagonistic opinions and, in doing so, develop a certain partnership that evolves into a friendship. The real antagonist is the world outside, which desperately tries to prevent from happening a duel over \"mere religion\" (a subject both duelists judge of utmost importance).\nMany have seen echoes in the novel of Chesterton's own longstanding and very public debates over religion with his friend, George Bernard Shaw.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The novel takes place between the 1910s and 1960s, and covers many of the United States' military involvements during that period. Once an Eagle tells the story of Sam Damon, career Army officer, from his initial enlistment as a private to his rise to general officer rank. Damon is an honorable soldier who rises in rank by success in field command, and cares for the welfare of his troops. His career is contrasted with that of another soldier, Courtney Massengale, who has no honor, no concern for his troops, and rises in rank through staff positions by cunning and political connections. As the two rise in the ranks together, they frequently clash in their views.\nA No. 1 New York Times Bestseller, Once an Eagle has been a favorite of American military men and women since its writing. The book appears on the Commandant's required reading list for all Staff Sergeants and Gunnery Sergeants in the United States Marine Corps, and frequently serves as a text for cadets in leadership classes at West Point.\nA television miniseries based on the book was aired on NBC in 1976, with actor Sam Elliott portraying Sam Damon.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Appearing in the November 26, 1919 issue of The Mississippian, a literary magazine at the University of Mississippi, \"Landing in Luck\" tells the story of Cadet Thompson, who is sent on a solo flight without adequate instruction.  Thompson lands successfully, and his flight instructor, Bessing, takes credit for the fine job he did of teaching the cadet pilot.  It is a fictional exaggeration based on Faulkner's experience as a cadet-pilot for the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1918.\nThe setting of the story is likely Leaside Aerodrome in Toronto, Ontario. While a student at the School of Military Aeronautics at the University of Toronto in 1918, Faulkner had many opportunities to observe the operations at this airfield.Opinion varies on the quality of \"Landing in Luck:; biographer Stephen B. Oates calls it \"amusing\", while another biographer labels the story \"generic\" and \"without real depth\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "484_282", "question": "Who is the author of Female Serial Killers?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_11364", "text": "Female Serial Killers: How and Why Women Become Monsters  is a non-fiction true crime history by Peter Vronsky, a criminal justice historian. It surveys the history of female serial killers and female-perpetrated serial homicide and its culture, psychopathology, and investigation from the Roman Empire to the mid 2000s.The book describes historical cases of female-perpetrated serial murder from early recorded instances in ancient Rome to medieval and Renaissance Europe and Victorian Britain and its rise and escalation in the United States and the world in the postmodern era. Vronsky's central contention is that female serial killers, while exhibiting different forensic 'signatures' from male counterparts, inevitably kill for the same reasons that male offenders do: for power and control. The major difference, according to Vronsky, between female and male serial killers is that females (unless partnered with a male offender) tend not to sexually assault or physically mutilate their victims.Vronsky cites statistics indicating that nearly one in six (16 percent) of serial killers apprehended in the United States since 1820 was a female, either acting alone or as a partner of a male or female offender. Vronsky argues that, contrary to popular belief, female serial killers prefer to murder their male intimates or family members, while recent data indicate that currently female serial killers marginally prefer strangers as victims and that historically in the United States, 53 percent of female serial killers had murdered at least one adult female, and 32 percent at least one female child.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was founded by Marcus Morris, an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Morris edited a Southport parish magazine called The Anvil, but felt that the church was not communicating its message effectively. Simultaneously disillusioned with contemporary children's literature, he and Anvil artist Frank Hampson created a dummy comic based on Christian values. Morris proposed the idea to several Fleet Street publishers, with little success, until Hulton Press took it on.\nFollowing a huge publicity campaign, the first issue of Eagle was released in April 1950. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, created by Hampson with meticulous attention to detail. Other popular stories included Riders of the Range and P.C. 49. Eagle also contained news and sport sections, and educational cutaway diagrams of sophisticated machinery. A members club was created, and a range of related merchandise was licensed for sale.\nAmidst a takeover of the periodical's publisher and a series of acrimonious disputes, Morris left in 1959; Hampson followed shortly thereafter. Although Eagle continued in various forms, a perceived lowering of editorial standards preceded plummeting sales, and it was eventually subsumed by its rival, Lion, in 1969. Eagle was relaunched in 1982 and ran for over 500 issues before being dropped by its publisher in 1994.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Harriet Monroe, a fellow resident of Chicago, had founded the magazine Poetry in 1912.  Monroe liked and encouraged Sandburg's plain-speaking free verse style, strongly reminiscent of Walt Whitman.  Chicago Poems established Sandburg as a major figure in contemporary literature.Sandburg has described the poem as\na chant of defiance by Chicago... its defiance of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, London, Paris, Berlin and Rome. The poem sort of says \"Maybe we ain't got culture, but we're eatin' regular.\"\nThe Chicago Poems and its follow-up volumes of verse, Cornhuskers (1918) and Smoke and Steel (1920), represent Sandburg's attempts to create an American version of social realism, writing expansive verse in praise of American agriculture and industry. All of these tendencies are manifest in \"Chicago\" itself. Then as now, the city of Chicago was a hub of commodities trading and a key financial center for agricultural markets.

In the Gospel, authorship is internally credited to the \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" (\u1f41 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u1f74\u03c2 \u1f43\u03bd \u1f20\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u03b1 \u1f41 \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, o math\u0113t\u0113s on \u0113gapa o I\u0113sous) in John 20:2. John 21:24 claims that the Gospel of John is based on the written testimony of the \"Beloved Disciple\". The authorship of some Johannine literature has been debated since about the year 200.In his 4th century Ecclesiastical History, Eusebius says that the First Epistle of John and the Gospel of John are widely agreed upon as his. However, Eusebius mentions that the consensus is that the second and third epistles of John are not his but were written by some other John. Eusebius also goes to some length to establish with the reader that there is no general consensus regarding the revelation of John. The revelation of John could only be what is now called the Book of Revelation. The Gospel according to John differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, which were likely written decades earlier. The bishops of Asia Minor supposedly requested him to write his gospel to deal with the heresy of the Ebionites, who asserted that Christ did not exist before Mary. John probably knew of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, but these gospels spoke of Jesus primarily in the year following the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist. Around 600, however, Sophronius of Jerusalem noted that \"two epistles bearing his name ... are considered by some to be the work of a certain John the Elder\" and, while stating that Revelation was written by John of Patmos, it was \"later translated by Justin Martyr and Irenaeus,\" presumably in an attempt to reconcile tradition with the obvious differences in Greek style.\nUntil the 19th century, the authorship of the Gospel of John had been attributed to the Apostle John. However, most modern critical scholars have their doubts. Some scholars place the Gospel of John somewhere between AD 65 and 85; John Robinson proposes an initial edition by 50\u201355 and then a final edition by 65 due to narrative similarities with Paul.:\u200app.284,\u200a307\u200a Other scholars are of the opinion that the Gospel of John was composed in two or three stages.:\u200ap.43\u200a Most contemporary scholars consider that the Gospel was not written until the latter third of the first century AD, and with the earliest possible date of AD 75\u201380: \"...a date of AD 75\u201380 as the earliest possible date of composition for this Gospel.\" Other scholars think that an even later date, perhaps even the last decade of the first century AD right up to the start of the 2nd century (i.e. 90 \u2013 100), is applicable.Nonetheless, today many theological scholars continue to accept the traditional authorship. Colin G. Kruse states that since John the Evangelist has been named consistently in the writings of early Church Fathers, \"it is hard to pass by this conclusion, despite widespread reluctance to accept it by many, but by no means all, modern scholars.\"Modern, mainstream Bible scholars generally assert that the Gospel of John has been  written by an anonymous author.Regarding whether the author of the Gospel of John was an eyewitness, according to Paul N. Anderson, the gospel \"contains more direct claims to eyewitness origins than any of the other Gospel traditions.\" F. F. Bruce argues that 19:35 contains an \"emphatic and explicit claim to eyewitness authority.\" The gospel nowhere claims to have been written by direct witnesses to the reported events.Mainstream Bible scholars assert that all four gospels from the New Testament are fundamentally anonymous and most of mainstream scholars agree that these gospels have not been written by eyewitnesses. As The New Oxford Annotated Bible (2018) has put it, \"Scholars generally agree that the Gospels were written forty to sixty years after the death of Jesus.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

George hits his head when they get there and experiences past memories as if they were present, each occurring on the first day of a new season, and each corresponding to a new \"season\" of George's life.The novel's title is taken from the final scene of Shakespeare's final play, The Tempest.

Harriet Monroe, a fellow resident of Chicago, had founded the magazine Poetry in 1912.  Monroe liked and encouraged Sandburg's plain-speaking free verse style, strongly reminiscent of Walt Whitman.  Chicago Poems established Sandburg as a major figure in contemporary literature.Sandburg has described the poem as\na chant of defiance by Chicago... its defiance of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, London, Paris, Berlin and Rome. The poem sort of says \"Maybe we ain't got culture, but we're eatin' regular.\"\nThe Chicago Poems and its follow-up volumes of verse, Cornhuskers (1918) and Smoke and Steel (1920), represent Sandburg's attempts to create an American version of social realism, writing expansive verse in praise of American agriculture and industry. All of these tendencies are manifest in \"Chicago\" itself. Then as now, the city of Chicago was a hub of commodities trading and a key financial center for agricultural markets.

It was founded by Marcus Morris, an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Morris edited a Southport parish magazine called The Anvil, but felt that the church was not communicating its message effectively. Simultaneously disillusioned with contemporary children's literature, he and Anvil artist Frank Hampson created a dummy comic based on Christian values. Morris proposed the idea to several Fleet Street publishers, with little success, until Hulton Press took it on.\nFollowing a huge publicity campaign, the first issue of Eagle was released in April 1950. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, created by Hampson with meticulous attention to detail. Other popular stories included Riders of the Range and P.C. 49. Eagle also contained news and sport sections, and educational cutaway diagrams of sophisticated machinery. A members club was created, and a range of related merchandise was licensed for sale.\nAmidst a takeover of the periodical's publisher and a series of acrimonious disputes, Morris left in 1959; Hampson followed shortly thereafter. Although Eagle continued in various forms, a perceived lowering of editorial standards preceded plummeting sales, and it was eventually subsumed by its rival, Lion, in 1969. Eagle was relaunched in 1982 and ran for over 500 issues before being dropped by its publisher in 1994.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The book is a long and detailed examination of one short translation of a minor French poem and, through that, an examination of the mysteries of translation (and indeed more generally, language and consciousness) itself.  Hofstadter himself refers to it as \"my ruminations on the art of translation\".\nThe title itself is a pun, revealing many of the themes of the work: le ton beau means \u2018the beautiful tone\u2019 or \u2018the sweet tone\u2019, but the word order is unusual for French. It would be more common to write le beau ton. A French speaker hearing the title spoken ([l\u0259 t\u0254\u0303 bo d\u0259 ma.\u0281o]) would be more likely to interpret it as le tombeau de Marot; where tombeau may mean \u2018tomb\u2019 (as per the cover picture), but also tombeau, \u2018a work of art (literature or music) done in memory and homage to a deceased person\u2019 (the title is intended to parallel the title of Maurice Ravel's Le Tombeau de Couperin). In a further play on the title, Hofstadter refers to his deceased wife Carol, to whom the book is dedicated, as ma rose (\"my rose\"), and to himself as ton beau (\"your dear\").\nAt the surface level, the book treats the difficulties and rewards of translating works (particularly poetry) from one language to another. Diverse translations (usually to English) of a short poem in Renaissance French, Cl\u00e9ment Marot's A une Damoyselle malade (referred to as \u2018Ma mignonne\u2019 by Hofstadter), serve as reference points for his ideas on the subject. Groups of translations alternate with analysis and commentary on the same throughout the book. However, Hofstadter's reading of the idea of \u2018translation\u2019 goes deeper than simply that of translating between languages. Translation between frames of reference \u2014 languages, cultures, modes of expression or, indeed, between one person's thoughts and another \u2014 becomes an element in many of the same concepts Hofstadter has addressed in prior works, such as reference and self-reference, structure and function, and artificial intelligence.\nOne theme of this book is the loss of Hofstadter's wife Carol, who died of a brain tumor while the book was being written; she also created one of the numerous translations of Marot's poem presented in the book. In this context the poem, dedicated to \u2018a sick lady\u2019, gained yet another deeply tragic and personal meaning, even though the translations were started long before her illness was even known (Hofstadter went on to follow with an even more personal book titled I Am a Strange Loop after the death of his wife).", "hasanswer": true}]}

Although the content is mostly derived from the Discourses of Epictetus, it is not a summary of the Discourses but rather a compilation of practical precepts. Eschewing metaphysics, Arrian focuses his attention on Epictetus's work applying philosophy to daily life. Thus, the book is a manual to show the way to achieve mental freedom and happiness in all circumstances.\nThe Enchiridion was well-known in the ancient world, and in the medieval period, it was specially adapted for use in Greek-speaking monasteries.

{"id": "484_699", "question": "Who is the author of King James Version?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_12810", "text": "The King James Version (KJV), also the King James Bible (KJB) and the Authorized Version (AV), is an Early Modern English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England, which was commissioned in 1604 and published in 1611, by sponsorship of King James VI and I. The 80 books of the King James Version include 39 books of the Old Testament, 14 books of Apocrypha, and the 27 books of the New Testament. \nNoted for its \"majesty of style\", the King James Version has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in the shaping of the English-speaking world. The King James Version remains the preferred translation of many Christian fundamentalists and religious movements, and it is considered one of the important literary accomplishments of early modern England.\nThe KJV was the third translation into English approved by the English Church authorities: The first had been the Great Bible (1535), and the second had been the Bishops' Bible (1568). In Switzerland the first generation of Protestant Reformers had produced the Geneva Bible which was published in 1560 having referred to the original Hebrew and Greek scriptures, which was influential in the writing of the Authorized King James Version.\nThe English Church initially used the officially sanctioned \"Bishops' Bible\", which was hardly used by the population. More popular was the named \"Geneva Bible\", which was created on the basis of the Tyndale translation in Geneva under the direct successor of the reformer John Calvin for his English followers. However, their footnotes represented a Calvinistic Puritanism that was too radical for King James. The translators of the Geneva Bible had translated the word king as tyrant about four hundred times\u2014the word tyrant does not appear once in the KJV. Because of this, it has been assumed King James purposely had the translators of the KJV mistranslate the word \"tyrant\" as either \"troubling\", \"oppressor\", or some other word to avoid people being critical of his monarchy, though there is no evidence to back up that claim.King James convened the Hampton Court Conference in January 1604, where a new English version was conceived in response to the problems of the earlier translations perceived by the Puritans, a faction of the Church of England. James gave translators instructions intended to ensure the new version would conform to the ecclesiology, and reflect the episcopal structure, of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament from Hebrew and Aramaic, and the Apocrypha from Greek and Latin. In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, the text of the Authorized Version replaced the text of the Great Bible for Epistle and Gospel readings, and as such was authorized by Act of Parliament.By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version had become effectively unchallenged as the only English translation used in Anglican and other English Protestant churches, except for the Psalms and some short passages in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England. Over the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English-speaking scholars. With the development of stereotype printing at the beginning of the 19th century, this version of the Bible had become the most widely printed book in history, almost all such printings presenting the standard text of 1769, and nearly always omitting the books of the Apocrypha. Today the unqualified title \"King James Version\" usually indicates this Oxford standard text.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was edited by Glenn O'Brien and published by Warner Books, Maverick and Callaway. The book features adult content including softcore pornography and simulations of sexual acts including sadomasochism.\nMadonna developed Sex after Judith Regan of Simon & Schuster publishers suggested a book of erotic photographs. She wrote it as a character named \"Mistress Dita\", inspired by 1930s film actress Dita Parlo. It was influenced by punk rock and fashion figures including Guy Bourdin, Helmut Newton and Robert Mapplethorpe. The photos were shot in early 1992 in New York City and Miami, in locations including hotels, burlesque theaters, and city streets. The book includes cameos by actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, and socialite Princess Tatiana von F\u00fcrstenberg. The cover is made of aluminium, spiral bound and wrapped in a Mylar sheet.\nMadonna's publishers were apprehensive about the release and the book's commercial potential. It was released on October 21, 1992, the day after Madonna's fifth studio album Erotica. A CD single was also packaged with the book which contained the song \"Erotic\", a song similar in composition to her similarly-named single \"Erotica\". It sold over 150,000 copies on its first day in the United States, and topped the New York Times Best Seller list for three weeks. In matters of days, Sex went on to sell more than 1.5 million copies worldwide and remains the best and fastest-selling coffee table book. It also remains as one of the most in-demand out-of-print publications of all time.\nSex attracted extensive media attention and backlash, but Madonna remained unapologetic. Though it initially received negative reviews from fans and critics, who felt she had \"gone too far\", later reviews have been more positive, with academics deeming it a defining phase in Madonna's career. Sex is noted for its social and cultural impact and is considered a bold post-feminist work.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It explores the theater's socioeconomic milieu in the 1970s. There are stories about attempts to censor the arts and describing increasing anti-arts sentiment in this country.\nThe book features a foreword by Broadway director and producer Harold Prince. Prince discusses the problems of maintaining an art theater in a commercial society.\nIt is written in the style of a novel, even though it is a non-fiction work. The model for the book is Voltaire's Candide.\nThis book was one of a handful on the forefront of the field of creative non-fiction. Three years after its publication, in 1994, the Creative Nonfiction Foundation was established. The author reports that when she submitted a draft of the work as a doctoral dissertation, she was asked to rewrite it because the creative nonfiction approach had not yet been accepted in the academic community. According to her report, members of her dissertation committee said that while it was thorough and accurate, they felt they were reading a novel; they asked her to make changes in the style so that it no longer met the criteria of creative nonfiction. She did so in order to get her doctorate, but submitted the earlier draft to publishers. The chapter titles, written in the style of Voltaire's 'Candide' (listed below), were particularly controversial.\nThe Chelsea Theater Center was founded in 1965 and closed in 1986. It was in residence at the Brooklyn Academy of Music from 1968 to 1978. Before and after that time, it worked in theaters in Manhattan, mainly the Westside Theater.\nGlenn Close, Frank Langella, Christopher Lloyd and Meryl Streep were among the actors who worked at the Chelsea. Directors included Des McAnuff, Hal Prince, John Hirsch, and Alan Schneider.\nIn 1965, when Robert Kalfin founded the Chelsea, there were few nonprofit theaters in New York. During the next ten years, new theaters opened, funding sources decreased, and costs rose. Many nonprofit theaters started to do conventional work that would attract audiences. Kalfin and his partners, David and Hash, continued to do innovative work.\nCritics often said that the Chelsea stretched the boundaries of theater. Spectators subscribed to seasons before they knew what the Chelsea would produce the following year. On the other hand, there were many clashes behind the scenes.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was performed on 30 July 1634, three years before the poet's death, and published in 1641.\nThe masque was not produced by the Stuart Court in one of the royal palaces around London, as many of Jonson's notable early masques were. Rather it was staged by William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle (at the time, he was the Earl of Newcastle) at Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire, in honor of King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria. Newcastle had put on a Jonson masque for his royal visitors at Welbeck in Nottinghamshire the year before: The King's Entertainment at Welbeck, performed on 21 May 1633. It was such a success that the King requested another on his 1634 royal progress. The Duke spent between \u00a314,000 and \u00a315,000 on staging the Bolsover masque and providing for his royal guests and their attendants, which was more than double the \u00a34,000 to \u00a35,000 he'd spent for the Welbeck entertainment the previous year. (The Masque of Beauty, one of Jonson's early Court masques, had cost \u00a34,000 to stage in 1608, and was considered exorbitantly expensive at the time.)\nIn Love's Welcome, Jonson continued the mockery of Inigo Jones that he'd practiced for two decades, starting Bartholomew Fair (1614) and continuing through The Masque of Augurs (1622), Neptune's Triumph for the Return of Albion (1624), The Staple of News (1626), and A Tale of a Tub (1633). In this masque, Jones is \"Colonel Iniquo Vitruvius.\"\nThe masque was staged in what was called the \"little castle\" at Bolsover, a then-recent (Jacobean) construction. The pillared hall there was furnished with five brilliantly colored paintings on the theme of The Senses; Jonson alludes to the paintings in his text. The show was described by local witnesses as \"stupendous,\" more than adequate to establish Newcastle's reputation as the greatest \"prince...in all the northern quarter\" of the kingdom. Perhaps the most visually striking element in the masque lay in the two Cupids, Eros (Love) and Anteros (Love Returned), who descended \"from the clouds\" bearing fronds of palms.\nThe masque was published in 1641 in the second folio collection of Jonson's works, and was thereafter included in his canon, although it does not appear in Stephen Orgel's \"Complete Masques of Ben Jonson\".

Coji-Coji, however, is ultimately kind-hearted and helps his friends, if in unnoticed ways. Another running theme of the show is Coji-Coji's friends' ignorance of his God-like abilities. Coji-Coji makes no effort to conceal his powers, however: his friends simply never notice because he appears too simple and naive.\nIn addition to the anime series, there is a Dreamcast party game from Marvelous Entertainment based on the television series. The Dreamcast microphone was used to play the game. The title character is voiced by Shizuka Aoki, and it also features the vocal talents of Urara Takano and Katashi Ishizuka.

The second section, \"Deux\", tells of Sedaris\u2019s move to Normandy with his partner Hugh, often drawing humor from his efforts to live in France without speaking French and his frustrated attempts to learn it. Prior to publication, several of the essays were read by the author on the Public Radio International program, This American Life.\nIn April 2001, Variety reported that Sedaris had sold the Me Talk Pretty One Day film rights to director Wayne Wang, who was adapting four stories from the book for Columbia Pictures with hopes of beginning shooting in late 2001. At the time, Sedaris commented, \"It's just one of those things I had never considered. Like, 'What if I de-clawed a kitten?' But I like Wayne Wang a lot.\"  He recommended Jack Lemmon to play his father and Elaine Stritch for his mother.  Wang had completed the script and begun casting when Sedaris asked to \"get out of it,\" after a conversation with his sister aroused concerns as to how his family might be portrayed on screen. He wrote about the conversation and its aftermath in the essay \"Repeat After Me\", published in Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim. Sedaris recounted that Wang was \"a real prince.

The tale of moral choice takes as its subject Britannicus, the son of the Roman emperor Claudius, and heir to the imperial throne. Britannicus' succession to the throne is however usurped by Lucius, later known as Nero, and the son of Claudius' wife Agrippina the Younger.\nRacine portrays Nero's true nature as revealed by his sudden desire for Britannicus's fianc\u00e9e Junia. He wrests himself free from his mother's domination and plots to assassinate his adoptive brother. Nero is driven less by fear of being overthrown by Britannicus than by competition in love. His desire for Junia manifests itself in sadism towards the young woman and all that she loves. Agrippina is portrayed as a possessive mother who will not accept the loss of control over both her son and the Empire. Despite giving his name to the play, the character of Britannicus is more minor than those of Agrippina and Nero.\nSuccess only came to the play slowly, but of Racine's works, Britannicus is today second only to Andromaque amongst the repertory of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, and is frequently studied in high school.", "hasanswer": true}]}

She purchased a plantation near Jacksonville as a place for her son to recover from the injuries he had received as a Union soldier and to make a new start in life. After visiting him, she became so enamored with the region she purchased a cottage and orange grove for herself and wintered there until 1884, even though the plantation failed within its first year. Parts of Palmetto Leaves appeared in a newspaper published by Stowe's brother, as a series of letters and essays about life in northeast Florida.\nScion of New England clergy, Stowe keenly felt a sense of Christian responsibility that was expressed in her letters. She considered it her duty to help improve the lives of newly emancipated blacks and detailed her efforts to establish a school and church in Mandarin toward these ends. Parts of the book relate the lives of local African-Americans and the customs of their society. Stowe described the charm of the region and its generally moderate climate but warned readers of \"excessive\" heat in the summer months and occasional cold snaps in winter. Her audience comprises relatives, friends, and strangers in New England who ask her advice about whether or not to move to Florida, which at the time was still mostly wilderness.

The Maltese original, Bonaparti f'Malta, was published in 1997.\nCiting contemporary documents from Malta's archives, it provides a detailed account of the six days Napoleon Bonaparte spent in Malta in 1798, as well as an analysis of the political situation under the Order of St John of Jerusalem and the political and cultural consequences of Bonaparte's conquest of Malta.\nIn the words of fellow writer and former Prime Minister of Malta, Alfred Sant, Napoleon and his impact on Malta were \"enduring subjects of [Sammut's] interests and research\".It is the first account in the French language of those six days. At the Eighth Congress of the International Napoleonic Society, Sammut gave a presentation, \"The Enlightenment in Malta and the Coming of Bonaparte\", based on his research for Bonaparte \u00e0 Malte.\nSammut maintained that Napoleon, despite spending such a short time in Malta, sought singlehandedly to draw the country into the modern world. He issued a series of decrees aimed at bringing about a thorough reorganization of government and society in Malta, and tirelessly sought to review the country's laws and regulations. The abolition of noble titles and privileges and the ending of slavery were the first measures he implemented. He ordered the expulsion of the Inquisitor and the release of the Order's political prisoners, including the Maltese patriot, Mikiel Anton Vassalli, who shared his Enlightenment ideals and whom he described as \"the most intelligent prisoner (ever) locked in a cell\". Voicing his surprise that fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics and astronomy were not yet being taught at the University of Malta, he also instituted a series of educational reforms.Sammut characterized Napoleon as \"a different kind of leader... more of an intellectual strategist and philosopher\", a quality placing him in the highest rank of commander together with Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great.Some of Sammut's research for Bonaparte \u00e0 Malte also went into his 1994 historical novel about Vassalli, Il-\u0126olma Maltija (The Maltese Dream), described by Alfred Sant as \"his masterpiece\" and by British author and poet Marjorie Boulton as \"a colossal work\".According to Prof. Anne-Marie M\u00e9sa of the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Frans Sammut's \"point of view is actually original, well reasoned out, nuanced and subtle \u2013 as one would expect from all works on history.

While Chomsky and other generative grammarians argued that the meaning of a sentence was derived from its syntax, the generative semanticists argued that syntax was derived from meaning.\nEventually, generative semantics spawned an alternative linguistic paradigm, known as cognitive linguistics, which attempts to correlate the understanding of language with the concepts of cognitive psychology, such as memory, perception and categorization. While generative grammarians operate on the premise that the mind has a unique and independent module for language acquisition, cognitive linguists deny this.

Despite numerous errors taken from Eusebius, and some of his own, Jerome produced a valuable work of universal history, if only for the example which it gave to such later chroniclers as Prosper of Aquitaine, Cassiodorus, and Victor of Tunnuna to continue his annals. In conformity with the Chronicon of Eusebius (early 4th century), Jerome dated Creation to 5201 BC.The Chronicle includes a chronology of the events of Greek mythology, based on the work of Hellenistic scholars such as Apollodorus, Diodorus Siculus, and Eusebius. While many of the earlier sections contain legendary characters and events that are not necessarily historically factual, there may be scattered remnants of historical events of late Mycenean Greece from entries of the 12th century BC. (See the historicity of the Iliad. Notably, Jerome's date for the capture of Troy of 1183 BC corresponds remarkably well with the destruction layer of Troy VIIa, the main candidate for the historical inspiration of legendary Troy, dated to c.\u20091190 BC.)

The second edition was published under the title Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost in a limited edition of five copies in 1965.

It features typewritten and handwritten text intermixed with clip art, stamps, and seals appropriated from other sources.\nWhile the Principia is full of literal contradictions and unusual humor, it contains several passages which propose that there is serious intent behind the work, for example a message scrawled on page 00075: \"If you think the PRINCIPIA is just a ha-ha, then go read it again.\"\nThe Principia is quoted extensively in and shares many themes with the satirical 1975 science fiction book The Illuminatus! Trilogy by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. Wilson was not directly involved in writing the Principia.\n\nNotable symbols in the book include the Apple of Discord, the pentagon, and the \"Sacred Chao\", which resembles the Taijitu of Taoism, but the two principles depicted are \"Hodge\" and \"Podge\" rather than yin and yang, and they are represented by the apple and the pentagon, and not by dots. Saints identified include Emperor Norton, Yossarian, Don Quixote, and Bokonon.  The Principia also introduces the mysterious word \"fnord\", later popularized in The Illuminatus!

{"id": "484_1474", "question": "Who is the author of The Ball?", "ctxs": [{"id": "484_15452", "text": "The Ball is a Caroline comedy by James Shirley, first performed in 1632 and first published in 1639.\nThe Ball was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 16 November 1632. Herbert, however, was not happy with the play: in a note in his office book dated two days later, 18 November, he complained that the play showed \"diverse personated so naturally, both of lords and others of the Court, that I took it ill, and would have forbidden the play\" \u2013 but impresario Christopher Beeston promised Herbert that everything that Herbert disliked in the play would be fixed before the performance. The desired changes must have been made satisfactorily since the play was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre.\nThe 1639 quarto publication of the play, printed by Thomas Cotes for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke, confused subsequent generations of critics since the title page attributes the play to both Shirley and George Chapman. The play, a light comedy of manners, is entirely like the style of Shirley, and nothing like the style of Chapman. Most scholars now think that the dual attribution is simply a mistake, a point of confusion by the publishers: The Tragedy of Chabot, Admiral of France, a Chapman play that had been revised by Shirley, was printed in the same year by the same house.Traditional critics sometimes complained about the frothy amorality of The Ball \u2013 judging it to display a \"coarseness...unflattering\" to the social set depicted. Yet Herbert's adverse reaction to the accuracy of the play suggests that even the revised version may have a certain journalistic quality, showing what the Court of Charles I was actually like.", "hasanswer": true}]}
