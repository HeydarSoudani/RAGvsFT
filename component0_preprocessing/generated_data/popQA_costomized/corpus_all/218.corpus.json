        "content": "As a king, Afonso II set a different approach of government. Hitherto, his father Sancho I and his grandfather Afonso I were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring Kingdom of Castile or against the Moorish lands in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to ensure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns, like Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in 1217, were conquered from the Moors by the private initiative of noblemen. This does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between Afonso and his brothers and sisters. The king managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin. Since military issues were not a government priority, Afonso established the state's administration and centralized power on himself. He designed the first set of Portuguese written laws. These were mainly concerned with private property, civil justice, and minting. Afonso also sent ambassadors to European kingdoms outside the Iberian Peninsula and began amicable commercial relations with most of them. Other reforms included the always delicate matters with the pope. In order to get the independence of Portugal recognized by Rome, his grandfather, Afonso I, had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the Church. These eventually created a state within the state. With Portugal's position as a country firmly established, Afonso II endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the Catholic Church to purposes of national utility. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and Portugal. After being excommunicated for his audacities by Pope Honorius III, Afonso II promised to make amends to the church, but he died in Coimbra on 25 March 1223 before making any serious attempts to do so. King Afonso was buried originally at the Monastery of Santa Cruz in Coimbra where his body remained for nearly ten years. His remains were transferred subsequently to Alcoba\u00e7a Monastery, as he had stipulated in his will. He and his wife, Queen Urraca, were buried at its Royal Pantheon."

        "content": "Batman is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha, a vendetta tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy the Joker. Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of DC's Superman; although Kane frequently claimed sole creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more bat-like. The character received his own spin-off publication, Batman, in 1940. Batman was originally introduced as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed criminals, but evolved into a character with a stringent moral code and strong sense of justice. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s, culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo and Black Label. The longest-running Batman comic, Detective Comics, is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice League and the Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters have taken on the Batman persona on different occasions, such as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in the 1993\u20131994 \"Knightfall\" story arc; Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; and Jace Fox, son of Wayne's ally Lucius, as of 2021. DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the incarnation from the Flashpoint event, and numerous interpretations from Elseworlds stories. One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, Batman has been listed among the greatest comic book superheroes and fictional characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has been licensed and featured in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as Lego Batman and video games like the Batman: Arkham series. Batman has been adapted in live-action and animated incarnations, including the 1960s Batman television series played by Adam West and in film by Michael Keaton in Batman , Batman Returns and The Flash , Christian Bale in The Dark Knight trilogy , Ben Affleck in the DC Extended Universe , and Robert Pattinson in The Batman . Kevin Conroy, Jason O'Mara, and Will Arnett, among others, have provided the character's voice."

        "content": "In early 1939, the success of Superman in Action Comics prompted editors at National Comics Publications to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, Bob Kane created \"the Bat-Man\". Collaborator Bill Finger recalled that \"Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of\u00a0...reddish tights, I believe, with boots\u00a0...no gloves, no gauntlets\u00a0...with a small domino mask, swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign\u00a0...BATMAN\". The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired as a child by Leonardo da Vinci's sketch of an ornithopter flying device. Finger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and gloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume. Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: \"Bruce Wayne's first name came from Robert the Bruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock\u00a0...then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne.\" He later said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk's popular The Phantom, a syndicated newspaper comic-strip character with which Kane was also familiar. Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the Bat-Man's look, personality, methods, and weaponry. Details find predecessors in pulp fiction, comic strips, newspaper headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself. As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, Batman had predecessors in the Scarlet Pimpernel and Zorro . Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane noted the influence of the films The Mark of Zorro and The Bat Whispers in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like Doc Savage, The Shadow, Dick Tracy, and Sherlock Holmes, made the character a master sleuth. In his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation:"

        "content": "Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say \"Batman created by Bob Kane\"; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster began receiving a \"created by\" credit on the Superman titles, along with William Moulton Marston being given the byline for creating Wonder Woman, Batman stories began saying \"Created by Bob Kane\" in addition to the other credits. Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of Batman #169 for example, editor Julius Schwartz names him as the creator of the Riddler, one of Batman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, \"Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by.\" At the time of Finger's death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator. Jerry Robinson, who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with The Comics Journal: Although Kane initially rebutted Finger's claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that \"it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the ''Batman, t'  as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue.\" Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. \"The trouble with being a 'ghost' writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'. However, if one wants the 'credit', then one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator.\""

        "content": "The first Batman story, \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\", was published in Detective Comics #27 . Finger said, \"Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps\", and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in Detective Comics. By that time, Detective Comics was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success. The two characters were featured side by side as the stars of World's Finest Comics, which was originally titled World's Best Comics when it debuted in fall 1940. Creators including Jerry Robinson and Dick Sprang also worked on the strips during this period. Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. \"About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman\", Kane said. Batman's characteristic utility belt was introduced in Detective Comics #29 , followed by the boomerang-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the Batplane, in #31 . The character's origin was revealed in #33 , unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, at their grave, the child vows that \"by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals\". The early, pulp-inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in Detective Comics #38 with the introduction of Robin, Batman's junior counterpart. Robin was introduced, based on Finger's suggestion, because Batman needed a \"Watson\" with whom Batman could talk. Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of \"kid sidekicks\". The first issue of the solo spin-off series Batman was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the Joker and Catwoman, but for a pre-Robin inventory story, originally meant for Detective Comics #38, in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death. That story prompted editor Whitney Ellsworth to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun. By 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos. In the years following World War II, DC Comics \"adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy\". The impact of this editorial approach was evident in Batman comics of the postwar period; removed from the \"bleak and menacing world\" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a \"bright and colorful\" environment."

        "content": "Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story \"The Mightiest Team in the World\" in Superman #76 , Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discover each other's secret identity. Following the success of this story, World's Finest Comics was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before. The team-up of the characters was \"a financial success in an era when those were few and far between\"; this series of stories ran until the book's cancellation in 1986. Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist Fredric Wertham's book Seduction of the Innocent in 1954. Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed homosexual overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers. Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority, a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry. The tendency towards a \"sunnier Batman\" in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code. Scholars have suggested that the characters of Batwoman and the pre-Barbara Gordon Bat-Girl were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories took on a campier, lighter feel. In the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more science fiction-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre. New characters such as Batwoman, the original Bat-Girl, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite were introduced. Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the Justice League of America in The Brave and the Bold #28 , and went on to appear in several Justice League comic book series starting later that same year."

        "content": "By 1964, sales of Batman titles had fallen drastically. Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was \"planning to kill Batman off altogether\". In response to this, editor Julius Schwartz was assigned to the Batman titles. He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's Detective Comics #327 , which was cover-billed as the \"New Look\". Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist Carmine Infantino to help overhaul the character. The Batmobile was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite were retired. Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred was killed off while a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet Cooper, came to live with Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson. The debut of the Batman television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character. The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and Batman reached a circulation of close to 900,000 copies. Elements such as the character of Batgirl and the show's campy nature were introduced into the comics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, \"When the television show was a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books.\" Starting in 1969, writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a \"grim avenger of the night\". O'Neil said his idea was \"simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.\" O'Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story \"The Secret of the Waiting Graves\" in Detective Comics #395 . Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker Dick Giordano, and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s; nevertheless the influence of their work was \"tremendous\". Giordano said: \"We went back to a grimmer, darker Batman, and I think that's why these stories did so well\u00a0...\" While the work of O'Neil and Adams was popular with fans, the acclaim did little to improve declining sales; the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer Steve Englehart and penciler Marshall Rogers in Detective Comics #471\u2013476 , which went on to influence the 1989 movie Batman and be adapted for Batman: The Animated Series, which debuted in 1992. Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985."

The comic book, which tells the story of a 55-year-old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated interest in the character. The Dark Knight Returns was a financial success and has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones. The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character's popularity. That year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC's status quo-altering 12-issue miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths. O'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before. One outcome of this new approach was the \"Year One\" storyline in Batman #404\u2013407 , in which Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli redefined the character's origins. Writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page one-shot issue Batman: The Killing Joke, in which the Joker, attempting to drive Commissioner Gordon insane, cripples Gordon's daughter Barbara, and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically. The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a 900 number for readers to call to vote on whether Jason Todd, the second Robin, lived or died. Voters decided in favor of Jason's death by a narrow margin of 28 votes ."

Writers Doug Moench, Chuck Dixon, and Alan Grant worked on the Batman titles during \"Knightfall\", and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s. 1998's \"Cataclysm\" storyline served as the precursor to 1999's \"No Man's Land\", a year-long storyline that ran through all the Batman-related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake-ravaged Gotham City. At the conclusion of \"No Man's Land\", O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by Bob Schreck. Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was Jeph Loeb. Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale, they wrote two miniseries that pit an early-in-his-career version of Batman against his entire rogues gallery while dealing with various mysteries involving serial killers Holiday and the Hangman. In 2003, Loeb teamed with artist Jim Lee to work on another mystery arc: \"Batman: Hush\" for the main Batman book. The 12\u2013issue storyline has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman's entire rogues gallery, including an apparently resurrected Jason Todd, while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain Hush. While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC. The series became #1 on the Diamond Comic Distributors sales chart for the first time since Batman #500 and Todd's appearance laid the groundwork for writer Judd Winick's subsequent run as writer on Batman, with another multi-issue arc, \"Under the Hood\", which ran from Batman #637\u2013650 ."

Starting in 2006, Grant Morrison and Paul Dini were the regular writers of Batman and Detective Comics, with Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore. Most notably of these elements were the science fiction-themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman suffered under the influence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training. Morrison's run climaxed with \"Batman R.I.P.\", which brought Batman up against the villainous \"Black Glove\" organization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. \"Batman R.I.P.\" segued into Final Crisis , which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of Darkseid.

Batman Incorporated was relaunched in 2012\u20132013 to complete the \"Leviathan\" storyline. With the beginning of The New 52, Scott Snyder was the writer of the Batman title.

However, Bruce Wayne is soon revealed to be alive, albeit now suffering almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his life as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred. Bruce Wayne finds happiness and proposes to his girlfriend, Julie Madison, but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to destroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a \"strange star\" to swallow the city. Bruce Wayne discovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman, but at the cost of his memories as the reborn Bruce Wayne. He returns and helps Jim Gordon defeat Mr. Bloom and shut down the reactor. Gordon gets his job back as the commissioner, and the government Batman project is shut down.

As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate. He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip while feigning near-drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since Wayne is actually a strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess.

Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade. This is in contrast to the Post-Crisis Superman, whose Clark Kent persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the facade. In Batman Unmasked, a television documentary about the psychology of the character, behavioral scientist Benjamin Karney notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity; that \"Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better\". Bruce Wayne's principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill. Bruce Wayne believes that our actions define us, we fail for a reason and anything is possible. Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison notes that both heroes \"believe in the same kind of things\" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. He notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: \"Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss.\" T. James Musler's book Unleashing the Superhero in Us All explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman. Will Brooker notes in his book Batman Unmasked that \"the confirmation of the Batman's identity lies with the young audience\u00a0...he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him\u00a0...and they're never wrong.\""

        "content": "Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as \"wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession\". The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative teams. Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: \"Julie Schwartz did a Batman in Batman and Detective and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the Brave and the Bold and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days.\" The driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that \"there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes\". Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist and to train his body into physical perfection to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind. He also speaks over 40 different languages. Another of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the \"reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions\". The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures. Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as \"a dionysian figure, a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order\". Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting, a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty conscience. Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into Batman's characterization, such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and increasingly alienated behavior. Batman, shortly a year after his debut and the introduction of Robin, was changed in 1940 after DC editor Whitney Ellsworth felt the character would be tainted by his lethal methods and DC established their own ethical code, subsequently he was retconned to have a stringent moral code, which has stayed with the character of Batman ever since. Miller's Batman was closer to the original pre-Robin version, who was willing to kill criminals if necessary."

As part of DC's 2011 continuity relaunch, Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the Flashpoint crossover event. In an interview with IGN, Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin represented a \"reverse\" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, \"a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin\". Morrison explained his intentions for the new characterization of Batman: \"Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the Teen Titans, and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier;  a lot looser and more relaxed.\" Over the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence. Jean-Paul Valley, also known as Azrael, assumed the cowl after the events of the Knightfall saga. Jim Gordon donned a mecha-suit after the events of Batman: Endgame, and served as Batman in 2015 and 2016. In 2021, as part of the Fear State crossover event, Lucius Fox's son Jace Fox succeeds Bruce as Batman in a 2021 storyline, depicted in the series I Am Batman, after Batman was declared dead. Additionally, members of the group Batman Incorporated, Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world. Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various former proteges of Bruce Wayne."

Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because \"Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking.\" The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940. In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero Nightwing. A second Robin, Jason Todd, appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but was later revived. He used the Joker's old persona, the Red Hood, and became an antihero vigilante with no qualms about using firearms or deadly force. Carrie Kelley, the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels The Dark Knight Returns and The Dark Knight Strikes Again, fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity. The third Robin in the mainstream comics is Tim Drake, who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series, and currently goes by the Red Robin, a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the first decade of the new millennium, Stephanie Brown served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made vigilante identity the Spoiler, and later as Batgirl. After Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to Damian Wayne, the 10-year-old son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, in the late 2000s. Damian's tenure as du jour Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of Batman Incorporated in 2013. Batman's next young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise young woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the ornithological theme nonetheless; she debuted the codename and identity of the Bluebird in 2014. Unlike the Robins, the Bluebird is willing and permitted to use a gun, albeit non-lethal; her weapon of choice is a modified rifle that fires taser rounds. In 2015, a new series began titled We Are...Robin, focused on a group of teenagers using the Robin persona to fight crime in Gotham City."

Bruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically linked with many women throughout his various incarnations.

The attraction between Batman and Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear, including a love story between their two secret identities as early as in the 1966 film Batman. Although Catwoman is typically portrayed as a villain, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic connection. In an early 1980s storyline, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as \"Bruce\". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. Out of costume, Bruce and Selina develop a romantic relationship during The Long Halloween. The story shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In Batman: Dark Victory, he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the 12-issue story arc called \"Hush\", Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, \"Hush\" sees Batman and Catwoman allied against the entire rogues gallery and rekindling their romantic relationship. In \"'Hush\", Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman. The Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world, partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Selina Kyle, as shown in Superman Family #211. They have a daughter named Helena Wayne, who becomes the Huntress. Along with Dick Grayson, the Earth-Two Robin, the Huntress takes the role as Gotham's protector once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on the roof of a building in Catwoman vol. 4 #1 ; the same issue implies that the two have an ongoing sexual relationship. Following the 2016 DC Rebirth continuity reboot, the two once again have a sexual encounter on top of a building in Batman vol. 3 #14 . Following the 2016 DC Rebirth continuity reboot, Batman and Catwoman work together in the third volume of Batman. The two also have a romantic relationship, in which they are shown having a sexual encounter on a rooftop and sleeping together. Bruce proposes to Selina in Batman vol. 3 #24 , and in issue #32, Selina asks Bruce to propose to her again. When he does so, she says, \"Yes.\" Batman vol. 3 Annual #2 centers on a romantic storyline between Batman and Catwoman. Towards the end, the story is flash-forwarded to the future, in which Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle are a married couple in their golden years. Bruce receives a terminal medical diagnosis, and Selina cares for him until his death."

Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient scientist, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver. Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical conditioning. As a polymath, his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe. He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman. In the Superman: Doomed story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet. Batman has trained extensively in various different fighting styles, making him one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the DC Universe. He has fully utilized his photographic memory to master a total of 127 different forms of martial arts including, but not limited to, Aikido, boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Capoeira, Eskrima, fencing, Gatka, Hapkido, Jeet Kune Do, Judo, Kalaripayattu, Karate, Kenjutsu, Kenpo, kickboxing, Kobudo, Krav Maga, Kyudo, Muay Thai, Ninjutsu, Pankration, Sambo, Savate, Silat, Taekwondo, wrestling, numerous different styles of Wushu , and Yaw-Yan. In terms of his physical condition, Batman is in peak, Olympic-athlete-level condition, easily-able to run-across rooftops in a Parkour-esque fashion. Superman describes Batman as \"the most dangerous man on Earth\", able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extra-terrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's first storyline in JLA. Batman is strongly disciplined, and he has the ability to function under great physical pain and resist most forms of telepathy and mind control. He is a master of disguise, multilingual, and an expert in espionage, often gathering information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone. Batman is highly skilled in stealth movement and escapology, which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable deathtraps with little to no harm. Batman is an expert in interrogation techniques and his intimidating and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of Superman and Wonder Woman. Among physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these include being a licensed pilot , as well as being able to operate other types of machinery. In some publications, he underwent some magician training."

Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue. Hence, the costume's colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey; as well as black and grey. In the Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns films, Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle. Ben Affleck's Batman in the DC Extended Universe films wears a suit grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol. Batman's batsuit aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops. The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, \"We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same\u00a0...Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it.\""

In proper practice, the \"bat\" prefix is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals stretched the practice to campy proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a Batboat, Bat-Sub, and Batcycle, among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such \"bat-\" names as the Bat-computer, Bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-shark repellent bat-spray, and Bat-rope. The storyline \"A Death in the Family\" suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the \"bat\" prefix on his own. In The Dark Knight Returns, Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name \"Batmobile\" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle. The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books, with the Batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics."

Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are hand guns, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents' murder. In modern stories in terms of his vehicles, Batman compromises on that principle to install weapon systems on them for the purpose of non-lethally disabling other vehicles, forcing entry into locations and attacking dangerous targets too large to defeat by other means."

Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of 8, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \"Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible\u00a0...\" As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.

        "content": "The Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced Barry Allen as a new, updated version of the Flash. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth-One. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until Detective Comics #327 , in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series. After the introduction of DC Comics' Multiverse in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman . The two have a daughter, Helena Wayne, who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the position as Gotham's protector along with Dick Grayson, the Earth-Two Robin, once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner. Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles, however, often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne ) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980, then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman miniseries to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history. Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the Justice League of America, Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's The Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, The Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month."

        "content": "In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. In 1974's \"Night of the Stalker\" storyline, a diploma on the wall reveals Bruce Wayne as a graduate of Yale Law School. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath, and the arrival of Ra's al Ghul, a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing. In the final issue of The Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the Outsiders. He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 and the comic subsequently changed its title."

        "content": "After the 12-issue miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline \"Year One\" from Batman #404\u2013407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career remain canonical in the Post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the \"Year One\" period. Subsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crimefighting, a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin. Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been intertitle crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published \"Knightfall\". During the storyline's first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in \"KnightsEnd\", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role. The 1994 company-wide crossover storyline Zero Hour: Crisis in Time! changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's \"Cataclysm\" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's \"No Man's Land\". Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of \"Batman: Officer Down\" and \"Batman: War Games/War Crimes\"; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Bullock are forced out of the police department in \"Officer Down\", while \"War Games\" and \"War Crimes\" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the sadistic Black Mask the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. Lex Luthor arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper Lynd during the \"Bruce Wayne: Murderer?\" and \"Bruce Wayne: Fugitive\" story arcs. Though Batman is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the organization known as \"Checkmate\" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with help from Talia al Ghul in Superman/Batman #1\u20136."

        "content": "DC Comics' 2005 miniseries Identity Crisis reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from lobotomizing Dr. Light after he raped Sue Dibny. Batman later creates the Brother I satellite surveillance system to watch over and, if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for the Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother EYE and the OMACs, though, at the very end, Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger. Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson , and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to \"rebuild Batman\". In the Face the Face storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. Part of this absence is captured during Week 30 of the 52 series, which shows Batman fighting his inner demons. Later on in 52, Batman is shown undergoing an intense meditation ritual in Nanda Parbat. This becomes an important part of the regular Batman title, which reveals that Batman is reborn as a more effective crime fighter while undergoing this ritual, having \"hunted down and ate\" the last traces of fear in his mind. At the end of the \"Face the Face\" story arc, Bruce officially adopts Tim as his son. The follow-up story arc in Batman, Batman and Son, introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman's son with Talia al Ghul. Although originally, in Batman: Son of the Demon, Bruce's coupling with Talia was implied to be consensual, this arc retconned it into Talia forcing herself on Bruce. Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders. Grant Morrison's 2008 storyline, \"Batman R.I.P.\" featured Batman being physically and mentally broken by the enigmatic villain Doctor Hurt and attracted news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion, which would speculated to feature the death of Bruce Wayne. However, though Batman is shown to possibly perish at the end of the arc, the two-issue arc \"Last Rites\", which leads into the crossover storyline \"Final Crisis\", shows that Batman survives his helicopter crash into the Gotham City River and returns to the Batcave, only to be summoned to the Hall of Justice by the JLA to help investigate the New God Orion's death. The story ends with Batman retrieving the god-killing bullet used to kill Orion, setting up its use in \"Final Crisis\". In the pages of Final Crisis Batman is reduced to a charred skeleton. In Final Crisis #7, Wayne is shown witnessing the passing of the first man, Anthro. Wayne's \"death\" sets up the three-issue Battle for the Cowl miniseries in which Wayne's ex-proteges compete for the \"right\" to assume the role of Batman, which concludes with Grayson becoming Batman, while Tim Drake takes on the identity of the Red Robin. Dick and Damian continue as Batman and Robin, and in the crossover storyline \"Blackest Night\", what appears to be Bruce's corpse is reanimated as a Black Lantern zombie, but is later shown that Bruce's corpse is one of Darkseid's failed Batman clones. Dick and Batman's other friends conclude that Bruce is alive."

Bruce publicly announced that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as \"Batman, Incorporated\".

        "content": "In the 2017 Dark Nights: Metal event, it is revealed that a Dark Multiverse exists alongside the main DC Multiverse. Each reality in the Dark Multiverse is negative and transient reflection of its existing counterpart, which were intended to be acquired by a third figure in the 'trinity' of the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor, who would feed these timelines to his 'dragon', Barbatos. However, this balance came to an end when Barbatos escaped his bonds and allowed the rejected timelines to remain in some form of existence. Eventually, Barbatos is released onto the DC universe when Batman is treated with five unique metals, turning him into a portal to the Dark Multiverse, with this ortal also allowing Barbatos to summon an army of evil alternate Batmen known as the Dark Knights, led by a God-like Batman, who describe themselves as having been created based on Batman's dark imaginations of what he could do if he possessed the powers of his colleagues. Barbatos is a hooded, God-like being in the Dark Multiverse. Barbatos had previously visited Prime-Earth in the DC Multiverse and founded the Tribe of Judas, which would later become the Court of Owls. Sometime before returning to the Dark Multiverse, Barbatos encountered Hawkman/Carter Hall, and was hit by his mace. Barbatos tried to return to the Multiverse but the events of Final Crisis prevented him from doing so. However, after witnessing Bruce Wayne/Batman being sent back in time by Darkseid's Omega Beams, Barbatos realised the similarities between his and Bruce's Bat emblems and believed he could use him as a doorway. Barbatos' followers manipulated events in order for Bruce to be injected with four out of the five metals needed to create the doorway, and after the fifth was injected in the present day, Barbatos was able to transport himself and the Dark Knights to Prime-Earth to conquer it. The Batman Who Laughs is a version of Batman from Earth -22, a dark reflection of the Earth-22. In that reality, the Earth -22 Joker learned of Batman's identity as Bruce Wayne and killed most of Batman's other rogues along with Commissioner Gordon. He then subjected a sizeable population of Gotham's populace to the chemicals that transformed him, subsequently killing several parents in front of their children with the goal of turning them into essentially a combination of himself and Batman. When Batman grappled with the Joker, it resulted in the latter's death as Batman is exposed to a purified form of the chemicals that gradually turned him into a new Joker, the process proving irreversible by the time Batman discovered what was happening to him. The Batman who Laughs proceeded to take over Earth-22, killing off most of his allies and turning Damian into a mini-Joker. The Batman Who Laughs seems to be the de facto leader or second-in-command of Barbatos' Dark Knights and recruited the other members. After arriving on Prime-Earth, the Batman Who Laughs takes control of Gotham and oversees events at the Challenger's mountain. He distributes joker cards to the Batman's Rogues, giving them the ability to alter reality and take over sections of the city. Accompanying him are Damian and three other youths whom he also calls his sons, all four being twisted versions of Robin, having intended to destroy all of reality by linking the Over-Monitor to Anti-Monitor's astral brain. But The Batman Who Laughs is defeated when the Prime Universe Batman is aided by the Joker, who notes the alternate Batman's failure to perceive this scenario due to still being a version of Batman. While assumed dead, the Batman who Laughs is revealed to be in the custody of Lex Luthor who offers him a place in the Legion of Doom. The Red Death is a version of Batman from Earth -52, originally an aged man who broke after the deaths of Dick, Jason, Tim, and Damian. Believing he has a chance to prevent the loss of more loved ones, Bruce decides he needs the Flash's Speed Force to achieve this and equipped himself with the Rogues' equipment of capture the Flash. He is able to knock Barry out and ties him to the Batmobile which has a machine created from reverse-engineering the Cosmic Treadmill attached to it. Using this machine against Barry's wishes, Bruce drove straight into the Speed Force while absorbing Barry in the process. Horribly scarred and now suffering from a split-personality created from residual traces of the Earth -52 Barry's mind, the newly born Red Death tests his new powers but realises he cannot stop his Earth from its destruction until he is recruited by The Batman Who Laughs, who promises him a new Earth to live upon. After entering Prime-Earth, the Red Death arrives in Central City and is confronted by Iris West and Wally West, in which he uses his powers to slow Wally and age them both. The Flash confronts the Red Death and before the latter can attack, Doctor Fate saves Barry. The Red Death proclaims that he will save Central City and make it his new home. After Barry is transported to a 'sand'-filled cave beneath Central City, the Red Death arrives and reveals several Flashmobiles and chases after Barry. During the events of the Wild Hunt, the Red Death ceased when exposed by an energy wave from the release of a newly born universe with the restored -52 Barry eventually destroyed from the energy consuming him. The Murder Machine is a version of Batman from Earth -44, a dark reflection of the Earth-44. Distraught from having lost Alfred, Batman requested Cyborg to help him finish the Alfred Protocol, an A.I. version of Alfred. But the Alfred Protocol malfunctioned upon activation and began to multiply and kill all of Batman's Rogues Gallery. Bruce pleaded with Cyborg to help find a way to fix it but the latter refused. The Alfred Protocol began to merge with Bruce and the two became the Murder Machine, and his first act as this new entity was to kill Cyborg. After being recruited by the Batman Who Laughs, the Murder Machine arrives on Prime-Earth with the other Dark Knights. He proceeds to the Justice League's Watchtower and confronts Cyborg. After Cyborg is incapacitated by the other Dark Knights, the Murder Machine infects and converts the Watchtower as the Dark Knights' new base of operations. The Dawnbreaker is a version of Batman from Earth -32, a dark reflection of the Earth-32 where Batman became a Green Lantern. When Earth -32 Bruce lost his parents to Joe Chill, he is chosen by a Green Power Ring to become a Green Lantern. But Bruce's will overrides the ring's ban on lethal force and corrupts it, enabling him to use it to kill Chill and various criminals. After Bruce killed Gordon when eventually confronted, he wipes out the Green Lantern Corp and the Guardians of the Universe when they confront him. Bruce then entered his giant Green Lantern Power Battery and exits with a new outfit and moniker, the Dawnbreaker. However, he finds that his Earth has begun to collapse and he is met by the Batman Who Laughs who, after recruiting the Red Death and the Murder Machine, recruits the Dawnbreaker, promising him a new world to shroud in darkness. After arriving on Earth-0, Dawnbreaker heads to Coast City where he is confronted by Hal Jordan. Dawnbreaker tries to consume Hal Jordan in a 'blackout' but the latter is rescued by Doctor Fate. With Green Lantern gone, Dawnbreaker takes control of Coast City. The Dawnbreaker confronts Hal Jordan in a blacked out cave underneath Coast City, claiming that the Green Lantern oath is worthless in his cave. The Drowned is a version of Batman from Earth -11, a dark reflection of the reversed-gender Earth-11. Originally known as Batwoman, Bryce Wayne was in a relationship with Sylvester Kyle until he was killed by a metahuman. A revenge-driven Bryce spent 18 months hunting down every rogue metahuman before Aquawoman and the Atlanteans emerged from their self-imposed exile. While Aquawoman claimed her people came in peace, a skeptical Bryce declared war on Atlantis with the Atlanteans flooding Gotham in retaliation when their queen was killed. Bryce survived the disaster by performing auto-surgery on herself by introducing mutated hybrid DNA into her body, giving Bryce the ability to breath underwater, accelerated healing, and water manipulation. She also created an army of Dead Waters to fight for her. Donning a new attire, Bryce called herself The Drowned and successfully conquered Atlantis at the cost of flooding every city. After seeing her signal being lit, the Drowned met the Batman Who Laughs and recruits her as a Dark Knight. After arriving on Earth-0, the Drowned headed to Amnesty Bay, where she was confronted by Aquaman and Mera. The two were unable to combat the Drowned and her army of Dead Waters, with Mera becoming infected and controlled by the Drowned while Aquaman was saved by Doctor Fate. The Drowned proceeded to take control of Amnesty Bay. When Aquaman is transported fathoms below Amnesty Bay, the Drowned attacks him, revealing that the infected Mera has mutated into a gargantuan shark/crab/octopus creature. The Merciless is a version of Batman from Earth -12, a dark reflection of Earth-12 where Batman is in a relationship with Wonder Woman. Having killed Ares to avenge Wonder Woman when he assumed she died, the Earth -12 Batman acquired Ares's helmet and assumed that he can channel its power to war with justice and mercy rather than ruthless brutality. But it corrupted him and the 'Merciless' Batman ended up killing Wonder Woman while eliminating all his enemies. The Merciless is later depicted as destroying the Valhalla Mountain when Sam Lane, Amanda Waller, Steve Trevor and Mister Bones attempt a counter-attack against the Dark Batmen after the regular heroes have apparently failed. The Merciless confronts Wonder Woman after she is transported under the foundation of A.R.G.U.S Headquarters in Washington D.C., revealing his armory filled with the divine arsenal of the Gods he killed on his Earth. He reveals to her that his Diana taught him to fight and after he destroyed the Gods, the Merciless found Themyscria and fought them for three days. The Merciless also reveals that he ordered the Ferryman at the River Styx to gather every coin from every dead Amazon seeking passage into the afterlife which he melted into a giant golden drachma, which he strikes with a hammer, summoning the undead Amazons. The Devastator is a version of Batman from Earth -1, a dark reflection of Earth-1. When Superman turned evil and kills friend and foe alike along with Lois, the Earth-1 Batman injected himself with an engineered version of the Doomsday virus to stop the Kryptonian at the cost of his humanity as he transformed into a Doomsday-like monster. Despite his victory, the Devastator still feels remorse for not being able to protect Metropolis from Superman's wrath. The Batman Who Laughs offers The Devastator a second chance at saving those whom he feels are blindly inspired by Superman. Bruce infects the Earth-0 Lois Lane, Supergirl, and all of Metropolis with the Doomsday virus as he views it as the only way to protect them from Superman's strength and false prophecies. Along with the Murder Machine, the Devastator was sent to retrieve the Cosmic Tuning Tower, ripping it out of its foundation and throwing it outside the Fortress of Solitude. He is then confronted by the two Green Lanterns of Earth , The Flash/Wally West, Firestorm, and Lobo and he proceeds to incapacitate all except Lobo who he throws into the Sun. Grabbing the Cosmic Tuning Tower, the Devastator leaps into space and lands on the Challenger's Mountain, planting the tower on top of it."

Superman begins a new world order where he and the Justice League use brute force and fear to coerce people into following the law, but Batman sees the tyranny in this and opposes Superman's Regime with his Insurgency. He suffers a few losses, notably of Dick Grayson by the hands of his biological son Damian , who sided with Superman. By the end of Year One Superman breaks Batman's back in an attempt to delay any future defiance. During most of Year Two Batman is out of commission, relying on his allies to stop the Regime when the Green Lantern Corps gets involved. In Year Three Batman allies himself with magic-users, notably John Constantine, though this ends with Constantine revealed to have been using Batman to further his own goals. Year Four has Batman look to the Greek gods to stop Superman. However, he comes to regret this when the gods decide to overpower humanity themselves, leading him to enlist the New God Highfather to stop them. He evades a trap set up by Superman when the fallen hero tries to make a meeting to discuss their problems. By the game's events, Batman has suffered many losses by the hands of the Regime and in a last-ditch effort summons the counterparts of Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Green Arrow, and Aquaman from the mainstream universe, needing them to help him retrieve a shard of kryptonite from his now-abandoned Batcave; the kryptonite was meant to be a last resort for if Superman went rogue, but Batman made it he could only access it if key members of the League agreed. Since most of them allied with Superman who are dead he needed duplicates. When this plan fails, he is reluctant to bring over the mainstream Superman, convinced that any version of Superman is corruptible. However, his prime counterpart convinces him to have faith and he does so, with the mainstream Superman defeating his counterpart and ending the Regime's influence."

Years later, having been Batman for a while, he finds out that the same person, revealed to be Clark Kent, is a reporter who spoke to Bruce's new ward Dick Grayson. Donning his costume, Bruce confronts Clark but is quickly overpowered, and is shocked when none of his equipment harms Clark. Clark finds out Bruce's identity by taking his mask and cape, and Bruce escapes. He seemingly leaves behind Clark's recording of his conversation with Dick, and Clark doesn't reveal Bruce's double life to the public. Bruce's cape later becomes part of Clark's prototype costume as he first begins his crime fighting career."

The first adaptation of Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October 25, 1943. That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part serial Batman, with Lewis Wilson becoming the first actor to portray Batman on screen. While Batman never had a radio series of his own, the character made occasional guest appearances in The Adventures of Superman, starting in 1945 on occasions when Superman voice actor Bud Collyer needed time off. A second movie serial, Batman and Robin, followed in 1949, with Robert Lowery taking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations during the 1940s \"helped make [Batman] a household name for millions who never bought a comic book\". In the 1964 publication of Donald Barthelme's collection of short stories Come Back, Dr. Caligari, Barthelme wrote \"The Joker's Greatest Triumph\". Batman is portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man."

        "content": "The Batman television series, starring Adam West, premiered in January 1966 on the ABC television network. Inflected with a camp sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, Back to the Batcave, West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a farce or lampoon, and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes, ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the Batman television series, the cast and crew made the theatrical film Batman . The Who recorded the theme song from the Batman show for their 1966 EP Ready Steady Who, and The Kinks performed the theme song on their 1967 album Live at Kelvin Hall. Despite not having an immediate continuation, the series spawned a pilot episode for a spin-off Batgirl television series and, decades later, the Batman '66 comic book series and the animated films Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders and Batman vs. Two-Face , and even the mockumentary Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt . In the 1996 episode Heroes and Villians of Only Fools and Horses, David Jason spoofed the role of Batman. The popularity of the Batman TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in The Batman/Superman Hour; the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as The Adventures of Batman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's Super Friends series, which was animated by Hanna-Barbera. Olan Soule was the voice of Batman in all these shows, but was eventually replaced during Super Friends by Adam West, who also voiced the character in Filmation's 1977 series The New Adventures of Batman. In 1992, Batman: The Animated Series premiered on the Fox television network, produced by Warner Bros. Animation and featuring Kevin Conroy as the voice of Batman. The series received considerable acclaim for its darker tone, mature writing, stylistic design, and thematic complexity compared to previous superhero cartoons, in addition to multiple Emmy Awards. The series' success led to the theatrical film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm , as well as various spin-off TV series that included Superman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited . The futuristic series Batman Beyond also took place in this same animated continuity and featured a newer, younger Batman voiced by Will Friedle, with the elderly Bruce Wayne as a mentor. In 2004, an unrelated animated series titled The Batman made its debut with Rino Romano voicing Batman. In 2008, this show was replaced by another animated series, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, featuring Diedrich Bader's voice as Batman. In 2013, a new CGI-animated series titled Beware the Batman made its debut, with Anthony Ruivivar voicing Batman. In 2014, the live-action TV series Gotham premiered on the Fox network, featuring David Mazouz as a 12-year-old Bruce Wayne. In 2018, when the series was renewed for its fifth and final season it was announced that Batman would make an appearance in the show's series finale's flash-forward. Iain Glen portrays Bruce Wayne in the live-action series Titans, appearing in the show's second season in 2019. Prior to Glen, Batman was played by stunt doubles Alain Moussi and Maxim Savarias in the first season. To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the character, Warner Bros aired the television short film, Batman: Strange Days, that was also posted on DC's YouTube channel. In August 2019, it was announced that Kevin Conroy would make his live-action television debut as an older Bruce Wayne in the upcoming Arrowverse crossover, Crisis on Infinite Earths. In the crossover, he portrayed a parallel universe iteration of Batman from Earth-99. In Batwoman, the Earth-Prime version of Bruce Wayne / Batman is portrayed by Warren Christie. In May 2021, it was announced that a new animated series titled Batman: Caped Crusader was in development by Bruce Timm, JJ Abrams, and Matt Reeves. The series is said to be a reimagining of the Caped Crusader that returns to the character's noir roots."

        "content": "Batman's first cinematographic adventures consisted of the 1943 serial film Batman and its 1949 sequel Batman and Robin, which both depicted a government-backed version of Batman and Robin . The serials are, though, notorious for their accentuation on anti-Japanese sentiments due to their World War II-period setting. As mentioned earlier, in 1966, 20th Century Fox produced the first Batman feature film, titled Batman, set in the universe and featuring most of the actors from the TV series. In 1989, Warner Bros. released the live-action feature film Batman, directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton as the title character. The film was a huge success; not only was it the top-grossing film of the year, but at the time was the fifth highest-grossing film in history. The film also won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction. The film's success spawned three sequels: Batman Returns , Batman Forever and Batman & Robin , the latter two of which were directed by Joel Schumacher instead of Burton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with Val Kilmer and George Clooney, respectively. The second Schumacher film failed to outgross any of its predecessors and was critically panned, causing Warner Bros. to cancel the planned fifth sequel, Batman Unchained, and end the initial film series. The first two films became the basis for the Tim Burton-inspired comic book series Batman '89. In April 2021, it was announced that Keaton would reprise his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman for the 2022 film, The Flash. In 2005, Batman Begins was released by Warner Bros. as a reboot of the film series, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale as Batman. Its sequel, The Dark Knight , set the record for the highest grossing opening weekend of all time in the U.S., earning approximately $158 million, and became the fastest film to reach the $400 million mark in the history of American cinema . These record-breaking attendances saw The Dark Knight end its run as the second-highest domestic grossing film with $533 million, bested then only by Titanic. The film also won two Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actor for the late Heath Ledger. It was eventually followed by The Dark Knight Rises , which served as a conclusion to Nolan's film series. Since 2008, Batman has also starred in various direct-to-video animated films under the DC Universe Animated Original Movies banner. Kevin Conroy has reprised his voice role of Batman for several of these films while others have featured celebrity voice actors in the role, including Jeremy Sisto, William Baldwin, Bruce Greenwood, Ben McKenzie, and Peter Weller. A Lego-themed version of Batman was also featured as one of the protagonists in the animated film The Lego Movie , with Will Arnett providing the voice. Arnett reprised the voice role for the spin-off film The Lego Batman Movie , and for the sequel The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part , which curiously depicts Batman's wedding to an original character. In 2016, Ben Affleck began portraying Batman in the DC Extended Universe with the release of the film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, directed by Zack Snyder, a younger child version of the character was played by Brandon Spink in the same film. Affleck also made a cameo appearance as Batman in David Ayer's film Suicide Squad . Affleck reprised the role in the 2017 film Justice League, also set in the DC Extended Universe. Dante Pereira-Olson portrays a young Bruce Wayne in the 2019 film Joker. In 2019, Robert Pattinson was cast to play Batman in the upcoming, The Batman, releasing in 2022."

Professor of film and cultural studies Will Brooker argues the validity of a queer reading of Batman, and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within, whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not. He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character. In 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses, prompting DC to threaten legal action. Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, \"The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay\u00a0...everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane\u00a0...none of them wrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view.\" Frank Miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting so much so that he's \"borderline pathological\", concluding \"He'd be much healthier if he were gay.\" Grant Morrison said that \"Gayness is built into Batman\u00a0...Obviously as a fictional character he's intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay.\""

        "content": "Batman has been the subject of psychological study for some time, and there have been a number of interpretations into the character's psyche. In Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight, Dr. Travis Langley argues that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell is present in the Batman mythos, such that the character represents the \"shadow archetype\". This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own dark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself. Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil. Langley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our \"shadow selves\". Langley also taught a class called Batman, a title he was adamant about. \"I could have called it something like the Psychology of Nocturnal Vigilantism, but no. I called it Batman,\" Langley says. Several psychologists have explored Bruce Wayne/Batman's mental health. Robin. S. Rosenberg evaluated his actions and problems to determine if they reach the level of mental disorders. She examined the possibility of several mental health issues, including dissociative identity disorder, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, and several others. She concluded that Bruce Wayne/Batman may have a disorder or a combination of disorders but due to his fictional nature, a definitive diagnosis will remain unknown. However, Langley himself states in his book that Batman is far too functional and well-adjusted, due to his training, confrontation of his fear early on and other factors, to be mentally ill. More likely, he asserts Batman's mental attitude is far more in line with a dedicated Olympic athlete."

He was the creator and host of the television variety program The Toast of the Town, which in 1955 was renamed The Ed Sullivan Show. Broadcast from 1948 to 1971, it set a record as the longest-running variety show in US broadcast history.  \"It was, by almost any measure, the last great TV show,\" said television critic David Hinckley. \"It's one of our fondest, dearest pop culture memories.\" Sullivan was a broadcasting pioneer during the early years of American television. As critic David Bianculli wrote, \"Before MTV, Sullivan presented rock acts. Before Bravo, he presented jazz and classical music and theater. Before the Comedy Channel, even before there was The Tonight Show, Sullivan discovered, anointed and popularized young comedians. Before there were 500 channels, before there was cable, Ed Sullivan was where the choice was. From the start, he was indeed 'the Toast of the Town'.\" In 1996, Sullivan was ranked number 50 on TV Guide'''s \"50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time\"."

        "content": "Edward Vincent Sullivan was born on September 28, 1901, in Harlem, New York City: the son of Elizabeth F. and Peter Arthur Sullivan, a customs house employee.  He grew up in Port Chester, New York, where the family lived in a small red brick home at 53 Washington Street. He was of Irish descent. The entire family loved music, and someone was always playing the piano or singing. A phonograph was a prized possession; the family loved playing all types of records on it. Sullivan was a gifted athlete in high school, earning 12 athletic letters at Port Chester High School. He played halfback in football; he was a guard in basketball; in track he was a sprinter. With the baseball team, Sullivan was catcher and team captain and he led the team to several championships. Baseball made an impression on him that would affect his career as well as the culture of America. Sullivan noted that, in the state of New York, integration was taken for granted in high school sports: \"When we went up into Connecticut, we ran into clubs that had Negro players. In those days this was accepted as commonplace; and so, my instinctive antagonism years later to any theory that a Negro wasn't a worthy opponent or was an inferior person. It was just as simple as that.\" Sullivan landed his first job at The Port Chester Daily Item: a local newspaper for which he had written sports news while in high school and then joined the paper full-time after graduation. In 1919, he joined The Hartford Post. The newspaper folded in his first week there, but he landed another job on The New York Evening Mail as a sports reporter. After The Evening Mail closed in 1923, he bounced through a series of news jobs with The Associated Press, The Philadelphia Bulletin, The Morning World, The Morning Telegraph, The New York Bulletin and The Leader. Finally, in 1927, Sullivan joined The Evening Graphic: first as a sports writer and then as a sports editor. In 1929, when   Walter Winchell moved to The Daily Mirror, Sullivan was made its Broadway columnist. He left the Graphic for the city's largest tabloid: the New York Daily News. His column, \"Little Old New York\", concentrated on Broadway shows and gossip, as Winchell's had; and, like Winchell, he did show-business news broadcasts on radio. Again echoing Winchell, Sullivan took on yet another medium in 1933 by writing and starring in the film Mr. Broadway, which has him guiding the audience around New York nightspots to meet entertainers and celebrities. Sullivan soon became a powerful starmaker in the entertainment world himself, becoming one of Winchell's main rivals, setting the El Morocco nightclub in New York as his unofficial headquarters against Winchell's seat of power at the nearby Stork Club. Sullivan continued writing for The News throughout his broadcasting career, and his popularity long outlived Winchell's. In the late 60's, however, Sullivan praised Winchell's legacy in a magazine interview, leading to a major reconciliation between the longtime adversaries. Throughout his career as a columnist, Sullivan had dabbled in entertainment\u2014producing vaudeville shows with which he appeared as master of ceremonies in the 1920s and 1930s, directing a radio program over the original WABC , and organizing benefit reviews for various causes."

        "content": "In 1948, producer Marlo Lewis convinced the CBS network to hire Sullivan to do a weekly Sunday-night TV variety show, Toast of the Town, which later became The Ed Sullivan Show. Debuting in June 1948, the show was originally broadcast from the Maxine Elliott Theatre on West 39th Street in New York City. In January 1953, it moved to CBS-TV Studio 50, at 1697 Broadway in New York City, which in 1967 was renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater . From 1936 to 1950, Studio 50 was a CBS Radio playhouse. Before that it was variously known as Manhattan Theatre, Billy Rose's Music Hall, and Hammerstein's Theatre . Television critics gave the new show and its host poor reviews. Harriet Van Horne alleged that \"he got where he is not by having a personality, but by having no personality.\" Sullivan had little acting ability; in 1967, 20 years after his show's debut, Time magazine asked, \"What exactly is Ed Sullivan's talent?\" His mannerisms on camera were so awkward that some viewers believed the host suffered from Bell's palsy. Time in 1955 stated that Sullivan resembled \"Yet,\" the magazine concluded, \"instead of frightening children, Ed Sullivan charms the whole family.\" Sullivan appeared to the audience as an average guy who brought the great acts of show business to their home televisions. \"Ed Sullivan will last\", comedian Fred Allen said, \"as long as someone else has talent.\" Frequent guest Alan King said, \"Ed does nothing, but he does it better than anyone else in television.\" A typical show would feature a vaudeville act , one or two popular comedians, a singing star, a hot jukebox favorite, a figure from the legitimate theater, and for the kids, a visit with puppet \"Topo Gigio, the little Italian mouse\", or a popular athlete. The bill was often international in scope, with many European performers augmenting the American artists. Sullivan had a healthy sense of humor about himself and permitted\u2014even encouraged\u2014impersonators such as John Byner, Frank Gorshin, Rich Little, and especially Will Jordan, to imitate him on his show. Johnny Carson also did a fair impression, and even Joan Rivers imitated Sullivan's unique posture. The impressionists exaggerated his stiffness, raised shoulders, and nasal tenor phrasing, along with some of his commonly used introductions, such as \"And now, right here on our stage...\", \"For all you youngsters out there...\", and \"a really big shew\" . The latter phrase was in fact in the exclusive domain of his impressionists, as Sullivan never actually spoke the phrase \"really big show\" in the opening introduction of any episode in the entire history of the series. Will Jordan portrayed Sullivan in the films I Wanna Hold Your Hand, The Buddy Holly Story, The Doors, Mr. Saturday Night, Down with Love, and in the 1979 TV movie Elvis. Sullivan played himself parodying his mannerisms as directed by Jerry Lewis in Lewis' 1964 film The Patsy. Sullivan inspired a song in the musical Bye Bye Birdie, and in 1963, appeared as himself in the film. In 1954, Sullivan was a co-host on a memorable TV musical special, General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein."

        "content": "Sullivan was quoted as saying \"In the conduct of my own show, I've never asked a performer his religion, his race or his politics. Performers are engaged on the basis of their abilities. I believe that this is another quality of our show that has helped win it a wide and loyal audience.\" Although he was wary of Elvis Presley's \"bad boy\" image, and initially said that he would never book him, Presley became too big a name to ignore; in 1956, Sullivan signed him for three appearances. In August 1956, Sullivan was injured in an automobile accident near his country home in Southbury, Connecticut, and missed Presley's first appearance on September 9. Charles Laughton wound up introducing Presley on the Sullivan hour. When Ed returned to the show, audiences noticed a change in his voice. After Sullivan got to know Presley personally, he made amends by telling his audience, \"This is a real decent, fine boy.\" Sullivan's failure to scoop the TV industry with Presley made him determined to get the next big sensation first. In November 1963, while in Heathrow Airport, Sullivan witnessed Beatlemania firsthand as the band returned from Sweden and the terminal was overrun by screaming teens. At first Sullivan was reluctant to book the Beatles because the band did not have a commercially successful single released in the US at the time, but at the behest of a friend, legendary impresario Sid Bernstein, Sullivan signed the group. Their initial Sullivan show appearance on February 9, 1964, was the most-watched program in TV history to that point. The Beatles appeared three more times in person, and submitted filmed performances afterwards. The Dave Clark Five, who claimed a \"cleaner\" image than the Beatles, made 13 appearances on the show, more than any other UK group. Unlike many shows of the time, Sullivan asked that most musical acts perform their music live, rather than lip-synching to their recordings. Examination of performances shows that exceptions were made, as when a microphone could not be placed close enough to a performer for technical reasons. An example was B.J. Thomas' 1969 performance of \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\", in which actual water was sprinkled on him as a special effect. In 1969, Sullivan presented the Jackson 5 with their first single \"I Want You Back\", which ousted the B.J. Thomas song from the top spot of Billboard's pop charts. Sullivan had an appreciation for African American talent. According to biographer Gerald Nachman, \"Most TV variety shows welcomed 'acceptable' black superstars like Louis Armstrong, Pearl Bailey and Sammy Davis Jr. ... but in the early 1950s, long before it was fashionable, Sullivan was presenting the much more obscure black entertainers he had enjoyed in Harlem on his uptown rounds\u2014 legends like Peg Leg Bates, Pigmeat Markham and Tim Moore ... strangers to white America.\" He hosted pioneering TV appearances by Bo Diddley, the Platters, Brook Benton, Jackie Wilson, Fats Domino, and numerous Motown acts, including the Supremes, who appeared 17 times. As the critic John Leonard wrote, \"There wasn't an important black artist who didn't appear on Ed's show.\" He defied pressure to exclude African American entertainers, and to avoid interacting with them when they did appear. \"Sullivan had to fend off his hard-won sponsor, Ford's Lincoln dealers, after kissing Pearl Bailey on the cheek and daring to shake Nat King Cole's hand,\" Nachman wrote.  According to biographer Jerry Bowles, \"Sullivan once had a Ford executive thrown out of the theatre when he suggested that Sullivan stop booking so many black acts. And a dealer in Cleveland told him 'We realize that you got to have niggers on your show. But do you have to put your arm around Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson at the end of his dance?' Sullivan had to be physically restrained from beating the man to a pulp.\"  Sullivan later raised money to help pay for Robinson's funeral.  \"As a Catholic, it was inevitable that I would despise intolerance, because Catholics suffered more than their share of it,\" he told an interviewer. \"As I grew up, the causes of minorities were part and parcel of me. Negroes and Jews were the minority causes closest at hand. I need no urging to take a plunge in and help.\" At a time when television had not yet embraced Country and Western music, Sullivan featured Nashville performers on his program. This, in turn, paved the way for shows such as Hee Haw, and variety shows hosted by Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell, and other country singers. The Canadian comedy duo Wayne & Shuster made the most appearances of any act throughout the show's run, 67 appearances between 1958 and 1969. Sullivan appeared as himself on other television programs, including an April 1958 episode of the Howard Duff and Ida Lupino CBS situation comedy Mr. Adams and Eve. On September 14, 1958, Sullivan appeared on What's My Line? as a mystery guest, and showed his comedic side by donning a rubber mask. In 1961, Sullivan was asked by CBS to fill in for an ailing Red Skelton on The Red Skelton Show. Sullivan took Skelton's roles in the various comedy sketches; Skelton's hobo character \"Freddie the Freeloader\" was renamed \"Eddie the Freeloader.\""

I flare up, then I go around apologizing.\"  \"Armed with an Irish temper and thin skin,\" wrote Nachman, \"Ed brought to his feuds a hunger for combat fed by his coverage of, and devotion to, boxing.\" Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Jackie Mason, and Jim Morrison were parties to some of Sullivan's most storied conflicts. For his second Sullivan appearance in 1955, Bo Diddley planned to sing his namesake hit, \"Bo Diddley\", but Sullivan told him to perform Tennessee Ernie Ford's song \"Sixteen Tons\". \"That would have been the end of my career right there,\" Diddley told his biographer, so he sang \"Bo Diddley\" anyway. Sullivan was enraged: \"You're the first black boy that ever double-crossed me on the show,\" Diddley quoted him as saying. \"We didn't have much to do with each other after that.\"  Later, Diddley resented that Elvis Presley, whom he accused of copying his revolutionary style and beat, received the attention and accolades on Sullivan's show that he felt were rightfully his. \"I am owed,\" he said, \"and I never got paid.\"  \"He might have,\" wrote Nachman, \"had things gone smoother with Sullivan.\" Buddy Holly and the Crickets first appeared on the Sullivan show in 1957 to an enthusiastic response. For their second appearance in January 1958, Sullivan considered the lyrics of their chosen number \"Oh, Boy!\" too suggestive, and ordered Holly to substitute another song. Holly responded that he had already told his hometown friends in Texas that he would be singing \"Oh, Boy!\" for them. Sullivan, unaccustomed to having his instructions questioned, angrily repeated them, but Holly refused to back down. Later, when the band was slow to respond to a summons to the rehearsal stage, Sullivan commented, \"I guess the Crickets are not too excited to be on The Ed Sullivan Show.\"  Holly, still annoyed by Sullivan's attitude, replied, \"I hope they're damn more excited than I am.\"  Sullivan retaliated by cutting them from two numbers to one, then mispronounced Holly's name during the introduction. He also saw to it that Holly's guitar amplifier volume was barely audible, except during his guitar solo. Nevertheless, the band was so well-received that Sullivan was forced to invite them back; Holly responded that Sullivan did not have enough money. Archival photographs taken during the appearance show Holly smirking and ignoring a visibly angry Sullivan. During Jackie Mason's October 1964 performance on a show that had been shortened by ten minutes due to an address by President Lyndon Johnson, Sullivan\u2014on-stage but off-camera\u2014signaled Mason that he had two minutes left by holding up two fingers.  Sullivan's signal distracted the studio audience, and to television viewers unaware of the circumstances, it seemed as though Mason's jokes were falling flat. Mason, in a bid to regain the audience's attention, cried, \"I'm getting fingers here!\" and made his own frantic hand gesture: \"Here's a finger for you!\" Videotapes of the incident are inconclusive as to whether Mason's upswept hand was intended to be an indecent gesture, but Sullivan was convinced that it was, and banned Mason from future appearances on the program. Mason later insisted that he did not know what the \"middle finger\" meant, and that he did not make the gesture anyway. In September 1965, Sullivan\u2014who, according to Mason, was \"deeply apologetic\"\u2014brought Mason on the show for a \"surprise grand reunion\". \"He said they were old pals,\" Nachman wrote, \"news to Mason, who never got a repeat invitation.\"  Mason added that his earning power \"...was cut right in half after that. I never really worked my way back until I opened on Broadway in 1986.\" When the Byrds performed on December 12, 1965, David Crosby got into a shouting match with the show's director. They were never asked to return. Sullivan decided that \"Girl, we couldn't get much higher\", from the Doors' signature song \"Light My Fire\", was too overt a reference to drug use, and directed that the lyric be changed to \"Girl, we couldn't get much better\" for the group's September 1967 appearance. The band members \"nodded their assent\", according to Doors biographer Ben Fong-Torres, then sang the song as written. After the broadcast, producer Bob Precht told the group, \"Mr. Sullivan wanted you for six more shows, but you'll never work the Ed Sullivan Show again.\"  Jim Morrison replied, \"Hey, man, we just did the Ed Sullivan Show.\" The Rolling Stones famously capitulated during their fifth appearance on the show, in 1967, when Mick Jagger was told to change the titular lyric of \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" to \"Let's spend some time together\". \"But Jagger prevailed,\" wrote Nachman, by deliberately calling attention to the censorship, rolling his eyes, mugging, and drawing out the word \"t-i-i-i-me\" as he sang the revised lyric. Sullivan was angered by the insubordination, but the Stones did make one additional appearance on the show, in 1969. Moe Howard of the Three Stooges recalled in 1975 that Sullivan had a memory problem of sorts: \"Ed was a very nice man, but for a showman, quite forgetful. On our first appearance, he introduced us as the Three Ritz Brothers. He got out of it by adding, 'who look more like the Three Stooges to me'.\" Joe DeRita, who worked with the Stooges after 1959, had commented that Sullivan had a personality \"like the bottom of a bird cage.\" Diana Ross, who was very fond of Sullivan, later recalled Sullivan's forgetfulness during the many occasions the Supremes performed on his show. In a 1995 appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman , Ross stated, \"he could never remember our names. He called us 'the girls'.\" In a 1990 press conference, Paul McCartney recalled meeting Sullivan again in the early 1970s. Sullivan apparently had no idea who McCartney was. McCartney tried to remind Sullivan that he was one of the Beatles, but Sullivan obviously could not remember, and nodding and smiling, simply shook McCartney's hand and left. In an interview with Howard Stern around 2012, Joan Rivers said that Sullivan had been suffering from dementia toward the end of his life."

        "content": "Sullivan, like many American entertainers, was pulled into the Cold War anticommunism of the late 1940s and 1950s. Tap dancer Paul Draper's scheduled January 1950 appearance on Toast of the Town met with opposition from Hester McCullough, an activist in the hunt for \"subversives\". Branding Draper a Communist Party \"sympathizer\", she demanded that Sullivan's lead sponsor, the Ford Motor Company, cancel Draper's appearance. Draper denied the charge, and appeared on the show as scheduled. Ford received over a thousand angry letters and telegrams, and Sullivan was obliged to promise Ford's advertising agency, Kenyon & Eckhardt, that he would avoid controversial guests going forward. Draper was forced to move to Europe to earn a living. After the Draper incident, Sullivan began to work closely with Theodore Kirkpatrick of the anti-Communist Counterattack newsletter. He would consult Kirkpatrick if  any questions came up regarding a potential guest's political leanings. Sullivan wrote in his June 21, 1950, Daily News column that \"Kirkpatrick has sat in my living room on several occasions and listened attentively to performers eager to secure a certification of loyalty.\" Cold War repercussions manifested in a different way when Bob Dylan was booked to appear in May 1963. His chosen song was \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\", which poked fun at the ultraconservative John Birch Society and its tendency to see Communist conspiracies in many situations. No concern was voiced by anyone, including Sullivan, during rehearsals; but on the day of the broadcast, CBS's Standards and Practices department rejected the song, fearing that lyrics equating the Society's views with those of Adolf Hitler might trigger a defamation lawsuit. Dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song, but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice, he would rather not appear at all. The story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed; Sullivan denounced the network's decision in published interviews. Sullivan butted heads with Standards and Practices on other occasions, as well. In 1956, Ingrid Bergman\u2014who had been living in \"exile\" in Europe since 1950 in the wake of her scandalous love affair with director Roberto Rossellini while they were both married\u2014was planning a return to Hollywood as the star of Anastasia. Sullivan, confident that the American public would welcome her back, invited her to appear on his show and flew to Europe to film an interview with Bergman, Yul Brynner, and Helen Hayes on the Anastasia set. When he arrived back in New York, Standards and Practices informed Sullivan that under no circumstances would Bergman be permitted to appear on the show, either live or on film. Sullivan's prediction later proved correct, as Bergman won her second Academy Award for her portrayal, as well as the forgiveness of her fans."

Weinstein tried to tell her Jewish family she was dating a man named Ed Solomon, but her brother figured out she meant Ed Sullivan. With both families strongly opposed to a Catholic\u2013Jewish marriage, the affair was on-again-off-again for three years. They were finally married on April 28, 1930, in a City Hall ceremony, and 8 months later Sylvia gave birth to Elizabeth , named after Sullivan's mother, who had died that year. The Sullivans rented a suite of rooms at the Hotel Delmonico in 1944 after living at the Hotel Astor on Times Square for many years. Sullivan rented a suite next door to the family suite, which he used as an office until The Ed Sullivan Show was canceled in 1971. Sullivan was in the habit of calling his wife after every program to get her immediate critique. The Sullivans were always \"on the town\", eating out five nights a week at some of the trendiest clubs and restaurants, including the Stork Club, Danny's Hide-A-Way and Jimmy Kelly's. Sullivan socialized with the rich and famous, was friends with U.S. Presidents and was given audiences with several Popes. In 1952, Betty Sullivan married the Ed Sullivan Show's producer, Bob Precht. From the Prechts, Ed had five grandchildren\u2014Robert Edward, Carla Elizabeth, Vincent Henry, Andrew Sullivan and Margo Elizabeth. The Sullivan and Precht families were very close; Betty died on June 7, 2014, aged 83."

Although the Sullivan show was seen live in the Central and Eastern time zones, it was taped for airing in the Pacific and Mountain time zones. Excerpts have been released on home video, and posted on the official Ed Sullivan Show YouTube Channel. By 1971, the show's ratings had plummeted. In an effort to refresh its lineup, CBS canceled the program in March 1971, along with some of its other long running shows throughout the 1970\u20131971 season . Angered, Sullivan refused to host three more months of scheduled shows. They were replaced by reruns and a final program without him aired in June. He remained with the network in various other capacities and hosted a 25th anniversary special in June 1973. In early September 1974, Sullivan was diagnosed with an advanced stage of esophageal cancer. Doctors gave him very little time to live, and the family chose to keep the diagnosis secret from him. Sullivan, believing his ailment to be yet another complication from a long-standing battle with gastric ulcers, died five weeks later on October 13, 1974, at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital, two weeks after his 73rd birthday. His funeral was attended by 3,000 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, on a cold, rainy day. Sullivan is interred in a crypt at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Sullivan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd."

According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell on his face and laughed when God imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. He laughed because Sarah was past the age of childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age. Later, when Sarah overheard three messengers of the Lord renew the promise, she laughed inwardly for the same reason. Sarah denied laughing when God questioned Abraham about it."

In response, Abraham began to laugh, as both he and Sarah were well beyond natural child-bearing age. Some time later, three men who Abraham identifies as messengers of God visit him and Sarah, and Abraham treats them to food and nuptials. They repeat the prophecy that Sarah would bear a child, promising Isaac's birth within a year's time, at which point Sarah laughs in disbelief. God questions why the pair laughed in disbelief at his words, and if it is because they believe such things were not within his power. Now afraid, they futilely deny ever having laughed at God's words. Time passes as Isaac is born. Although this was Abraham's second son it was Sarah's first and only child. On the eighth day from his birth, Isaac was circumcised, as was necessary for all males of Abraham's household, in order to be in compliance with Yahweh's covenant. After Isaac had been weaned, Sarah saw Ishmael mocking, and urged her husband to cast out Hagar the bondservant and her son, so that Isaac would be Abraham's sole heir. Abraham was hesitant, but at God's order he listened to his wife's request."

The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac. The sacrifice of Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac, called the aqedah . According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac as an agent of God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law. According to the Jewish tradition, Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer. This tradition is based on Genesis chapter 24, verse 63 . Isaac was the only patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God told him not to do so. Rabbinic tradition gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as a sacrifice may not leave the Land of Israel. Isaac was the oldest of the biblical patriarchs at the time of his death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed. Rabbinic literature also linked Isaac's blindness in old age, as stated in the Bible, to the sacrificial binding: Isaac's eyes went blind because the tears of angels present at the time of his sacrifice fell on Isaac's eyes."

Tertullian draws a parallel between Isaac's bearing the wood for the sacrificial fire with Christ's carrying his cross. and there was a general agreement that, while all the sacrifices of the Old Law were anticipations of that on Calvary, the sacrifice of Isaac was so \"in a pre-eminent way\". The Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church consider Isaac as a saint along with other biblical patriarchs. Along with those of other patriarchs and the Old Testament Righteous, his feast day is celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine rite of the Catholic Church on the Second Sunday before Christmas , under the title the Sunday of the Forefathers."

Paul contrasted Isaac, symbolizing Christian liberty, with the rejected older son Ishmael, symbolizing slavery; Hagar is associated with the Sinai covenant, while Sarah is associated with the covenant of grace, into which her son Isaac enters. The Epistle of James chapter 2, verses 21\u201324, states that the sacrifice of Isaac shows that justification requires both faith and works. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, Abraham's willingness to follow God's command to sacrifice Isaac is used as an example of faith as is Isaac's action in blessing Jacob and Esau with reference to the future promised by God to Abraham. In verse 19, the author views the release of Isaac from sacrifice as analogous to the resurrection of Jesus, the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac being a prefigurement of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross."

Isaac, along with Ishmael, is highly important for Muslims for continuing to preach the message of monotheism after his father Abraham. Among Isaac's children was the follow-up Israelite patriarch Jacob, who is also venerated as an Islamic prophet. Isaac is mentioned seventeen times by name in the Quran, often with his father and his son, Jacob. The Quran states that Abraham received \"good tidings of Isaac, a prophet, of the righteous\", and that God blessed them both . In a fuller description, when angels came to Abraham to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on Sodom and Gomorrah, his wife, Sarah, \"laughed, and We gave her good tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac of Jacob\" ; and it is further explained that this event will take place despite Abraham and Sarah's old age. Several verses speak of Isaac as a \"gift\" to Abraham , and 24: 26\u201327 adds that God made \"prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring\", which has been interpreted to refer to Abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson Jacob, and his prophetic great-grandson Joseph. In the Quran, it later narrates that Abraham also praised God for giving him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age . Elsewhere in the Quran, Isaac is mentioned in lists: Joseph follows the religion of his forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and speaks of God's favor to them ; Jacob's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the God that their forefathers, \"Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac\", worshiped ; and the Quran commands Muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to \"Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs\" . In the Quran's narrative of Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son , the name of the son is not mentioned and debate has continued over the son's identity, though many feel that the identity is the least important element in a story which is given to show the courage that one develops through faith."

At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern Philistia with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 . Albrecht Alt and Martin Noth hold that, \"The figure of Isaac was enhanced when the theme of promise, previously bound to the cults of the 'God the Fathers' was incorporated into the Israelite creed during the southern-Palestinian stage of the growth of the Pentateuch tradition.\" According to Martin Noth, at the Southern Palestinian stage of the growth of the Pentateuch tradition, Isaac became established as one of the biblical patriarchs, but his traditions were receded in the favor of Abraham."

He played his entire 19-year Major League Baseball career, primarily as a left fielder, for the Boston Red Sox from 1939 to 1960; his career was interrupted by military service during World War II and the Korean War. Nicknamed \"Teddy Ballgame\", \"The Kid\", \"The Splendid Splinter\",  and \"The Thumper\", Williams is regarded as one of the greatest hitters in baseball history and to date is the last player to hit over .400 in a season. Williams was a nineteen-time All-Star, a two-time recipient of the American League Most Valuable Player Award, a six-time AL batting champion, and a two-time Triple Crown winner. He finished his playing career with a .344 batting average, 521 home runs, and a .482 on-base percentage, the highest of all time. His career batting average is the highest of any MLB player whose career was played primarily in the live-ball era, and ranks tied for 7th all-time . Born and raised in San Diego, Williams played baseball throughout his youth. After joining the Red Sox in 1939, he immediately emerged as one of the sport's best hitters. In 1941, Williams posted a .406 batting average; he is the last MLB player to bat over .400 in a season. He followed this up by winning his first Triple Crown in 1942. Williams was required to interrupt his baseball career in 1943 to serve three years in the United States Navy and Marine Corps during World War II. Upon returning to MLB in 1946, Williams won his first AL MVP Award and played in his only World Series. In 1947, he won his second Triple Crown. Williams was returned to active military duty for portions of the 1952 and 1953 seasons to serve as a Marine combat aviator in the Korean War. In 1957 and 1958 at the ages of 39 and 40, respectively, he was the AL batting champion for the fifth and sixth time. Williams retired from playing in 1960. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966, in his first year of eligibility. Williams managed the Washington Senators/Texas Rangers franchise from 1969 to 1972. An avid sport fisherman, he hosted a television program about fishing, and was inducted into the IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame. Williams's involvement in the Jimmy Fund helped raise millions in dollars for cancer care and research. In 1991 President George H. W. Bush presented Williams with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award bestowed by the United States government. He was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Time Team in 1997 and the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999."

His father was a soldier, sheriff, and photographer from Ardsley, New York, while his mother, May Venzor, a Spanish-Mexican-American from El Paso, Texas, was an evangelist and lifelong soldier in the Salvation Army. Williams resented his mother's long hours working in the Salvation Army, and Williams and his brother cringed when she took them to the Army's street-corner revivals. Williams's paternal ancestors were a mix of Welsh, English, and Irish. The maternal, Spanish-Mexican side of Williams's family was quite diverse, having Spanish , Russian, and American Indian roots. Of his Mexican ancestry he said that \"If I had my mother's name, there is no doubt I would have run into problems in those days, [considering] the prejudices people had in Southern California\". Williams lived in San Diego's North Park neighborhood . At the age of 8, he was taught how to throw a baseball by his uncle, Saul Venzor. Saul was one of his mother's four brothers, as well as a former semi-professional baseball player who had pitched against Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe Gordon in an exhibition game. As a child, Williams's heroes were Pepper Martin of the St. Louis Cardinals and Bill Terry of the New York Giants. Williams graduated from Herbert Hoover High School in San Diego, where he played baseball as a pitcher and was the star of the team. During this time, he also played American Legion Baseball, later being named the 1960 American Legion Baseball Graduate of the Year. Though he had offers from the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees while he was still in high school, his mother thought he was too young to leave home, so he signed up with the local minor league club, the San Diego Padres."

        "content": "Throughout his career, Williams stated his goal was to have people point to him and remark, \"There goes Ted Williams, the greatest hitter who ever lived.\" Minor leagues Williams played back-up behind Vince DiMaggio and Ivey Shiver on the Pacific Coast League San Diego Padres. While in the Pacific Coast League in 1936, Williams met future teammates and friends Dom DiMaggio and Bobby Doerr, who were on the Pacific Coast League's San Francisco Seals. When Shiver announced he was quitting to become a high school football coach in Savannah, Georgia, the job, by default, was open for Williams. Williams posted a .271 batting average on 107 at bats in 42 games for the Padres in 1936. Unknown to Williams, he had caught the eye of the Boston Red Sox's general manager, Eddie Collins, while Collins was scouting Bobby Doerr and the shortstop George Myatt in August 1936. Collins later explained, \"It wasn't hard to find Ted Williams. He stood out like a brown cow in a field of white cows.\" In the 1937 season, after graduating from Hoover High in the winter, Williams finally broke into the line-up on June 22, when he hit an inside-the-park home run to help the Padres win 3\u20132. The Padres ended up winning the PCL title, while Williams ended up hitting .291 with 23 home runs. Meanwhile, Collins kept in touch with Padres general manager Bill Lane, calling him two times throughout the season. In December 1937, during the winter meetings, the deal was made between Lane and Collins, sending Williams to the Boston Red Sox and giving Lane $35,000 and two major leaguers, Dom D'Allessandro and Al Niemiec, and two other minor leaguers. In 1938, the 19-year-old Williams was 10 days late to spring training camp in Sarasota, Florida, because of a flood in California that blocked the railroads. Williams had to borrow $200 from a bank to make the trip from San Diego to Sarasota. Also during spring training Williams was nicknamed \"The Kid\" by Red Sox equipment manager Johnny Orlando, who after Williams arrived to Sarasota for the first time, said, \"The Kid' has arrived\". Orlando still called Williams \"The Kid\" 20 years later, and the nickname stuck with Williams the rest of his life. Williams remained in major league spring training for about a week. Williams was then sent to the Double-A-league Minneapolis Millers. While in the Millers training camp for the springtime, Williams met Rogers Hornsby, who had hit over .400 three times, including a .424 average in 1924. Hornsby, who was a coach for the Millers that spring, gave Williams useful advice, including how to \"get a good pitch to hit\". Talking with the game's greats would become a pattern for Williams, who also talked with Hugh Duffy, who hit .438 in 1894, Bill Terry who hit .401 in 1930, and Ty Cobb with whom he would argue that a batter should hit up on the ball, opposed to Cobb's view that a batter should hit down on the ball. While in Minnesota, Williams quickly became the team's star. He collected his first hit in the Millers' first game of the season, as well as his first and second home runs during his third game. Both were inside-the-park home runs, with the second traveling an estimated  on the fly to a  center field fence. Williams later had a 22 game hitting streak that lasted from Memorial Day through mid-June. While the Millers ended up sixth place in an eight-team race, Williams ended up hitting .366 with 46 home runs and 142 RBIs. He received the American Association's Triple Crown and finished second in the voting for Most Valuable Player."

        "content": "Williams came to spring training three days late in 1939, thanks to Williams driving from California to Florida, as well as respiratory problems, the latter of which would plague Williams for the rest of his career. In the winter, the Red Sox traded right fielder Ben Chapman to the Cleveland Indians to make room for Williams on the roster, even though Chapman had hit .340 in the previous season. This led Boston Globe sports journalist Gerry Moore to quip, \"Not since Joe DiMaggio broke in with the Yankees by \"five for five\" in St. Petersburg in 1936 has any baseball rookie received the nationwide publicity that has been accorded this spring to Theodore Francis Williams\". Williams inherited Chapman's number 9 on his uniform as opposed to Williams's number 5 in the previous spring training. He made his major league debut against the New York Yankees on April 20, going 1-for-4 against Yankee pitcher Red Ruffing. This was the only game which featured both Williams and Lou Gehrig playing against one another. In his first series at Fenway Park, Williams hit a double, a home run, and a triple, the first two against Cotton Pippen, who gave Williams his first strikeout as a professional while Williams had been in San Diego. By July, Williams was hitting just .280, but leading the league in RBIs. Johnny Orlando, now Williams's friend, then gave Williams a quick pep talk, telling Williams that he should hit .335 with 35 home runs and he would drive in 150 runs. Williams said he would buy Orlando a Cadillac if this all came true. Williams ended up hitting .327 with 31 home runs and 145 RBIs, leading the league in the latter category, the first rookie to lead the league in RBIs and finishing fourth in MVP voting. He also led the AL in walks, with 107, a rookie record. Even though there was not a Rookie of the Year award yet in 1939, Babe Ruth declared Williams to be the Rookie of the Year, which Williams later said was \"good enough for me\". Williams's pay doubled in 1940, going from $5,000 to $10,000. With the addition of a new bullpen in right field of Fenway Park, which reduced the distance from home plate from 400 feet to 380 feet, the bullpen was nicknamed \"Williamsburg\", because the new addition was \"obviously designed for Williams\". Williams was then switched from right field to left field, as there would be less sun in his eyes, and it would give Dom DiMaggio a chance to play. Finally, Williams was flip-flopped in the order with the great slugger Jimmie Foxx, with the idea that Williams would get more pitches to hit. Pitchers, though, were not afraid to walk him to get to the 33-year-old Foxx, and after that the 34-year-old Joe Cronin, the player-manager. Williams also made his first of 16 All-Star Game appearances in 1940, going 0-for-2. Although Williams hit .344, his power and runs batted in were down from the previous season, with 23 home runs and 113 RBIs. Williams also caused a controversy in mid-August when he called his salary \"peanuts\", along with saying he hated the city of Boston and reporters, leading reporters to lash back at him, saying that he should be traded. Williams said that the \"only real fun\" he had in 1940 was being able to pitch once on August 24, when he pitched the last two innings in a 12\u20131 loss to the Detroit Tigers, allowing one earned run on three hits, while striking out one batter, Rudy York."

        "content": "In the second week of spring training in 1941, Williams broke a bone in his right ankle, limiting him to pinch hitting for the first two weeks of the season. Bobby Doerr later claimed that the injury would be the foundation of Williams's season, as it forced him to put less pressure on his right foot for the rest of the season. Against the Chicago White Sox on May 7, in extra innings, Williams told the Red Sox pitcher, Charlie Wagner, to hold the White Sox, since he was going to hit a home run. In the 11th inning, Williams's prediction came true, as he hit a big blast to help the Red Sox win. The home run is still considered to be the longest home run ever hit in the old Comiskey Park, some saying that it went . Williams's average slowly climbed in the first half of May, and on May 15, he started a 22-game hitting streak. From May 17 to June 1, Williams batted .536, with his season average going above .400 on May 25 and then continuing up to .430. By the All-Star break, Williams was hitting .406 with 62 RBIs and 16 home runs. In the 1941 All-Star Game, Williams batted fourth behind Joe DiMaggio, who was in the midst of his record-breaking hitting streak, having hit safely in 48 consecutive games. In the fourth inning Williams doubled to drive in a run. With the National League leading 5\u20132 in the eighth inning, Williams struck out in the middle of an American League rally. In the ninth inning the AL still trailed 5\u20133; Ken Keltner and Joe Gordon singled, and Cecil Travis walked to load the bases. DiMaggio grounded to the infield and Billy Herman, attempting to complete a double play, threw wide of first base, allowing Keltner to score. With the score 5\u20134 and runners on first and third, Williams homered with his eyes closed to secure a 7\u20135 AL win. Williams later said that that game-winning home run \"remains to this day the most thrilling hit of my life\". In late August, Williams was hitting .402. Williams said that \"just about everybody was rooting for me\" to hit .400 in the season, including Yankee fans, who gave pitcher Lefty Gomez a \"hell of a boo\" after walking Williams with the bases loaded after Williams had gotten three straight hits one game in September. In mid-September, Williams was hitting .413, but dropped a point a game from then on. Before the final two games on September 28, a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics, he was batting .39955, which would have been officially rounded up to .400. Red Sox manager Joe Cronin offered him the chance to sit out the final day, but he declined. \"If I'm going to be a .400 hitter\", he said at the time, \"I want more than my toenails on the line.\" Williams went 6-for-8 on the day, finishing the season at .406. Philadelphia fans ran out on the field to surround Williams after the game, forcing him to protect his hat from being stolen; he was helped into the clubhouse by his teammates. Along with his .406 average, Williams also hit 37 home runs and batted in 120 runs, missing the triple crown by five RBI. Williams's 1941 season is often considered to be the best offensive season of all time, though the MVP award would go to DiMaggio. The .406 batting average\u2014his first of six batting championships\u2014is still the highest single-season average in Red Sox history and the highest batting average in the major leagues since 1924, and the last time any major league player has hit over .400 for a season after averaging at least 3.1 plate appearances per game.  Williams's on-base percentage of .553 and slugging percentage of .735 that season are both also the highest single-season averages in Red Sox history. The .553 OBP stood as a major league record until it was broken by Barry Bonds in 2002 and his .735 slugging percentage was the highest mark in the major leagues between 1932 and 1994. His OPS of 1.287 that year, a Red Sox record, was the highest in the major leagues between 1923 and 2001. Despite playing in only 143 games that year, Williams led the league with 135 runs scored and 37 home runs, and he finished third with 335 total bases, the most home runs, runs scored, and total bases by a Red Sox player since Jimmie Foxx's in 1938. Williams placed second in MVP voting; DiMaggio won, 291 votes to 254, on the strength of his record-breaking 56-game hitting streak and league-leading 125 RBI."

A friend of Williams suggested that Williams see the advisor of the governor's Selective Service Appeal Agent, since Williams was the sole support of his mother, arguing that Williams should not have been placed in Class 1-A, and said Williams should be reclassified to Class 3-A. Williams was reclassified to 3-A ten days later. Afterwards, the public reaction was extremely negative, even though the baseball book Season of '42 states only four All-Stars and one first-line pitcher entered military service during the 1942 season.  Quaker Oats stopped sponsoring Williams, and Williams, who previously had eaten Quaker products \"all the time\", never \"[ate] one since\" the company stopped sponsoring him. Despite the trouble with the draft board, Williams had a new salary of $30,000 in 1942. In the season, Williams won the Triple Crown, with a .356 batting average, 36 home runs, and 137 RBIs. On May 21, Williams also hit his 100th career home run. He was the third Red Sox player to hit 100 home runs with the team, following his teammates Jimmie Foxx and Joe Cronin. Despite winning the Triple Crown, Williams came in second in the MVP voting, losing to Joe Gordon of the Yankees. Williams felt that he should have gotten a \"little more consideration\" because of winning the Triple Crown, and he thought that \"the reason I didn't get more consideration was because of the trouble I had with the draft [boards]\". Williams joined the Navy Reserve on May 22, 1942, went on active duty in 1943, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps as a Naval Aviator on May 2, 1944. Williams also played on the baseball team in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, along with his Red Sox teammate Johnny Pesky in pre-flight training, after eight weeks in Amherst, Massachusetts, and the Civilian Pilot Training Course. While on the baseball team, Williams was sent back to Fenway Park on July 12, 1943, to play on an All-Star team managed by Babe Ruth. The newspapers reported that Babe Ruth said when finally meeting Williams, \"Hiya, kid. You remind me a lot of myself. I love to hit. You're one of the most natural ballplayers I've ever seen. And if my record is broken, I hope you're the one to do it\". Williams later said he was \"flabbergasted\" by the incident, as \"after all, it was Babe Ruth\". In the game, Williams hit a 425-foot home run to help give the American League All-Stars a 9\u20138 win."

He joined the Red Sox again in 1946, signing a $37,500 contract. On July 14, after Williams hit three home runs and eight RBIs in the first game of a doubleheader, Lou Boudreau, inspired by Williams's consistent pull hitting to right field, created what would later be known as the Boudreau shift against Williams, having only one player on the left side of second base . Ignoring the shift, Williams walked twice, doubled, and grounded out to the shortstop, who was positioned in between first and second base. Also during 1946, the All-Star Game was held in Fenway Park. In the game, Williams homered in the fourth inning against Kirby Higbe, singled in a run in the fifth inning, singled in the seventh inning, and hit a three-run home run against Rip Sewell's \"eephus pitch\" in the eighth inning to help the American League win 12\u20130. For the 1946 season, Williams hit .342 with 38 home runs and 123 RBIs, helping the Red Sox win the pennant on September 13. During the season, Williams hit the only inside-the-park home run in his Major League career in a September 1\u20130 win at Cleveland, and in June hit what is considered the longest home run in Fenway Park history, at  and subsequently marked with a lone red seat in the Fenway bleachers. Williams ran away as the winner in the MVP voting. During an exhibition game in Fenway Park against an All-Star team during early October, Williams was hit on the elbow by a curveball by the Washington Senators' pitcher Mickey Haefner. Williams was immediately taken out of the game, and X-rays of his arm showed no damage, but his arm was \"swelled up like a boiled egg\", according to Williams. Williams could not swing a bat again until four days later, one day before the World Series, when he reported the arm as \"sore\". During the series, Williams batted .200, going 5-for-25 with no home runs and just one RBI. The Red Sox lost in seven games, with Williams going 0-for-4 in the last game. Fifty years later when asked what one thing he would have done different in his life, Williams replied, \"I'd have done better in the '46 World Series. God, I would\". The 1946 World Series was the only World Series Williams ever appeared in. Williams signed a $70,000 contract in 1947. Williams was also almost traded for Joe DiMaggio in 1947. In late April, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey and Yankees owner Dan Topping agreed to swap the players, but a day later canceled the deal when Yawkey requested that Yogi Berra come with DiMaggio. In May, Williams was hitting .337. Williams won the Triple Crown in 1947, but lost the MVP award to Joe DiMaggio, 202 points to 201 points. One writer left Williams off his ballot. Williams thought it was Mel Webb, whom Williams called a \"grouchy old guy\", although it now appears it was not Webb. Through 2011, Williams was one of seven major league players to have had at least four 30-home run and 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ralph Kiner, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, and Ryan Braun. In 1948, under their new manager, Joe McCarthy, Williams hit a league-leading .369 with 25 home runs and 127 RBIs, and was third in MVP voting. On April 29, Williams hit his 200th career home run. He became just the second player to hit 200 home runs in a Red Sox uniform, joining his former teammate Jimmie Foxx. On October 2, against the Yankees, Williams hit his 222nd career home run, tying Foxx for the Red Sox all-time record. In the Red Sox' final two games of the regular schedule, they beat the Yankees and Williams got on base eight times out of ten plate appearances. In the playoff, Williams went 1-for-4, with the Red Sox losing 8\u20133. In 1949, Williams received a new salary of $100,000 . He hit .343 , hitting 43 home runs, his career high, and driving in 159 runs, tied for highest in the league, and at one point, he got on base in 84 straight games, an MLB record that still stands today, helping him win the MVP trophy. On April 28, Williams hit his 223rd career home run, breaking the record for most home runs in a Red Sox uniform, passing Jimmie Foxx. Williams is still the Red Sox career home run leader. However, despite being ahead of the Yankees by one game just before a 2-game series against them , the Red Sox lost both of those games. The Yankees won the first of what would be five straight World Series titles in 1949. For the rest of Williams's career, the Yankees won nine pennants and six World Series titles, while the Red Sox never finished better than third place."

In the first inning, Williams caught a line drive by Ralph Kiner, slamming into the Comiskey Park scoreboard and breaking his left arm. Williams played the rest of the game, and he even singled in a run to give the American League the lead in the fifth inning, but by that time Williams' arm was a \"balloon\" and he was in great pain, so he left the game. Both of the doctors who X-rayed Williams held little hope for a full recovery. The doctors operated on Williams for two hours. When Williams took his cast off, he could only extend the arm to within four inches of his right arm. Williams only played 89 games in 1950. After the baseball season, Williams' elbow hurt so much he considered retirement, since he thought he would never be able to hit again. Tom Yawkey, the Red Sox owner, then sent Jack Fadden to Williams' Florida home to talk to Williams. Williams later thanked Fadden for saving his career. In 1951, Williams \"struggled\" to hit .318, with his elbow still hurting. Williams also played in 148 games, 60 more than Williams had played the previous season, 30 home runs, two more than he had hit in 1950, and 126 RBIs, twenty-nine more than 1950. Despite his lower-than-usual production at bat, Williams made the All-Star team. On May 15, 1951, Williams became the 11th player in major league history to hit 300 career home runs. On May 21, Williams passed Chuck Klein for 10th place, on May 25 Williams passed Hornsby for ninth place, and on July 5 Williams passed Al Simmons for eighth place all-time in career home runs. After the season, manager Steve O'Neill was fired, with Lou Boudreau replacing him. Boudreau's first announcement as manager was that all Red Sox players were \"expendable\", including Williams. U.S. Marine Corps, Korea Williams's name was called from a list of inactive reserves to serve on active duty in the Korean War on January 9, 1952. Williams, who was livid at his recalling, had a physical scheduled for April 2. Williams passed his physical and in May, after only playing in six major league games, began refresher flight training and qualification prior to service in Korea. Right before he left for Korea, the Red Sox had a \"Ted Williams Day\" in Fenway Park. Friends of Williams gave him a Cadillac, and the Red Sox gave Williams a memory book that was signed by 400,000 fans. The governor of Massachusetts and mayor of Boston were there, along with a Korean War veteran named Frederick Wolf who used a wheelchair for mobility. At the end of the ceremony, everyone in the park held hands and sang \"Auld Lang Syne\" to Williams, a moment which he later said \"moved me quite a bit.\" Private Wolf presented gifts from wounded veterans to Ted Williams. Ted choked and was only able to say,\"...ok kid...\" The Red Sox went on to win the game 5\u20133, thanks to a two-run home run by Williams in the seventh inning. In August 1953, Williams practiced with the Red Sox for ten days before playing in his first game, garnering a large ovation from the crowd and hitting a home run in the eighth inning. In the season, Williams ended up hitting .407 with 13 home runs and 34 RBIs in 37 games and 110 at bats . On September 6, Williams hit his 332nd career home run, passing Hank Greenberg for seventh all-time. On the first day of spring training in 1954, Williams broke his collarbone running after a line drive. Williams was out for six weeks, and in April he wrote an article with Joe Reichler of the Saturday Evening Post saying that he intended to retire at the end of the season. Williams returned to the Red Sox lineup on May 7, and he hit .345 with 386 at bats in 117 games, although Bobby \u00c1vila, who had hit .341, won the batting championship. This was because it was required then that a batter needed 400 at bats, despite Lou Boudreau's attempt to bat Williams second in the lineup to get more at-bats. Williams led the league in base on balls with 136 which kept him from qualifying under the rules at the time. By today's standards he would have been the champion. The rule was changed shortly thereafter to keep this from happening again. On August 25, Williams passed Johnny Mize for sixth place, and on September 3, Williams passed Joe DiMaggio for fifth all-time in career home runs with his 362nd career home run. He finished the season with 366 career home runs. On September 26, Williams \"retired\" after the Red Sox's final game of the season. During the off-season of 1954, Williams was offered the chance to be manager of the Red Sox. Williams declined, and he suggested that Pinky Higgins, who had previously played on the 1946 Red Sox team as the third baseman, become the manager of the team. Higgins later was hired as the Red Sox manager in 1955. Williams sat out the first month of the 1955 season due to a divorce settlement with his wife, Doris. When Williams returned, he signed a $98,000 contract on May 13. Williams batted .356 in 320 at bats on the season, lacking enough at bats to win the batting title over Al Kaline, who batted .340. Williams hit 28 home runs and drove in 83 runs while being named the \"Comeback Player of the Year.\""

Three weeks later at home against the Yankees on August\u00a07, after Williams was booed for dropping a fly ball from Mickey Mantle, he spat at one of the fans who was taunting him on the top of the dugout; Williams was fined $5,000 for the incident. The following night against Baltimore, Williams was greeted by a large ovation, and received an even larger one when he hit a home run in the sixth inning to break a 2\u20132 tie. In The Boston Globe, the publishers ran a \"What Globe Readers Say About Ted\" section made out of letters about Williams, which were either the sportswriters or the \"loud mouths\" in the stands. Williams explained years later, \"From '56 on, I realized that people were for me. The writers had written that the fans should show me they didn't want me, and I got the biggest ovation yet\". Williams lost the batting title to Mickey Mantle in 1956, batting .345 to Mantle's .353, with Mantle on his way to winning the Triple Crown. In 1957, Williams batted .388 to lead the majors, then signed a contract in February 1958 for a record high $125,000 . At age forty that season, he again led the American League with a .328 batting average. When Pumpsie Green became the first black player on the Red Sox\u2014the last major league team to integrate\u2014in 1959, Williams openly welcomed Green. Williams ended his career with a home run in his last at-bat on September 28, 1960. He refused to salute the fans as he returned the dugout after he crossed home plate or after he was replaced in left field by Carroll Hardy. An essay written by John Updike the following month for The New Yorker, \"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu\", chronicles this event. Williams is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades."

        "content": "Williams was an obsessive student of hitting. He famously used a lighter bat than most sluggers, because it generated a faster swing. In 1970 he wrote a book on the subject, The Science of Hitting , which is still read by many baseball players. The book describes his theory of swinging only at pitches that came into ideal areas of his strike zone, a strategy Williams credited with his success as a hitter. Pitchers apparently feared Williams; his bases-on-balls-to-plate-appearances ratio is still the highest of any player in the Hall of Fame. Williams nearly always took the first pitch. He helped pass his expertise of playing left-field in front of the Green Monster to his successor on the Red Sox, Carl Yastrzemski."

        "title": "Ted Williams_Relationship with Boston media and fans",
        "content": "Ted Williams was on uncomfortable terms with the Boston newspapers for nearly twenty years, as he felt they liked to discuss his personal life as much as his baseball performance. He maintained a career-long feud with SPORT magazine due to a 1948 feature article in which the SPORT reporter included a quote from Williams's mother. Insecure about his upbringing, and stubborn because of immense confidence in his own talent, Williams made up his mind that the \"knights of the keyboard\", as he derisively labeled the press, were against him. After having hit for the league's Triple Crown in 1947, Williams narrowly lost the MVP award in a vote where one midwestern newspaper writer left Williams entirely off his ten-player ballot. During his career, some sportswriters also criticized aspects of Williams's baseball performance, including what they viewed as his lackadaisical fielding and lack of clutch hitting. Williams pushed back, saying: \u201cThey\u2019re always saying that I don\u2019t hit in the clutches.\u00a0Well, there are a lot [of games] when I do\u201d.  He also asserted that it made no sense crashing into an outfield wall to try to make a difficult catch because of the risk of injury or being out of position to make the play after missing the ball. He treated most of the press accordingly, as he described in his memoir, My Turn at Bat. Williams also had an uneasy relationship with the Boston fans, though he could be very cordial one-to-one. He felt at times a good deal of gratitude for their passion and their knowledge of the game. On the other hand, Williams was temperamental, high-strung, and at times tactless. In his biography, Ronald Reis relates how Williams committed two fielding miscues in a doubleheader in 1950 and was roundly booed by Boston fans. He bowed three times to various sections of Fenway Park and made an obscene gesture. When he came to bat he spit in the direction of fans near the dugout. The incident caused an avalanche of negative media reaction, and inspired sportswriter Austen Lake's famous comment that when Williams's name was announced the sound was like \"autumn wind moaning through an apple orchard.\" Another incident occurred in 1958 in a game against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he stepped from the batter's box swung his bat violently in anger. The bat slipped from his hands, was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman who turned out to be the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a fit of temper. Williams gave generously to those in need. He was especially linked with the Jimmy Fund of the Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute, which provides support for children's cancer research and treatment. Williams used his celebrity to virtually launch the fund, which raised more than $750\u00a0million between 1948 and 2010. Throughout his career, Williams made countless bedside visits to children being treated for cancer, which Williams insisted go unreported. Often parents of sick children would learn at check-out time that \"Mr. Williams has taken care of your bill.\" The Fund recently stated that, \"Williams would travel everywhere and anywhere, no strings or paychecks attached, to support the cause\u00a0... His name is synonymous with our battle against all forms of cancer.\" Williams demanded loyalty from those around him. He could not forgive the fickle nature of the fans\u00a0\u2013 booing a player for booting a ground ball, and then turning around and roaring approval of the same player for hitting a home run. Despite the cheers and adulation of most of his fans, the occasional boos directed at him in Fenway Park led Williams to stop tipping his cap in acknowledgment after a home run. Williams maintained this policy up to and including his swan song in 1960. After hitting a home run at Fenway Park, which would be his last career at-bat, Williams characteristically refused either to tip his cap as he circled the bases or to respond to prolonged cheers of \"We want Ted!\" from the crowd by making an appearance from the dugout. The Boston manager Pinky Higgins sent Williams to his fielding position in left field to start the ninth inning, but then immediately recalled him for his back-up Carroll Hardy, thus allowing Williams to receive one last ovation as he jogged onto then off the field, and he did so without reacting to the crowd. Williams's aloof attitude led the writer John Updike to observe wryly that \"Gods do not answer letters.\" Williams's final home run did not take place during the final game of the 1960 season, but rather in the Red Sox's last home game that year. The Red Sox played three more games, but they were on the road in New York City and Williams did not appear in any of them, as it became clear that Williams's final home at-bat would be the last one of his career. In 1991 on Ted Williams Day at Fenway Park, Williams pulled a Red Sox cap from out of his jacket and tipped it to the crowd. This was the first time that he had done so since his earliest days as a player. A Red Smith profile from 1956 describes one Boston writer trying to convince Ted Williams that first cheering and then booing a ballplayer was no different from a moviegoer applauding a \"western\" movie actor one day and saying the next \"He stinks! Whatever gave me the idea he could act?\"  Williams rejected this; when he liked a western actor like Hoot Gibson, he liked him in every picture, and would not think of booing him. He once had a friendship with Ty Cobb, with whom he often had discussions about baseball. He often touted Rogers Hornsby as being the greatest right-handed hitter of all time. This assertion actually led to a split in the relationship between Ty Cobb and Ted Williams. Once during one of their yearly debate sessions on the greatest hitters of all time, Williams asserted that Hornsby was one of the greatest of all time. Cobb apparently had strong feelings about Hornsby and he threw a fit, expelling Williams from his hotel room. Their friendship effectively terminated after this altercation. This story was later refuted by Ted Williams himself."

        "content": "Williams served as a Naval Aviator during World War II and the Korean War. Unlike many other major league players, he did not spend all of his war-time playing on service teams. Williams had been classified 3-A by Selective Service prior to the war, a dependency deferment because he was his mother's sole means of financial support. When his classification was changed to 1-A following the American entry into World War II, Williams appealed to his local draft board. The draft board ruled that his draft status should not have been changed. He made a public statement that once he had built up his mother's trust fund, he intended to enlist. Even so, criticism in the media, including withdrawal of an endorsement contract by Quaker Oats, resulted in his enlistment in the U.S. Naval Reserve on May 22, 1942. Williams did not opt for an easy assignment playing baseball for the Navy, but rather joined the V-5 program to become a Naval aviator. Williams was first sent to the Navy's Preliminary Ground School at Amherst College for six months of academic instruction in various subjects including math and navigation, where he achieved a 3.85 grade point average. Williams was talented as a pilot, and so enjoyed it that he had to be ordered by the Navy to leave training to personally accept his American League 1942 Major League Baseball Triple Crown. Williams's Red Sox teammate, Johnny Pesky, who went into the same aviation training program, said this about Williams: \"He mastered intricate problems in fifteen minutes which took the average cadet an hour, and half of the other cadets there were college grads.\" Pesky again described Williams's acumen in the advance training, for which Pesky personally did not qualify: \"I heard Ted literally tore the sleeve target to shreds with his angle dives. He'd shoot from wingovers, zooms, and barrel rolls, and after a few passes the sleeve was ribbons. At any rate, I know he broke the all-time record for hits.\"  Ted went to Jacksonville for a course in aerial gunnery, the combat pilot's payoff test, and broke all the records in reflexes, coordination, and visual-reaction time. \"From what I heard. Ted could make a plane and its six 'pianos' play like a symphony orchestra\", Pesky says. \"From what they said, his reflexes, coordination, and visual reaction made him a built-in part of the machine.\" Williams completed pre-flight training in Athens, Georgia, his primary training at NAS Bunker Hill, Indiana, and his advanced flight training at NAS Pensacola. He received his gold Naval Aviator wings and his commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps on May 2, 1944. Williams served as a flight instructor at NAS Pensacola teaching young pilots to fly the complicated F4U Corsair fighter plane. Williams was in Pearl Harbor awaiting orders to join the Fleet in the Western Pacific when the War in the Pacific ended. He finished the war in Hawaii, and then he was released from active duty on January 12, 1946, but he did remain in the Marine Corps Reserve."

        "content": "On May 1, 1952, 14 months after his promotion to captain in the Marine Corps Reserve, Williams was recalled to active duty for service in the Korean War. He had not flown any aircraft for eight years but he turned down all offers to sit out the war in comfort as a member of a service baseball team. Nevertheless, Williams was resentful of being called up, which he admitted years later, particularly regarding the Navy's policy of calling up Inactive Reservists rather than members of the Active Reserve. Williams reported for duty on May 2, 1952. After eight weeks of refresher flight training and qualification in the F9F Panther jet fighter with VMF-223 at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, Williams was assigned to VMF-311, Marine Aircraft Group 33 , based at the K-3 airfield in Pohang, South Korea. On February 16, 1953, Williams, flying as the wingman for John Glenn , was part of a 35-plane raid against a tank and infantry training school just south of Pyongyang, North Korea. As the aircraft from VMF-115 and VMF-311 dove on the target, Williams' plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire, a piece of flak knocked out his hydraulics and electrical systems, causing Williams to have to \"limp\" his plane back to K-3 air base where he made a belly landing. For his actions of this day, he was awarded the Air Medal. Williams flew 39 combat missions in Korea, earning the Air Medal with two Gold Stars in lieu of second and third awards, before being withdrawn from flight status in June 1953 after a hospitalization for pneumonia. This resulted in the discovery of an inner ear infection that disqualified him from flight status. John Glenn described Williams as one of the best pilots he knew, while his wife Annie described him as the most profane man she ever met. In the last half of his missions, Williams was flying as Glenn's wingman. Williams likely would have exceeded 600 career home runs if he had not served in the military, and may have even approached Babe Ruth's then record of 714. He might have set the record for career RBIs as well, exceeding Hank Aaron's total. While the absences in the Marine Corps took almost five years out of his baseball career, he never publicly complained about the time devoted to service in the Marine Corps. His biographer, Leigh Montville, argued that Williams was not happy about being pressed into service in South Korea, but he did what he thought was his patriotic duty. Following his return to the United States in August 1953, he resigned his Reserve commission to resume his baseball career."

        "title": "Ted Williams_Post-retirement",
        "content": "After retirement from play, Williams helped Boston's new left fielder, Carl Yastrzemski, in hitting, and was a regular visitor to the Red Sox' spring training camps from 1961 to 1966, where he worked as a special batting instructor. He served as executive assistant to Tom Yawkey , then was named a team vice president upon his election to the Hall of Fame. He resumed his spring training instruction role with the club in 1978. Beginning in 1961, he would spend summers at the Ted Williams Baseball Camp in Lakeville, Massachusetts, which he had established in 1958 with his friend Al Cassidy and two other business partners. For eight summers and parts of others after that, he would give hitting clinics and talk baseball at the camp. It was not uncommon to find Williams fishing in the pond at the camp. The area now is owned by the town and a few of the buildings still stand. In the main lodge one can still see memorabilia from Williams's playing days. Williams served as manager of the Washington Senators, from 1969\u20131971, then continued with the team when they became the Texas Rangers after the 1971 season. Williams's best season as a manager was 1969 when he led the expansion Senators to an 86\u201376 record in the team's only winning season in Washington. He was chosen \"Manager of the Year\" after that season. Like many great players, Williams became impatient with ordinary athletes' abilities and attitudes, particularly those of pitchers, whom he admitted he never respected. On the subject of pitchers, in Ted's autobiography written with John Underwood, Ted opines regarding Bob Lemon pitching for the Cleveland Indians around 1951: \"I have to rate Lemon as one of the very best pitchers I ever faced. His ball was always moving, hard, sinking, fast-breaking. You could never really uhmmmph with Lemon.\" Williams was much more successful in fishing. An avid and expert fly fisherman and deep-sea fisherman, he spent many summers after baseball fishing the Miramichi River, in Miramichi, New Brunswick. Williams was named to the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame in 2000. Williams, Jim Brown, Cumberland Posey, and Cal Hubbard are the only athletes to be inducted into the Halls of Fame of more than one professional sport. Williams was also known as an accomplished hunter; he was fond of pigeon-shooting for sport in Fenway Park during his career, on one occasion drawing the ire of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Williams reached an extensive deal with Sears, lending his name and talent toward marketing, developing, and endorsing a line of in-house sports equipment \u2013 such as the \"Ted Williams\" edition Gamefisher aluminum boat and 7.5\u00a0hp \"Ted Williams\" edition motor, as well as fishing, hunting, and baseball equipment. Williams continued his involvement in the Jimmy Fund, later losing a brother to leukemia, and spending much of his spare time, effort, and money in support of the cancer organization. In his later years Williams became a fixture at autograph shows and card shows after his son , John Henry Williams, took control of his career, becoming his de facto manager. The younger Williams provided structure to his father's business affairs, exposed forgeries that were flooding the memorabilia market, and rationed his father's public appearances and memorabilia signings to maximize their earnings. One of Ted Williams's final, and most memorable, public appearances was at the 1999 All-Star Game in Boston. Able to walk only a short distance, Williams was brought to the pitcher's mound in a golf cart. He proudly waved his cap to the crowd\u2014a gesture he had never done as a player. Fans responded with a standing ovation that lasted several minutes. At the pitcher's mound he was surrounded by players from both teams, including fellow Red Sox player Nomar Garciaparra, and was assisted by Tony Gwynn in throwing out the first pitch of that year's All-Star Game. Later in the year, he was among the members of the Major League Baseball All-Century Team introduced to the crowd at Turner Field in Atlanta prior to Game Two of the World Series."

        "content": "On May 4, 1944, Williams married Doris Soule, the daughter of his hunting guide. Their daughter, Barbara Joyce , was born on January 28, 1948, while Williams was fishing in Florida. They divorced in 1954. Williams married the socialite model Lee Howard on September 10, 1961, and they were divorced in 1967. Williams married Dolores Wettach, a former Miss Vermont and Vogue model, in 1968. Their son John-Henry was born on August 27, 1968, followed by daughter Claudia, on October 8, 1971. They were divorced in 1972. Williams lived with Louise Kaufman for twenty years until her death in 1993. In his book, Cramer called her the love of Williams's life. After his death, her sons filed suit to recover her furniture from Williams's condominium as well as a half-interest in the condominium they claimed he gave her. Williams had a strong respect for General Douglas MacArthur, referring to him as his \"idol\". For Williams's 40th birthday, MacArthur sent him an oil painting of himself with the inscription \"To Ted Williams\u00a0\u2013 not only America's greatest baseball player, but a great American who served his country. Your friend, Douglas MacArthur. General U.S. Army.\" Politically, Williams was a Republican, and was described by one biographer as, \"to the right of Attila the Hun\" except when it came to Civil Rights. Another writer similarly noted that while in the 1960s he had a liberal attitude on civil rights, he was pretty far right on other cultural issues of the time, calling him \u201cultraconservative in the tradition of Barry Goldwater and John Wayne\u201d. Williams campaigned for Richard Nixon in the 1960 United States Presidential Election, and after Nixon lost to John F. Kennedy, refused several invitations from President Kennedy to gather together in Cape Cod. He supported Nixon again in 1968, and as manager of the Senators, kept a picture of him on his desk, meeting with the President several times while managing the team. In 1972 he called Nixon, \u201cthe greatest president of my lifetime.\u201d In the following years, Williams endorsed several other candidates in Republican Party presidential primaries, including George H.W. Bush in 1988 , Bob Dole in 1996, and George W. Bush in 2000. According to friends, Williams was an atheist and this influenced his decision to be cryogenically frozen. His daughter Claudia stated \"It was like a religion, something we could have faith in... no different from holding the belief that you might be reunited with your loved ones in heaven\". Williams's brother Danny and his son John-Henry both died of leukemia."

        "content": "In his last years, Williams suffered from cardiomyopathy. He had a pacemaker implanted in November 2000 and he underwent open-heart surgery in January 2001. After suffering a series of strokes and congestive heart failure, he died of cardiac arrest at the age of 83 on July 5, 2002, at Citrus Memorial Hospital, Inverness, Florida, near his home in Citrus Hills, Florida. Though his will stated his desire to be cremated and his ashes scattered in the Florida Keys, Williams's son John-Henry and younger daughter Claudia chose to have his remains frozen cryonically. Ted's elder daughter, Bobby-Jo Ferrell, brought a suit to have her father's wishes recognized. John-Henry's lawyer then produced an informal \"family pact\" signed by Ted, Claudia, and John-Henry, in which they agreed \"to be put into biostasis after we die\" to \"be able to be together in the future, even if it is only a chance.\" Bobby-Jo and her attorney, Spike Fitzpatrick , contended that the family pact, which was scribbled on an ink-stained napkin, was forged by John-Henry and/or Claudia. Fitzpatrick and Ferrell believed that the signature was not obtained legally. Laboratory analysis proved that the signature was genuine. John-Henry said that his father was a believer in science and was willing to try cryonics if it held the possibility of reuniting the family. Though the family pact upset some friends, family and fans, a public plea for financial support of the lawsuit by Ferrell produced little result. Citing financial difficulties, Ferrell dropped her lawsuit on the condition that a $645,000 trust fund left by Williams would immediately pay the sum out equally to the three children. Inquiries to cryonics organizations increased after the publicity from the case. In Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero, author Leigh Montville claims that the family cryonics pact was a practice Ted Williams autograph on a plain piece of paper, around which the agreement had later been hand written. The pact document was signed \"Ted Williams\", the same as his autographs, whereas he would always sign his legal documents \"Theodore Williams\", according to Montville. However, Claudia testified to the authenticity of the document in an affidavit. Ted's two 24-hour private caregivers who were with him the entire period the note was said to have been created also stated in affidavits that John-Henry and Claudia were never present at any time for the note to be produced. Following John-Henry's unexpected illness and death from acute myeloid leukemia on March 6, 2004, John-Henry's body was also transported to Alcor, in fulfillment of the family agreement."

Williams was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 1966. In his induction speech, Williams included a statement calling for the recognition of the great Negro leagues players: \"I've been a very lucky guy to have worn a baseball uniform, and I hope some day the names of Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson in some way can be added as a symbol of the great Negro players who are not here only because they weren't given a chance.\" Williams was referring to two of the most famous names in the Negro leagues, who were not given the opportunity to play in the Major Leagues before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947. Gibson died early in 1947 and thus never played in the majors; and Paige's brief major league stint came long past his prime as a player. This powerful and unprecedented statement from the Hall of Fame podium was \"a first crack in the door that ultimately would open and include Paige and Gibson and other Negro league stars in the shrine.\" Paige was the first inducted in 1971. Gibson and others followed, starting in 1972 and continued on and off into the 21st century. On November 18, 1991, President George H. W. Bush presented Williams with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the US. The Ted Williams Tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, carrying  of the final  of Interstate 90 under Boston Harbor, opened in December 1995, and Ted Williams Parkway in San Diego County, California, opened in 1992, were named in his honor while he was still alive. In 2016, the major league San Diego Padres inducted Williams into their hall of fame for his contributions to baseball in San Diego. The Tampa Bay Rays home field, Tropicana Field, installed the Ted Williams Museum behind the left field fence. From the Tampa Bay Rays website: \"The Ted Williams Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame brings a special element to the Tropicana Field. Fans can view an array of different artifacts and pictures of the 'Greatest hitter that ever lived.' These memorable displays range from Ted Williams's days in the military through his professional playing career. This museum is dedicated to some of the greatest players to ever 'lace 'em up,' including Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris.\" In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Williams as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Marine Corps during World War II."

His career batting average of .3444 is the highest of any player who played his entire career in the live-ball era following 1920. Most modern statistical analyses  place Williams, along with Ruth and Barry Bonds, among the three most potent hitters to have played the game. Williams's baseball season of 1941 is often considered favorably with the greatest seasons of Ruth and Bonds in terms of various offensive statistical measures such as slugging, on-base and \"offensive winning percentage.\" As a further indication, of the ten best seasons for OPS, short for On-Base Plus Slugging Percentage, a popular modern measure of offensive productivity, four each were achieved by Ruth and Bonds, and two by Williams. In 1999, Williams was ranked as number eight on The Sporting News''' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, where he was the highest-ranking left fielder."

Bonaparte lived in a townhouse in the north Baltimore neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere and had a country estate in suburban Baltimore County, Maryland, which surrounds the city on the west, north and east. His home, Bella Vista, was designed by the architects James Bosley Noel Wyatt and William G. Nolting , in the prominent local architectural partnership firm of Wyatt & Nolting in 1896. It lies east of the Harford Road in an area called Glen Arm. The house was not electrified since Bonaparte refused to have electricity or telegraph lines installed from a dislike of technology, verified by his use of horse-drawn coach until his death in the early 1920s."

He was a member of the Board of Indian Commissioners from 1902 to 1904, chairman of the National Civil Service Reform League in 1904 and appointed a trustee of The Catholic University of America in northeast Washington, D.C.  Maryland voters elected him to be one of their presidential electors in 1904. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Bonaparte Secretary of the Navy. In 1906 Bonaparte moved to the office of Attorney General, which he held until the end of Roosevelt's term. He was active in suits brought against the trusts and was largely responsible for breaking up the tobacco monopoly. He became known as \"Charlie, the Crook Chaser.\" In 1908, Bonaparte established a Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice which had been earlier established in 1870 under the direction of the Attorney General himself. By the 1920s, under its long-time director, J. Edgar Hoover, the Bureau had again been cleaned up and streamlined and in 1935 was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation ."

He wrote on series and the derivatives known by his name: he was the first writer to separate the symbols of operation from those of quantity, introducing systematically the operator notation DF for the derivative of the function F. In 1800, he published a calculus treatise where the first known statement of what is currently known as Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula appears, 55 years before the first published paper of Francesco Fa\u00e0 di Bruno on that topic."

        "content": "He was professor of mathematics at the Coll\u00e8ge de Colmar and entered a mathematical competition run by the St Petersburg Academy. His entry was to bring him fame and an important place in the history of the development of the calculus. Arbogast submitted an essay to the St Petersburg Academy in which he came down firmly on the side of Euler. In fact he went much further than Euler in the type of arbitrary functions introduced by integrating partial differential equations, claiming that the functions could be discontinuous not only in the limited sense claimed by Euler, but discontinuous in a more general sense that he defined that allowed the function to consist of portions of different curves. Arbogast won the prize with his essay and his notion of discontinuous function became important in Cauchy's more rigorous approach to analysis. In 1789 he submitted in Strasbourg a major report on the differential and integral calculus to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in Paris which was never published. In the Preface of a later work he described the ideas that prompted him to write the major report of 1789. Essentially he realised that there was no rigorous methods to deal with the convergence of series, and Arbogast's career reached new heights. In addition to his mathematics post, he was appointed as professor of physics at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal in Strasbourg and from April 1791 he served as its rector until October 1791 when he was appointed rector of the University of Strasbourg; in 1794 he was appointed Professor of Calculus at the \u00c9cole centrale des travaux publics et militaris\u00e9e but he taught at the \u00c9cole pr\u00e9paratoire. His contributions to mathematics show him as a philosophical thinker. As well as introducing discontinuous functions, as we discussed above, he conceived the calculus as operational symbols. The formal algebraic manipulation of series investigated by Lagrange and Laplace in the 1770s has been put in the form of operator equalities by Arbogast in 1800. We owe him the general concept of factorial as a product of a finite number of terms in arithmetic progression. The original version of this article was taken from the public domain resource the Rouse History of Mathematics."

        "content": "One of the famous \"Whiz Kids\" of the National League champion 1950 Phillies, Ashburn spent 12 of his 15 major-league seasons as the Phillies' center fielder . He sported a .308 lifetime batting average, leading the National League twice, and routinely led the league in fielding percentage. In 1950, in the last game of the regular season, he threw Dodgers' runner Cal Abrams out at home plate to preserve a 1\u20131 tie and set the stage for Dick Sisler's pennant-clinching home run. He had been playing in to back up a pick-off throw on a pitchout, but pitcher Robin Roberts had instead thrown a fastball to the batter, Duke Snider. The following year Ashburn displayed his fielding skill on the national stage in the All-Star Game at Tiger Stadium in Detroit. The Associated Press reported, \"Richie Ashburn, fleet footed Philadelphia Phillies outfielder, brought the huge Briggs Stadium crowd of 52,075 to its feet with a brilliant leaping catch in the sixth inning to rob Vic Wertz of a near homer. Ashburn caught the ball in front of the right centerfield screen 400 feet distant after a long run.\" He was also the last Phillies player to collect eight hits in a double-header when he singled eight times in a twinbill at Pittsburgh on May 20, 1951. Ashburn was a singles hitter rather than a slugger, accumulating over 2,500 hits in 15 years against only 29 home runs. In his day he was regarded as the archetypal \"spray hitter\", stroking the ball equally well to all fields, thus making him harder to defend against. Ashburn accumulated the most hits of any batter during the 1950s. During a game on August 17, 1957, Ashburn hit a foul ball into the stands that struck spectator Alice Roth, wife of Philadelphia Bulletin sports editor Earl Roth, breaking her nose. When play resumed Ashburn fouled off another ball that struck her while she was being carried off in a stretcher. Ashburn and Roth maintained a friendship for many years, and the Roths' son later served as a Phillies batboy. Ashburn was traded to the Chicago Cubs following the 1959 season for three players.  He went on to anchor center field for the North Siders in 1960 and 1961. Anticipating a future career behind a microphone, Ashburn sometimes conducted a post-game baseball instruction clinic at Wrigley Field for the benefit of the youngsters in the WGN-TV viewing audience. Ashburn was purchased by the expansion New York Mets for the 1962 season and was the first batter in franchise history. He had a good year offensively, batting .306, and was the team's first All-Star Game representative. It was, however, a frustrating year for the polished professional, who had begun his career with a winner and found himself playing for the least successful team in modern baseball history . He retired at the end of the season. One oft-told story is that on short flies to center or left-center, center fielder Ashburn would collide with shortstop Elio Chac\u00f3n. Chac\u00f3n, from Venezuela, spoke little English and had difficulty understanding when Ashburn was calling him off the ball. To remedy matters teammate Joe Christopher taught Ashburn to say \"Yo la tengo\", Spanish for \"I\u2019ve got it.\" When Ashburn first used this phrase it worked fine, keeping Chac\u00f3n from running into him. But then left fielder Frank Thomas, who did not speak a word of Spanish, slammed into Ashburn. After getting up Thomas asked Ashburn, \"What the heck is a Yellow Tango?\" This anecdote inspired the name of the American indie rock group Yo La Tengo. In his last five seasons, Ashburn played for the 8th-place Phillies, the 7th-place Cubs, and the 10th-place Mets. The infamous first-year Mets club won only a quarter of its games, and Ashburn decided to retire from active play. The last straw might have been during the Mets' 120th loss, when Ashburn was one of the three Mets victims in a triple play pulled off by his former teammates, the 9th-place Cubs. According to Jimmy Breslin, it was the prospect of sitting on the bench that led Ashburn to retire: \"He sat on the bench for a while with another team once and it bothered him badly. And he said that if he ever had to be a benchwarmer for the New York Mets he'd commit suicide.\" Throughout his playing career, Ashburn, who lived in his hometown of Tilden during the offseason, officiated high school basketball games throughout Nebraska as a way to stay in playing condition.  He became a well-respected official, but retired from officiating when he retired from baseball."

He first worked with long-time Phillies announcers Bill Campbell and Byrum Saam. In 1971 Campbell was released by the Phillies and replaced by Harry Kalas. From 1971 to 1976, Ashburn worked together with Saam and Kalas who would both be Ford C. Frick Award winners. Saam retired in 1976, and Ashburn continued working with Kalas for the next two decades, the two growing to be best friends.  Kalas often referred to Ashburn as \"His Whiteness\", a nickname Kalas used for most of Ashburn's life for the man he openly adored. Ashburn regularly wrote for columns on the Phillies and Major League Baseball for The Philadelphia Bulletin and The Philadelphia Daily News. According to Ashburn's mother, he planned to retire from broadcasting at the end of the 1997 season. On September 9, 1997, in New York City, after broadcasting the Phillies-Mets game at Shea Stadium, Ashburn suffered a heart attack and died. A large crowd of fans paid tribute to him, passing by his casket in Memorial Hall, located in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park.

Over 25,000 fans, mostly from Philadelphia, traveled to Cooperstown for the ceremony. Ashburn was inducted into The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame in 1997. Ashburn was posthumously inducted into the inaugural class of the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. Each year the Phillies present the Richie Ashburn Special Achievement Award to \"a member of the organization who has demonstrated loyalty, dedication and passion for the game.\" The center-field entertainment area at the Phillies current stadium, Citizens Bank Park, was named \"Ashburn Alley\" in his honor after numerous fans urged the Phillies to name their new stadium after Ashburn . At Citizens Bank Park, the Phillies' radio-broadcast booth is named \"The Richie 'Whitey' Ashburn Broadcast Booth\".

He said that he once had a habit of keeping a successful baseball bat in bed with him between games, not trusting the clubhouse crew to give him the same bat the next day.  Ashburn told Kalas that he had \"slept with a lot of old bats\" in his day. When calling late innings, Ashburn would occasionally ask on-air if the staff of Celebre's Pizza, a nearby pizzeria in South Philly, was listening to the radio.  Pizza would then arrive at the radio booth 15\u201320 minutes later.  The Phillies requested that Ashburn discontinue the practice, as Celebre's was not a Phillies sponsor, and it was considered free advertising. Ashburn was allowed to make on-air birthday and anniversary wishes during Phillies games.  To circumvent the Phillies' request, he started to say \"I'd like to send out a special birthday wish to the Celebre's twins \u2013 Plain & Pepperoni!\" Harry Kalas was heard on radio in 2007 making a similar wish. Rub\u00e9n Amaro Jr., former general manager of the Phillies and son and namesake of Rub\u00e9n Amaro Sr., Phillies shortstop from the sixties and coach, co-founded the Richie Ashburn Foundation, which provides free baseball camp for 1,100 underprivileged children in the Delaware Valley and awards grants to area schools and colleges. Ted Williams gave Ashburn the nickname \"Putt-Putt\" because he \"ran so fast you would think he had twin motors in his pants\".  The origin of the nickname also has been attributed to Stan Musial. The book, Richie Ashburn: Why The Hall Not?, is about Richie's journey to the Baseball Hall of Fame."

He interpreted their joint work on the Mid-Atlantic ridge as supporting S. Warren Carey's Expanding Earth Theory, developed in the 1950s, but under Tharp's influence \"eventually gave up the idea of an expanding earth for a form of continental drift in the mid-1960s.\" Tharp was Heezen's assistant while he was a graduate student and he gave her the task of drafting seafloor profiles. When she showed Heezen that her plotting of the North Atlantic revealed a rift valley, Heezen dismissed it as \"girl talk\".  She persisted and they eventually discovered that not only was there a North Atlantic rift valley, but a mountain range with a central valley that spanned the earth.  They also realized that the oceanic earthquakes they had been separately plotting fell within the rift, a revolutionary theory at the time. He presented this mid-ocean rift and earthquake theory at Princeton in 1957. At that lecture, preeminent geologist Harry Hess told Heezen, \"Young man, you have shaken the foundations of geology!\" Heezen died of a heart attack in 1977 while on a research cruise to study the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Iceland aboard the NR-1 submarine."

There, he created the first formal journal club. During this time, he also showed interest in comparative pathology and is considered the first to teach veterinary pathology in North America as part of a broad understanding of disease pathogenesis.  In 1884, he was appointed Chair of Clinical Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and in 1885, was one of the seven founding members of the Association of American Physicians, a society dedicated to \"the advancement of scientific and practical medicine.\" When he left Philadelphia in 1889, his farewell address, \"Aequanimitas\", was on the imperturbability and equanimity necessary for physicians. In 1889, he accepted the position as the first Physician-in-Chief of the new Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Shortly afterwards, in 1893, Osler was instrumental in the creation of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and became one of the school's first professors of medicine. Osler quickly increased his reputation as a clinician, humanitarian, and teacher. He presided over a rapidly expanding domain. In the hospital's first year of operation, when it had 220 beds, 788 patients were seen for a total of over 15,000\u00a0days of treatment. Sixteen years later, when Osler left for Oxford, over 4,200 patients were seen for a total of nearly 110,000\u00a0days of treatment. In 1905, he was appointed to the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, which he held until his death. He was also a Student of Christ Church, Oxford. In the UK, he initiated the founding in 1907 of the Association of Physicians and was founding Senior Editor of its publication the Quarterly Journal of Medicine until his death. In 1911, he initiated the Postgraduate Medical Association, of which he was the first President. In the same year, Osler was named a baronet in the Coronation Honours List for his contributions to the field of medicine. In January 1919 he was appointed President of the Fellowship of Medicine  and was also in October 1919 appointed founding President of the merged Fellowship of Medicine and Postgraduate Medical Association, now the Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.

        "content": "Perhaps Osler's greatest influence on medicine was to insist that students learn from seeing and talking to patients and the establishment of the medical residency. The latter idea spread across the English-speaking world and remains in place today in most teaching hospitals. Through this system, physicians in training make up much of a teaching hospital's medical staff. The success of his residency system depended, in large part, on its pyramidal structure with many interns, fewer assistant residents and a single chief resident, who originally occupied that position for years. While at Hopkins, Osler established the full-time, sleep-in residency system whereby staff physicians lived in the administration building of the hospital. As established, the residency was open-ended, and long tenure was the rule. Physicians spent as long as seven or eight years as residents, during which time they led a restricted, almost monastic life. He wrote in an essay \"Books and Men\" that \"He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all.\" His best-known saying was \"Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis\", which emphasises the importance of taking a good history. The contribution to medical education of which he was proudest was his idea of clinical clerkship \u2013 having third- and fourth-year students work with patients on the wards. He pioneered the practice of bedside teaching, making rounds with a handful of students, demonstrating what one student referred to as his method of \"incomparably thorough physical examination.\" Soon after arriving in Baltimore, Osler insisted that his medical students attend at bedside early in their training. By their third year they were taking patient histories, performing physicals and doing lab tests examining secretions, blood and excreta. He reduced the role of didactic lectures and once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, \"He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching.\" He also said, \"I desire no other epitaph \u2026 than the statement that I taught medical students in the wards, as I regard this as by far the most useful and important work I have been called upon to do.\"  Osler fundamentally changed medical teaching in North America, and this influence, helped by a few such as the Dutch internist P. K. Pel, spread to medical schools across the globe. Osler was a prolific author and a great collector of books and other material relevant to the history of medicine. He willed his library to the Faculty of Medicine of McGill University where it now forms the nucleus of McGill University's Osler Library of the History of Medicine. Osler was a strong supporter of libraries and served on the library committees at most of the universities at which he taught and was a member of the Board of Curators of the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He was instrumental in founding the Medical Library Association in North America, alongside employee and mentee Marcia Croker Noyes, and served as its second president from 1901 to 1904. In Britain he was the first president of the Medical Library Association of Great Britain and Ireland and also a president of the Bibliographical Society of London . Osler was a prolific author and public speaker and his public speaking and writing were both done in a clear, lucid style. His most famous work, 'The Principles and Practice of Medicine' quickly became a key text to students and clinicians alike. It continued to be published in many editions until 2001 and was translated into many languages.Golden, Richard A History of William Osler's The Principles and Practice of Medicine. Osler Library, McGill University. . It is notable in part for supporting the use of bloodletting as recently as 1923. Though his own textbook was a major influence in medicine for many years, Osler described Avicenna as the \"author of the most famous medical textbook ever written\". He noted that Avicenna's Canon of Medicine remained \"a medical bible for a longer time than any other work\". Osler's essays were important guides to physicians. The title of his most famous essay, \"Aequanimitas\", espousing the importance of imperturbability, is the motto on the Osler family crest and is used on the Osler housestaff tie and scarf at Hopkins."

        "content": "Osler held a number of views that were not atypical for a physician of his generation, but were politically controversial even at that time. Osler said Canada should be a \"white man's country\" in a 1914 speech given around the time of the Komagata Maru incident involving immigration from India. Osler wrote \u201cI hate Latin Americans\u201d in a letter to Henry Vining Ogden. Under the pseudonym \"Egerton Yorrick Davis\", Osler mocked Indigenous people: \u201cEvery primitive tribe retains some vile animal habit not yet eliminated in the upward march of the race.\u201d Uncovering this historical context, journalist Markus Grill and archivist Nils Seethaler reconstruct the shipment of several indigenous skulls by Osler from Canada to Germany, which were in the custody of the State Museums of Berlin."

        "content": "Osler is well known in the field of gerontology for the speech he gave when leaving Hopkins to become the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford.  \"The Fixed Period\", given on February 22, 1905, included some controversial words about old age.  Osler, who had a well-developed humorous side to his character, was in his mid-fifties when he gave the speech and in it he mentioned Anthony Trollope's The Fixed Period , which envisaged a college where men retired at 67 and after being given a year to settle their affairs, would be \"peacefully extinguished by chloroform\". He claimed that, \"the effective, moving, vitalizing work of the world is done between the ages of twenty-five and forty\" and it was downhill from then on.  Osler's speech was covered by the popular press which headlined their reports with \"Osler recommends chloroform at sixty\". The concept of mandatory euthanasia for humans after a \"fixed period\" became a recurring theme in 20th century imaginative literature\u2014for example, Isaac Asimov's 1950 novel Pebble in the Sky. In the 3rd edition of his Textbook, he also coined the description of pneumonia as \"the friend of the aged\" since it allowed elderly individuals a quick, comparatively painless death: \"Taken off by it in an acute, short, not often painful illess, the old man escapes those \"cold gradations of decay\" so distressing to himself and his friends.\" Coincidentally, Osler himself died of pneumonia."

The letter was apparently a response to a report on the phenomenon of vaginismus reported three weeks previously in the Philadelphia Medical News by Osler's colleague Theophilus Parvin. Davis, a prolific writer of letters to medical societies, purported to be a retired U.S. Army surgeon living in Caughnawaga, Quebec , author of a controversial paper on the obstetrical habits of Native American tribes that was suppressed and unpublished. Osler would enhance Davis's myth by signing Davis's name to hotel registers and medical conference attendance lists; Davis was eventually reported drowned in the Lachine Rapids in 1884. Throughout his life, Osler was a great admirer of the 17th century physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne. He died at the age of 70, on December 29, 1919, in Oxford, during the Spanish influenza epidemic, most likely of complications from undiagnosed bronchiectasis. His wife, Grace, lived another nine years but succumbed to a series of strokes. Sir William and Lady Osler's ashes now rest in a niche in the Osler Library at McGill University. They had two sons, one of whom died shortly after birth.  The other, Edward Revere Osler, was mortally wounded in combat in World War I at the age of 21, during the 3rd battle of Ypres . At the time of his death in August 1917, he was a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery; Lt. Osler's grave is in the Dozinghem Military Cemetery in West Flanders, Belgium. According to one biographer, Osler was emotionally crushed by the loss; he was particularly anguished by the fact that his influence had been used to procure a military commission for his son, who had mediocre eyesight. Lady Osler was born in Boston in 1854; her paternal great-grandfather was Paul Revere. In 1876, she married Samuel W. Gross, chairman of surgery at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and son of Dr. Samuel D. Gross. Gross died in 1889 and in 1892 she married William Osler who was then professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University. Osler was a founding donor of the American Anthropometric Society, a group of academics who pledged to donate their brains for scientific study. Osler's brain was taken to the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia to join the Wistar Brain Collection. In April 1987 it was taken to the M\u00fctter Museum, on 22nd Street near Chestnut in Philadelphia where it was displayed during the annual meeting of the American Osler Society.Osler Library Newsletter No. 60 February 1989 . mcgill.ca He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1885. In 1925, a biography of William Osler was written by Harvey Cushing, who received the 1926 Pulitzer Prize for the work. A later biography by Michael Bliss was published in 1999. In 1994 Osler was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame."

Osler described them as \"ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema, chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet.\" Osler nodes are usually painful, as opposed to Janeway lesions which are due to emboli and are painless. Osler\u2013Weber\u2013Rendu disease is a syndrome of multiple vascular malformations on the skin, in the nasal and oral mucosa, in the lungs and elsewhere.

Osler's manoeuvre: in pseudohypertension, the blood pressure as measured by the sphygmomanometer is artificially high because of arterial wall calcification. Osler's manoeuvre takes a patient who has a palpable, although pulseless, radial artery while the blood pressure cuff is inflated above systolic pressure; thus they are considered to have \"Osler's sign.\" Osler's rule: States that a neurological defect has to be related to a specific lesion, in contrast to Hickam's dictum, which states that the neurological defect can be due to several lesions. Osler's syndrome is a syndrome of recurrent episodes of colic pain, with typical radiation to back, cold shiverings and fever; due to the presence in Vater's diverticulum of a free-moving gallstone which is larger than the orifice. Osler's triad : association of pneumonia, endocarditis, and meningitis. Sphryanura osleri is a trematode worm found in the gills of a newt.

From 1905 to 1907, he studied at Kunstschule in Weimar, Germany, and in 1908 went back to Paris, where he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. Arp was a founder-member of the Moderne Bund in Lucerne, participating in their exhibitions from 1911 to 1913. In 1912 he went to Munich and called on Wassily Kandinsky, the influential Russian painter and art theorist. Arp was encouraged by him in his researches and exhibited with the Der Blaue Reiter group. Later that year, he took part in a major exhibition in Z\u00fcrich, along with Henri Matisse, Robert Delaunay and Kandinsky. In Berlin in 1913, he was taken up by Herwarth Walden, the dealer and magazine editor who was at that time one of the most powerful figures in the European avant-garde. In 1915 he moved to Switzerland to take advantage of Swiss neutrality. Arp later told the story of how, when he was notified to report to the German consulate in Zurich, he pretended to be mentally ill in order to avoid being drafted into the German Army: after crossing himself whenever he saw a portrait of Paul von Hindenburg, Arp was given paperwork on which he was told to write his date of birth on the first blank line. Accordingly, he wrote \"16/9/87\"; he then wrote \"16/9/87\" on every other line as well, then drew one final line beneath them and, \"without worrying too much about accuracy\", calculated their sum. Hans Richter, describing this story, noted that \"they [the German authorities] believed him.\" It was at an exhibition that year where he first met the artist Sophie Taeuber who was to become his collaborator in the production of works of art and a significant influence on his artistic style and working method. They married on 20 October 1922. In 1916 Hugo Ball opened the Cabaret Voltaire, which was to become the centre of Dada activities in Zurich for a group that included Arp, Marcel Janco, Tristan Tzara, and others. In 1920, as Hans Arp, along with Max Ernst and the social activist Alfred Gr\u00fcnwald, he set up the Cologne Dada group. In 1925 his work also appeared in the first exhibition of the Surrealist group at the Gal\u00e9rie Pierre in Paris."

In 1931 he broke with the Surrealist movement to found Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation, working with the Paris-based group Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation and the periodical, Transition. Beginning in the 1930s the artist expanded his efforts from collage and bas-relief to include bronze and stone sculptures. He produced several small works made of multiple elements that the viewer could pick up, separate, and rearrange into new configurations. Throughout the 1930s and until the end of his life, he wrote and published essays and poetry. In 1942 he fled from his home in Meudon to escape German occupation and lived in Z\u00fcrich until the war ended."

In 1950 he was invited to execute a relief for the Harvard University Graduate Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts and would also be commissioned to do a mural at the UNESCO building in Paris. Arthur and Madeleine Lewja, of Galerie Chalette, who had known Arp in Europe, became his gallery representatives in New York in the late 1950s, and were instrumental in establishing his reputation on the American side of the Atlantic. In 1958, a retrospective of Arp's work was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, followed by an exhibition at the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, France, in 1962. In 1972, the Metropolitan Museum of Art showcased Jean Arp's work from the Lejwa's collection and a few works lent by Arp's widow, Marguerite Arp. The exhibition was expanded and traveled as \"Arp 1877\u20131966,\" first exhibited at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and then shown in seven museums in the United States and six in Australia. Organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Wurttembergischer Kunstverein of Stuttgart, a 150-piece exhibition titled \"The Universe of Jean Arp\" concluded an international six-city tour at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1986."

        "content": "Paris became known in the US in 1990 with the hit single \"The Devil Made Me Do It\" and album of the same name, after earning a bachelor's degree in economics from UC Davis. Originally released on Tommy Boy Records, his first video was banned by MTV. When his second album, Sleeping with the Enemy, was ready for release in 1992, Paris was dropped from now-defunct Tommy Boy Records and distributor Warner Bros. Records, owned by Time Warner, when the parent company discovered its incendiary content, which included fantasy revenge killings of then-President Bush and racist police officers. Also problematic was the album's insert, which featured the artist waiting behind a tree, holding a TEC-9, as the president was waving to the crowd. Paris eventually released the LP himself on his newly formed Scarface Records. Also in 1992, Paris contributed to industrial music band Consolidated's 1992 album Play More Music with the track \"Guerrillas in the Mist.\" Paris signed a major artist and distribution deal with Priority Records for himself and Scarface Records in 1993 and released his third LP, Guerrilla Funk, and several then up-and-coming groups, most notably The Conscious Daughters. Paris and Priority formally severed their business relationship due to creative differences in 1995, and in 1997, Paris signed a one-off deal with now-defunct Whirling Records for the release of his fourth LP, Unleashed, which was released in small numbers with little promotion. The album contained some very explicitly violent and racially charged verses, and while less overtly political as earlier efforts, the lyrics explicitly describe racial violence when confronted with the same. Also released in Europe with a different track list, the album featuring songs from 1994, 1996 and 1998, some of which were more in the style of his earlier releases. Becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the music industry, Paris retired from recording and worked as a stockbroker, cementing his personal wealth allowing him to independently finance the next stage of his musical endeavors."

The album continued his tradition of controversial cover art, evoking images of the September 11 attacks, it depicts a plane flying toward the White House. Its content is equally radical and covers many topics, including the war on terror, the war in Iraq, police brutality, black-on-black violence, conditions in inner-city communities, the Illuminati, and state-sponsored terrorism. Other politically minded hip hop artists were featured on the album, including Kam, dead prez, and Public Enemy. Sonic Jihad was the catalyst for the creation of Paris' new label and web site, Guerrilla Funk Recordings, a home for projects and material of such notable acts as dead prez and Public Enemy. Paris' anti-war anthem \"What Would You Do?\" accuses \"the Bush Administration [of playing] a key role in orchestrating the terror attacks of September 11\", saying, \"Ain't no terror threat, unless approval rating's slumpin'. So I'ma say it for the record we the ones that planned it, ain't no other country took a part or had they hand in it\".  The song is featured on the 2004 compilation album Peace Not War, Vol. 2. On the 2003 Anybody Killa album Hatchet Warrior, Paris appeared with Monoxide on a track entitled \"Ghetto Neighbor.\" In 2005, Paris completed a project with Public Enemy, Rebirth of a Nation, the title both a reference to the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation, controversial for its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its racist portrayal of African Americans, and PE's 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.  Although Chuck D was the primary vocal performer, Paris penned and produced the bulk of the album, which also featured N.W.A's MC Ren, Immortal Technique, Kam, dead prez, and The Conscious Daughters. In 2006, Paris also released Paris presents Hard Truth Soldiers, Vol. 1, the first in a Paris-produced compilation series that touched on subjects ranging from war and police brutality to black-on-black crime and domestic violence. It showcased contributions from Public Enemy, the Coup, dead prez, Paris, T-K.A.S.H., Kam, The Conscious Daughters, Mystic, MC Ren, Sun Rise Above, and the Stop the Violence Movement , among others. In addition, Paris introduced the world to former Coup-member T-K.A.S.H. later that year, releasing his debut offering, Turf War Syndrome, and handling production duties as well. In 2007, Paris released the follow-up companion piece to Rebirth of a Nation, the Public Enemy collaboration Remix of a Nation, and began laying the framework for the film division of Guerrilla Funk Recordings. Paris inked a distribution deal with Fontana/Universal for Guerrilla Funk in late 2007, and released his next album, Acid Reflex, featuring Chuck D and George Clinton, in 2008. In 2009, Paris released Paris Presents: Hard Truth Soldiers, Vol. 2, the sophomore project from T-K.A.S.H., Brains All Over The Streets, and the latest offering from The Conscious Daughters, The Nutcracker Suite. Paris not only writes and produces songs, but also publishes information about ways to improve inner-city communities. Numerous articles can be found on various subjects in the Thought Box section of Guerrilla Funk's website."

Paris' production and original material has been featured in various Hollywood offerings, including Morgan Freeman's HBO documentary Prom Night in Mississippi in 2009,  End of Watch, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe\u00f1a in 2012, and 2014's Kill the Messenger, starring Jeremy Renner. In November 2014, he released a video single, \"Night of the Long Knives,\" which called for an increased unity in the black and brown communities and the adoption of the eye-for-an-eye philosophy toward racist police aggression and brutality in the wake of the tragedy in Ferguson, Missouri and other high-profile shooting deaths. In August 2015, Paris released his second video single, \"Buck, Buck, Pass,\" a commentary on gun violence, its often ignored racial implications and its after effects. His album Pistol Politics was released on September 11, 2015. It was named one of the Best Hip-Hop albums of 2015 by SPIN magazine and received an \"A-\" rating by VICE. Paris' third single and video, \"Hard Truth Soldier \" was released in November 2015. Paris became an official contributor to Vice Media in June 2016, beginning his ongoing relationship with that outlet to provide political and entertainment insights on current events from an urban perspective. In March 2016, EA Sports released UFC2, the second installment of its popular UFC mixed martial arts fighting video game franchise, featuring music produced by Paris. On September 5, 2016, Paris performed at Hiero Day in Oakland, California - hip-hop collective Hieroglyphics' annual block party celebrating Bay Area indie music, food and culture. In October 2016, Guerrilla Funk released videos for \"Lethal Warning Shot\" and \"Power,\" the 4th and 5th singles from Paris' acclaimed Pistol Politics release. Paris rounded out 2016 with contributions to Level 33 Entertainment's mystery/suspense thriller, Blood in the Water. 2018 found Paris' productions included in several movie and television offerings, including Get Shorty on the Epix network, Champaign ILL on YouTube Premium, and Netflix's Flint Town and Hip Hop Evolution, the latter of which featured an in-depth interview by Paris. In 2019, Paris' music has been featured in USA network's The Purge, HBO's The Deuce, CBS' The Unicorn, multiple episodes of CBS Sports Network's The Jim Rome Show and Between Two Ferns: The Movie on Netflix, starring Zach Galifianakis, Matthew McConaughey, Keanu Reeves and Will Ferrell. Netflix's All Day and a Night started off 2020 with featured music by Paris, starring Ashton Sanders, Jeffrey Wright, Isaiah John and Regina Taylor, among others. In August of that year, \"Baby Man Hands\" was released - a scathing indictment of Donald Trump's presidency and the first single and video from Paris' album, Safe Space Invader. On September 11, Safe Space Invader's second single and video, \"Nobody Move\" was released, a stylistic homage to Black Panther Party artist Emory Douglas that calls out police brutality, gentrification and more. Safe Space Invader was released on September 25, 2020. On October 23, 2020, Safe Space Invader's third single and video, \"Turned the Key,\" was released, addressing the hard topics of gentrification, income inequality & housing affordability.  Its fourth single and video, \"Walk Like a Panther,\" was released on December 2 of that same year. In 2021, Paris' music was featured in FX network's Hip Hop Uncovered, Netflix's Notorious B.I.G. biopic, Biggie: I've Got a Story to Tell, NBC's Young Rock, and in Blindspotting on the STARZ network."

        "title": "Steve Kerr_Summary",
        "content": "Stephen Douglas Kerr is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach of the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association . He is an eight-time NBA champion, having won five titles as a player as well as three with the Warriors as a head coach. Kerr is the only NBA player to win four straight NBA titles after 1969. Kerr has the highest career three-point field goal percentage in NBA history for any player with at least 250 three-pointers made. He also held the NBA record for the highest three-point percentage in a season at 52.4% until the record was broken by Kyle Korver in 2010. In 2004, Kerr became a minority owner of the Phoenix Suns, part of the group led by Robert Sarver that purchased the team in 2004. In June 2007, the Phoenix Suns named Kerr the team's president of basketball operations and general manager and was one of the majority owner, Sarver's trusted basketball advisors. Kerr announced he was leaving the position in June 2010, but retained his minority share until 2014. Afterward, Kerr returned as a color commentator for NBA on TNT until 2014, when he pursued a career in coaching. In May 2014, Kerr received his first head coaching job with the Golden State Warriors. Under his leadership, the franchise entered the most successful period in its history, reaching five consecutive NBA Finals and winning three championships in 2015, 2017, and 2018. The 2015\u201316 Warriors won an unprecedented 73 games, breaking the record for the most wins in an NBA season, previously held by Kerr's 1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls. As part of USA Basketball in international play, Kerr won the 1986 FIBA World Championship as a player, and a gold medal in the 2020 Summer Olympics as an assistant coach of the men's team."

        "title": "Steve Kerr_Early life",
        "content": "Kerr was born in Beirut, Lebanon to Malcolm H. Kerr, an American academic who specialized in the Middle East, and his wife, Ann . He has three siblings. His grandfather, Stanley Kerr, volunteered with the Near East Relief after the Armenian genocide and rescued women and orphans in Aleppo and Marash before eventually settling in Beirut. Kerr spent much of his childhood in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries. While in Beirut in the summer of 1983, he met a number of US Marines who were later killed in the Beirut barracks bombings. Kerr attended Cairo American College in Egypt, the American Community School in Beirut, Lebanon, and Palisades High School in Los Angeles, graduating in 1983. Malcolm Kerr was killed by members of the Shia Lebanese militia called Islamic Jihad on the morning of January 18, 1984 at the age of 52 while he was serving as president of the American University of Beirut. He was shot twice in the back of his head, by gunmen using suppressed handguns, in the hallway outside his office. Kerr was 18 years old at the time, and a college freshman; regarding his father's death, he has said: \"Before my father was killed, my life was impenetrable. Bad things happened to other people.\" The Kerr family sued the Iranian government under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. While warming up with the Arizona Wildcats for a game at arch-rival Arizona State in 1988, Kerr had to deal with many ASU Sun Devil fans in the crowd chanting \"PLO\" and \"Where\u2019s your father?\" Though tearful, Kerr led the Wildcats to victory, scoring 20 points in the first half, making all six of his three-point attempts. The athletic director of Arizona State, Charles Harris, sent a letter of apology to Kerr a few days later. Kerr graduated from the University of Arizona in 1988 with a Bachelor of General Studies, with emphasis on history, sociology and English."

In the summer of 1986, Kerr was named to the USA Basketball team that competed in the FIBA World Championship in Spain. The team was the last American Men's Senior Team composed strictly of amateur players to capture a gold medal. He blew out his knee in the tournament, usually a career-ending injury, forcing him to miss an entire season at Arizona. He helped the Wildcats reach the Final Four of the NCAA Division I basketball tournament in 1988 along with fellow All-American teammate Sean Elliott. Kerr also set an NCAA record for 3-point percentage in a season ."

He spent over three seasons there. Orlando Magic Kerr spent part of the 1992\u201393 season with the Orlando Magic. Chicago Bulls In 1993, Kerr signed with the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls made the playoffs in the 1993\u201394 and 1994\u201395 seasons, but without Michael Jordan's presence for all of 1994 and much of 1995, the team could not advance to the Finals. However, with Jordan back full-time for the 1995\u201396 season, the Bulls set a then-NBA record of 72\u201310 and defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Kerr played a major part in the Bulls' championship victory in the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. In the final seconds of Game 6 with the score tied at 86, he took a pass from Jordan and hit the title-winner. The Bulls won, earning the franchise's fifth title. Kerr also won the 3-Point Shootout at the 1997 All-Star Game. In the last minute of Game 2 of the 1998 NBA Finals against Utah, Kerr missed a 3-pointer, grabbed his own rebound and made a pass to Jordan who made a crucial three-point play, putting them in the lead for good. The play helped Chicago win the game and tie the series at 1. The Bulls won the series in six games. San Antonio Spurs In January 1999, Kerr was acquired by the San Antonio Spurs in a sign-and-trade deal with the Bulls, whereby Chuck Person and a first-round pick in the 2000 NBA draft was sent to Chicago. The Spurs reached 1999 NBA Finals and won their first NBA Championship with a 4\u20131 series victory over the New York Knicks. Kerr became the second player to win four straight NBA titles without being a part of the 1960s Boston Celtics dynasty, the other being Frank Saul, who won four straight with Rochester and Minneapolis from 1951 to 1954. Kerr and Saul were the only two players in NBA history to have won two championships with two different teams in consecutive seasons until Patrick McCaw achieved the same feat in 2019 and Danny Green in 2020. Portland Trail Blazers Kerr was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers alongside Derek Anderson on July 24, 2001, in a deal that brought Steve Smith to the Spurs. He would remain in Portland for the 2001\u201302 season, playing in 65 games. Return to San Antonio On August 2, 2002, Kerr was traded back to San Antonio along with Erick Barkley and a 2003 second-round pick. In return, the Trail Blazers received Charles Smith, Amal McCaskill, and Antonio Daniels. Kerr played in nearly every game the following year, which was his final season in the league. In Game Six of the 2003 Western Conference Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, Kerr made four second-half three-pointers that helped eliminate Dallas. The Spurs eventually won the NBA championship by beating the New Jersey Nets in the 2003 NBA Finals, 4\u20132."

He became part of Suns management, acting as a consultant. During the 2006 NBA All-Star Weekend, he was a member of the San Antonio team that won the Shooting Stars Competition. On June 2, 2007, Kerr announced that he would become the general manager of the Phoenix Suns beginning with the 2007\u20132008 season. In 2008, the Suns traded forward Shawn Marion and guard Marcus Banks to the Miami Heat in exchange for Shaquille O'Neal. The Suns were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games in the first round of the playoffs. On December 10, 2008, Kerr continued to remake the Suns roster by trading Boris Diaw, Raja Bell, and Sean Singletary to the Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for Jason Richardson, Jared Dudley, and the Bobcats' 2010 second-round draft pick, which was used to draft Gani Lawal of Georgia Tech. On June 25, 2009, Kerr traded O'Neal to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Ben Wallace, Sasha Pavlovic, a future second-round draft pick and cash. On May 5, 2010, the Suns wore their \"Noche Latina\" Los Suns jerseys in Game 2 against the Spurs to be united against the controversial Arizona immigration law. Kerr himself compared the law to Nazi Germany. On June 15, 2010, Kerr stepped down as president and general manager of the Suns. He continued to own a one percent share of the Suns' organization until 2014."

        "content": "Golden State Warriors On May 14, 2014, Kerr reached an agreement to become the head coach for the Golden State Warriors, succeeding Mark Jackson. Kerr coached in the 2014 Summer League for the Warriors. During the 2014\u201315 season, the team's offense employed elements of the triangle offense from his playing days in Chicago under Phil Jackson, the spacing and pace of Gregg Popovich in San Antonio, and the uptempo principles Mike D'Antoni and later Alvin Gentry used in Phoenix when Kerr was the GM. After the Warriors beat the Houston Rockets to win their 14th consecutive game, Kerr became the first coach to start his career with a 19\u20132 record. This beat out Al Cervi and his 18\u20132 start with the Syracuse Nationals. On December 10, 2014, Kerr became the first NBA rookie head coach to win 21 of his first 23 games. He was named the head coach of the Western Conference team for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game after Golden State had the best record in the conference. On April 4, the Warriors beat the Dallas Mavericks 123\u2013110 to clinch home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, and Kerr got his 63rd win of the season to become the highest winning rookie head coach in NBA history, passing Tom Thibodeau and his 62 wins with the Chicago Bulls in the 2010\u201311 season. In the NBA Coach of the Year voting, Kerr was runner-up to Mike Budenholzer. The Warriors ultimately finished with one of the best regular seasons in NBA history, and the greatest in the team's 69-year history. Golden State ended with an overall record of 67\u201315, becoming the 10th team to win 67 or more games in a single season. It was the first time the Warriors had ever won as many as 60 games in a season; their previous high was 59 in the 1975\u201376 season. The Warriors also ended with a 39\u20132 home record, which is tied for the second-best home record in NBA history. The Warriors were first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving\u2013led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. They became the first team in NBA history to have two win streaks over 15 at home . In the opening round of the playoffs against the New Orleans Pelicans, Kerr led the Warriors to their first four-game playoff sweep since the 1975 NBA Finals. Afterwards, the team surpassed the Memphis Grizzlies . Down 2\u20131 in the series, Kerr made an unconventional adjustment in Game 4 to leave the Grizzlies' Tony Allen open and have his defender, center Andrew Bogut, guard the interior. His strategy was lauded after Allen, Memphis' best wing defender but a poor jump-shooter, was benched and limited to 16 minutes after missing wide open shots. The Warriors then defeated the Houston Rockets , making the NBA Finals for the first time in 40 years. The Warriors faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals. Kerr and rival coach David Blatt were both in their first season as NBA head coaches, and this was the first time a pair of rookie head coaches faced each other in the NBA Finals since the NBA's first year of existence, in 1947 with Eddie Gottlieb of the Philadelphia Warriors and Harold Olsen of the Chicago Stags competing. After the Warriors went down 2\u20131 to Cleveland, Kerr started swingman Andre Iguodala in place of Bogut, jump-starting their stagnant offense for a 103\u201382 road win that evened the series. It was Iguodala's first start of the season, and the small unit came to be known as the Death Lineup. After the game, Kerr admitted to lying to the press in response to pregame questions about potential changes to his starting lineup. The Warriors went on to win the championship in six games, defeating the Cavaliers, 4\u20132, in the series, to give Kerr his sixth championship and first as a head coach. After the first two days of the defending champion Warriors' training camp, Kerr took an indefinite leave of absence to rehabilitate his back, which had caused problems since the 2015 NBA Finals. Around this time, assistant coach Luke Walton assumed Kerr's coaching duties. Kerr missed all of 2015 and most of January 2016, although technically the NBA credited Walton's win-loss record to Kerr. Kerr said \"I think it's ridiculous\", when asked about getting all of Walton's wins. On January 22, 2016, Kerr returned to coaching after missing 43 games, but warned he might need to miss games occasionally if there was a recurrence of the headaches and pain related to the spinal fluid leak that sidelined him. The Warriors went 39\u20134 with interim coach Luke Walton. The Warriors went 34-5 after Kerr returned to coaching. Golden State broke the 1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls 72\u201310 record by winning 73 games. Kerr became the first person in NBA history to be a part of 70-win teams as a player and head coach. He was named 2015\u201316 NBA Coach of the Year. Kerr would lead the Warriors to the 2016 NBA Finals where they would again face the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors lost in seven games. On November 20, 2016, the NBA announced that Kerr had been fined $25,000 for public criticism of officiating during a radio interview with KNBR 680 on November 17. Kerr missed time during the 2017 playoffs due to recurring back issues. Associate head coach Mike Brown has acted as acting head coach during periods of Kerr's absence, and Brown continued head coaching into the playoffs leading the Warriors to a 12\u20130 record in the postseason. Kerr returned for the 2017 NBA Finals where he led the Warriors to victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16\u20131 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history. Kerr is the fourth coach in NBA history to win two championships in his first three seasons of coaching. Kerr won his third championship as a head coach when the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2018 NBA Finals in four games to give Kerr his eighth championship of his career. Mainly on the strength of his first five seasons, Kerr is already third on the Warriors' all-time wins list behind Al Attles and Don Nelson. He also became the first head coach in NBA history to have led his team towards 67 or more wins in three consecutive seasons."

In an interview following the election, Kerr voiced the opinion that Trump's rise to power was based on insults against women and minorities. He compared Trump's campaign performances and the crude responses of his supporters to The Jerry Springer Show. He made clear his \"disgust\" with Trump's disrespectful public discourse and has been disappointed with his leadership in the country. Kerr has been a strong supporter of gun control, expressing concern with the government's response to school shootings. He has voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movements across the United States, praising the efforts of peaceful protests and hopes that more people will take action to stand up to systemic racial injustice to black people. On October 27, 2020, Kerr endorsed Joe Biden for President in that year's upcoming election in an ad made by The Lincoln Project. In the ad, he announced many of his views; \"stand[ing] for truth over lies\", \"categorically reject[ing] white supremacy\", and \"believe[ing] a presidency should be transparent\" were among them."

Having formed an intimacy with Sir David Wilkie, Raimbach in 1812 began to engrave some of Wilkie's best pictures. At his death, he held a gold medal awarded for his Village Politicians at the Paris Exhibition of 1814. He was elected corresponding member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in 1835.

Together with Willem Frederik Hermans and Harry Mulisch, he is considered one of the \"Great Three\" of Dutch post-war literature. His 1981 novel De vierde man was the basis for Paul Verhoeven's 1983 film. Reve was one of the first homosexual authors to come out in the Netherlands. He often wrote explicitly about erotic attraction, sexual relations and intercourse between men, which many readers considered shocking. However, he did this in an ironic, humorous and recognizable way, which contributed to making homosexuality acceptable for many of his readers. Another main theme, often in combination with eroticism, was religion. Reve himself declared that the primary message in all of his work was salvation from the material world we live in. Gerard Reve was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and was the brother of the Slavicist and essayist Karel van het Reve, who became a staunch anti-communist in his own way; the personal rapport between the brothers was not good. They broke off relations altogether in the 1980s."

        "content": "He often insisted that homosexuality was merely a motif in his work, the deeper theme being the inadequacy of human love . Since the publication of Op weg naar het einde and Nader tot U , marking his breakthrough to a large audience, he articulated his views on God's creation and human fate, especially in the many collections of letters that he published. These writings stress a symbolic, rather than literal, understanding of religious texts as the only intellectually acceptable one, and the irrelevance of the Gospel's historical truth. Religion, according to Reve, has nothing to do with the literal, the factual, the moral or the political. It has no quarrel with modern science, because religious truths and empirical facts are in different realms. The observable world has no meaning beyond comparing facts, and, while revelation may not make sense, it has meaning, and it is this meaning that Reve was after in everything he wrote. Philosophically, Reve was influenced by Arthur Schopenhauer, whose works he re-read every winter, and even more so by Carl Jung, according to a Dutch painter who spent some time with the author in France to paint several portraits of him. Reve's erotic prose deals partly with his own sexuality, but aims at something more universal. Reve's work often depicts sexuality as ritual. Many scenes bear a sado-masochistic character, but this is never meant as an end in itself. 'Revism', a term coined by him, can roughly be described as consecrating sexual acts of punishment, dedicating these acts to revered others, and, ultimately, to higher entities . This is again a quest for higher significance in a human act that is devoid of meaning in its material form."

Similarly, his humour and often paradoxical view of the world relies on the contrast between exalted mysticism and common sense. The irony that pervades his work and his tendency towards extreme statements has caused confusion among readers. Many doubted the sincerity of his conversion to Catholicism, although Reve remained adamant about the truthfulness of his faith, claiming his right to individual notions about religion and his personal experience of it."

Writing for The Guardian, Tim Parks opened his review as follows:It is so rare, as a reviewer, to come across a novel that is not only a masterpiece but a cornerstone manque of modern European literature, that I hesitate before setting down a response: what can I say, in a world of hype, that will put this book where it belongs, in readers\u2019 hands and minds?"

        "title": "Gerard Reve_Controversies",
        "content": "Reve's literary career was marked by many controversies. Early on, the Dutch ministry of culture intervened when Reve was to receive a grant, citing the obscene nature of his work. A member of the Dutch senate, the Calvinist senator Hendrik Algra, spoke on the same subject in a plenary debate.  Reve sometimes welcomed the publicity, but also complained about his continual struggle with the authorities, public opinion and the press. Reve was prosecuted in 1966 for allegedly breaking a law against blasphemy. In Nader tot U he describes the narrator's love-making to God, a visitor to his house incarnated in a one-year-old mouse-grey donkey. In April 1968 he was acquitted by the Supreme Court. Although it would take decades for the Netherlands to decriminalize blasphemy, in 2013 the law was abolished, the outcome of this case \u2014 known as the \u201cDonkey Trial\u201d \u2014 rendered the existing law virtually obsolete Reve came from a communist and atheistic family, but converted to Roman Catholicism. Although liturgically traditional, he took a liberal stance on Roman Catholic ethics. His ridiculing of some aspects of Catholicism led to tensions in the Dutch Roman Catholic community in the 1960s. Nevertheless, he contributed as a literary advisor to the translation of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans within the larger context of the Dutch 'Willibrord Translation' of the Bible. One of Reve's main themes, along with religion and love, is his intense hatred of communism, its regimes and the tolerance toward it in leftist circles in the western world. In 1975, he appeared at a Dutch poetry festival, wearing a swastika as well as a hammer and sickle on his clothes, and read a poem that spoke of immigration in racist terms, though stressing cultural differences and using zwart rather than neger/nikker , in a solemn language that insulted many people, especially Afro-Surinamese, many of whom had arrived recently on the eve of the decolonization of Surinam that was to take place in November 1975. This event led to much controversy, and many people have since wondered whether Reve had lost his mind, or had been alluding to something else. In the face of a wave of criticism Reve did not move an inch, and his claims of being 'too intelligent to be a racist' and never wanting to inflict any harm on any racial grounds partly got lost in the confusion generated by his ever-present irony. Like WF Hermans, he invited controversy by visiting South Africa in 1984 in defiance of a cultural boycott that was declared on that country because of its apartheid policy. In 2001, he was awarded the Prijs der Nederlandse Letteren, the most prestigious prize for Dutch-language authors, but King Albert II of Belgium refused to present it to him because his partner had been accused of pedophilia. The money was awarded by bank transfer and the certificate delivered. During the last years of his life, he began to suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and he died of it, in Zulte, Belgium, on 8 April 2006 at the age of 82. Reve was buried on April 15 in the centre of the cemetery \"Nieuwe Begraafplaats\" in Machelen-aan-de-Leie."

        "content": "Behaim was born in Nuremberg on 6 October 1459, the oldest son of Martin Behaim and Agnes Schopper. The elder Martin was a merchant involved in long-distance trade within Europe, including Venice; in 1461 he was elected a senator of Nuremberg. Their son, as a member of a prominent and prosperous family, likely received a good education at one of the best grammar schools in the city. Contrary to later assertions, it is unlikely that he was ever a student of the famous Renaissance mathematician and astronomer, Regiomontanus. When his father died in 1474, Martin's uncle Leonhard sent him at the age of 15 to Mechelen, Flanders to gain experience as a textile merchant. There he joined the business of Jorius van Dorpp, a vendor of clothing. In 1477 they visited Antwerp where van Dorpp sold his wares to a German merchant; later that same year Behaim attended the Frankfurt fair with Bartels von Eyb, a friend of the family. Writing to his uncle in 1478, Behaim expressed a desire to improve his business prospects by moving to Antwerp, a leading center of the cloth trade.  The following year he moved to Antwerp and joined the cloth-dye-house of Fritz Heberlein, a native of Nuremberg. In 1484 Behaim moved to Portugal and set up residence in Lisbon. The circumstances behind this move are unclear but Lisbon was the hub of a wide-ranging trade network that included spices, slaves, and gold from Africa and it is likely that Behaim was looking for trading opportunities. He quickly found favor as a counselor in the court of King John II where he supposedly provided advice on navigation and astronomy. However, despite assertions by his early biographers, there is no evidence that Behaim made any significant contributions in these areas. Claims that he taught celestial navigation or introduced the Portuguese to new navigational instruments are belied by the fact that these technologies were already known and used by Portuguese mariners. He may have acted as an importer of scientific instruments, the finest of which were produced at that time in his native town of Nuremberg. On 18 February 1485 Behaim was knighted by John II, presumably for his contributions as adviser on navigation and astronomy but there is no record of the exact reasons for his honor. It appears that Behaim participated in a voyage to West Africa around 1485; however it is unlikely that he accompanied Diogo C\u00e3o on his second expedition as is sometimes claimed. It is more likely that he participated in a trading voyage to Guinea led by Jo\u00e3o Afonso de Aveiro. Following his marriage to Joana de Macedo in 1486, he resided on the Portuguese island of Faial in the Azores, where his father-in-law, Josse van Huerter, was Captain-donat\u00e1rio and leader of the Flemish community.  In 1490, Behaim returned to Nuremberg to settle a will case, and remained in the city for three years. He managed to convince leading members of the city council to finance the construction of his famous terrestrial globe under his direction. He returned to Faial in 1493 by way of Flanders and Lisbon, and he remained there until 1506. Behaim died in the hospice of Saint Bartholomew on 29 July 1507 while visiting Lisbon for business."

        "title": "Martin Behaim_Unsubstantiated claims",
        "content": "Numerous assertions have been made regarding Behaim's accomplishments, some made by himself and others by his early biographers. Since the twentieth century, historians have taken a more critical look at these claims and have concluded that many of them are unsubstantiated by any documentary evidence, and in some cases flatly contradicted by existing documentation. Historian Johann Christoph Wagenseil claimed in 1682 that Behaim had discovered America before Columbus. Other authors say that Behaim at least gave Columbus the idea of sailing west. There is no evidence that Behaim ever sailed west on a voyage of discovery and although it is possible that Behaim and Columbus met in Lisbon, neither Behaim or Columbus ever referenced such a meeting. Behaim has been hailed as a great mathematician and astronomer but there is no evidence of a scientific education nor are there any extant scientific writings by him. Behaim claimed to be a disciple of the Renaissance mathematician and astronomer, Regiomontanus. Regiomontanus was a neighbor in Nuremberg when Behaim was a boy, but there is no evidence that they ever studied together. Biographers have claimed that Behaim accompanied Diogo C\u00e3o on his second voyage of discovery. Behaim may have contributed to the misunderstanding by leaving a confused account of an African voyage he made in 1485. The fact is that Behaim's dates do not match the dates of this voyage and there is no independent evidence that Behaim sailed with C\u00e3o. Antonio Pigafetta, an Italian writer who accompanied Ferdinand Magellan alleges that Magellan had prior knowledge of a passage to the \"Southern Sea\" derived from a map made by Behaim. Historians now doubt that Behaim had any direct knowledge of such a passage but he may have depicted mysterious passages in an unknown land which Magellan interpreted as the strait he eventually discovered."

        "content": "After Behaim returned to Nuremberg in 1490, leading members of the city council financed the construction of a terrestrial globe. Under  the direction of Behaim, a team of artisans and craftsmen constructed what has become the oldest extant globe. Georg Glockendon was the artist who created the actual map drawings following Behaim's specifications. The globe is about 21 inches in diameter and was fashioned from a type of papier-mache and coated with gypsum. The ball was supported on a wooden tripod and secured by a pair of iron hoops. Glockendon's map drawings were painted onto parchment strips and pasted into position around the sphere. The globe contains more than 2,000 place names, 100 pictorial illustrations , and more than 50 long legends. Many of the notations deal with fabulous monsters of foreign countries and their inhabitants, plants and animals. Many notes also deal with trade, explorations, and famous travelers like Marco Polo. The world map depicted on the Behaim globe is based primarily on the geography of the second-century geographer Ptolemy.  It also combines geographical information from other sources, including Marco Polo, John Mandeville, and Portuguese explorer Diogo Gomes. It is notable for lacking more current Portuguese geographic data which should have been available to Behaim and it contains numerous errors that did not reflect contemporary geographical understanding. The completed globe, which came to be called Erdapfel by the townspeople, was originally housed in Nuremberg's city hall. In the 17th century the Behaim family took possession of the globe. It was inexpertly restored in 1823 and again in 1847, resulting in the corruption of many place-names and labels. The German National Museum in Nuremberg later took possession of the globe, which is commonly known as the Nuremberg Terrestrial Globe. The antiquity of this globe and the year of its execution, on the eve of the discovery of the Americas, makes it not just the oldest globe but also represents an encyclopedia of Europe's knowledge of the known world in 1492."

        "content": "John XIX played a role in the process leading to the Schism of 1054 by rejecting a proposal by Patriarch Eustathius of Constantinople to recognise that patriarchate's sphere of interest in the east. Against the grain of ecclesiastical history, John XIX agreed, upon being paid a large bribe, to recognize the patriarch of Constantinople's claim to the title of ecumenical bishop. However, this proposal excited general indignation throughout the Church, compelling him almost immediately to withdraw from the agreement. John invited the celebrated musician, Guido of Arezzo, to visit Rome and explain the musical notation invented by him. He encouraged the Benedictine to instruct the Roman clergy in music. On the death of the Emperor Henry II in 1024, John gave his support to Emperor Conrad II, who along with his wife, Gisela of Swabia, was crowned with great pomp at St. Peter's Basilica on Easter of 1027. Two kings, Rudolph III of Burgundy and Cnut the Great of Denmark and England, took part in this journey to Rome. Consistent with his role as a Christian king, Cnut went to Rome to repent for his sins, to pray for redemption and the security of his subjects, and to improve the conditions for pilgrims, as well as merchants, on the road to Rome. Rudolph had control of many of the toll gates. Negotiations being successful, the solemn word of the pope, Conrad and Rudolph was given with the witness of four archbishops, twenty bishops, and \"innumerable multitudes of dukes and nobles\", suggesting it was before the ceremonies were completed. In 1025 he sent the crown to Poland and blessed the coronation of the Polish king Boles\u0142aw I the Brave. On 6 April 1027, John held a Lateran synod in which he declared for the patriarch of Aquileia against the patriarch of Grado, giving its bishop, Poppo of Aquileia, the patriarchal dignity and putting the bishop of Grado under his jurisdiction. In fact, the patriarch took precedence over all Italian bishops. In 1029, John revoked his decision and reaffirmed all the dignities of Grado. John also enacted a papal bull endowing Archbishop Byzantius of Bari with the right to consecrate his own twelve suffragans after the reattachment of the Bariot diocese to Rome in 1025. This was part of a conciliatory agreement with Eustathius, whereby the existence of the Byzantine Rite would be allowed in Italy in exchange for the establishment of Latin Rite churches in Constantinople. Pope John XIX took the Cluny Abbey under his protection, and renewed its privileges in spite of the protests of Goslin, bishop of Macon. He offered Odilo of Cluny the archbishopric of Lyons, but Odilo refused and the pope then chided Odilo for disobedience. John XIX died shortly after. He was said to have been killed by a mob of angry peasants, but there is no evidence to support this. His nephew Benedict IX was selected to succeed him, although he was still young; according to some sources, he was only 12, but he was more likely to have been about 18 or 20."

He initially attended Hamline University, but graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1902, followed by William Mitchell College of Law in 1904. Three years later, he was blinded by an electrical shock from a cigar lighter. Schall was elected to the House of Representatives in 1914 and served from March 4, 1915, to March 3, 1925, in the 64th, 65th, 66th, 67th, and 68th congresses. As he was legally blind, he was granted, by House vote, a full-time page to assist him with his work. After losing the Republican primary for a special election to the Senate in 1923, Schall was elected to the Senate in 1924, defeating Magnus Johnson with 46% of the vote. He served from March 4, 1925, until his death, in the 69th, 70th, 71st, 72nd, and 73rd congresses. He had a tough re-election campaign in 1930, facing strong candidates from both the Democratic and Farmer Labor parties, and eventually won with 37% of the vote. Schall was struck by a hit and run driver while walking across the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway in Cottage City, Maryland, on December 19, 1935. He died in Washington three days later, becoming one of the few United States Senators or Congressmen to die in a road accident while in office. He is buried in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis."

He was educated at St Paul's School, at Eton College, and at St John's College, Oxford. In 1714, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, where he was inducted by Newton. Rawlinson was a Jacobite and maintained a strong support for the exiled Stuart Royal family throughout his life.  In 1716 was ordained as a Deacon and then priest in the nonjuring Church of England , the ceremony being performed by the non-juring Usager bishop, Jeremy Collier.  Rawlinson was, in 1728, consecrated as a Bishop in the nonjuring church by Bishops Gandy, Blackbourne and Doughty.  On Blackbourne's death in 1741 he became the senior nonjuring Bishop in London and still maintained a congregation into the mid 1740s.  He was particularly concerned with collecting the history and archives of the nonjurors, but later squabbled with his fellow bishops in continuing the succession with the consecration of Robert Gordon. Rawlinson travelled in England and on the continent of Europe, where he passed several years, making very diverse collections of books, manuscripts, pictures and curiosities  of manuscripts, coins and curiosities, his books alone forming three libraries, English, foreign and Classical. Rawlinson was a friend of the antiquarian Thomas Hearne and, among his voluminous writings, published a Life of the antiquary Anthony Wood. Towards the end of his life, Rawlinson quarrelled with both the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. Cutting the Society of Antiquaries from his bequests, he began transferring his collections to the Bodleian. Among his collection was a copperplate known as the Bodleian Plate depicting structures in Williamsburg, Virginia. A series of almanacs in 175 volumes, ranging in date from 1607 to 1747 arrived in 1752\u201355. At his death, Rawlinson left to the Library 5,205 manuscripts bound in volumes that include many rare broadsides and other printed ephemera, his curiosities, and some other property that endowed a professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University. The Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon was first appointed in 1795. He was also a benefactor to St John's College, Oxford. He died at Islington, London. Richard Rawlinson is buried at St John's College, Oxford, allegedly holding the skull of Christopher Layer, an executed Jacobite. . Rawlinson Road in North Oxford is named after him."

His lyrics are often charged with intentionally simple, heavily metaphorical, or popular expressions, such as \"Burbujas de Amor\" . His lyrics also reflect in political issues, but from a deeply human perspective, that is, centering the lyrics in the human drama that social injustice generates. This is seen in \"Visa Para un Sue\u00f1o\" about the broken dream of a visit to America. \"El Ni\u00e1gara en Bicicleta\" \u2014 a title based on the Cuban idiom, \"al pasar el Niagara en bicicleta\", meaning a difficult task \u2014 describes the negligence that destroys the social health services. \"El Costo de La Vida\" describes the effects of globalization on the working-class people; \"Acomp\u00e1\u00f1eme Civil\" is about police and military corruption that exploits the people that they should care for."

        "content": "Louis Renault was a French jurist and educator, and the co-winner in 1907 of the Nobel Prize for Peace. Renault was born at Autun. From 1868 to 1873, Renault was professor of Roman and commercial law at the University of Dijon. From 1873 until his death, he was professor in the faculty of law at the University of Paris, where in 1881 he became professor of international law. In 1890, he was appointed jurisconsult of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a post created for him in which he scrutinized French foreign policy in the light of international law. He served at numerous conferences in this capacity, notably at the two Hague Conventions and the London Naval Conference . Renault was prominent as an arbitrator, his more famous cases including the Japanese House Tax case of 1905, the Casa Blanca Case of 1909, the Sarvarkar Case of 1911, the Carthage case of 1913, and the Manouba case of 1913. Among his writings are articles and monographs on the specialized topics of international law. Together with his friend and colleague C. Lyon-Caen, he produced several works on commercial law, including a compendium in two volumes, a treatise in eight volumes, and a manual that ran to many editions. In 1879, Renault published his Introduction to the Study of International Law and in 1917 First Violations of International Law by Germany, concerning the invasion of Belgium and of Luxembourg in breach of Germany's treaty obligations."

Active as a session musician from the late 1950s until his death, he gained a following in the late 1960s after the release of his album Gris-Gris and his appearance at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music. He typically performed a lively, theatrical stage show inspired by medicine shows, Mardi Gras costumes, and voodoo ceremonies. Rebennack recorded thirty studio albums and nine live albums, as well as contributing to thousands of other musicians' recordings.

        "content": "Rebennack was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on November 20, 1941. He was the son of Dorothy and Malcolm John Rebennack, and had German, Irish, Spanish, English, and French heritage. His father ran an appliance shop in the East End of New Orleans, fixing radios and televisions and selling records. Growing up in the 3rd Ward of New Orleans, he found early musical inspiration in the minstrel tunes sung by his grandfather and a number of aunts, uncles, sister, and cousins who played piano. He did not take music lessons before his teens and endured only a short stint in choir before getting kicked out. His father exposed him as a young boy to jazz musicians King Oliver and Louis Armstrong, who later inspired his 2014 release, Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch. Throughout his adolescence, his father's connections enabled him access to the recording rooms of rock artists, including Little Richard and Guitar Slim. Later he began to perform in New Orleans clubs, mainly on guitar, and played on stage with various local artists. When he was about 13 years old, Rebennack met Professor Longhair. Impressed by the professor's flamboyant attire and striking musical style, Rebennack soon began performing with him, and began his life as a professional musician. He later recalled that his debut in the studio, in about 1955 or 1956, came when he was signed as a songwriter and artist by Eddie Mesner at Aladdin Records. He joined the musicians' union at the end of 1957, with the help of Danny Kessler, and then considered himself to be a professional musician. At age 16, Rebennack was hired by Johnny Vincent as a producer at Ace Records. There, he gained experience working with many artists, including James Booker, Earl King, and Jimmy Clanton. While a struggling student at Jesuit High School, he was already playing in night clubs, something the Jesuit fathers disapproved of. He formed his first band, The Dominoes, while at the school. The priests told him to either stop playing in clubs or leave the school. Rebennack was expelled from the high school in 1954 and from then on focused entirely on music. In late 1950s New Orleans, Rebennack gigged with local bands including Mac Rebennack and the Skyliners, , Frankie Ford and the Thunderbirds, and Jerry Byrne and the Loafers. By the age of 17, he had co-written his first rock and roll song \"Lights Out\", which was a regional hit for Jerry Byrne on the Specialty label in 1957. He had a regional hit with a Bo Diddley-influenced instrumental called \"Storm Warning\" on Rex Records in 1959. At A&R he and Charlie Miller recorded monophonic singles on 45s for Johnny Vincent and Joe Corona for local labels Ace, Ron, and Ric. He oversaw the rhythm section while Miller wrote the horn arrangements and headed up the horns. This continued until Miller moved to New York to study music formally. Rebennack's career as a guitarist was stunted around 1960, when the ring finger on his left hand was injured by a gunshot during an incident at a Jacksonville, Florida gig. After the injury, Rebennack concentrated on bass guitar before making piano his main instrument, developing a style influenced by Professor Longhair. Rebennack's friend Jay Woolfe, who had played in earlier bands, later recalled that Rebennack would often get into trouble with the police for hanging out with black musicians and in black clubs. Rebennack became involved in illegal activities in New Orleans, using and selling narcotics and running a brothel. He was arrested on drug charges and sentenced to two years in the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Worth. When his sentence ended in 1965, however, a campaign was underway to clean up New Orleans by closing its clubs, which meant that he and his fellow musicians found work hard to get, so he left for Los Angeles. Once settled in Los Angeles he became a \"first call\" session musician in the Los Angeles studio scene in the 1960s and 1970s and was part of the so-called \"Wrecking Crew\" stable of studio musicians. He provided backing for Sonny & Cher , for Canned Heat on their albums Living the Blues and Future Blues , and for Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention on Freak Out! ."

        "title": "Dr. John_Voodoo influence",
        "content": "As a young man, Rebennack was interested in New Orleans voodoo, and in Los Angeles, he developed the idea of the Dr. John persona for his old friend Ronnie Barron, based on the life of Dr. John, a Senegalese prince, conjure man, herb doctor, and spiritual healer who came to New Orleans from Haiti. This free man of color lived on Bayou Road and claimed to have 15 wives and over 50 children. He kept an assortment of snakes and lizards, along with embalmed scorpions and animal and human skulls, and sold gris-gris, voodoo amulets which supposedly protect the wearer from harm. Rebennack decided to produce a record and a stage show based on this concept, with Dr. John serving as an emblem of New Orleans heritage. Although initially, the plan was for Barron to front the act assuming the identity of \"Dr. John\", while Rebennack worked behind the scenes as Dr. John's writer, musician, and producer, this did not come to pass. Barron dropped out of the project, and Rebennack took over the role of Dr. John. Gris-Gris became the name of Dr. John's debut album, released in January 1968, representing his own form of \"voodoo medicine\"."

        "content": "Beginning in the late 1960s, Rebennack gained fame as a solo artist after adopting the persona of \"Dr. John, The Night Tripper\". Dr. John's act combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and elaborate stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. In 1970, when Howard Smith asked him where the name \"Dr. John the Night Tripper\" came from, he responded, \"Before that I was Professor Bizarre. Cats used to call me things like \"Bishop\" or \"Governor\" or somethin' but they started callin' me \"Doctor\" for a while, so I just hung it on myself for keeps.\" On the earliest Dr. John records, the artist billing was \"Dr. John, The Night Tripper\", while the songwriting credits billed him as \"Dr. John Creaux\". Within a few years, the \"Night Tripper\" subtitle was dropped, and Rebennack resumed using his real name for writing and producing/arranging credits. Gris-Gris, his 1968 debut album combining voodoo rhythms and chants with the New Orleans music tradition, was ranked 143rd on Rolling Stone\u2032s \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list. Three more albums, Babylon , Remedies and The Sun, Moon & Herbs , were released in the same vein as Gris-Gris. During early to mid-1969, Dr. John toured extensively, backed by supporting musicians Richard \"Didymus\" Washington , Richard Crooks , David L. Johnson , Gary Carino , and singers Eleanor Barooshian, Jeanette Jacobs from The Cake, and Sherry Graddie. A second lineup formed later in the year for an extensive tour of the East Coast with Crooks and Johnson joined by Doug Hastings and Don MacAllister . The same year, Dr. John contributed to the Music from Free Creek \"supersession\" project, playing on three tracks with Eric Clapton. Washington and Crooks also contributed to the project. By the time The Sun, Moon, and Herbs was released, he had gained a notable cult following, which included artists such as Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger, who both took part in the sessions for that album. This album served as a transition from his Night Tripper voodoo, psychedelic persona to one more closely associated with traditional New Orleans R&B and funk. His next album, Dr. John's Gumbo, with drummer Fred Staehle serving as the band's backbone, proved to be a landmark recording and is one of his most popular to this day."

        "content": "Along with Gris-Gris, Dr. John is perhaps best known for his recordings in the period 1972\u201374. 1972's Dr. John's Gumbo, an album covering several New Orleans R&B standards with only one original, is considered a cornerstone of New Orleans music. In his 1994 autobiography, Under a Hoodoo Moon, Dr. John writes, \"In 1972, I recorded Gumbo, an album that was both a tribute to and my interpretation of the music I had grown up with in New Orleans in the late 1940s and 1950s. I tried to keep a lot of little changes that were characteristic of New Orleans, while working my own funknology on piano and guitar.\" The lead single from the album, \"Iko Iko\", broke into the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, eventually reaching No. 71. In 2003, Dr. John's Gumbo was ranked number 404 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. With Gumbo, Dr. John expanded his career beyond the psychedelic voodoo music and theatrics which had driven his career since he took on the Dr. John persona, although it always remained an integral part of his music and identity. It was not until 1998's Anutha Zone that he again concentrated on this aspect of his music wholly for a full album. \"After we cut the new record\", he wrote, \"I decided I'd had enough of the mighty-coo-de-fiyo hoodoo show, so I dumped the Gris-Gris routine we had been touring with since 1967 and worked up a new act\u2014a Mardi Gras revue featuring the New Orleans standards we had covered in Gumbo.\" In early 1973 Thomas Jefferson Kaye produced an album featuring a collaboration with Dr. John, Mike Bloomfield and John Paul Hammond. This album, Triumvirate, was recorded in Columbia Studios, San Francisco, and Village Recorders, Los Angeles. In 1973, with Allen Toussaint producing and The Meters backing, Dr. John released the seminal New Orleans funk album In the Right Place. In the same way that Gris-Gris introduced the world to the voodoo-influenced side of his music, and in the manner that Dr. John's Gumbo began his career-long reputation as an esteemed interpreter of New Orleans standards, In the Right Place established Dr. John as one of the main ambassadors of New Orleans funk. In describing the album, Dr. John stated, \"The album had more of a straight-ahead dance feel than ones I had done in the past, although it was still anchored solid in R&B.\" It rose to No. 24 on the Billboard album chart. In July 1973, the single \"Right Place, Wrong Time\" peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, as well as peaking at No. 19 on the Hot Soul Singles chart. A second single, \"Such a Night\", peaked at No. 42. Still in heavy rotation on most classic rock stations, \"Right Place Wrong Time\" remains his most recognized song. Artists such as Bob Dylan, Bette Midler, and Doug Sahm contributed single lines to the lyrics, which lists several instances of ironic bad luck and failure. Dr. John attempted to capitalize on In the Right Places successful formula, again collaborating with Allen Toussaint and The Meters, for his next album, Desitively Bonnaroo \u2013 from part of which a Tennessee festival took as its name \u2013 released in 1974. Although similar in feel to In the Right Place, it failed to catch hold in the mainstream as its predecessor had done. It did produce the single \"Rite Away\", which peaked at No. 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and to date is the last time he hit the Hot 100. It was his last pure funk album until 1994's Television, although like his voodoo and traditional New Orleans R&B influences, funk continued to heavily influence most of his work to the end, especially his live concerts. In the mid-1970s Dr. John began an almost 20-year-long collaboration with the R&R Hall of Fame/Songwriters Hall of Fame writer Doc Pomus, to create songs for Dr. John's releases City Lights and Tango Palace, and for B.B. King's Stuart Levine-produced There Must Be a Better World Somewhere, which won a Grammy for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording in 1982. Dr. John also recorded \"I'm On a Roll\" \u2013 the last song written with Pomus prior to his death in 1991 \u2013 for the now out-of-print Rhino/Forward Records 1995 tribute to Pomus titled Til the Night Is Gone: A Tribute to Doc Pomus. The tribute included covers of Pomus-penned songs by Bob Dylan, John Hiatt, Shawn Colvin, Brian Wilson, The Band, Los Lobos, Dion, Rosanne Cash, Solomon Burke, and Lou Reed. According to Pomus' daughter, Dr. John and her father were very close friends as well as writing partners. Dr. John delivered one of a number of eulogies and performed with singer Jimmy Scott at Pomus' funeral on March 17, 1991 in New York City. On Thanksgiving Day 1976 he performed \"Such a Night\" at the farewell concert for The Band, which was filmed by Martin Scorsese and released as The Last Waltz. In 1979, he collaborated with the legendary Professor Longhair on Fess's last recording Crawfish Fiesta, as a guitarist. The album was awarded the first W.C. Handy Blues Album of the Year in 1980 and was released shortly after Longhair's death in January 1980."

In 1975, his manager, Richard Flanzer, hired producer Bob Ezrin, and Hollywood Be Thy Name was recorded live at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California. The studio was transformed into a New Orleans nightclub for the sessions.

He also performed as the first American artist at the Franco Follies festival in 1992. Dr. John's longtime confidant and former personal manager, Paul Howrilla, was responsible for moving Dr. John from Los Angeles to New York and securing \"crossover\" work, as well as modifying Dr. John's image from the 1970s to the 1990s. Paul Howrilla was the brains behind the scenes, as Dr. John would attest. They remained close friends. Dr. John also provided vocals for Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits' \"Luv dat chicken \u00a0...\" jingle, as well as the theme song for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom.

The same year he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame along with Neil Diamond, Alice Cooper, Darlene Love and Tom Waits. In 2012, Dr. John released Locked Down, a collaboration with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, who produced the record and played guitar on it. The album received very positive reviews for its raw, Afrobeat-influenced sound. The Los Angeles Times said that it showed Dr. John \"exiting a period of relative creative stagnation by creating something magical, the embodiment of everything he's done but pushed in a clear new direction\". It won a Grammy Award, as did Auerbach for producing it. In 2014, Dr. John released a Louis Armstrong tribute album, Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch, on Concord Records USA and Proper Records in Europe. Dr. John described the inspiration of the album as Louis Armstrong coming to him in a dream and telling him \"do my music your way\". The Los Angeles Times said, \"Tribute albums come and go, but it's a real rarity that can snap a listener to attention like Dr. John's new salute to jazz founding father Louis Armstrong.\" That spring, \"The Musical Mojo of Mac\", a New Orleans concert to honor Dr. John, was introduced by Brian Williams and kicked off by Bruce Springsteen singing \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", with Dr. John and an all-star band which included event producer Don Was on bass. Dr. John recorded \"Let 'Em In\" in the Paul McCartney tribute album The Art of McCartney. \"It's a wonder to behold, as the ageless Dr. John re-envisions \"Let 'Em In\" as a laconic come on, an invitation to party or maybe something more, once a few more glasses have been raised\", wrote Something Else. \"At the same time, he ends up lacing the song with darker feelings, as well.\" Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl interviewed Dr. John about music in the New Orleans-themed episode of their HBO series Sonic Highways \"\", wrote a Decider reviewer. From 2014 to 2016, Dr. John performed with an alternate band, including at a Hollywood Bowl tribute \"Yes We Can Can\" for his late friend Allen Toussaint on July 20, 2016.

He added a year to his age as an underage prodigy with a local hit, so he could get into gigs."

        "content": "Moses had a rather difficult time adjusting to regular monastic discipline. His flair for adventure remained with him. Attacked by a group of robbers in his desert cell, Moses fought back, overpowered the intruders, and dragged them to the chapel where the other monks were at prayer. He told the brothers that he did not think it was Christian to hurt the robbers and asked what he should do with them. The robbers themselves repented and joined the community as brothers afterwards. Moses was zealous in all he did, but became discouraged when he concluded he was not perfect enough. Early one morning, Isidore, abbot of the monastery, took Moses to the roof and together they watched the first rays of dawn come over the horizon. Isidore said to Moses, \"Only slowly do the rays of the sun drive away the night and usher in a new day, and thus, only slowly does one become a perfect contemplative.\" Moses proved to be effective as a prophetic spiritual leader. The abbot ordered the brothers to fast during a particular week. Some brothers came to Moses, and he prepared a meal for them. Neighboring monks reported to the abbot that Moses was breaking the fast. When they came to confront Moses, they changed their minds, saying, \"You did not keep a human commandment, but it was so that you might keep the divine commandment of hospitality.\" Some see in this account one of the earliest allusions to the Paschal fast, which developed at this time. When a brother committed a fault and Moses was invited to a meeting to discuss an appropriate penance, Moses refused to attend. When he was again called to the meeting, Moses took a leaking jug filled with water and carried it on his shoulder. Another version of the story has him carrying a basket filled with sand. When he arrived at the meeting place, the others asked why he was carrying the jug. He replied, \"My sins run out behind me and I do not see them, but today I am coming to judge the errors of another.\" On hearing this, the assembled brothers forgave the erring monk. Moses became the spiritual leader of a colony of hermits in the Western Desert. Later, he was ordained a priest."

He was joined by seven others, and they were together martyred by the bandits on 24 Paoni . A different story of Abba Moses' death is related in The Paradise of the Holy Fathers:31. Abba Poemen said: Abba Moses asked Abba Zechariah a question when he was about to die, and said unto him, \"Father, is it good that we should hold our peace?\" And Zechariah said unto him, \"Yea, my son, hold thy peace.\" And at the time of his death, whilst Abba Isidore was sitting with him, Abba Moses looked up to heaven, and said, \"Rejoice and be glad, O my son Zechariah, for the gates of heaven have been opened.\""

He was also a poet and art teacher, and his posthumously published reminiscences give a chatty and often vivid picture of life in the circle of the Pre-Raphaelites; he was especially close to Dante Gabriel Rossetti. After growing up in Edinburgh, he moved to London, and from 1843 to 1864 was principal of the government School of Art in Newcastle upon Tyne, where he added industrial subjects to his repertoire of landscapes and history painting.  He was one of the first British artists to extensively depict the processes of the Industrial Revolution. He returned to London, working for the Science and Art Department until 1885. He painted a cycle of historical subjects mixed with scenes from modern industry for Wallington Hall in Northumberland , his best known works, and a purely historical cycle for Penkill Castle in Ayrshire in Scotland. He did not paint many portraits, but his striking portrait of his friend Algernon Charles Swinburne is the iconic image of the poet.  His etchings were mostly designed to illustrate his books."

While a young man he studied art and assisted his father, and he published verses in the Scottish magazines. In 1837, Scott went to London. There he became sufficiently well known as an artist to be appointed in 1844 master of the government school of design at Newcastle-on-Tyne. He held the post for twenty years, and did work in organizing art-teaching and examining under the Science and Art Department. In Newcastle, Scott was visited by all the Rossetti family, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti painted Maria Leathart's portrait at Scott's house 14 St Thomas' Crescent . Algernon Charles Swinburne, who wrote two poems to Scott, spent much time with him in Newcastle after being sent down from Oxford. After 1870 Scott was much in London, where he bought a house in Chelsea, and he was an intimate friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and in high repute as an artist and an author. He was, however, at daggers drawn with John Ruskin. He resigned his appointment under the Science and Art Department in 1885, and from then until his death he was mainly occupied in writing his reminiscences, Autobiographical Notes, which were published posthumously in 1892, with a memoir by Professor Minto. It is for his connection with Rossetti's circle that Bell Scott will be chiefly remembered."

He produced eight large pictures illustrating Northumbrian history, with life-size figures, supplemented by eighteen pictures on The Ballad of Chevy Chase in the spandrels of the arches of the hall. For Penkill Castle he executed a similar series, illustrating James I's poem The Kingis Quair."

        "content": "Annie Oakley was an American sharpshooter who starred in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. Oakley developed hunting skills as a child to provide for her impoverished family in western Ohio. At 15, she won a shooting contest against experienced marksman Frank E. Butler, whom she later married. The pair joined Buffalo Bill in 1885, performing in Europe before royalty and other heads of state. Audiences were astounded to see her shooting out a cigar from her husband's lips or splitting a playing-card edge-on at 30 paces, and she earned more than anyone except Buffalo Bill himself. After a bad rail accident in 1901, she had to settle for a less taxing routine, and toured in a play written about her career, as well as instructing women in marksmanship, believing strongly in female self-defense. Her stage acts were filmed for one of Thomas Edison's earliest Kinetoscopes in 1894. Since her death, her story has been adapted for stage musicals and films, including Annie Get Your Gun."

        "content": "Annie Oakley was born Phoebe Ann Mosey on August 13, 1860, in a log cabin less than  northwest of Woodland, now Willowdell, in Darke County, Ohio, a rural county along the state's border with Indiana. Her birthplace is about  east of North Star. There is a stone-mounted plaque in the vicinity of the site, which was placed by the Annie Oakley Committee in 1981, 121 years after her birth. Annie's parents were Quakers of English descent from Hollidaysburg, Blair County, Pennsylvania: Susan Wise, age 18, and Jacob Mosey, born 1799, age 49, married in 1848. They moved to a rented farm in Patterson Township, Darke County, Ohio, sometime around 1855. Born in 1860, Annie was the sixth of Jacob and Susan's nine children, and the fifth of the seven surviving. Her siblings were Mary Jane , Lydia , Elizabeth , Sarah Ellen , Catherine , John , Hulda and a stillborn infant brother in 1865. Annie's father, who had fought in the War of 1812, was 61 years old at the time of Annie's birth and became invalid from hypothermia during a blizzard in late 1865 and died of pneumonia in early 1866 at age 66. Her mother later married Daniel Brumbaugh, had another daughter, Emily , and was widowed once again. Because of poverty following her father's death, Annie did not regularly attend school as a child, although she did attend later in childhood and in adulthood. On March 15, 1870, at age nine, she was admitted to the Darke County Infirmary along with her sister Sarah Ellen. According to her autobiography, she was put in the care of the infirmary's superintendent, Samuel Crawford Edington, and his wife Nancy, who taught her to sew and decorate. Beginning in the spring of 1870, she was \"bound out\" to a local family to help care for their infant son, on the false promise of fifty cents per week and an education. The couple had originally wanted someone who could pump water, cook, and who was bigger. She spent about two years in near slavery to them, enduring mental and physical abuse. One time, the wife put Annie out in the freezing cold without shoes, as a punishment because she had fallen asleep over some darning. Annie referred to them as \"the wolves\". Even in her autobiography, she never revealed the couple's real names. According to biographer Glenda Riley, \"the wolves\" could have been the Studabaker family, but the 1870 U.S. Census suggests they were the Abram Boose family of neighboring Preble County. Around the spring of 1872, Annie ran away from \"the wolves\". According to biographer Shirl Kasper, it was only at this point that Annie met and lived with the Edingtons, returning to her mother's home around the age of 15. Annie began trapping before the age of seven, and shooting and hunting by age eight, to support her siblings and her widowed mother. She sold the hunted game to locals in Greenville, such as shopkeepers Charles and G. Anthony Katzenberger, who shipped it to hotels in Cincinnati and other cities. She also sold the game to restaurants and hotels in northern Ohio. Her skill paid off the mortgage on her mother's farm when Annie was 15."

        "content": "Annie soon became well known throughout the region. On Thanksgiving Day 1875, the Baughman & Butler shooting act was being performed in Cincinnati. Traveling show marksman and former dog trainer Frank E. Butler , an Irish immigrant, placed a $100 bet per side with Cincinnati hotel owner Jack Frost that Butler could beat any local fancy shooter. The hotelier arranged a shooting match between Butler and the 15-year-old Annie, saying, \"The last opponent Butler expected was a  15-year-old girl named Annie.\" After missing on his 25th shot, Butler lost the match and the bet. Another account says that Butler hit on his last shot, but the bird fell dead about  beyond the boundary line. He soon began courting Annie and they married. They did not have children. According to a modern-day account in The Cincinnati Enquirer, it is possible that the shooting match took place in 1881 and not 1875. It appears the time of the event was never recorded. Biographer Shirl Kasper states the shooting match took place in the spring of 1881 near Greenville, possibly in North Star as mentioned by Butler during interviews in 1903 and 1924. Other sources seem to coincide with the North Fairmount location near Cincinnati if the event occurred in 1881. The Annie Oakley Center Foundation mentions Oakley visiting her married sister Lydia Stein at her home near Cincinnati in 1875. That information is incorrect as Lydia didn't marry Joseph C. Stein until March 19, 1877. Although speculation, it is most likely that Oakley and her mother visited Lydia in 1881 as she was seriously ill from tuberculosis. The Bevis House hotel was still being operated by Martin Bevis and W. H. Ridenour in 1875. It opened around 1860 after the building was previously used as a pork packaging facility. Jack Frost didn't obtain management of the hotel until 1879. The Baughman & Butler shooting act first appeared on the pages of The Cincinnati Enquirer in 1880. They signed with Sells Brothers Circus in 1881 and made an appearance at the Coliseum Opera House later that year. Regardless of the actual date of the shooting match, Oakley and Butler were married a year afterward. A certificate on file with the Archives of Ontario, Registration Number 49594, reports that Butler and Oakley were wed on June 20, 1882, in Windsor, Ontario. Many sources say the marriage took place on August 23, 1876, in Cincinnati, but no recorded certificate validates that date. A possible reason for the contradictory dates is that Butler's divorce from his first wife, Henrietta Saunders, was not yet final in 1876. An 1880 U.S. Federal Census record shows Saunders as married. Sources mentioning Butler's first wife as Elizabeth are inaccurate; Elizabeth was his granddaughter, her father being Edward F. Butler. Throughout Oakley's show-business career, the public was often led to believe that she was five to six years younger than she was. The later marriage date would have better supported her fictional age."

        "content": "Annie and Frank Butler lived in Cincinnati for a time. Oakley, the stage name she adopted when she and Frank began performing together, is believed to have been taken from the city's neighborhood of Oakley, where they resided. Some people believe she took on the name because that was the name of the man who had paid her train fare when she was a child. They joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West in 1885. At five feet tall, Oakley was given the nickname of \"Watanya Cicilla\" by fellow performer Sitting Bull, rendered \"Little Sure Shot\" in the public advertisements. During her first engagement with the Buffalo Bill show, Oakley experienced a tense professional rivalry with rifle sharpshooter Lillian Smith. Smith was eleven years younger than Oakley, age 15 at the time she joined the show in 1886, which may have been a primary reason for Oakley to alter her actual age in later years due to Smith's press coverage becoming as favorable as hers. Oakley temporarily left the Buffalo Bill show but returned two years later, after Smith departed, in time for the Paris Exposition of 1889. This three-year tour only cemented Oakley as America's first female star. She earned more than any other performer in the show, except for Buffalo Bill himself. She also performed in many shows on the side for extra income. In Europe, she performed for Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, King Umberto I of Italy, President Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot of France and other crowned heads of state. Oakley supposedly shot the ashes off a cigarette held by the newly crowned German Kaiser Wilhelm II at his request. From 1892 to 1904, Oakley and Butler made their home in Nutley, New Jersey. Oakley promoted the service of women in combat operations for the United States armed forces. She wrote a letter to President William McKinley on April 5, 1898, \"offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should the U.S. go to war with Spain.\" The Spanish\u2013American War did occur, but Oakley's offer was not accepted. Theodore Roosevelt, did, however, name his volunteer cavalry the \"Rough Riders\" after the \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World\" where Oakley was a major star. In 1901 , Oakley was badly injured in a train accident but recovered after temporary paralysis and five spinal operations. She left the Buffalo Bill show and in 1902 began a less taxing acting career in a stage play written especially for her, The Western Girl. Oakley played the role of Nancy Berry who used a pistol, a rifle and rope to outsmart a group of outlaws. Throughout her career, it is believed that Oakley taught more than 15,000 women how to use a gun. Oakley believed strongly that it was crucial for women to learn how to use a gun, as not only a form of physical and mental exercise, but also to defend themselves. She said: \"I would like to see every woman know how to handle guns, as naturally as they know how to handle babies.\" The Little Sure Shot of the Wild West Buffalo Bill was friends with Thomas Edison, and Edison built the world's largest electrical power plant at the time for the Wild West Show. Buffalo Bill and 15 of his show Indians appeared in two Kinetoscopes filmed September 24, 1894. In 1894, Oakley and Butler performed in Edison's Kinetoscope film \"Little Sure Shot\" of the \"Wild West\", an exhibition of rifle shooting at stationary and moving objects, which was filmed November 1, 1894, in Edison's Black Maria studio by William Heise. It lasted 21 seconds at 30 frames and 39 feet.  It was the eleventh film made after commercial showings began on April 14, 1894."

The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica notes that:Oakley never failed to delight her audiences, and her feats of marksmanship were truly incredible. At 30 paces she could split a playing card held edge-on, she hit dimes tossed into the air, she shot cigarettes from her husband's lips, and, a playing card being thrown into the air, she riddled it before it touched the ground. R. A. Koestler-Grack reports that, on March 19, 1884, she was being watched by Chief Sitting Bull when:Oakley playfully skipped on stage, lifted her rifle, and aimed the barrel at a burning candle. In one shot, she snuffed out the flame with a whizzing bullet. Sitting Bull watched her knock corks off of bottles and slice through a cigar Butler held in his teeth."

The former Indian Chief was so impressed with Oakley's skills that he offered $65 for a photograph of him and her together. According to Oakley, the admiration and respect was mutual and only increased as they spent more time together.   Sitting Bull felt Oakley must be \"gifted\" by supernatural means, in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, Sitting Bull symbolically \"adopted\" Oakley as his daughter in 1884, naming her \"Little Sure Shot\" \u2013 a title that Oakley went onto use throughout her career."

Most of the newspapers that printed the story had relied on the Hearst article, and they immediately retracted it with apologies upon learning of the libelous error. Hearst, however, tried to avoid paying the anticipated court judgments of $20,000 by sending an investigator to Darke County, Ohio, with the intent of collecting reputation-smearing gossip from Oakley's past. The investigator found nothing. Oakley spent much of the next six years winning all but one of her 55 libel lawsuits against newspapers.

It is known as the Annie Oakley House and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 1917, they moved to North Carolina and returned to public life. She continued to set records into her sixties and also engaged in extensive philanthropy for women's rights and other causes, including the support of young women she knew. She embarked on a comeback and intended to star in a feature-length silent movie. She hit 100 clay targets in a row from  at age 62 in a 1922 shooting contest in Pinehurst, North Carolina. In late 1922, the couple were in a car accident that forced her to wear a steel brace on her right leg. She eventually performed again after more than a year of recovery, and she set records in 1924. Her health declined in 1925 and she died of pernicious anemia in Greenville, Ohio, at the age of 66 on November 3, 1926. She was cremated and her ashes buried at Brock Cemetery, near Greenville. According to B. Haugen, Butler was so grieved by Oakley's death that he stopped eating and died 18 days later in Michigan; he was buried next to her ashes. Kasper reports that Butler's death certificate gave \"senility\" as the cause of death. One rumor claims that Oakley's ashes were placed in one of her trophies and placed with Butler's body in his coffin prior. Both body and ashes were interred in the cemetery on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1926. After her death, her incomplete autobiography was given to stage comedian Fred Stone, and it was discovered that her entire fortune had been spent on her family and her charities. A vast collection of Oakley's personal possessions, performance memorabilia, and firearms are on permanent exhibit in the Garst Museum and the National Annie Oakley Center in Greenville, Ohio. She has been inducted into the Trapshooting Hall of Fame, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, the National Women's Hall of Fame, the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame, and the New Jersey Hall of Fame."

Oakley's name appears as \"Ann Mosey\" in the 1870 U.S. Census and \"Mosey\" is engraved on her father's headstone and appears in his military record; \"Mosey\" is the official spelling by the Annie Oakley Foundation, maintained by her living relatives. The spelling \"Mosie\" has also appeared. According to Kasper, Oakley insisted that her family name be spelled \"Mozee\", leading to arguments with her brother John. Kasper speculates that Oakley may have considered \"Mozee\" to be a more phonetic spelling. There is also popular speculation that young Oakley had been teased about her name by other children. Prior to their double wedding in March 1884, both Oakley's brother John and one of her sisters, Hulda, changed their surnames to \"Moses\"."

Oakley urged that women serve in war, though President William McKinley rejected her offer of woman sharpshooters for service in the Spanish\u2013American War. Beyond this offer to the president, Oakley believed that women should learn to use a gun for the empowering image that it gave. Laura Browder discusses how Oakley's stardom gave hope to women and youth in Her Best Shot: Women and Guns In America. Oakley pressed for women to be independent and educated.

The Madero family had settled in Northern Mexico in the early nineteenth century.  Grandfather Evaristo had founded the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Industrial de Parras. In the latter part of the nineteenth century the Madero family business extended from vineyards, cotton, and textiles, to mining, milling, smelting, ranching, and banking. Gustavo went to high school at the Colegio San Juan, a Jesuit school in Saltillo. For further high school studies and to learn English, the two oldest Madero brothers, Gustavo and Francisco attended Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Maryland but stayed only for a year. In 1887, made possible with the financial support of his father, Gustavo and his older brother Francisco moved to France where they attended the Lycee of Versailles and finally received a baccalaureate. Gustavo went on to study business management at Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales in Jouy-en-Josas, near Paris.

        "content": "There were many divisions within the Madero family; some of its members wished for a peace agreement, hoping to avoid the problems that the civil war would bring to their businesses and investments. Talks were arranged in New York with Jos\u00e9 Yves Limantour, the finance minister of the D\u00edaz government, but these failed as the revolution continued and peace negotiations broke down. Financing his brother's revolution required serious funding. Gustavo through family contacts went to New York in 1910. His main contact was the Washington lawyer and lobbyist Sherburne Hopkins. For a fee of $50,000 Gustavo signed him on to represent and promote the revolutionary movement his brother Francisco led against the Dictator Porfirio Diaz. Hopkins brought the New York financiers Henry Clay Pierce and Charles Ranlett Flint on board. Both had financial interest in the Mexican railroads and oil. Their main competitors, John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil and Viscount Cowdray of the El Aguila Oil Company supported the Diaz regime. Thus, in the spring of 1911, the rivalry between international oil barons and the help of Sherburne Hopkins allowed Gustavo to raise the funds needed to depose the aging dictator of Mexico. After the success of the revolution, Gustavo remained his brother's closest confidante, although he did not hold public office. One of the most important tools of Gustavo's power between May 1911 and February 1913 was the Mexican Secret Service which he headed. Originally established and financed by Sherburne Hopkins, Gustavo through his lieutenant Felix A. Sommerfeld put down the most serious challenges to Francisco Madero's government. In the fall of 1911, Bernardo Reyes, an exiled general and competitor for the presidency in 1910, rose in revolt from San Antonio, Texas. The uprising fizzled by Christmas and Reyes was arrested. A few months later, another disgruntled revolutionary, Pascual Orozco who had fought alongside Madero to defeat Diaz, challenged the government in a massive uprising that covered much of northern Mexico. Again, Gustavo sent Sommerfeld to the border. The Mexican secret service cooperated closely with agents of the American Bureau of Investigations, customs and military officials to put down the uprising. Another uprising in Veracruz in the fall of 1912, this time headed by Felix Diaz, a relative of the deposed dictator, also fell victim to the efficient secret service under Gustavo's control. In the process, however, Gustavo made many serious enemies. Felix Diaz and Bernardo Reyes plotted their next moves from their jail cells. Victoriano Huerta, the army chief who the Mexican president fired for disloyalty on Gustavo's advice, seethed with resentment."

Felix Diaz, Bernardo Reyes and a host of members of the old regime plotted to take control of Mexico City first and then the entire country. As the assault started on February 9, Reyes and Diaz marched on the presidential palace. In a shootout with troops Gustavo had frantically assembled in the early morning hours, Reyes was killed. Madero's secretary of war Lauro Villar Ochoa was seriously injured. The president appointed Victoriano Huerta, who professed undivided loyalty to Madero to replace him. However, Gustavo quickly uncovered the participation of Huerta in the conspiracy. On February 17, he arrested Huerta and brought him before the president. Against Gustavo's advice, Huerta remained in charge of the military. The Madero government collapsed the next day. On February 18 the American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, Victoriano Huerta and F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz signed an agreement cementing the coup d'\u00e9tat, titled the Pact of the Embassy. Gustavo was ambushed and arrested inside the Gambrinus restaurant just before lunch. Two hours later, President Francisco Madero became a prisoner of the putschists. Followers of D\u00edaz sought to have Francisco and Gustavo Madero turned over to them. The President was kept by Huerta, since his resignation from the presidency was needed to give a veneer of legality to the coup d'etat.

        "content": "Julius Winfield Erving II , commonly known by the nickname Dr. J, is an American former professional basketball player. Regarded as one of the most influential basketball players of all time, Erving helped legitimize the American Basketball Association and was the best-known player in that league when it merged into the National Basketball Association after the 1975\u201376 season. Erving won three championships, four Most Valuable Player Awards, and three scoring titles with the ABA's Virginia Squires and New York Nets and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. During his 16 seasons as a player, none of his teams ever missed the postseason. He is the eighth-highest scorer in ABA/NBA history with 30,026 points . He was well known for slam dunking from the free-throw line in slam dunk contests and was the only player voted Most Valuable Player in both the ABA and the NBA. The basketball slang of being posterized was first coined to describe his moves. In 1993, Erving was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1994, Erving was named by Sports Illustrated as one of the 40 most important athletes of all time. In 1996, Erving was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team. In 2004, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2021, Erving was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. Many consider him one of the most talented players in the history of the NBA; he is widely acknowledged as one of the game's best dunkers. While Connie Hawkins, \"Jumping\" Johnny Green, Elgin Baylor, Jim Pollard, and Gus Johnson performed spectacular dunks before Erving's time, Erving brought the practice into the mainstream. His signature dunk was the \"slam\" dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the \"crossover\" dribble and the \"no look\" pass. Before Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game. However, the way Erving utilized the dunk more as a high-percentage shot made at the end of maneuvers generally starting well away from the basket and not necessarily a \"show of force\" helped to make the shot an acceptable tactic, especially in trying to avoid a blocked shot. Although the slam dunk is still widely used as a show of power, a method of intimidation, and a way to fire up a team , Erving demonstrated that there can be great artistry and almost balletic style to slamming the ball into the hoop, particularly after a launch several feet from that target."

He attended Roosevelt High School and played for its basketball team. He received the nickname \"Doctor\" or \"Dr. J\" from a high school friend named Leon Saunders. He explains, I started calling [Saunders] \"the professor\", and he started calling me \"the doctor\". So it was just between us...we were buddies, we had our nicknames and we would roll with the nicknames.  ...And that's where it came from. Erving recalled, \"[L]ater on, in the Rucker Park league in Harlem, when people started calling me 'Black Moses' and 'Houdini', I told them if they wanted to call me anything, call me 'Doctor,'\" Over time, the nickname evolved into \"Dr. Julius,\" and finally \"Dr. J.\""

Erving took advantage of the rule change and left Massachusetts after his junior year to sign a four-year contract worth $500,000 spread over seven years with the Virginia Squires. Erving quickly established himself as a force and gained a reputation for hard and ruthless dunking. He scored 27.3 points per game as a rookie, was selected to the All-ABA Second Team, made the ABA All-Rookie Team, led the ABA in offensive rebounds, and finished second to Artis Gilmore for the ABA Rookie of the Year Award. He led the Squires into the Eastern Division Finals, where they lost to the Rick Barry-led New York Nets in seven games. The Nets would eventually go to the finals, losing to the star-studded Indiana Pacers team."

        "content": "Under NBA rules, he became eligible for the 1972 NBA draft and the Milwaukee Bucks picked him in the first round . This move would have brought him together with Oscar Robertson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. However, prior to the draft, he signed a contract with the Atlanta Hawks worth more than $1 million with a $250,000 bonus. The signing with the Hawks came after a dispute with the Squires where he demanded a renegotiation of the terms. He discovered that his agent at the time, Steve Arnold, was employed by the Squires and convinced him to sign a below-market contract. This created a dispute between three teams in two leagues. The Bucks asserted their rights to Erving via the draft, while the Squires went to court to force him to honor his contract. He joined Pete Maravich at the Hawks' training camp, as they prepared for the upcoming season. He played two exhibition games with the Hawks until NBA Commissioner J. Walter Kennedy ruled that the Bucks owned Erving's rights via the draft. Kennedy fined the Hawks $25,000 per game in violation of his ruling. Atlanta appealed Kennedy's decision to the league owners, who also supported the Bucks\u2019 position. While waiting for the owners\u2019 decision, Erving played in one more preseason game, earning the Hawks another fine. Erving enjoyed his brief time with Atlanta, and he would later duplicate with George Gervin his after-practice playing with Maravich. On October 2, Judge Edward Neaher issued an injunction that prohibited him from playing for any team other than the Squires. The judge then sent the case to arbitration because of an arbitration clause in Erving\u2019s contract with Virginia. He agreed to report to the Squires while his appeal of the injunction made its way through the court. Back in the ABA, his game flourished, and he achieved a career-best 31.9 points per game in the 1972\u20131973 season. The following year, the cash-strapped Squires sold his contract to the New York Nets. New York Nets The Squires, like most ABA teams, were on rather shaky financial ground. The cash-strapped team sent Erving to the Nets in a complex deal that kept him in the ABA. Erving signed an eight-year deal worth a reported $350,000 per year. The Squires received $750,000, George Carter, and the rights to Kermit Washington for Erving and Willie Sojourner. The Nets also sent $425,000 to the Hawks to reimburse the team for its legal fees, fines and the bonus paid to Erving. Finally, Atlanta would receive draft compensation should a merger of the league result in a common draft. He went on to lead the Nets to their first ABA title in 1973\u201374, defeating the Utah Stars. Erving established himself as the most important player in the ABA. His spectacular play established the Nets as one of the better teams in the ABA, and brought fans and credibility to the league. The end of the 1975\u201376 ABA season finally brought the ABA\u2013NBA merger. The Nets and Nuggets had applied for admission to the NBA before the season, in anticipation of the eventual merger that had first been proposed by the two leagues in 1970 but which was delayed for various reasons, including the Oscar Robertson free agency suit . The Erving-led Nets defeated the Denver Nuggets in the ABA\u2019s final championship. In the postseason, Erving averaged 34.7 points and was named Most Valuable Player of the playoffs. That season, he finished in the top 10 in the ABA in points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game, free throw percentage, free throws made, free throws attempted, three-point field goal percentage and three-point field goals made."

        "content": "The Nets, Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs joined the NBA for the 1976\u201377 season. With Erving and Nate Archibald , the Nets were poised to pick up right where they left off. However, the New York Knicks upset the Nets' plans when they demanded that the Nets pay them $4.8 million for \"invading\" the Knicks' NBA territory. Coming on the heels of the fees the Nets had to pay for joining the NBA, owner Roy Boe reneged on a promise to raise Erving's salary. Erving refused to play under these conditions and held out in training camp. After several teams such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers lobbied to obtain him, the Nets offered Erving's contract to the New York Knicks in return for waiving the indemnity, but the Knicks turned it down. This was considered one of the worst decisions in franchise history. The Sixers then decided to offer to buy Erving's contract for $3 million\u2014in addition to paying roughly the Nets same amount as their expansion fee\u2014and Boe had little choice but to accept the $6 million deal. For all intents and purposes, the Nets traded their franchise player for a berth in the NBA. The Erving deal left the Nets in ruin; they promptly crashed to a 22\u201360 record, the worst in the league. Years later, Boe regretted having to trade Erving to join the NBA, saying, \"The merger agreement killed the Nets as an NBA franchise.\" Erving quickly became the leader of his new club and led them to an exciting 50-win season. However, playing with other stars-such as former ABA standout George McGinnis, future NBA All-Star Lloyd Free, and aggressive Doug Collins allowed him to focus on playing more team-oriented ball. Despite a smaller role, Erving stayed unselfish. The Sixers won the Atlantic Division and were the top drawing team in the NBA. They defeated the defending champions, the Boston Celtics, to win the Eastern Conference. Erving took them into the NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers of Bill Walton. After the Sixers took a 2\u20130 lead, however, the Blazers ran off four straight victories after the famous brawl between Maurice Lucas and Darryl Dawkins which ignited the Blazers' team. However, Erving enjoyed success off the court, becoming one of the first basketball players to endorse many products and to have a shoe marketed under his name. He also starred in the 1979 basketball comedy film, The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh. In the following years, Erving coped with a team that was not yet playing at his level. It took a few years for the Sixers franchise to build around Erving. Eventually, coach Billy Cunningham and top-level players like Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones were added to the mix and the franchise was very successful. The Sixers were still eliminated twice in the Eastern Conference Finals. In 1979, Larry Bird entered the league, reviving the Boston Celtics and the storied Celtics\u201376ers rivalry; these two teams faced each other in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1985. The Bird vs. Erving matchup became arguably the top personal rivalry in the sport , inspiring the early Electronic Arts video game One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird. In 1980, the 76ers prevailed over the Celtics to advance to the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. There, Erving executed the legendary \"Baseline Move\", a behind-the-board reverse layup. However, the Lakers won 4\u20132 with superb play from, among others, Magic Johnson. Erving again was among the league's best players in the 1980\u20131981 and 1981\u20131982 seasons, although more disappointment came as the Sixers stumbled twice in the playoffs: in 1981, the Celtics eliminated them in seven games in the 1981 Eastern Finals after Philadelphia had a 3\u20131 series lead, but lost both Game 5 and Game 6 by 2 points and the deciding Game 7 by 1; and in 1982, the Sixers managed to beat the defending champion Celtics in seven games in the 1982 Eastern Finals but lost the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Despite these defeats, Erving was named the NBA MVP in 1981 and was again voted to the 1982 All-NBA First Team. Finally, for the 1982\u201383 season, the Sixers obtained the missing element to combat their weakness at their center position, Moses Malone. Armed with one of the most formidable and unstoppable center-forward combinations of all time, the Sixers dominated the whole season, prompting Malone to make the famous playoff prediction of \"fo-fo-fo \" in anticipation of the 76ers sweeping the three rounds of the playoffs en route to an NBA title. In fact, the Sixers went four-five-four, losing one game to the Milwaukee Bucks in the conference finals, then sweeping the Lakers to win the NBA title. Erving maintained his all-star caliber of play into his twilight years, averaging 22.4, 20.0, 18.1, and 16.8 points per game in his final seasons. In 1986, he announced that he would retire after the season, causing every game he played to be sold out with adoring fans. That final season saw opposing teams pay tribute to Erving in the last game Erving would play in their arenas, including in cities such as Boston and Los Angeles, his perennial rivals in the playoffs."

He is also one of the few players in modern basketball to have his number retired by two franchises: the Brooklyn Nets have retired his No. 32 jersey, and the Philadelphia 76ers his No. 6 jersey. He was an excellent all around player who was also an underrated defender. In his ABA days, he would guard the best forward, whether small forward or power forward, for over 40 minutes a game, and simultaneously be the best passer, ball handler, and clutch scorer every night. Many of Erving's acrobatic highlight feats and clutch moments were unknown because of the ABA's scant television coverage. He is considered by many as the greatest dunker of all time. In his ABA and NBA careers combined, he scored more than 30,000 points. In 1993, Erving was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. When he retired, Erving ranked in the top 5 in scoring , field goals made , field goals attempted and steals .

He went all the way to the end of the court and ran to release a free throw line dunk.

With UCLA defensive legend Bill Walton waiting in the post, Erving threw down a vicious slam dunk over Walton's outstretched arms. This dunk is considered by many to be one of the strongest dunks ever attempted, considering he ran full court with all five defenders running with him.

As he came inside of the 3-point line, he cupped the ball into his wrist and forearm, rocking the ball back and forth before taking off for what Lakers radio broadcaster Chick Hearn best described as a \"Rock The Baby\" slam dunk: he slung the ball around behind his head and dunked over a ducking Cooper.

He has spoken about his faith, saying, \"After searching for the meaning of life for over ten years, I found the meaning in Jesus Christ.\" Erving was first called \"Dr. J\" by his friend and teammate on the Nets and Squires, Willie Sojourner. In 1988, Erving received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Erving is a second cousin of economist Walter Williams. Erving was married to Turquoise Erving from 1972 until 2003. Together they had four children. In 2000, their 19-year-old son Cory went missing for weeks, until he was found drowned after driving his vehicle into a pond. In 1979, Erving began an affair with sportswriter Samantha Stevenson, resulting in the 1980 birth of Alexandra Stevenson, who would become a professional tennis player. Although Erving's fatherhood of Alexandra Stevenson was known privately to the families involved, it did not become public knowledge until Stevenson reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1999, the first year she qualified to play in the tournament. Erving had provided financial support for Stevenson over the years, but had not otherwise been part of her life. The public disclosure of their relationship did not initially lead to contact between father and daughter. However, Stevenson contacted Erving in 2008 and they finally initiated a further relationship. In 2009 Erving attended the Family Circle Cup tennis tournament to see Stevenson play, marking the first time he had attended one of her matches. In 2003, Erving fathered a second child outside of his marriage, Justin Kangas, with a woman named Dor\u00fds Madden. Julius and Turquoise Erving were subsequently divorced and Erving continued his relationship with Madden, with whom he had three more children, Jules Erving and two others. They married in 2008."

        "content": "Edward Drinker Cope was an American zoologist, paleontologist, comparative anatomist, herpetologist, and ichthyologist. Born to a wealthy Quaker family, Cope distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science; he published his first scientific paper at the age of 19. Though his father tried to raise Cope as a gentleman farmer, he eventually acquiesced to his son's scientific aspirations. Cope married his cousin and had one child; the family moved from Philadelphia to Haddonfield, New Jersey, although Cope would maintain a residence and museum in Philadelphia in his later years. Cope had little formal scientific training, and he eschewed a teaching position for field work. He made regular trips to the American West, prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s, often as a member of United States Geological Survey teams. A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil-finding competition now known as the Bone Wars. Cope's financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the 1880s, forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection. He experienced a resurgence in his career toward the end of his life before dying on April 12, 1897. Though Cope's scientific pursuits nearly bankrupted him, his contributions helped to define the field of American paleontology. He was a prodigious writer, with 1,400\u00a0papers published over his lifetime, although his rivals debated the accuracy of his rapidly published works. He discovered, described, and named more than 1,000\u00a0vertebrate species, including hundreds of fishes and dozens of dinosaurs. His proposal for the origin of mammalian molars is notable among his theoretical contributions. \"Cope's rule\", however, the hypothesis that mammalian lineages gradually grow larger over geologic time, while named after him, is \"neither explicit nor implicit\" in his work."

        "title": "Edward Drinker Cope_Early life",
        "content": "Edward Drinker Cope was born on July 28, 1840, the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope. The death of his mother when he was three years old seemed to have had little effect on young Edward, as he mentioned in his letters that he had no recollection of her. His stepmother, Rebecca Biddle, filled the maternal role; Cope referred to her warmly, as well as his younger stepbrother, James Biddle Cope. Alfred, an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers, operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father, Thomas P. Cope, in 1821. He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends, the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens, and the Institute for Colored Youth. Edward was born and raised in a large stone house called \"Fairfield\", whose location is now within the boundaries of Philadelphia. The  of pristine and exotic gardens of the house offered a landscape that Edward was able to explore. The Copes began teaching their children to read and write while very young, and took Edward on trips across New England and to museums, zoos, and gardens. Cope's interest in animals became apparent at a young age, as did his natural artistic ability. Alfred intended to give his son the same education he himself had received. At age nine, Edward was sent to a day school in Philadelphia; at 12, he attended the Friends' Boarding School at Westtown, near West Chester, Pennsylvania. The school was founded in 1799 with fundraising by members of the Society of Friends , and provided much of the Cope family's education. The prestigious school was expensive, costing Alfred $500 in tuition each year, and in his first year, Edward studied algebra, chemistry, scripture, physiology, grammar, astronomy, and Latin. Edward's letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to manipulate his father, and he was, according to author and Cope biographer Jane Davidson, \"a bit of a spoiled brat\". His letters suggest he was lonely at the school\u2014it was the first time he had been away from his home for an extended period. Otherwise, Edward's studies progressed much like a typical boy\u2014he consistently had \"less than perfect\" or \"not quite satisfactory\" marks for conduct from his teachers, and did not work hard on his penmanship lessons, which may have contributed to his often-illegible handwriting as an adult. Edward returned to Westtown in 1855, accompanied by two of his sisters. Biology began to interest him more that year, and he studied natural history texts in his spare time. While at the school, he frequently visited the Academy of Natural Sciences. Edward often obtained bad marks due to quarreling and bad conduct. His letters to his father show he chafed at farm work and betrayed flashes of the temper for which he would later become well known. After sending Edward back to the farm for summer break in 1854 and 1855, Alfred did not return Edward to school after spring 1856. Instead, Alfred attempted to turn his son into a gentleman farmer, which he considered a wholesome profession that would yield enough profit to lead a comfortable life, and improve the undersized Edward's health. Until 1863, Cope's letters to his father continually expressed his yearning for a more professional scientific career than that of a farmer, which he called \"dreadfully boring\". While working on farms, Edward continued his education on his own. In 1858, he began working part-time at the Academy of Natural Sciences, reclassifying and cataloguing specimens, and published his first series of research results in January 1859. Cope began taking French and German classes with a former Westtown teacher. Though Alfred resisted his son's pursuit of a science career, he paid for his son's private studies. Instead of working the farm his father bought for him, Edward rented out the land and used the income to further his scientific endeavors. Alfred finally gave in to Edward's wishes and paid for university classes. Cope attended the University of Pennsylvania in the 1861 and/or 1862 academic years, studying comparative anatomy under Joseph Leidy, one of the most influential anatomists and paleontologists at the time. Cope asked his father to pay for a tutor in German and French to allow him to read scholarly works in those languages. During this period, he had a job recataloging the herpetological collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences, where he became a member at Leidy's urging. Cope visited the Smithsonian Institution on occasion, where he became acquainted with Spencer Baird, who was an expert in the fields of ornithology and ichthyology. In 1861, he published his first paper on Salamandridae classification; over the next five years he published primarily on reptiles and amphibians. Cope's membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences and American Philosophical Society gave him outlets to publish and announce his work; many of his early paleontological works were published by the Philosophical Society."

        "content": "In 1863\u20131864 during the American Civil War, Cope traveled through Europe, taking the opportunity to visit the most esteemed museums and societies of the time. Initially, he seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital, but in letters to his father later on in the war, this aspiration seemed to disappear; instead he considered working in the American South to assist freed African Americans. Davidson suggests Cope's correspondence with Leidy and Ferdinand Hayden, who worked as field surgeons during the war, might have informed Cope of the horrors of the occupation. Edward was involved in a love affair; his father did not approve. Whether Edward or the unnamed woman broke off the relationship is unknown, but he took the breakup poorly. Biographer and paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn attributed Edward's sudden departure for Europe as a method of keeping him from being drafted into the Civil War. Cope did write to his father from London on February 11, 1864, \"I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this, as I know certain persons who would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe to avoid the war.\" Eventually, Cope took the pragmatic approach and waited out the conflict. He may have suffered from mild depression during this period, and often complained of boredom. Despite his torpor, Edward proceeded with his tour of Europe, and met with some of the most highly esteemed scientists of the world during his travels through France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Austria, Italy, and Eastern Europe, most likely with introductory letters from Leidy and Spencer Baird. In the winter of 1863, Edward met Othniel Charles Marsh while in Berlin. Marsh, age 32, was attending the University of Berlin. He held two university degrees in comparison to Edward's lack of formal schooling past 16, but Edward had written 37\u00a0scientific papers in comparison to Marsh's two published works. While they would later become rivals, on meeting, the two men appeared to take a liking to each other. Marsh led Edward on a tour of the city, and they stayed together for days. After Edward left Berlin, the two maintained correspondence, exchanging manuscripts, fossils, and photographs. Edward burned many of his journals and letters from Europe upon his return to the United States. Friends intervened and stopped Cope from destroying some of his drawings and notes, in what author Url Lanham deemed a \"partial suicide\"."

        "content": "When Cope returned to Philadelphia in 1864, his family made every effort to secure him a teaching post as the Professor of Zoology at Haverford College, a small Quaker school where the family had philanthropic ties. The college awarded him an honorary master's degree so he could have the position. Cope even began to think about marriage and consulted his father in the matter, telling him of the girl he would like to marry: \"an amiable woman, not over sensitive, with considerable energy, and especially one inclined to be serious and not inclined to frivolity and display\u2014the more truly Christian of course the better\u2014seems to be the most practically the most suitable for me, though intellect and accomplishments have more charm.\" Cope thought of Annie Pim, a member of the Society of Friends, as less a lover than companion, declaring, \"her amiability and domestic qualities generally, her capability of taking care of a house, etc., as well as her steady seriousness weigh far more with me than any of the traits which form the theme of poets!\" Cope's family approved of his choice, and the marriage took place in July 1865 at Pim's farmhouse in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The two had a single daughter, Julia Biddle Cope, born June 10, 1866. Cope's return to the United States also marked an expansion of his scientific studies; in 1864, he described several fishes, a whale, and the amphibian Amphibamus grandiceps During the period between 1866 and 1867, Cope went on trips to western parts of the country. He related to his father his scientific experiences; to his daughter he sent descriptions of animal life as part of her education. Cope found educating his students at Haverford \"a pleasure\", but wrote to his father that he \"could not get any work done.\" He resigned from his position at Haverford and moved his family to Haddonfield, in part to be closer to the fossil beds of western New Jersey. Due to the time-consuming nature of his Haverford position, Cope had not had time to attend to his farm and had let it out to others, but eventually found he was in need of more money to fuel his scientific habits. Pleading with his father for money to pursue his career, he finally sold the farm in 1869. Alfred apparently did not press his son to continue farming, and Edward focused on his scientific career. He continued his continental travels, including trips to Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. He visited caves across the region. He stopped these cave explorations after an 1871 trip to the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana, but remained interested in the subject. Cope had visited Haddonfield many times in the 1860s, paying periodic visits to the marl pits. The fossils he found in these pits became the focus of several papers, including a description in 1868 of Elasmosaurus platyurus and Laelaps. Marsh accompanied him on one of these excursions. Cope's proximity to the beds after moving to Haddonfield made more frequent trips possible. The Copes lived comfortably in a frame house backed by an apple orchard. Two maids tended the estate, which entertained a number of guests. Cope's only concern was for more money to spend on his scientific work. The 1870s were the golden years of Cope's career, marked by his most prominent discoveries and rapid flow of publications. Among his descriptions were the therapsid Lystrosaurus , the archosauromorph Champsosaurus , and the sauropod Amphicoelias , possibly the largest dinosaur ever discovered. In the period of one year, from 1879 to 1880, Cope published 76\u00a0papers based on his travels through New Mexico and Colorado, and on the findings of his collectors in Texas, Kansas, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. During the peak years, Cope published around 25\u00a0reports and preliminary observations each year. The hurried publications led to errors in interpretation and naming\u2014many of his scientific names were later canceled or withdrawn. In comparison, Marsh wrote and published less frequently and more succinctly\u2014his works appeared in the widely read American Journal of Science, which led to faster reception abroad, and Marsh's reputation grew more rapidly than Cope's. In autumn 1871, Cope began prospecting farther west to the fossil fields of Kansas. Leidy and Marsh had been to the region earlier, and Cope employed one of Marsh's guides, Benjamin Mudge, who was in want of a job. Cope's companion Charles Sternberg described the lack of water and good food available to Cope and his helpers on these expeditions. Cope would suffer from a \"severe attack of nightmare\" in which \"every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night\u00a0... sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting slumber.\" Nevertheless, Cope continued to lead the party from sunrise to sunset, sending letters to his wife and child describing his finds. The severe desert conditions and Cope's habit of overworking himself till he was bedridden caught up with him, and in 1872, he broke down from exhaustion. Cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879. Throughout the decade, Cope traveled across the West, exploring rocks of the Eocene in 1872 and the Titanothere Beds of Colorado in 1873. In 1874, Cope was employed with the Wheeler survey, a group of surveys led by George Montague Wheeler that mapped parts of the United States west of the 100th meridian. The survey traveled through New Mexico, whose Puerco formations, he wrote to his father, provided \"the most important find in geology I have ever made\". The New Mexico bluffs contained millions of years of formation and subsequent deformation, and were in an area which had not been visited by Leidy or Marsh. Being part of the survey had other advantages; Cope was able to draw on fort commissaries and defray publishing costs. While there was no salary, his findings would be published in the annual reports the surveys printed. Cope brought Annie and Julia along on one such survey, and rented a house for them at Fort Bridger, but he spent more of his own money on these survey trips than he would have liked. Alfred died December 4, 1875, and left Edward with an inheritance of nearly a quarter of a million dollars. Alfred's death was a blow to Cope; his father was a constant confidant. The same year marked a suspension of much of Cope's field work and a new emphasis on writing up discoveries of the previous years. His chief publication of the time, The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous Formations of the West, was a collection of 303\u00a0pages and 54\u00a0illustration plates. The memoir summarized his experiences prospecting in New Jersey and Kansas. Cope now had the finances to hire multiple teams to search for fossils for him year-round and he advised the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition on their fossil displays. Cope's studies of marine reptiles of Kansas closed in 1876, opening a new focus on terrestrial reptiles. The same year, Cope moved from Haddonfield to 2100 and 2102 Pine Street in Philadelphia. He converted one of the two houses into a museum where he stored his growing collection of fossils. Cope's expeditions took him across Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana. His initial journey into the Clarendon beds of Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Texas led to an affiliation with the Geological Survey of Texas. Cope's papers on the region constitute some of his most important paleontological contributions. In 1877, he purchased half the rights to the American Naturalist to publish the papers he produced at a rate so high, Marsh questioned their dating. Cope returned to Europe in August 1878 in response to an invitation to join the British Association for the Advancement of Science's Dublin meeting. He was warmly welcomed in England and France, and met with the distinguished paleontologists and archeologists of the period. Marsh's attempts to sully Cope's reputation had made little impact on anyone save paleontologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who according to Osborn, \"alone treated [Cope] with coolness\". Following the Dublin meeting, Cope spent two days with the French Association for the Advancement of Science. At each gathering, Cope exhibited dinosaur restorations by Philadelphia colleague John A. Ryder and various charts and plates from geological surveys of the 1870s led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. He returned to London on October 12, meeting with anatomist Richard Owen, ichthyologist Albert G\u00fcnther, and paleontologist H. G. Seeley. While in Europe, Cope purchased a great collection of fossils from Argentina. Cope never found time to describe the collection and many of the boxes remained unopened until his death."

        "content": "Cope's relations with Marsh turned into a competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's return to the United States in the 1860s, although Cope named Colosteus marshii for Marsh in 1867, and Marsh returned the favor, naming Mosasaurus copeanus for Cope in 1869. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil finds\u2014a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neck\u2014he commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull at the end of the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some remained with their buyers . The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope's brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never talk to each other amicably again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them. The rivalry between the two increased towards the latter half of the 1870s. In 1877, Marsh received a letter from Arthur Lakes, a schoolteacher in Golden, Colorado. Lakes had been hiking in the mountains near the town of Morrison with his friend, H. C. Beckwith, looking for fossilized leaves in the Dakota sandstone. Instead, the pair found large bones embedded in the rock. Lakes wrote that the bones were \"apparently a vertebra and a humerus bone of some gigantic saurian.\" While Lakes sent Marsh some 1,500 pounds of bone, he also sent Cope some of the specimens. Marsh published his finds first, and having been paid $100 for the finds Lakes wrote to Cope that the samples should be forwarded to Marsh. Cope was offended by the slight. Meanwhile, Cope received bones from school superintendent O.W. Lucas in March 1877 from Canon City; the remains were of a dinosaur even bigger than Lakes' that Marsh had described. Word that Lakes had notified Cope of his finds galvanized Marsh into action. When Marsh heard from Union Pacific Railroad workers W.E. Carlin and W.H. Reed about a vast boneyard northwest of Laramie in Como Bluff, Marsh sent his agent, Samuel Wendell Williston, to take charge of the digging. Cope, in response, learned of Carlin and Reed's discoveries and sent his own men to find bones in the area. The two scientists attempted to sabotage each other's progress. Cope was described as a genius and what Marsh lacked in intelligence, he easily made up for in connections\u2014Marsh's uncle was George Peabody, a rich banker who supported Marsh with money, and a secure position at the Peabody Museum. Marsh lobbied John Wesley Powell to act against Cope and attempted to persuade Hayden to \"muzzle\" Cope's publishing. Both men tried to spy on the other's whereabouts and attempted to offer their collectors more money in the hopes of recruiting them to their own side. Cope was able to recruit David Baldwin in New Mexico and Frank Williston in Wyoming from Marsh. Cope and Marsh were extremely secretive as to the source of their fossils. When Henry Fairfield Osborn, at the time a student at Princeton, visited Cope to ask where to travel to look for fossils in the West, Cope politely refused to answer. When Cope arrived back in the United States after his tour of Europe in 1878, he had nearly two years of fossil findings from Lucas. Among these dinosaurs was Camarasaurus, one of the most recognizable dinosaur recreations of the time. The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and north to Oregon, where he was amazed at the rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean. In 1879, the United States Congress consolidated the various government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence King as its leader. This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh, an old college friend, as the chief paleontologist. The period of Cope's and Marsh's paleontological digs in the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892, by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources."

        "content": "The 1880s proved disastrous for Cope. Marsh's close association with the Geological Survey gave him the resources to employ 54\u00a0staff members over the course of ten\u00a0years. His teaching position at Yale meant he had guaranteed access to the American Journal of Science for publication. Cope had his interest in the Naturalist, but it drained him of funds. After Hayden was removed from the survey, Cope lost his source of government funding. His fortune was not enough to support his rivalry, so Cope invested in mining. Most of his properties were silver mines in New Mexico; one mine yielded an ore vein worth $3\u00a0million in silver chloride. Cope visited the mines each summer from 1881 to 1885, taking the opportunity to supervise or collect other minerals. For a while he made good money, but the mines stopped producing and by 1886 he had to give up his now-worthless stocks. The same year he received a teaching position at the University of Pennsylvania. He continued to travel west, but realized he would not be able to best Marsh in cornering the market for bones; he had to release the collectors he had hired and sell his collections. During this period, he published 40 to 75\u00a0papers each year. With the failure of his mines, Cope began searching for a job, but was turned down at the Smithsonian and American Museum of Natural History. He turned to giving lectures for hire and writing magazine articles. Each year, he lobbied Congress for an appropriation with which to finish his work on \"Cope's Bible\", a volume on Tertiary vertebrates, but was continually turned down. Rather than work with Powell and the survey, Cope tried to inflame sentiment against them. At Marsh's urging, Powell pushed for Cope to return specimens he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, who had used his own money while working as a volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations with the president of the University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled. Cope took his sinking fortunes in stride. In writing to Osborn about the articles, he laughed at the outcome, saying, \"It will now rest largely with you whether or not I am supposed to be a liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerus.\" Cope was well aware of his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of \"Cope\" and \"hater\", Anisonchus cophater. Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers\u2014his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier. In 1892, Cope was granted expense money for field work from the Texas Geological Survey. With his finances improved, he was able to publish a massive work on the Batrachians of North America, which was the most detailed analysis and organization of the continent's frogs and amphibians ever mastered, and the 1,115-page The Crocodilians Lizards and Snakes of North America. In the 1890s, his publication rate increased to an average of 43\u00a0articles a year. His final expedition to the West took place in 1894, when he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The same year, Julia was married to William H. Collins, a Haverford astronomy professor. The couple's ages\u2014Julia was 28 and the groom 35\u2014were past the conventions of Victorian marriage. After their European honeymoon, the couple returned to Haverford. While Annie moved to Haverford, as well, Cope did not. His official reason was the long commute and late lectures he gave in Philadelphia. In private correspondence, however, Osborn wrote that the two had essentially separated, though they remained on amiable terms. Cope sold his collections to the American Museum of Natural History in 1895; his set of 10,000\u00a0American fossil mammals sold for $32,000, lower than Cope's asking price of $50,000. The purchase was financed by the donations from New York's high society. Cope sold three other collections for $29,000. While his collection contained more than 13,000\u00a0specimens, Cope's fossil hoard was still much smaller than Marsh's collection, valued at over a million\u00a0dollars. The University of Pennsylvania bought part of Cope's ethnological artifact collection for $5,500. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia's foremost museum, did not bid on any of Cope's sales due to bad blood between Cope and the museum's leaders; as a result, many of Cope's major finds left the city. Cope's proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to prospect for fossils on his behalf."

        "content": "In 1896, Cope began suffering from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, and returned to his home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday. Sternberg, still prospecting for Cope that spring, was woken by a liveryman who relayed word from Annie that Cope had died three days earlier. Sternberg wrote in his memoirs, \"I had lost friends before, and I had known what it was to bury my own dead, even my firstborn son, but I had never sorrowed more deeply than I did over the news.\" Cope's Quaker funeral consisted of six men: Osborn, his colleague William Berryman Scott, Cope's friend Persifor Frazer, son-in-law Collins, Horatio Wood, and Harrison Allen. The six sat around Cope's coffin among the fossils and Cope's pets, a tortoise and a Gila monster, for what Osborn called \"a perfect Quaker silence\u00a0... an interminable length of time.\" Anticipating the quiet, Osborn had brought along a Bible and read an excerpt from the Book of Job, ending by saying, \"These are the problems to which our friend devoted his life.\" The coffin was loaded on a hearse and carried to a gathering at Fairfield; much of the gathering was spent in silence. After the coffin was removed, the assembled began talking. Frazer recalled that each person remembered Cope differently, and \"Few men succeeded so well in concealing from anyone\u00a0... all the sides of his multiform character.\" Osborn, intending to follow the coffin to the graveyard, was instead pulled aside by Collins and taken to the reading of Cope's will\u2014Osborn and Cope's brother-in-law John Garrett were named executors. Cope gave his family a choice of his books, with the remainder to be sold or donated to the University of Pennsylvania. After debts were handled, Cope left small bequests to friends and family\u2014Anna Brown and Julia received $5000 each, while the remainder went to Annie. Cope's estate was valued at $75,327, not including additional revenue raised by sales of fossils to the American Museum of Natural History, for a total of $84,600. Some specimens preserved in alcohol made their way to the Academy of Natural Sciences, including a few Gordian worms. Cope insisted through his will that no graveside service or burial be held; he had donated his body to science. He issued a final challenge to Marsh at his death: he had his skull donated to science so his brain could be measured, hoping his brain would be larger than that of his adversary; at the time,  brain size was thought to be the true measure of intelligence. Marsh never accepted the challenge. Cope's brain is preserved in alcohol at the Wistar Institute, and his skull is at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. His ashes were placed at the institute with those of Leidy, while his bones were extracted and kept in a locked drawer to be studied by anatomy students. Osborn listed Cope's cause of death as uremic poisoning, combined with a large prostate, but the true cause of death is unknown. Many believed  Cope had died of syphilis contracted from the women with whom he fraternized during his travels. In 1995, Davidson gained permission to have the skeleton examined by a medical doctor at the university. Dr. Morrie Kricun, a professor of radiology, concluded no evidence of bony syphilis was found on Cope's skeleton. Public mentions of Cope's death were relatively slight. The Naturalist ran four photographs, a six-page obituary by editor J. S. Kingsley, and a two-page remembrance by Frazer. The National Academy of Sciences' official memoir was submitted years later and written by Osborn. The American Journal of Science devoted six paragraphs to Cope's passing, and incorrectly gave his age as 46. Cope was outlived by his rival Marsh, who was suffering poor health."

        "content": "As a young man, Cope read Charles Darwin's Voyage of a Naturalist, which had little effect on him. The only comment about Darwin's book recorded by Cope was that Darwin discussed \"too much geology\" from the account of his voyage. Due to his background in taxonomy and paleontology, Cope focused on evolution in terms of changing structure, rather than emphasizing geography and variation within populations as Darwin had. Over his lifetime, Cope's views on evolution shifted. His original view, described in the paper \"On the Origin of Genera\" , held that while Darwin's natural selection may affect the preservation of superficial characteristics in organisms, natural selection alone could not explain the formation of genera. Cope's suggested mechanism for this action was a \"steady progressive development of organization\" through what Cope termed \"a continual crowding backward of the successive steps of individual development\". In Cope's view, during embryological development, an organism could complete its growth with a new stage of development beyond its parents, taking it to a higher level of organization. Later individuals would inherit this new level of development\u2014thus evolution was a continuous advance of organization, sometimes slowly and other times suddenly; this view is known as the law of acceleration. Cope's beliefs later evolved to one with an increased emphasis on continual and utilitarian evolution with less involvement of a Creator. He became one of the founders of the Neo-Lamarckism school of thought, which holds that an individual can pass on traits acquired in its lifetime to offspring. Although the view has been shown incorrect, it was the prevalent theory among paleontologists in Cope's time. In 1887, Cope published his own \"Origin of the Fittest: Essays in Evolution\", detailing his views on the subject. He was a strong believer in the law of use and disuse\u2014that an individual will slowly, over time, favor an anatomical part of its body so much that it will become stronger and larger as time progresses down the generations. The giraffe, for example, stretched its neck to reach taller trees and passed this acquired characteristic to its offspring in a developmental phase that is added to gestation in the womb. Cope's Theology of Evolution argued that consciousness comes from the mind of the universe and governs evolution by directing animals to new goals. According to Sideris , \"[Cope] argued that organisms respond to changes in their environments by an exercise of choice. Consciousness itself, he maintained, was the principal force in evolution. Cope credited God with having built into evolution a life force that propelled organisms toward even higher levels of consciousness.\""

        "content": "Julia assisted Osborn in writing a biography of her father, titled Cope: Master Naturalist. She would not comment on the name of the woman with whom her father had had an affair prior to his first European travel. Julia is believed to have burned any of the scandalous letters and journals Cope had kept, but many of his friends were able to give their recollections of the scandalous nature of some of Cope's unpublished routines. Charles R. Knight, a former friend called, \"Cope's mouth the filthiest, from hearsay that in [Cope's] heyday no woman was safe within five\u00a0miles of him.\" As Julia was the major financier behind The Master Naturalist, she wanted to keep her father's name in good standing and refused to comment on any misdeeds her father might have committed. Cope was described by zoologist Henry Weed Fowler as \"a man of medium height and build, but always impressive with his great energy and activity\". To him, Fowler wrote, \"[Cope] was both genial and always interesting, easily approachable, and both kindly and helpful.\" Cope's affability during visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences to compare specimens was later recalled by his colleague Witmer Stone: \"I have often seen him busily engaged in such comparisons, all the while whistling whole passages from grand opera, or else counting the scales on the back of a lizard, while he conversed in a most amusing manner with some small street urchin who had drifted into the museum and was watching in awe with eyes and mouth wide open.\" His self-taught nature, however, meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics. He had a famous temper; one friend called Cope a \"militant paleontologist\". Despite his faults, he was generally well liked by his contemporaries. American paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that, \"[Cope's] little slips from virtue were those we might make ourselves, were we bolder\". Cope was raised as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. Although he never confronted his family about their religious views, Osborn writes that Cope was at least aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes: \"If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible\u00a0... he did not express them in his letters to his family but there can be little question\u00a0... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period.\" Lanham writes that Cope's religious fervor was embarrassing to even his devout Quaker associates. Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope's deference to his father's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father's financial support. Frazer's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what they wanted to hear, rather than his true views. Cope's views on human races would today be considered racist, and his beliefs were used by scientists of the time to justify imperialism. In his essays on evolution, he assessed the physiognomies of three sub-species of human \u2014 termed the Negro, the Mongolian, and the Indo-European \u2014 in comparison to those of apes and human embryos, and drew the following conclusion:The Indo-European race is then the highest by virtue of the acceleration of growth in the development of the muscles by which the body is maintained in the erect position , and in those important elements of beauty, a well-developed nose and beard. It is also superior in those points in which it is more embryonic than the other races, viz., the want of prominence of the jaws and cheek-bones, since these are associated with a greater predominance of the cerebral part of the skull, increased size of cerebral hemispheres, and greater intellectual power.He believed that if, \"a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like\". He was opposed to blacks because of their \"degrading vices\", believing that the \"inferior Negro should go back to Africa.\" He did not blame blacks for their perceived \"poor virtue\", but wrote, \"A vulture will always eat carrion when surrounded on all hands by every kind of cleaner food. It is the nature of the bird\". Cope was against the modern view of women's rights, believing in the husband's role as protector; he was opposed to women's suffrage, as he felt they would be unduly influenced by their husbands."

He discovered a total of 56\u00a0new dinosaur species during the Bone Wars compared to Marsh's 80. Although Cope is today known as a herpetologist and paleontologist, his contributions extended to ichthyology, in which he catalogued 300\u00a0species of fishes and described over 300 species of reptiles over three decades. In total, he discovered and described over 1,000\u00a0species of fossil vertebrates and published 600\u00a0separate titles.

        "content": "Jean-Dominique, comte de Cassini was a French astronomer, son of C\u00e9sar-Fran\u00e7ois Cassini de Thury and great-grandson of Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Cassini was born at the Paris Observatory. He succeeded his father as director of the observatory in 1784; but his plans for its restoration and re-equipment were wrecked in 1793 by the animosity of the National Assembly. His position having become intolerable, he resigned on 6 September and was thrown into prison in 1794, but released after seven months. He then withdrew to Thury, where he died in 1845. In 1770, he published an account of a voyage to America in 1768, undertaken as the commissary of the French Academy of Sciences with a view to testing Pierre Le Roy\u2019s watches at sea.  In 1783, he sent a memoir to the Royal Society in which he proposed a trigonometric survey connecting the observatories of Paris and Greenwich for the purpose of better determining the latitude and longitude of the latter. His proposal was accepted, resulting in the Anglo-French Survey . The results of the survey were published in 1791. He visited England for the purposes of the work with Pierre M\u00e9chain and Adrien-Marie Legendre, and the three met William Herschel at Slough. He completed his father's map of France, which was published by the Academy of Sciences in 1793. It served as the basis for the Atlas National , showing France in departments. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788. Cassini's M\u00e9moires pour servir \u00e0 l\u2019histoire de l\u2019observatoire de Paris embodied portions of an extensive work, the prospectus of which he had submitted to the Academy of Sciences in 1774. The volume included his Eloges of several academicians, and the biography of his great-grandfather, Giovanni Cassini. His youngest son Henri was a botanist of some note."

Between 1950 and 1956, he illegally used the third-class waiting hall in Cologne main station for political and cultural discussion events , which were important for German education in democracy. Well known public figures had to face a crowd and answer questions they would not know beforehand - something completely unknown in Germany before.

When his distant kinsman and the head of the rival royal branch Christopher II of Denmark was exiled from his kingdom, Holsteiner and Danish high nobles got to choose a new king. Their choice fell to 11-year-old Duke Valdemar V of Schleswig, who was the head of the branch descended from King Abel of Denmark. Due to his young age, his maternal uncle, the mighty Count Gerhard of Rendsborg who also was the biggest pawnbroker of mortgaged Denmark, was appointed as the Regent and guardian . Valdemar's ascension promissory was at least as strict as Christopher's had been. There were some new stipulations, such as all royal castles in Scania should be demolished, and all nobles received the right to fortify their homesteads. The most important agreement, however, was the so-called Constitutio Valdemariana, which promised that in the future, the same person could never be both ruler of Slesvig and Denmark simultaneously. Valdemar accordingly gave up his patrimony, Schleswig, and enfeoffed it to his uncle and guardian, whereby the first Holsteinian became a Duke: Gerhard, Duke of Jutland . Denmark was now held totally by certain nobles, in practice. That was not popular among the peasants. A portion of the nobles were foreigners, and many set up new taxes. In 1328, peasants in Zealand rose in rebellion, though it was quelled, and a rebellion in Jutland followed in 1329; the Jutland rebellion had more success, but was also quelled in the end. Finally, count Gerhard gave up in the name of his king, and in 1329 Christopher II was allowed to return to the throne. Valdemar became again Duke of Schleswig. In 1340, he gave his only sister Helvig of Schleswig to marriage with Valdemar IV, the new king of Denmark. During the rest of his rule he led a changeable policy towards Denmark by which war alternated with co-operation. Valdemar died in 1364. He was married to Richardis of Schwerin , daughter of Count G\u00fcnzelin VI of Schwerin-Wittenburg. They had two sons, Valdemar and Henry . Henry succeeded as Duke of Schleswig when his father died."

He is very detailed and explicit where the subject is important from a practical point of view, but extremely brief when dealing with theory. Ran did not write the commentary on all of Alfasi, although the whole commentary is often ascribed to him. In his comments he did not hesitate to refute the greatest earlier authorities, such as Rashi, Rabbenu Tam, Maimonides, Nachmanides, and Solomon ben Aderet. However, he showed his reverence for these teachers by adopting their opinions in practise. Frequently, he would refute the opinion of an earlier teacher but then write: \"Yet since the ancients have decided thus, their conclusions may not be set aside.\" According to his student Isaac ben Sheshet, he was generally very cautious in his decisions and inclined toward conservatism. In his commentaries Nissim endeavored to establish the decisions relating to practise, and he devoted himself to the explanation and defense of Alfasi's \"Halakot,\" since that compendium had been adopted for practical decisions. The extant commentaries of Nissim on the \"Halakhot\" cover the treatises Shabbat, Pesa\u1e25im, Ta'anit, Rosh ha-Shanah, Be\u1e93ah, Sukkah, Megillah, Ketubot, Gi\u1e6d\u1e6din, \u1e32iddushin, Shebu'ot, and Avodah Zarah. Commentaries on Mo'ed Katan and Makkot are erroneously ascribed to him. He is very detailed and explicit where the subject is important from a practical point of view, but extremely brief when dealing with matters of mere theory.

Clark had a startling good performance on Opening Day 2009, hitting 2 home runs to lead the D-Backs to a victory over the Colorado Rockies; fellow switch-hitting teammate Felipe L\u00f3pez also homered from both sides of the plate in the same game, making them the first teammates to do so on an Opening Day. Clark slumped badly thereafter, however, as in his next 18 at-bats he only managed to eke out a single.  As of May 6 he was batting .179, and had struck out in more than half his at bats.  That day Clark was placed on the 15-day disabled list for a lingering wrist ligament injury, and Whitesell, who was hitting .356 for the Reno Aces with a .477 on-base percentage, was called up to the Diamondbacks to take his place.  Clark suffered the injury during spring training, and re-aggravated it in late April, leaving him unable to swing comfortably from the left side.  It was anticipated that the injury could require more than 15 days to heal.  On June 19 Clark came off the disabled list and returned to Arizona , and Whitesell was optioned back to Reno .  In his first game back with the team, Clark went 0\u20133 with 2 strikeouts to bring his batting average down to .161, with strikeouts in 55% of his at bats for the season. Clark struggled on defense as well, as on June 21 in his second game back he dropped a throw to him at first base with two outs in the ninth, allowing the winning run to score for Seattle.  The play left players and managers on both sides stunned and speechless.  \"It's a miserable ending to a rough road trip\", manager A. J. Hinch said.  His resulting .973 fielding percentage was last among major league first basemen who had played 60 or more innings. On July 12, 2009, the Diamondbacks released Clark, who was hitting .182 with four home runs and 11 RBIs.  They replaced him with Whitesell.  Clark said he would continue to work out the next few weeks in the event an opportunity might arise with another team, and that if he didn't land with another team he'd consider broadcasting and coaching, perhaps with the Diamondbacks.  Diamondbacks General Manager Josh Byrnes expressed an interest in keeping him with the organization, and Clark said he \"would welcome the opportunity.\""

He was succeeded by Sayyid Ali bin Said Al-Busa'id . Soon after, in July 1890, with the Heligoland\u2013Zanzibar Treaty between the German Empire and the United Kingdom, Germany agreed to \"recognize the British protectorate over ... the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba\" and the Sultan was forced to accede to the new power on the island. During his reign, a civil list had been drawn up reducing his income, and various departments, including the police force, had been created by the then British Consul Gerald Portal, each department under a European. When Khalid bin Barghash was 19 years old, Rennell Rodd arrived in Zanzibar, in the New Year of 1893, to replace Gerald Portal. Immediately, the succession of the ailing Sultan was discussed and three candidates emerged. \"There was Khaled, son of Barghash, a rather truculent youth of eighteen: there was Hamed Bin Thwain, the son of a brother of Barghash now dead, a man of about forty, of reputed high character and a student of Arab literature : and finally there was Mahmoud, an elder cousin of the reigning Sultan.\" Khalid bin Barghash, despite his very strong claims to the throne as the son of Bargash, in Rennell Rodds, view \"was, however, for other reasons undesirable.\" During Rennell Rodd's last visit to the Sultan, when he presented Cecil Rhodes at his court in March 1893, it was obvious to him that the Sultan had not long to live. Accordingly, he made preparations for daily and nightly signals to be exchanged with HMS Philomel and HMS Blanche where marines were to be at the ready with machine guns. On the night of March 5th 1893, Sayyid Ali bin Said Al-Busa'id died as anticipated. Khalid entered the palace let in by his aunt, the Sultan's sister, Bi. Zemzem binti Sa'id bin Sultan, who was fond of Khalid. However, Rennell Rodd immediately ordered the landings of 200 marines armed with machine guns, while the police force under Lietenant Hatch was stationed around the palace and town. Refused permission to enter the palace, an ultimatum was issued with the threat that the doors of the palace would be blown open within 5 minutes if entry was barred. After forcing entry into the palace, Khalid was rebuked and marched off to his house under arrest, and the Sayyid Hamad bin Thuwaini Al-Busa'id was installed as the new Sultan, after he had accepted the conditions \"which had been carefully thought out and prepared in advance\" by Rennell Rodd."

        "content": "The events of 1893 were in some measure repeated in 1896 but on a much larger scale. Khalid  briefly ruled Zanzibar , seizing power after the sudden death of his cousin Hamad bin Thuwaini, who many suspect was poisoned by Khalid. Great Britain refused to recognise his claim to the throne, citing a treaty from 1866 which stated that a new Sultan could only accede to the throne with British assent, resulting in the Anglo-Zanzibar War, the briefest war in history. During the \"war\", Royal Navy vessels shelled Khalid's palace for 38 minutes before a surrender was received. This time, the casualties sustained were 500 or so men in Khalid's retinue, martial law was imposed, and several Omani sheikhs suspected of complicity were apprehended and deported to Machakos. Khalid fled his palace through a back door to take refuge in the German consulate. Basil Cave, the British Consul, who had been Vice-Consul when Rennell Rodd had removed Khalid from succession three years earlier, informed the Foreign Secretary, Marquess of Salisbury, in September, that he \"remains in the house all the doors of which are guarded, from the inside, by about ten armed sailors or marines from a German man-of-war in harbour. The Consulate is being carefully and constantly watched by men in the service of Sir Lloyd Mathews\". In October 1896, Albrecht von Rechenberg, the German Consul in Zanzibar, wrote to Cave saying, \"Monsieur le Gerant, J'ai l'honneur de vous informer que mon Gouvemement m'a ordonne d'envoyer Chalid bin Bargash \u00e1 Dar-es-Salaam. Le transport sera effectue sans que Chalid touche le sol de Zanzibar\". ."

        "content": "In 1985, Badalamenti was composing the score for David Lynch's Blue Velvet, as well as serving as the vocal coach for the film's star, Isabella Rossellini. A key scene in Blue Velvet was intended to feature This Mortal Coil's version of \"Song to the Siren\" by Tim Buckley, but when the rights to the song proved prohibitively expensive, it was suggested that Badalamenti compose a pop song in the same style, with lyrics written by Lynch. Because the song required a vocalist with a haunting, ethereal voice, Badalamenti recommended Cruise, who had sung in a New York theater workshop Badalamenti had produced. The result of their initial collaboration was \"Mysteries of Love\", which figures prominently in Blue Velvet'''s closing scenes and gained a cult following. Badalamenti and Lynch went on to write and produce additional songs for Cruise, most of which were featured in her debut album, Floating into the Night . The album was released on 12 September 1989 by Warner Bros. Records, and charted on Billboard the following year. It also provided musical material for Lynch's Industrial Symphony No. 1, in which Cruise performed while \"floating\" from a harness dozens of feet above a stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The second, more significant project was the soundtrack to Lynch's Twin Peaks, for which Badalamenti composed the original score. The song \"Falling\", which became the orchestral theme for the television series, caused a minor sensation, winning a Grammy at the 33rd Grammy Awards for Best Pop Instrumental. The Twin Peaks soundtrack, featuring Cruise on the songs \"Into the Night\" and \"The Nightingale\" as well as on the vocal version of \"Falling\", eventually went gold in the US, a rare feat for a television soundtrack. Cruise made a number of appearances on Twin Peaks as a singer at a local bar, and was prominently featured in both the show's landmark pilot episode and the episode where Laura Palmer's murderer is revealed, as well as in 1992's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart\", the second single from Floating into the Night, was released in 1990 and was also featured in an episode of Twin Peaks along with \"The World Spins\"; in the episode, several of the main female characters are shown lip-synching to \"Rockin' Back Inside My Heart.\" Cruise reinterpreted and sang the theme song for an episode of the USA Network show Psych. The episode, \"Dual Spires\", was about a secluded town full of secrets and skeletons while they investigate the murder of a girl. It aired 20 years to the day after Laura Palmer's murderer was revealed. Cruise appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 12, 1990, filling in along with Spanic Boys on short notice when scheduled performer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor refused to appear on the same show as guest host Andrew Dice Clay. Cruise performed \"Falling.\" The following year, Cruise recorded a Lynch- and Badalamenti-produced cover of the Elvis Presley song \"Summer Kisses, Winter Tears\" for the soundtrack of Wim Wenders's Until the End of the World. Afterward, Cruise maintained a relatively low profile until her second album, The Voice of Love, was released in 1993. An instrumental version of \"She Would Die for Love\" was used as the main theme for the movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.\"She Would Die for Love\" was also covered by alternative metal band Fant\u00f4mas on their The Director's Cut album as \"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\". Cruise's early collaborations with Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch were closely related to Lynch's film work, and their lyrics often reflect this. For example, \"Into the Night\" begins with the whispered words \"Now it's dark\", a line which was repeatedly spoken by Frank Booth, Dennis Hopper's character, in Blue Velvet. Lynch also photographed Cruise for the liner notes of Floating Into the Night and The Voice of Love, and created the sculptures featured on the covers of both albums. In 2017 she appeared in Part 17 of the new Twin Peaks season performing 'The World Spins'. Cruise released the EP Three Demos in 2018, containing the original demo versions of \"Floating\", \"Falling\" and \"The World Spins\"."

        "content": "On 4 March 1995 she debuted as a professional boxer, with a first round knockout win over Marleen Lambert in Belgium. As a matter of a fact, her first three professional fights were held in different European countries and they were all first-round knockout wins for Aboro. Her fourth fight, on 19 October 1996 against Severine Grandsire, was her first fight in Germany, and Aboro won by a sixth-round technical knockout. Aboro had one more win, and then, on 29 November 1997, she met future world champion Daisy Lang, defeating Lang by a six-round decision. On 22 August 1998 Aboro fought Brigitte Pastor for the vacant WIBF European Super Bantamweight title, knocking out Pastor in five rounds to win her first professional belt. She defended her title once, knocking out Galina Gumliiska in eight rounds on 28 November, then followed that win with four more wins in a row, before obtaining her first world title opportunity. Aboro became a world champion when she fought Eva Jones, on 5 February 2000, knocking Jones out in round ten to become the WIBF's world Super Bantamweight champion. Then came Downtown Leona Brown's challenge. Aboro met the future world champion on 13 June that year, defeating Brown by a ten-round decision. After two, non-title wins, she faced the highly touted contender Kelsey Jeffries, who had 10 wins and only 2 losses coming into their bout, for her second world championship defence. Aboro defended the title successfully against Jeffries on 10 February 2001, with a ten-round decision win. After one more non-title win, Aboro made what has been, to date, her last fight. On 24 November that year she beat Nadia Debras, who she had previously beaten, by a ten-round decision, to retain her world title for the third time. Aboro has not officially announced her retirement. However, should she decide to remain inactive and, ultimately, to retire from boxing, she would join Rocky Marciano and a handful of others in boxing's history to retire as an undefeated world champion. As of 2019, Aboro is a resident of Amsterdam, Netherlands."

        "content": "He was born at La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland, but left his native place with the engraver Jean Girardet at the age of sixteen for Paris. He was on the eve of obtaining the grand prix for engraving when the events of 1815 blasted his hopes, for Neuch\u00e2tel was restored to Prussia, and Robert was struck off the list of competitors as a foreigner. Whilst continuing his studies under Girardet he had never ceased to frequent the studio of David, and he now determined to become a painter, and only returned to his native country when his master himself was exiled. At Neuch\u00e2tel he attracted the notice of Roullet de Mezerac, who enabled him by a timely loan to proceed to Rome. In depicting the customs and life of the people, of southern Italy especially, he showed peculiar feeling for the historical characteristics of their race. After executing many detached studies of Italian life Robert conceived the idea of painting four great works which should represent at one and the same time the four seasons in Italy and the four leading races of its people. In the Return from the F\u00eate of the Madonna dell'Arco he depicted the Neapolitans and the spring. This picture, exhibited at the Salon of 1827, achieved undoubted success and was bought for the Luxembourg by Charles X; but the work which appeared in 1831, the Summer Reapers arriving in the Pontine Marshe , which became the property of Louis Phillippe, established the artist's reputation. Florence and her autumn vineyards should now have furnished him with his third subject. He attempted to begin it, but, unable to conquer his passion for Princess Charlotte Napoleon , he threw up his work and went to Venice, where he began and carried through the fourth of the series, the Fishers of the Adriatic. This work was not equal to the Reapers. Worn by the vicissitudes of painful feeling, and bitterly discouraged, Robert committed suicide before his easel on 20 March 1835, on the tenth anniversary of the melancholy suicide of a brother to whom he had been much attached. There are a number of references to Robert's paintings in the novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, one being specifically to The Reapers."

The Krafts were a Modern Orthodox Jewish family. Robert attended the Edward Devotion School and graduated from Brookline High School. As a child, he sold newspapers outside of Braves Field in Boston. During high school, he was unable to participate in most sports because it interfered with his after-school Hebrew studies and observance of the Sabbath. Kraft attended Columbia University on an academic scholarship and he served as class president. He played tennis and safety on the school's freshman and lightweight football teams.

He considered running against Representative Philip J. Philbin in 1970 but chose not to, citing the loss of privacy and strain on his family that politics would have caused.

In 1968, he gained control of the company through a leveraged buyout. He still serves as this company's chairman. In 1972, he founded International Forest Products, a trader of physical paper commodities. The two combined companies make up the largest privately held paper and packaging companies in the United States. Kraft has stated that he started the company out of a hunch that the increase in international communications and transportation would lead to an expansion of global trade in the late twentieth century. International Forest Products became a top 100 US exporter/importer in 1997 and in 2001 was ranked No. 7 on the Journal of Commerce'''s list in that category. Kraft said of the business in 1991 that, \"We do things for a number of companies, including Avon, Kodak, cosmetics companies, candies, toys.\" The company produced both corrugated and folding cartons, which he stated, \"are used to package everything from the Patriot missile, to mints, to Estee Lauder, Indiana Glass and Polaroid.\" Kraft acquired interests in other areas, and ultimately formed the Kraft Group as an umbrella for them in 1998. Kraft was an investor in New England Television Corp., which gained control of the channel 7 license for Boston in 1982, and Kraft became a director of the board a year later, after the newly licensed station, WNEV-TV, signed on, replacing the former WNAC-TV. In 1986, he was named president of the corporation. In 1991, Kraft exercised his option to sell his shares for an estimated $25 million."

        "content": "Kraft has been a Patriots fan since their American Football League days and has been a season ticket holder since 1971 when the team moved to Schaefer Stadium. In 1985, he bought a 10-year option on Foxboro Raceway, a horse track adjacent to the stadium, and the purchase prevented Patriots owner Billy Sullivan from holding non-Patriot events at the stadium while races were being held. Kraft took advantage of the fact that the Sullivans owned the stadium but not the surrounding land, and it was the beginning of a quest to buy the stadium and the Patriots. Sullivan's family was reeling from a series of bad investments, principally The Jackson Five 1984 Victory Tour, for which they had to pledge Sullivan Stadium as collateral. Those problems ultimately forced Sullivan to sell controlling interest of the team in 1988, while the stadium lapsed into bankruptcy. In 1988, Kraft outbid several competitors to buy the stadium out of bankruptcy court from Sullivan for $22 million. The stadium was considered to be outdated and nearly worthless, but the purchase included the stadium's lease to the Patriots which ran through 2001. Kraft placed a bid on the Patriots franchise as well, but he lost the bidding to Victor Kiam. Sullivan and Kiam then tried to move the team to Jacksonville, but Kraft refused to let them break the lease. Kiam was nearly brought down by bad investments of his own and was forced to sell the Patriots to James Orthwein in 1992. In 1994, Orthwein offered Kraft $75 million to buy out the remainder of the team's lease at Foxboro Stadium, but Kraft turned it down. Orthwein was not interested in operating the team in New England and decided to sell it. Prospective buyers had to deal with Kraft, however, due to terms in the operating covenant, and he offered $172 million for an outright purchase which Orthwein accepted. It was the highest price ever paid for an NFL team at the time. While future St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke had actually offered more money , Orthwein would have had to bear all of the team's relocation expenses. Orthwein would have also been responsible for paying the costs of an all-but-certain legal battle over the lease, as Kraft let it be known that he would go to court to enforce the covenant. Kraft said that his passion for the Patriots led him to \"break every one of my financial rules\" in his pursuit of the team. Indeed, he still believes he \"overpaid\" for the franchise. He still keeps a Victory Tour poster in his office as a reminder of what set in motion the events that allowed him to buy the Patriots. Following the NFL's approval of the sale, the Patriots sold out their entire 1994 season, the first full sell-out in franchise history. Every Patriots home game\u2013preseason, regular season, and playoffs\u2013has been sold out ever since. In 1998, Kraft considered moving the Patriots to Hartford, Connecticut based on an offer that the state of Connecticut would finance a new stadium, but he terminated the deal just before it became binding to instead build a new stadium in Foxboro with Massachusetts infrastructure funding. In 2002, Kraft financed a $350-million stadium for the Patriots initially called CMGI Field but renamed Gillette Stadium. In 2007, Kraft began to develop the land around Gillette Stadium, creating a $375-million open-air shopping and entertainment center called Patriot Place. The development included \"The Hall at Patriot Place presented by Raytheon,\" a multi-story museum and hall of fame attached to the stadium, and the \"CBS Scene,\" a CBS-themed restaurant. On January 27, 2000, Kraft traded a first round draft pick to the New York Jets for the rights to hire Bill Belichick as head coach. The trade was met with criticism at the time, but proved to be successful after Belichick led the Patriots to win six Super Bowl championships and nine conference and 16 division titles. The relationship between Kraft, Belichick and Brady has been credited with producing one of the most successful sports dynasties in football, although in later years the personal relationship between the three men grew strained. Under Kraft's ownership, the Patriots experienced sustained success for the first time in franchise history. While they appeared in Super Bowl XX under the Sullivans, this was one of only six playoff appearances in 34 years. Indeed, that Super Bowl season saw only the second playoff win in franchise history. However, they have made the playoffs 21 times in Kraft's 27 years as owner. They have won 19 AFC East titles, including all but three since 2001 and 11 in a row from 2009 to 2019. They represented the AFC in the Super Bowl in 1996 , 2001 , 2003 , 2004 , 2007 , 2011 , 2014 , 2016 , 2017 and 2018 . After having never won more than 11 games prior to Kraft's arrival, the Patriots have won at least 12 games 14 times, including finishing the 2007 regular season undefeated before losing to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII. Indianapolis Colts center Jeff Saturday, referring to Kraft's role in helping to settle the NFL lockout before the 2011 season, said \"He [Kraft] is a man who helped us save football.\" In 2005, during a visit to Saint Petersburg, Kraft gave Russian President Vladimir Putin his third Super Bowl ring. He released a statement some days after the visit claiming that it was a gift out of \"respect and admiration\" for the Russian people and Putin's leadership. Kraft later said that he did not originally intend to give the ring as a gift and that his statement had been issued under pressure from the White House after Putin had kept the ring. The ring is on display with state gifts at the Kremlin. Former Patriot Ryan O'Callaghan wrote in his book that Kraft supported him when he publicly came out as gay in 2017. According to O'Callaghan, Kraft invited him to a reception and said, \"What you did took a lot of courage. I'm so proud of you\" and that he would be \"forever a Patriot\"."

Kraft also owned the San Jose Clash from 1998 to 2000. In November 2005, Kraft met with Rick Parry, the Chief Executive of English Premier League team Liverpool. Kraft was rumored to be interested in investing money into the 2004\u201305 Champions League winners. Kraft told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Liverpool is a great brand and it's something our family respects a lot. We're always interested in opportunities and growing, so you never know what can happen.\" Eventually, however, the club was sold to American duo George Gillett and Tom Hicks. Liverpool is now owned by Fenway Sports Group, owners of fellow Boston-based sport team the Boston Red Sox. In October 2017, Kraft said he was \"still intrigued\" by the possibility of buying a Premier League football club, but that he was concerned about the lack of a salary cap in British football. In 2017, Kraft was named the Honorary Chairman of the board of directors for the successful joint Canadian-Mexican-American bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. In 2019, Kraft hired Bruce Arena as head coach and sporting director of the New England Revolution. In 2020, the team had their first playoff win in six years."

One of their most distinctive projects is supporting American Football Israel, including Kraft Family Stadium in Jerusalem and the Kraft Family Israel Football League. In 2017, Kraft announced a contribution of $6 million to build the first ever regulation size American football field in Israel. In June 2017, Robert Kraft, along with several NFL Hall of Famers, traveled to Israel for the grand opening of the new Kraft Family Sports Campus. Kraft has led additional \"Touchdown in Israel\" trips to Israel, with Patriots and Hall of Famers, since that 2017 trip. In December 2018, following Pittsburgh synagogue shooting at Tree of Life, Kraft visited the synagogue to pay his respects and attended services with the congregation before the Patriots played the Steelers in a game the next day. In 2018, Kraft donated $10 million to CJP for the renovation of its headquarters in downtown Boston. In 2019, Kraft, along with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, hosted a soccer match between the New England Revolution and Chelsea F.C., called Final Whistle on Hate, to raise money to combat antisemitism. The match raised an estimated $4 million, with Kraft personally contributing $1 million toward the fund. In June 2019, Kraft received Israel's prestigious Genesis Prize, a $1 million award granted to an individual who is committed to Jewish values and is an inspiration to the next generation of Jews. At the Jerusalem event, Kraft pledged $20 million to establish a foundation that will fight antisemitism and combat the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel, also known as BDS. As of 2019, Kraft has led 27 missions to Israel."

In 2020, Kraft partnered with Chinese company Tencent to purchase 1.2 million N95 masks to donate to medical workers in New York and Massachusetts to help combat the coronavirus pandemic, sending the New England Patriots' private team plane to China to pick up the supplies. Kraft initially negotiated for 1.7 million masks, but only 1.2 million fit on board. They were allowed three hours on the ground in China at Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport.

Investigators suspected the managers at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa, where Kraft was allegedly video recorded in sexual activity, were sex trafficking women, forcing the women to perform sex acts on clients. Deputies placed hidden cameras inside the facility and claimed Kraft was caught \"receiving the alleged acts\", according to the lead investigator. On February 25, Dave Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County, announced that Kraft was among 25 people facing first-degree misdemeanor charges for soliciting prostitution at the Jupiter day spa. The next day, Kraft's attorney electronically entered a not guilty plea in Palm Beach County. On March 26, Kraft's lawyers submitted a court filing, in which Kraft \"waives arraignment, pleads not guilty to all charges and requests a jury trial.\" Previously, his attorney William Burck asserted evidence from hidden cameras inside the spa and traffic stops was obtained illegally. On April 2, papers filed by Kraft's attorneys revealed that the hidden video cameras at the day spa had been installed when investigators entered the facility under the guise of a bomb threat in January.  On April 17, Florida Circuit Court Judge Joseph Marx ordered that the videos not be released prior to a hearing. On April 23, Judge Leonard Hanser temporarily sealed the videos until a jury was selected or the case against Kraft was otherwise resolved. On May 13, Judge Hanser further ruled that prosecutors could not use the videos in their case against Kraft, as detectives \"did not do enough to minimize the invasion of privacy of other customers.\" On October 1, prosecutors submitted a formal appeal of that ruling to suppress video evidence. On August 19, 2020, a Florida appeals court ruled that law enforcement violated Kraft's constitutional rights when obtaining certain video evidence, and that the video would not be admissible in court. On September 24, 2020, it was announced that the charges against Kraft had been dropped due to lack of sufficient evidence. In January 2021, US District Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz II from Florida ordered that video recordings of Kraft and other customers at Orchids of Asia be destroyed."

His relationship with Goerdeler allowed him to come into contact with Claus von Stauffenberg. Although he was not directly informed of the 20 July Plot, his knowledge of Stauffenberg's intention to assassinate Hitler as well as his close ties to the resistance group forced him to go into hiding for the remainder of World War II."

In 1946 Kaiser helped found the Free German Trade Union Federation . In the same year he was elected co-chairman of the East German CDU . Although his political views were progressive, he was critical of the Communist Party of Germany and its Soviet-supported leaders. His belief that the German Congress was controlled by the Soviets resulted in his refusal to join. In 1947 during the Ahlen conference, a joint conference of West and East German CDU leaders, Kaiser's plan of nationalisation of key industries and other moderate leftwing ideas were adopted by the party. In 1947 the Soviets forced him to resign as party chairman. However, he remained a member of the party's Executive Committee. In 1948 Kaiser was forced to leave East Berlin and he went to West Berlin where he joined the West German Christian Democratic Union . Within the CDU he became a major rival of Konrad Adenauer, the party leader. Kaiser disagreed with Adenauer's social market economy and called for the nationalisation of key industries. Kaiser strongly believed in a neutral, united Germany, and hoped that Germany would be a bridge between the West and the East. In 1950 Kaiser was elected a vice-chairman of the West German CDU. From 1949 until 1957 he was Minister of All-German Affairs in Adenauer's cabinet. Kaiser died on 7 May 1961 in Berlin.

        "content": "Born in New York City in 1918, Amen began drawing at the age of four. A scholarship to the Pratt Institute was awarded to him when he was fourteen years old. From 1942 to 1945 he served with the Armed Forces. He headed a mural project and executed murals in the United States and Belgium. His first exhibition in woodcut was held at the New School for Social Research and his second at the Smithsonian Institution in 1949 and also exhibited at the Artists House in Jerusalem, the Library of Congress, and the National Academy of Design. Amen studied in Paris in 1950. Upon his return to the United States, he had one man shows in New York and Washington DC. In 1953, Amen traveled throughout Italy. This resulted in a series of eleven woodcuts, eight etchings and a number of oil paintings. One of these woodcuts, \"Piazza San Marco #4\" and its four woodblocks constitute a permanent exhibit of block printing in color at the Smithsonian Institution. Travel in Israel, Greece and Turkey in 1960 led to a retrospective show at the Artist's House in Jerusalem. His art is widely owned and loved. Irving Amen has taught at Pratt Institute and at the University of Notre Dame.  He had a show of woodcuts at the Artists Studio in NYC. In 1974 he illustrated The Epic of Gilgamesh in linocuts and woodcuts for the Limited Editions Club. He designed a set of stained glass windows depicting the Twelve Tribes of Israel for Agudas Achim Synagogue in Bexley, Ohio. His work often depicts themes of Judaism, chess, people, music, Italy and Don Quixote. In his later years he lived and worked in Boca Raton, Florida. Commissions include a Peace Medal in honor of the Vietnam War. He created designs for 12 stained glass windows 16 feet high depicting the Twelve Tribes of Israel, commissioned by Agudas Achim Synagogue in Columbus, Ohio. He is listed in Mantle Fielding's Dictionary of American Painters, Sculptors and Engravers and the Dictionary of Contemporary American Artists by Paul Cummings.

In 1934 he moved to Oxford and studied Economics and Political science. After Oxford, Arndt moved to Warsaw, Poland for graduate study, where he learned Polish and, later, Russian. In 1939, after Hitler's invasion of Poland, he joined the anti-Nazi forces, was captured by the Germans and, after escaping from a German POW camp, spent a year in the Polish underground, eventually making his way back to Istanbul. From 1942 to 1945, Arndt was active in intelligence work on behalf of allied forces. He worked for the Office of Strategic Services, and the Office of War Information where he forged Nazi documents and passes until the end of the war. It was in Istanbul that he met and married Miriam Bach and had 2 sons while teaching and studying at Robert College where he received a degree in mechanical engineering. He worked in U.N. refugee resettlement between 1944 and 1949 until he was able to arrange emigration to the United States with his family. They lived in Tennessee, then North Carolina where their 2 daughters were born . In 1956 he received his doctorate in comparative linguistics and classics from UNC. He taught classics and modern languages at Guilford College and then the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. In 1963 he was awarded Yale University's Bollingen Prize for Translation, in recognition of his translation of Aleksandr Pushkin's \"Eugene Onegin.\"  In 1966 he accepted the chair of the Russian department at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Semi-retired since 1986, he continued to write well into his 93rd year.

        "content": "After serving in World War I and graduating from Amherst College , March was managing editor of The New Yorker in 1925, and helped create the magazine's \"Talk of the Town\" front section.  He left the magazine, and wrote the first of his two important long Jazz Age narrative poems, The Wild Party.  Due to its risqu\u00e9 content, this violent story of a vaudeville dancer who throws a booze and sex-filled party could not find a publisher until 1928.  Once published, however, the poem was a great success despite being banned in Boston.  March followed with The Set-Up, a poem about a black boxer who had just been released from prison. In 1929, March moved to Hollywood to provide additional dialogue for the film Journey's End and, more famously, to turn the silent version of Howard Hughes' classic Hell's Angels into a talkie \u2014 a rewrite that brought the phrase \"Excuse me while I put on something more comfortable\" into the American lexicon.  March stayed with Hughes' Caddo Pictures studio for several years, temporarily running the office, overseeing the release of Hell's Angels, and getting into legal trouble after an attempt to steal the script for rival Warner Bros.'  flying picture The Dawn Patrol. March worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood until 1940, under contract to MGM and Paramount and later as a freelancer for Republic Pictures and other studios; he wrote at least 19 produced scripts in his Hollywood career.  His most prominent late script is probably the left-leaning John Wayne curio Three Faces West, a knockoff of The Grapes of Wrath that ends with a faceoff between Okies and Nazis. With his third wife, Peggy Prior and her two children, March returned to the East Coast in 1940.  During World War II, he worked at a shipbuilding plant in Groton, Connecticut, and wrote features for the New York Times Magazine.  In later years, he wrote documentaries for the State Department and industrial films for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Monsanto Company, American Airlines, and others.  Several films starring industrial films icon Thelma \"Tad\" Tadlock, including Design for Dreaming and A Touch of Magic were made from March's rhyming scripts.  March died in 1977."

        "content": "March revised both The Set-Up and The Wild Party in 1968. Most critics deplored these changes, and Art Spiegelman returned to the original text when he published his illustrated version of The Wild Party in 1994. Both of March's long poems were made into films. Robert Wise's 1949 film version of The Set-Up loses the poem's racial dimension by casting the white actor Robert Ryan in the lead, while the Merchant Ivory Productions 1975 version of The Wild Party changes March's plot to conflate the poem with the Fatty Arbuckle scandal. The Wild Party continues to attract new readers and adaptations. In 2000, two separate musical versions played in New York, one on Broadway, composed by Michael John LaChiusa, and the other off-Broadway, composed by Andrew Lippa, with mixed critical and popular success. The Archives & Special Collections at Amherst College holds a substantial collection of March's personal papers, including unpublished poems, scripts, and a memoir entitled Hollywood Idyll. See: Joseph Moncure March Papers, 1896-1999 March's uncle, General Peyton Conway March, was once Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army in World War I. His grandfather was the philologist Francis Andrew March, and his adopted daughter is the retired actress Lori March Williams."

In his teens Joachim primarily focused on the discus throw, but after switching shot put technique from the glide style to rotational style, he improved dramatically during his four years at University of Idaho, where he was coached by Tim Taylor. Although he appeared at the World Junior Championships in Sydney 1996, where he threw the Discus, it was at the U23 European Championships in Gothenburg in 1999 he made his first international impact, winning a silver medal. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Olsen did not qualify for the final. Nevertheless, he received worldwide attention after he wrote in a chat room that the winner of the final, Arsi Harju had failed a doping test. The rumour was false, and the incident caused the Danish National Olympic Committee to send Joachim B. Olsen home prior to the closing of the Games. At the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, Olsen qualified for his first international final. Since then he has qualified for every final at Olympic, World and European Championships. In 2002 Olsen won the silver medal at the European Championships outdoor as well as indoor. In 2003 a hand injury held him back, but a revised training plan removed the pain in his wrist. Thus Olsen was ready for a comeback in 2004, and at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships he won a Bronze medal - a placement he repeated at the Olympic Games in Athens. But because of a positive doping of the gold medalist Yuri Bilonog , which caused the cancellation of the medal, Olsen inherited the silver medal after the announcement of redistributing medals. On 6 November 2005 Olsen injured his right ankle during practise. Several ligaments were either torn or severely damaged. On 6 February 2006 he announced, that the injury had healed sufficiently for him to compete again at highest level. A month later, at the World Indoor Championships, he managed to win a bronze medal with a throw of 21.16 metres. On 8 August 2008 at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, Olsen was the flagbearer for Denmark. He failed to reach the final. In 2008 Joachim Olsen became well known in the Danish publicity by his participation in, and winning of, the fifth season of the Danish version of Dancing with the Stars. On 22 July 2009, he announced his withdrawal from shot putting, saying that while he had a dream of competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics, his physical condition would not allow it. He suffered a slipped disc in April 2009."

        "content": "De Angulo began his career in field linguistics and anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley in the early 1920s, shortly after his marriage to L. S. Freeland.  During the next decade he and his wife lived for intermittent periods among several native Californian tribes to study their cultures, languages and music. As a linguist he contributed to the knowledge of more than a dozen native Northern Californian and Mexican Indian languages and music-systems and collected additional field data on their cultures and oral traditions. De Angulo was particularly interested in the semantics of grammatical systems of the tribes he studied, and was a pioneer in the study of North American ethnomusicology, particularly in his recordings of native music, and he was especially concerned to develop an existential understanding of Native American cosmology, social psychology, values and culture.  From the perspective of the academic scholarship of the period, this amounted to \"going native.\"  His key exposition of this matter is \u201cIndians In Overalls\u201d, first published in 1950 in The Hudson Review and subsequently as a book. De Angulo corresponded with Franz Boas, Alfred L. Kroeber, and Edward Sapir. Much of his fieldwork was funded by the American Council of Learned Societies Committee on Research in Native American Languages, under direction chiefly of Boas, and in part through Kroeber, head of Berkeley's Department of Anthropology, which published some of it and which archives some of his notes. As a phonetician, he was largely self-taught.  He had no formal training in the field, but acquired a basis in the discipline and discourse from trained linguists he worked with, including Nancy Freeland; by his own account his correspondence seeking instruction \"exhausted Sapir's patience\". In one case, the accuracy of his record has been questioned, and some linguistic work attributed to him was done by his wife. Boas, Kroeber, and finally Sapir also had qualms about his reliability, and Boas suspected that some of his analysis of Achumawi was imaginary and not based on actual observation, but these leaders in the still-emergent field of Americanist linguistics had an urgent need to get workers of any competence into the field while indigenous languages were still spoken. De Angulo's Bohemian lifestyle disconcerted college manners and social hypocrisies and contributed to his not pursuing a normal academic career.  His involvement in Native American research effectively came to an end following the death of his son Alvar in an automobile accident in 1933, near Big Sur. He retired to the isolated hilltop ranch there where he had lived intermittently for many years, and which he had first homesteaded after the 1915 failure of his ranch in Alturas. At this point his writings took a turn into fiction and poetry, much of which he justified as alternative techniques of presenting in accessible format the ethnographic detail he had collected. This was especially true for his bestseller, Indian Tales. Much of his fictional work attempted to recognize and embrace the native \"coyote tales\", or the trickster wisdom inherent in native storytelling. Ezra Pound called him \"the American Ovid\" and William Carlos Williams \"one of the most outstanding writers I have ever encountered.\" de Angulo also went on to tutor numerous famous authors including Jack Spicer in linguistics, and Robert Duncan in North American shamanic sorcery; he appears as a character in Jack Kerouac's books. Perceptions of de Angulo swing wildly; he is seen variously as a gifted but inconsistent field ethnographer, an \u2018\u2018Old Coyote,\u2019\u2019 an anarchist hero and talented subversive.  Some regarded him as an accomplished poet.  De Angulo shaped and diversified the scholarly picture of the native Californian landscape.  His re-envisioning of the ontological status of Native American cosmology and ethnology anticipated the Deep Ecology and Back To The Pleistocene thought of the 1990s.  He was friend and colleague to poets, composers, and scholars such as Harry Partch, Henry Miller, Robinson Jeffers, Mary Austin, Henry Cowell, Carl Jung, D. H. Lawrence, Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Duncan, and many others and an important participant in the San Francisco bay area's literary and cultural avant garde from his arrival until his death."

        "content": "Paul Bril is believed to have been born in Antwerp although his birthplace may have been Breda. He was the son of the painter Matthijs Bril the Elder.  Paul and his older brother Matthijs likely started their artistic training with their father in Antwerp. Paul may also have been a student of the Antwerp painter Damiaen Wortelmans who was specialised in the decoration of harpsichords. Matthijs moved to Rome probably around 1575. Here he worked on several frescoes in the Vatican Palace. It is believed Paul joined his brother in Rome around or after 1582. When Matthijs died in 1583, his brother likely continued his work, picking up many of Matthijs' commissions.  Paul's earliest known works date from the late 1580s.  He established his reputation with commissions from Pope Gregory XIII in the Collegio Romano.  His success was assured after Pope Sixtus V became his principal patron. Bril was part of a team specialized in landscape painting and thus participated in almost every assignment which entailed decorative landscapes, such as in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Vatican Palace and the Scala Santa. Another important early commission was the fresco cycle in the Santa Cecilia in Trastevere in Rome of around 1599. Pope Clement VIII also became his patron and gave the artist a commission for a monumental seascape on the Martyrdom of St. Clement.  Paul Bril completed this commission  in the Vatican Palace\u2019s Sala Clementina in collaboration with the brothers Giovanni and Cherubino Alberti . In 1601 Paul received another major commission, to paint a series of large canvases featuring properties of the Mattei family.  Paul further painted landscape frescoes in the Casino dell'Aurora of the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome. His patrons were among the most influential people in Rome and included members from the Colonna, Borghese, Mattei and Barberini families in Rome as well as Cardinal Federico Borromeo in Milan, Cardinal Carlo de\u2019 Medici in Florence and Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga in Mantua. In 1621, Paul Bril became director of the Accademia di San Luca, the artists' academy in Rome. This was a clear sign of the high esteem in which he was held by his fellow artists in Rome as he was the first foreigner to hold this position. He had many students including his son Cyriacus Bril, Luigi Carboni, Balthasar Lauwers, Willem van Nieulandt II, Pieter Spierinckx, Agostino Tassi and Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom.  Karel Philips Spierincks may also briefly have been his pupil. Paul Bril died in Rome in 1626."

        "content": "Paul Bril initially painted in the late Mannerist style developed by his brother. These early landscapes are in the Flemish tradition inaugurated by Joachim Patinir and Pieter Bruegel the Elder and further developed by his own brother. Works from this early period were characterised by a picturesque arrangement of landscape elements and violent contrasts between light and dark. These early paintings also show strong contrasts of forms to create a sense of dramatic motion. Bril contrasted steep cliffs with chasms or dark, twisting trees growing from hills next to flat, sunlit pastures. His style changed during his stay in Rome. His compositions became calmer and his style more classicising around 1605. This may have been due to the influence of Annibale Carracci and Adam Elsheimer. The works from this period have lower horizons and less abrupt transitions from foreground to background. The subjects are typically pastoral or bucolic scenes and mythological subjects.  This late style had a strong influence on the development of Flemish landscape painting and was crucial to Claude Lorrain's formation of the classical landscape. Agostino Tassi may have been Paul's pupil. Tassi later became the master of Claude Lorrain. Paul Bril thus forms one of the links between the panoramic views of Joachim Patinir and the ideal landscape evolved by Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. Bril is considered a precursor of the Dutch Italianates such as Cornelius van Poelenburgh and Bartholomeus Breenbergh, and, to a certain extent, of the Flemish and Dutch genre painters active in Rome known as the Bamboccianti. Paul also painted small cabinet paintings on copper and panel commencing from the 1590s. Some of these he signed with a pair of glasses, a pun on the Flemish word bril which means \"glasses\". These small-scale paintings depicted subjects that he and his brother had rendered before on a large scale, such as tempestuous seascapes, hermits in the wilderness, travelling pilgrims, peasants among ancient ruins, hunters and fishermen. A prolific draftsman, his drawings were popular with collectors and were copied by the many students who worked with him in his studio, which was a popular destination for Dutch and Flemish artists visiting Rome. He often collaborated on paintings with Johann Rottenhammer. According to a dealer's letter of 1617, Rottenhammer painted the figures in Venice and then sent the plates to Rome for Bril to complete the landscape. Bril also collaborated with his friends Jan Brueghel the Elder and Adam Elsheimer, whom he both influenced and was influenced by.  His collaboration with Elsheimer is shown in a painting now in Chatsworth House.  Bril introduced Jan Brueghel the Elder to Cardinal Federico Borromeo, who subsequently became Brueghel's most important patron. He also let the Dutch landscape artist Bartholomeus Breenbergh live in his Roman residence for many years."

He won the race in 1963, then famously broke down while leading the 1967 race with three laps to go in a turbine car. During his career as an owner, he won the Indy 500 in 1970\u20131971 with driver Al Unser, Sr. Jones won races in many types of vehicles: sports cars, IndyCars, sprint cars, midget cars, off-road vehicles, and stock cars. He is also remembered for bringing the stock block engine to USAC Sprint car racing as one of the \"Chevy Twins\" with Jim Hurtubise. He is associated with the famous Boss 302 Mustang with his wins using the engine in the 1970s. Jones' son P. J. Jones was also a diverse driver, with IndyCar and NASCAR starts and a championship in IMSA prototype sports cars. His other son Page Jones was an up-and-coming driver before suffering career ending injuries in a sprint car at the 4-Crown Nationals, and has been in rehabilitation, working with his father-in-law.

        "content": "Born in Texarkana, Arkansas, Jones' family moved to Torrance, California, where he grew up . He was nicknamed Parnelli by his boyhood friend Billy Calder, who hoped that the Jones family would not discover their son was racing cars as a 17-year-old minor. Jones participated in his first race in a Jalopy race at Carrell Speedway in Gardena, California. He developed his racing skills by racing in many different classes in the 1950s, including 15 stock car racing wins in the NASCAR Pacific Coast Late Model Series. His first major championship was the Midwest region Sprint car title in 1960. The title caught the attention of promoter J. C. Agajanian, who became his sponsor. He began racing at Indianapolis in 1961. Jones was named the 1961 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year, an honor that he shared with Bobby Marshman. Jones led early in the race and ran among the leaders until being hit in the face with a stone, bloodying his face, blurring his vision and slowing him to a 12th-place finish. In 1962, he was the first driver to qualify over 150\u00a0mph at the Indianapolis 500, winning the pole position at a speed of . Jones dominated the first two-thirds of the race until a brake line failure slowed him, and he settled for a seventh-place finish. In the 1963 Indianapolis 500, he started on the pole. This was the year the controversial Lotus-Ford rear-engined cars made their first appearance, and had ruffled the Indianapolis establishment. Before the race, the chief steward, Harlan Fengler, told the teams that he would black-flag any cars that leaked oil on the track, warning, \"Don't believe me, just try me.\" With Scotsman Jim Clark in a Lotus-Ford closing on Jones in the waning laps, Jones' car developed a horizontal crack in the external oil reservoir. At that moment, driver Eddie Sachs crashed on the oil-slickened racing surface and brought out a yellow caution flag, slowing the field. Agajanian, Jones' car owner, argued with chief steward Harlan Fengler not to issue a black flag, insisting the oil level had dropped below the level of the crack, and that the leak had stopped. As Agajanian pleaded with Fengler, Lotus head man Colin Chapman rushed up to join the conversation and demanded that Fengler follow the rules about disqualifying cars with oil leaks. With the end of the race just minutes away, Fengler took no action, and Jones went on to win. The Lotus-Ford team, while unhappy with the obvious favoritism displayed by race officials toward Jones and Agajanian, also acknowledged Jones' clear superiority in the event. In addition, Ford officials recognized that a victory through disqualification of Clark's biggest competitor would not be well received by the public, so they declined to protest. Also that year, legendary vehicle fabricator Bill Stroppe built a Mercury Marauder USAC Stock car for Jones. Jones won the 1963 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the car, and broke the stock car speed record. In 1964, he won seven races on his way to the USAC Stock car crown. He won the Turkey Night Grand Prix midget car event. Mercury decided to pull out of stock car racing after the season. The following year, Jones almost won Indy for a second time, finishing second behind Jim Clark. He won five of the nine midget car events that he entered in 1966, including the Turkey Night Grand Prix. He finished fourteenth in the final points despite competing in only nine of 65 events. In 1967, he drove in the Indianapolis 500 for owner Andy Granatelli in the revolutionary STP-Paxton Turbocar. Jones dominated the race but dropped out with three laps to go when a small, inexpensive transmission bearing broke. After 1968, turbine-powered cars were legislated out of competitiveness. Also in 1967, as part of his stock car contract with the Lincoln-Mercury division of the Ford Motor Company, Jones drove a Mercury Cougar for Bud Moore in the second-year Trans Am series. In April, Jones dueled with teammate, friend and rival Dan Gurney in a brutal , 4-hour event at Green Valley, Texas in 113-degree heat, losing by inches to Gurney. Stroppe suggested that Jones try his hand at off-road racing in front of a large crowd at a Christmas party in 1967. Jones at first said no, since he had enough of dirt. Stroppe suggested that maybe off-road racing was too hard for Jones, and the challenge started Jones' off-road career. Jones and Stroppe teamed up for the  Star Dust 7/11 race across the Nevada desert in early 1968. Jones had never driven or pre-run the Ford Bronco. Jones hit a dry wash at full speed, which broke the wheels and blew out the front tires. Jones would later have a guest appearance in the original film Gone in 60 Seconds featuring him and his Bronco which was stolen in the plot. Jones had become hooked on off-road racing. In 1968, Jones headed a super-roster of seven drivers signed by Andy Granatelli to drive STP Lotus 56 turbine cars in an unprecedented single-team assault on the Indianapolis 500. The deaths of Jim Clark and Mike Spence, plus a serious injury to Jackie Stewart, whittled the entry to four. Jones, testing his reworked 1967 car in practice, was dissatisfied with the car's performance compared to the newer \"wedge\"-shaped Lotus 56 turbines, and had concluded the car was unsafe. He stepped out of the car, which was subsequently assigned to Joe Leonard, who promptly wrecked the car in practice. Jones retired from driving IndyCars, but later admitted, \"If I hadn't already won Indy, they could never have kept me out of that car.\" Jones entered the 1968 NORRA Mexican 1000 . Jones led until the  marker. The Off-road Motorsports Hall of Fame describes Jones' racing style: \"Jones and Stroppe had to find a way to keep their vehicles in one piece. During races Jones would push the vehicles at maximum speeds until they gave way, with Stroppe telling him at top volume the entire time to take it easier on the vehicle.\" Jones had a special car fabricated that looked like a Bronco, but had racing parts that could withstand rigorous jarring that off-road vehicles endure. Jones named the vehicle \"Big Oly\" after his sponsor Olympia Beer. Jones used the vehicle to lead the Mexican 1000 from start to finish in a new record time of 14 hours and 59 minutes. Jones had major wins in the 1973 season. He won his second Mexican 1000 in 16 hours and 42 minutes. He also won the 1973 Baja 500 and Mint 400 off-road events. Jones had a major accident at SCORE International's 1974 Baja 500, and stepped away from full-time off-road racing to become a race car owner. \"Big Oly\" was sold in May 2020 for $1.7 million. Jones raced SCCA Trans Am sedans owned by Bud Moore: Mercury Cougar and Ford Mustang . Parnelli's dominance of the extremely competitive 1970 season brought Ford the manufacturer's championship."

After the company disbanded, the couple began performing in different teatro de revista companies, primarily in Barcelona. Mapy Cort\u00e9s made her film debut as one of the two female leads in the comedy Dos Mujeres y un Don Juan .

Back-to-back starring roles in three hit films - the Pan-American musical La liga de las canciones / The League of Songs , the nostalgia musical comedy \u00a1Ay, qu\u00e9 tiempos, se\u00f1or don Sim\u00f3n! / Oh, What Times, Don Simon! and the Cantinflas comedy El gendarme desconocido / The Unknown Policeman - quickly turned Mapy Cort\u00e9s into one of the most bankable leading ladies in Mexican cinema. Mapy also appeared in the U.S. State Department propaganda short film Mexican Moods. The short shows the couple performing at the luxurious Hotel Reforma in Mexico City circa 1941, when Mapy performed as part of the hotel's dinner show and Fernando acted as master of ceremonies. In the short, Mapy sings the Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez song \"Nada\" , which the couple later performed in the 1966 film Luna de miel en Puerto Rico as part of a tribute to the recently deceased composer. In 1942, Cort\u00e9s made her only foray into Hollywood cinema, playing a singer in the RKO wartime musical comedy Seven Days' Leave. Her eponymous character is engaged to Victor Mature's soldier character before he falls in love with a socialite played by Lucille Ball. After filming Seven Days Leave, Mapy Cort\u00e9s returned to Mexico City and played top-billed roles in contemporary romantic comedies and nostalgia musicals set during the Mexican Belle \u00c9poque. The 1945 Mapy Cort\u00e9s vehicle La p\u00edcara Susana / Mischievous Susana  marked the directorial debut of her husband Fernando, who remained very active as a comedy director in Mexican film and TV until his death in 1979, directing vehicles for popular Mexican comedians like Tin-Tan, Resortes, and la India Maria. While Fernando's demand as journeyman comedy director grew, Mapy's film career waned in the early 1950s with the rise of a younger generation of vedettes, rumberas and musical comedy stars. The couple received an invitation from \u00c1ngel Ramos, owner of El Mundo Enterprises, to help launch WKAQ-TV Telemundo Channel 2. On March 28, 1954, Puerto Rico received its first television transmission from Telemundo: a live broadcast of the Spanish comedy El caso de la mujer asesinadita, starring Mapy and directed by Fernando. The couple also starred in the station's first comedy show Mapy y Papi, an adaptation of the I Love Lucy format that also featured Maria Judith Franco and Mapy's nephew Paquito Cordero. Despite their success in Puerto Rican television, the couple decided to return to Mexico City, where they starred in a Mexican version of Mapy y Papi. Her niece Mapita Cort\u00e9s had been living with the couple in Mexico City and she briefly joined the Mexican film industry after becoming Miss Puerto Rico 1957. After an eight-year absence from films, Mapy Cort\u00e9s co-starred in the comedy Dormitorio para se\u00f1oritas / Girls' Dormitory , a loose remake of her 1943 hit Internado para se\u00f1oritas / Girls' Dormitory , starring Mapita and directed by Fernando. However, Mapita quickly retired from showbiz after marrying the popular Chilean crooner Lucho Gatica and only briefly returned many years later, as part of the Mexican telenovela industry. By the 1960s, Mapy Cort\u00e9s was working mostly on the Mexico City stage, often starring in comedies by Spanish author Alfonso Paso. Her last film appearances were supporting roles in three Puerto Rican/Mexican co-productions that were filmed in Puerto Rico, directed by her husband, and produced by her nephew Paquito. After Fernando Cort\u00e9s died, Mapy Cort\u00e9s returned to Puerto Rico and led a relatively quiet life. In 1998 she died at her home of a heart attack. She was buried at the Puerto Rico Memorial Cemetery in Carolina, Puerto Rico."

During Operation Bodenplatte, the German Luftwaffe's last offensive operation, Creamer was on the ground watching the aerial combat around him. A German Bf 109 fighter roared into make a strafing run on Creamer's position. Creamer ducked behind a mound of dirt, then pulled out his .45 pistol and fired at the German plane.

She served as an acolyte in the historic service, held at the Church of the Advocate, in which the first eleven women, now known as the Philadelphia Eleven, were ordained priests in the Episcopal Church on July 29, 1974. The ordinations were controversial, as women's ordination was still being debated in the Episcopal Church, but they were later officially recognized. Harris herself felt called to the ministry. The rector at Church of the Advocate, Paul Washington, recommended her to Bishop Lyman C. Ogilby of Pennsylvania, as a candidate for ordination. Ogilby ordained her as a deacon in 1979 and then as a priest in 1980. Harris was the priest-in-charge of St. Augustine of Hippo Church in Norristown, Pennsylvania, from 1980 to 1984. She also served as chaplain to the Philadelphia County prisons, and as counsel to industrial corporations for public policy issues and social concerns. She was named executive director of the Episcopal Church Publishing Company in 1984, and publisher of The Witness magazine. In 1988 she served as interim rector of the Church of the Advocate."

        "content": "Harris was elected bishop suffragan of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, on September 24, 1988, at a special convention of diocesan delegates.  Her election was controversial, in part because she was divorced and had not attended seminary. She was also the first woman to be elected to the position of bishop not only in the Episcopal Church, but in all of the Anglican Communion. Some members of the church felt it was inappropriate to elevate a woman to the position of bishop, and others were concerned that her election would strain relations with the wider Anglican Communion. Nevertheless, Harris had many supporters and her election was successful. Harris was consecrated on February 11, 1989. Eight thousand people attended the service, which was held at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, Massachusetts. Sixty bishops participated in the laying on of hands. There were 1,200 dignitaries and clergy in the opening procession, and four choirs participating in the service. The service was televised live and lasted three hours. As the first woman ordained as a bishop, and as an African American, she received death threats and obscene messages. Though urged to wear a bulletproof vest to her ordination, she refused. A contingent of the Boston police were assigned to her consecration. Her comment was merely, \"I don't take this in a personal way.\" Speaking of her work as bishop, Harris said, \"I certainly don't want to be one of the boys. I want to offer my peculiar gifts as a black woman ... a sensitivity and an awareness that comes out of more than a passing acquaintance with oppression.\" Harris served for 13 years as bishop in the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, a large diocese with 98,000 members. She retired in 2003 and was succeeded by another African-American woman, Gayle Elizabeth Harris. She then served as assisting bishop in the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, DC, until 2007. She was also the president of the Episcopal Church Publishing Company, publishers of The Witness magazine."

Her sermon was entitled \"It Isn't Easy Being Green\". Harris died at a hospice in Lincoln, Massachusetts, on March 13, 2020, at age 89. The Barbara C. Harris Camp & Conference Center is a ministry of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts located in Greenfield, New Hampshire. The center is named in honor of Harris. A task force was convened in 1997 to explore the potential of the center and their recommendation to proceed with the development of the center was approved by the diocesan council in 1998. From 1999 to 2002, the development of the center was under the direction of diocesan staff. In addition, over 200 lay and clergy volunteers lent their time, energy, and expertise to the project, working in a variety of roles. An extensive fund-raising campaign took place in order to finance the construction and to fund a scholarship endowment and an operating endowment. The center welcomed its first summer campers in July 2003. Three months after her death, Harris was commemorated at the consecration and installation of Deon Kevin Johnson, eleventh bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Missouri on June 13, 2020. The collect and readings for her commemoration were written and selected by Johnson and the Rev. Canon Sandye Wilson."

        "content": "Born at Fairnilee House, in the Scottish Borders, between Galashiels and Selkirk, she was the daughter of Robert Rutherfurd of Fairnalee. She married an impoverished advocate, Patrick Cockburn of Ormiston in 1731. Unable to afford a home of their own they lived for 4 years in the house of her elderly father-in-law, \"an old Presbyterian of the deepest dye\" who condemned as ungodly cards, plays, and dancing. On the death of the old man they moved to Edinburgh, and she began to mix in society where her liveliness and wit made her welcome in spite of her relatively lowly status. In 1745 during the Jacobite rising she vented her Whiggism in a squib upon Bonnie Prince Charlie, and narrowly escaped being taken by the Highland guard as she was driving through Edinburgh in the family coach of the Keiths of Ravelston, with the parody in her pocket. Her husband died in 1753, and left her a small income. She continued to mix in artistic and intellectual circles from her home in Bristo Street, on Castle-hill, Edinburgh. Despite the added loss of her only son in infancy we are told of, \"her insatiable love of mischief, mockery and match-making, everywhere welcome, both in town and country, a good companion, a wise friend, ready to jest over her own ailments.\" In 1765 she published her lyrics to the traditional Border Ballad the Flowers of the Forest beginning \"I've seen the smiling of Fortune beguiling\".  It is said to have been written before her marriage in 1731 and concerns a financial crisis that had ruined the fortunes of a number of the Selkirk Lairds. Later biographers, however, think it probable that it was written on the departure to London of a certain John Aikman, with whom Alison appears to have had an early attachment. Another later set of lyrics to the song by Jean Elliot of Minto written in 1756 is also in circulation and should not be confused with Rutherford's. In 1773 she was living at St Andrews Square in a then new house in Edinburgh's New town. In 1777 she remarked of a young Walter Scott that he was \"the most extraordinary genius of a boyo.\"  She befriended Robert Burns in 1786, whom she described as having \"a most enthusiastic heart of love\".  She was a great friend of the philosopher David Hume. She was an indefatigable letter-writer and a composer of parodies, squibs, toasts and \"character sketches\", then a favourite form of composition.  The \"Flowers of the Forest\" however is considered the only thing she wrote that possesses lasting literary merit. At her house on Castlehill, and afterwards in Crichton Street, she received many illustrious friends, among whom were Henry Mackenzie, William Robertson, David Hume, John Home, Lord Monboddo, the Keiths of Ravelston, the Balcarres family and Lady Anne Barnard, the author of \"Auld Robin Gray.\" As a Rutherfurd she had a connexion with Sir Walter Scott's mother, and was her intimate friend. Lockhart quotes a letter written by Mrs Cockburn in 1777, describing the conduct of little Walter Scott, then scarcely six years old, during a visit which she paid to his mother, when the child gave as a reason for his liking for Mrs Cockburn that she was a \"virtuoso like himself.\" Cockburn died on 22 November 1794. She is buried in the kirkyard of Buccleuch Parish Church in south Edinburgh."

        "content": "Robert Crannell Minor , American artist, was born in New York City on April 30, 1839. His father, Israel Minor, was a merchant who made a large fortune in the pharmaceutical business. As a young man, Robert Minor worked as a bookkeeper in New York City but decided to study art in his early thirties. After studying in New York with painter Alfred Cornelius Howland, Minor went abroad in 1871 to continue his artistic education.  He visited various galleries in England before traveling to Barbizon, France, where he studied under Diaz.  He later studied in Antwerp under Joseph Van Luppen and Hippolyte Boulenger. In 1874, he was vice president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 artistique et litt\u00e9raire of Antwerp. On his return to the United States in 1874, he opened a studio in New York.  He painted for many years out of his studio in the Old University Building of New York University.  Painting in the Adirondack Mountains and later in Waterford, Connecticut, Minor soon became known for his landscapes resembling the Barbizon School.  Under the influence of George Inness and Alexander Helwig Wyant, he also began to paint in a Tonalist style.  His painting Great Silas at Night displays his adoption of the Tonalist style while his lingering Barbizon style can be seen in A Hillside Pasture.   From the 1890s until his death, Minor exhibited frequently with the Tonalists in New York. In 1897, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Design, New York.  In 1900, Minor achieved the height of his success at the historic William T. Evans sale in 1900, where his painting The Close of Day fetched $3,050, the highest price for a landscape by a living American painter at that auction. Over the course of his lifetime, Minor was a member of the Society of American Artists and the Salmagundi Club.  He exhibited in New York, Brooklyn, Chicago, and elsewhere in the United States, as well as in the Royal Academy of London and the salons of Paris and Antwerp. Minor was plagued with bad health during the last decade of his life. Despite later speculation, it did not materially impact the quantity of his output, and the suggestion that it impacted the quality of his work is a misreading of the increasing abstraction in certain of his later Tonalist paintings. He died at his home in Waterford, Connecticut, on August 4, 1904.  His paintings are owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Mead Art Museum, the Lyman Allyn Museum, the Florence Griswold Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Newark Museum, the Robert Hull Fleming Museum, the Haggin Museum, the Salmagundi Club, the Memorial Art Gallery, and the University of Arizona Museum of Art."

        "content": "He learned architecture from his father, Miguel Cano; painting in the academy of Juan del Castillo, and from Francisco Pacheco the teacher of Vel\u00e1zquez; and sculpture from Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s. As a sculptor, his most famous works are the Madonna and Child in the church of Lebrija , and the colossal figures of San Pedro and San Pablo. He was made first royal architect, painter to Philip IV, and instructor to the prince, Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias. The King gave him the church preferment of a canon of the Granada Cathedral , in order to take up a position as chief architect of the cathedral, where his main achievement in architecture was the fa\u00e7ade, designed at the end of his life and erected to his design after his death. He was notorious for his ungovernable temper; and it is said that once he risked his life by committing the then capital offence of dashing to pieces the statue of a saint, when in a rage with the purchaser who begrudged the price he demanded. According to another story, he found his house robbed after coming home one evening, his wife murdered, and his Italian servant fled. Notwithstanding the presumption against the fugitive, the magistrates condemned Cano, because he was of a jealous temper. Upon this he fled to Valencia, but afterwards returned to Madrid, where he was put to the torture, which he endured without incriminating himself, and the king received him into favour. After the death of his wife he took Holy Orders as a protection from further prosecution, but still continued his professional pursuits. He died in 1667. In his last moments, when the priest held to him a crucifix, he told him to take it away because it was badly carved. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the dying Cano refused the Sacrament from a priest who gave it to conversos. Probably this version is spurious as many others about his life and temperament."

        "content": "Manuel Ortiz Partida, debut in the pros in 1990, spent his time in the Independent Circuit. He wrestled as \"Halloween\" for most of his career. In 1996, Ortiz joined WCW where he took the name \"Ciclope\". His biggest moment in wrestling was part of the feud between Chris Jericho and Dean Malenko. Malenko, who had been inactive for a few months prior, dressed up as Ciclope to win a Cruiserweight battle royale to determine the number one contendership to Chris Jericho's Cruiserweight Title. Jericho had been refusing to grant Malenko contendership, making the disguise necessary. After his time there was over, he lost the Ciclope mask to Antifaz del Norte early in 1999. He quickly reverted to his Halloween character but lost his mask again on December 24, 1999 in a match against Super Parka. He has wrestled in many United States promotions over the years including for USA Pro Wrestling, Florida Championship Wrestling and Luchamania. In 2002 he along with La Familia de Tijuana came to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in Mexico City. The trio won the National Trios title but Nicho had a falling out with management and La Familia soon left entirely. They continued to work for independent promoters until CMLL called them back in 2005 to wrestle against Negro Casas, Heavy Metal and Felino on a show celebrating Negro's 25 years of wrestling. Perro Aguayo, Jr. recruited him and Dami\u00e1n for his Los Perros del Mal group. However, Halloween suffered a leg injury and his role was minimalized. After Universo 2000 used the illegal martinete on Dami\u00e1n 666, Halloween challenged Univeso to a hair vs. hair match on the December 2 show. After losing the match and his hair, Halloween underwent knee surgery that put him out of action for several months after which he was released from CMLL. In 2009 Halloween joined Aguayo's Perros del Mal Producciones, where he reunited with Dami\u00e1n 666. In June 2010, Halloween became a major part of a storyline, where Los Perros del Mal invaded AAA. On June 18, 2011, at Tripleman\u00eda XIX, Halloween, Dami\u00e1n 666 and X-Fly defeated Los Psycho Circus in a tournament final to become the first ever AAA World Trios Champions. On July 31 at Verano de Esc\u00e1ndalo, Los Perros del Mal faced Los Psycho Circus in a steel cage match, where the last person left in the cage would lose either his hair or mask. The match ended with Psycho Clown escaping the cage, leaving X-Fly inside and forcing him to have his hair shaved off. On October 9 at H\u00e9roes Inmortales, Los Perros del Mal and Los Psycho Circus ended their year long rivalry, when Halloween, Dami\u00e1n 666 and Nicho el Millonario were defeated in a Masks vs. Hairs steel cage match and were all shaved bald. After a five-month break from the rivalry, Los Perros del Mal lost the AAA World Trios Championship to Los Psycho Circus on March 11, 2012. The following day, Halloween, Dami\u00e1n 666 and X-Fly announced that they had quit Los Perros del Mal. On March 13, 2012, Halloween, Bestia 666, Dami\u00e1n 666, Super Nova and X-Fly announced that they were forming La Familia de Tijuana, a group of independent wrestlers, much like Los Perros del Mal, with the exception that they were not looking to form their own promotion. On March 29, International Wrestling Revolution Group was officially announced as La Familia de Tijuanas new home promotion. Afterwards, Halloween was the only member of La Familia de Tijuana, who kept appearing on AAA events. After initially teasing dissension with El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, Halloween reunited with Los Perros del Mal on April 1. On April 19, Halloween officially severed his ties with the rest of La Familia de Tijuana and returned to Los Perros del Mal. On August 5 at Tripleman\u00eda XX, Halloween reunited with former partner Extreme Tiger for one night to take part in a Parejas Suicidas steel cage match, featuring three other former tag teams. However, both Halloween and Tiger managed to escape the cage and avoid having to face each other in a Hair vs. Mask match. In late 2012, Halloween started a romance storyline with Mari Apache, which led to the two winning the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship on October 7. Later, in the main event of the same evening, Halloween lost his hair to Dark Cuervo in an eight man tag team Domo de la Muerte. Halloween and Apache lost the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship to Drago and Faby Apache on July 19, 2013.

His father Franti\u0161ek Ra\u0161\u00edn was a farmer, baker and a vendor of flour and cereals. His mother worked in their household and on the field. The family later bought a house in the town and another field. Later in life, Ra\u0161\u00edn described poor social reality in the area that was focused on the sugar industry. He also criticized the so-called \"harfenictv\u00ed\": traveling musician groups connected to prostitution that expanded after the cancellation of the corvee. From 1878 to 1881, Ra\u0161\u00edn attended a gymnasium in Nov\u00fd Byd\u017eov and he spent the fourth year of the gymnasium in a German gymnasium in Broumov. He finished the last years of high school in the gymnasium of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 and graduated there in 1886. In these years he became interested in politics into which he was guided by his father who in 1887 became the mayor of Nechanice. He was fourth of his brothers who started to study at university. The other two brothers pursued a job in the trade sector. Firstly, he studied at the Faculty of Medicine of Charles University but he was forced to leave due to lung disease. He switched for Faculty of Law because there was an optional attendance at lectures and moved to the house of his sister in Krkono\u0161e for rehabilitation. After two years he recuperated."

        "content": "In 1888, Ra\u0161\u00edn returned to Prague to properly continue his studies. There he was actively participating in the student movement and three years later he participated at the Conference of Slavonic students with Anton\u00edn Hajn and V\u00e1clav Klof\u00e1\u010d. The Czech youth's opinions defied against the Austrian monarchy, police and the conservative Old Czech Party. Their most powerful instrument was the Magazine of Czech Students , where they propagated the adoption of universal voting rights and greater national rights for Czech people. Ra\u0161\u00edn was supporting the National Freedom Party which is another name for the Young Czech Party that got into the Bohemian Diet and in 1891 into the Imperial Council. In October 1891, he graduated from his law studies at Charles University and continued in his political activity. In the day of the Emperor's Franz Joseph I of Austria arrival to Prague, Ra\u0161\u00edn published an anti-state legal-political text Czech State Law in which he outlined the program of restoring the independent Czech state in the spirit of the democracy with the guarantees for the rights of the minorities. He joined service in the military in Hungarian Pest and passed an officer\u2019s exams with the best results. But because of his previous controversial article that was confiscated by the police, he was threatened by prolonging his service in the military to two years in total and loss of his ranks. Ra\u0161\u00edn returned from his military service in the fall of 1892 and started to work as an advocate concipient. He was elected the mayor of \"Slavia\": literary and rhetorical association of progressors that supported strengthening radicalism. He also published critical articles in journals New Flows of Ideas and Prospects like Study on the death penalty, Judicial independence, Political crimes according to the outline of the new Criminal Code, Reflections on the draft Criminal Code. Despite having little and questionable evidence against radical movements in Prague, the Austrian government declared a state of emergency in September 1893 and started to arrest critical voices. In October Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn was taken to custody together with redactors and editorial staff of oppositional newspapers Anton\u00edn Hajn, Josef \u0160k\u00e1ba, Anton\u00edn Pravoslav Vesel\u00fd, Karel Stanislav Sokol, Stanislav Kostka Neumann, and others. Journals were banned and 70 people were arrested. The defendants in the process remembered as Omladina Trial were accused of the highest treason for conspiring against the state. In fact, the group called Omladina never existed. In January 1894 the trial began and Ra\u0161\u00edn was sentenced to 2 years unconditionally to prison in Bory . He lost his academic titles and civil rights. In prison, he never asked for pardon and in his free time, he pursued learning French, English, reading, translating , and studying national economic policies. In November 1894, his father became a member of the Imperial Council which is the highest legislative body of the Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire based in Vienna. When he returned, he planned to stand against weakness and humanism of the realist wing of the Young Czech Party represented by Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk. The Young Czech Party was also denounced by supporters of Czech Modernism like Josef Svatopluk Machar."

The Czech Progressive Movement divided to radically progressive around the journal Independence and Anton\u00edn Hajn and to nationally progressive and statutory around Radical Newspaper which Ra\u0161\u00edn turned into a journal. In 1899, he was partially involved in the creation of a Radical Statutory Party officially named Czech Statutory Party but left it year after when his son was born. He founded independent weekly newspaper Word and created his own Law Office. As an advocate, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn represented \u017divnobanka bank. The weekly paper ended 1905 and together with the banker of \u017divnobanka Jan Preiss, Ra\u0161\u00edn entered in 1907 into the Young Czech Party, the second biggest burgheral party after agrarian. He was propagating universal suffrage and was trying to reform the party. Ra\u0161\u00edn was the first in Czech lands who introduced member legitimations, regional branch offices, paid regional secretary and party cash register with regular contributions. He sided with Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159 and Franti\u0161ek Fiedler and founded Party\u2019s journal Day . With Kram\u00e1\u0159 he gained Czech newspapers National Newspaper in 1910.

They created the so-called National Council that financed foreign resistance led by Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk.  The consequences got to them in July 1916 when Ra\u0161\u00edn was arrested, taken into custody in Vienna and charged for treason and espionage. The process with Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn, Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159, journalist and translator Vincenc \u010cervinka, and accountant of the malt house Zden\u011bk Zamazal lasted from December 1915 to July 1916 with the result of the death penalty. Later in the same year, Emperor Franz Joseph I and after him, Charles I died, and punishments were changed to 10 years in Austrian M\u00f6llersdorf.

His Imperial Council Member\u2019s mandate was taken away from him in June 1917. Next month, the amnesty was announced. After his return from prison, viewed as a national hero, he immediately started to be politically active. He regained his Doctor of Laws academic title . In 1918, the Young Czech Party merged with the Statutory Progressive Party, Moravian People's Progressive Party and some part of the Progressive Party with the common name the Czech Statutory Democracy. The Old Czech Party joined in the next year. As a party chairman was elected Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159. Ra\u0161\u00edn was part of the party\u2019s leadership that set its goals: support of social justice but rejection of the socialism as such, support of Czech nationalism and democracy, the need for strong control state, police, army and the large state apparatus. It promoted secularization, but with the preservation of freedom of religion and a strong influence of Christian morality, it also promoted solidarity and education. It was supposed to be oriented on the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and Czarist Russia. The National Newspaper continued to be the party\u2019s newspapers."

Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159 was Chairman, Anton\u00edn \u0160vehla Vice-Chairman, Franti\u0161ek Soukup Managing Director and Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn Member of the Board. In the night from 27th to 28th, Vlastimil Tusar called Ra\u0161\u00edn from Vienna and said that Czech politics needs to go to the front and support fighters in endurance and not leaving. He knew that this is a sign of surrender. Ra\u0161\u00edn said: \u201cI was convinced that it will burst tomorrow.\u201d  In the morning, Ra\u0161\u00edn met \u0160vehla and others from the National Assembly. After they received Andr\u00e1ssyho n\u00f3ta , they decided to take the power before surrender. Today, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn is remembered as one of the Men of the 28th October , who together declared an independent Czechoslovakian state. Ra\u0161\u00edn was the first one who publicly announced the state in the place of National Assembly, he also was the author of the first law which established an independent state. In November 1918, the Revolutionary National Assembly was formed. On the first meeting, the members elected Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk as the President of the Republic and appointed Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159 Prime Minister. Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn was firstly supposed to be the Interior Minister but for his knowledge in economics, he was needed to take the Ministry of Finance because state finances were devastated by inflation. Journalist Ferdinand Peroutka pointed out that Ra\u0161\u00edn was not a pure economist but he has more political experience than for example Ra\u0161\u00edn\u2019s opponent doctor Karel Engli\u0161. January 1919, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn wrote to Edvard Bene\u0161: \"The population thinks that freedom means not paying taxes, no one is doing anything from executions, so I don't know how economics could be managed further,\" but at the same time state is relied on as on the solver of all problems. As a Minister for Finance, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn had efforts to back his proposed currency by gold. For that, he announced nationwide voluntary collection, where 64 kilograms of pure gold was obtained. At the beginning of 1919, Ra\u0161\u00edn closed borders and the isolated whole country from 26 February to 9 March and started to stamp all money from which he withholds some part as a government loan. For that 2 weeks, he was given rule over police and army. The goal was to disconnect currencies, lower volume of money in circulation and subordinate emission policy to a newly created state bank. After the left won the elections in 1919, Vladim\u00edr Tusar was appointed Prime Minister and Ra\u0161\u00edn became only Member of the Parliament. The second Vladim\u00edr Tusar\u2019s government was established in 1920 after the Constitution of Czechoslovakia was approved. Ra\u0161\u00edn still got a mandate for Czechoslovakian National Democracy that was also part of the Committee of Five . In the same year, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn published his book My Finance Plan describing Czechoslovakian financial history from Austria-Hungary till present days. Two years later he followed up with publications Financial and Economic Policy until the End of 1921 , and Inflation and Deflation . He was appointed Ministry for Finance in the government of Anton\u00edn \u0160vehla and introduced many measures against social benefits. He also criticized monetary compensations for the legionaries. Amidst an economic crisis, Ra\u0161\u00edn stressed the politics of deflation and a strong currency. High unemployment caused great animosity towards him, especially from the left. A fierce anti-Ra\u0161\u00edn campaign developed."

In the morning of 5 January 1923, Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn came out of his apartment in \u017ditn\u00e1 street house number 8 and was shot in the back and side when trying to get in the ministry car. He died after a long period of suffering on 18 February 1923. The assassin was young anarcho-communist Josef \u0160oupal who confessed and told that he was planning to kill other representatives of Czechoslovak capitalism Jaroslav Preiss and Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159. Because he was younger than 21 years, he wasn\u2019t sentenced to death but imprisoned for 18 years in Kartouz. The assassination was condemned by the president and many anti-socialist laws were introduced."

        "content": "DeSario worked within several music genres out of high school. She was a vocalist and played both recorder and harp from 1970\u20131977 with a Medieval and Renaissance music group named the Early Music Consort. The group was headed by scholar and Pro Musica member Arnold Grayson. She began her career as a singer/songwriter in the folk genre and later expanded her love of folk music with her passion for jazz. After marrying horn player, arranger, and composer Bill Purse, they founded a pop-folk-jazz collaborative called Abacus. One night, a long-haired man walked into the club where she was performing and claimed to be the producer of the Bee Gees; to their surprise, he was. Barry Gibb had heard her demo of original music and was so inspired by DeSario's vocals that he wrote a song for her called \"Ain't Nothing Gonna Keep Me from You\" and helped her obtain a recording contract. \"Ain't Nothing Gonna Keep Me from You\" from 1978 was DeSario's first hit single, written by Barry Gibb from her first album Pleasure Train, also released in 1978. Even though the first single from her debut, Pleasure Train, made #43 on the U.S. pop charts, she hadn't really enjoyed the recording experience and wanted a new direction. It was then that she bumped into an old school mate she had as a teen, Harry Wayne Casey of KC and the Sunshine Band. In the U.S., DeSario is mainly known for her duet with KC, lead singer of the R&B and funk group KC and the Sunshine Band of the Barbara Mason cover, \"Yes, I'm Ready\" from 1980 from her second album Moonlight Madness, released in 1979. Follow-up singles \"Moonlight Madness\" and a remake of \"Dancin' in the Streets\" charted but didn't make the Billboard Top 40. By the end of 1980, her hit \"Yes, I'm Ready\" granted her one-hit wonder status, with the disco-era making an exit, even though her duet with KC was a pop-fused remake of a slow-dancing ballad. She went on to record two more albums for Casablanca, Caught, an album which reflected her situation with the record company, and Relationships, which was shelved when the company itself changed directions.  In the mid-1980s, she recorded two contemporary Christian albums in quick succession for Word Records, A Call to us All and Voices in the Wind, which were co-written with and produced by Bill Purse. Between these two albums, she released a Post-disco/Dance-pop-flavored album with Joey Carbone and Richie Zito entitled Overnight Successexclusively in Japan.  The title track was released as a single but made minimal commercial impact.  In 1986, she was nominated for a Grammy in the gospel category for Best Female Performance. She also wrote for and appeared on various artists' albums. During the same period, her music was popular in Japan and the Philippines. DeSario's music became more introspective and increasingly challenged conservative Christianity.  Finally, in 1986, she requested that she be released from her contract at Word Records. In 1989, DeSario also performed/recorded a version of \"Lifeline\" with The Maranatha! Singers on a compilation CD for Maranatha! Music. DeSario took her talents to production for Emergence on 1993's Laughing Medusa Theme Series, Vol. 1 release. DeSario was credited as executive producer, producer and vocalist and husband Bill took on the roles of synthesizer, piano, arranger, keyboards, vocals, producer, engineer, editing, executive producer and mixing. DeSario would also provide vocals on Mark Snow's 1996 album, The Truth and the Light: Music from the X-Files In 2012, Gold Legion.com digitally remastered Pleasure Train and released it on CD. Though it does not contain bonus tracks of the 12 inch dance versions, it comes with a 12-page booklet with liner notes that detail the story of the original album as told by its producers. DeSario shares her life in Germany and Miami and sings from time to time with The Marschfellows in Germany. She is also part of Christian music groups and performs with them."

        "content": "Archibald MacNeal Willard was an American painter who was born and raised in Bedford, Ohio. He was the son of Samuel Willard, the pastor of Bedford Baptist Church. Willard had an interest in art ever since he was a child and often scribbled on barns and other structures at home. As a young man, Willard moved to Wellington, Ohio and began working for the wagon maker, E.S. Tripp. He began as a basic wagon painter, but eventually was allowed to paint elaborate decorations that were popular at the time. Willard joined the 86th Ohio Infantry in 1863 and fought in the American Civil War, but was not heavily involved. During this time, he painted several scenes from the war. After the war, Willard created a pair of paintings for Tripp's daughter, Addie, called Pluck and Pluck No. 2. The first of the two features three children being carted by a dog chasing a rabbit, while in the second, the children and their cart have crashed due to their reckless pursuit. These paintings, among earlier sketches, forged a relationship between him and photographer, James F. Ryder. Ryder made much of his money in chromolithography with the outcome of making popular and marketable images for the average household. He saw a potential in Willard to create humorous and cheerful paintings to make profits. Willard painted The Spirit of '76 about 1875 in Wellington, Ohio, after he saw a holiday parade pass through the town square. Willard also painted three murals in the main hall of the Fayette County courthouse in Washington Court House, Ohio: The Spirit of Electricity, The Spirit of Telegraphy, and The Spirit of the Mail. Willard is buried in Wellington, Ohio at the Greenwood Cemetery. He is commemorated by a Willard Avenue in his birthplace of Bedford and a Willard Drive in nearby Garfield Heights named after him."

        "content": "Willard's most famous work is The Spirit of '76 , which was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1876. Common myths claim that people were so inspired by it that Willard was invited to show his painting and that even then president Grant gave his praise. Unfortunately, it did not have such an initial popularity. It was placed in the Art Annex to make room for a large number of applications and it was scarcely advertised. It was not hailed by critics either, with one calling the work \"oppressive\". The success of the painting was largely due to Ryder's marketing of the chromolithographs, sold first at five dollars a piece and for less as the exhibition progressed. After the exhibition, the painting garnered enough popularity to tour across the country to large crowds. The original is displayed in Abbot Hall, Marblehead, Massachusetts. Several later variations painted by Willard have been exhibited around the country . Willard developed the painting from a sketch, which included three men dancing and singing. He used his father, Samuel Willard, as the model for the middle character of the painting. Hugh Mosher was the model for the fifer. The boy was Henry Devereaux. Including his father in the painting was something that set the painting apart from his usual, humorous style, since Willard felt sentimental toward his father's work as a minister and his grandfather's role in the Revolutionary War. He also made several other works of art, including The Blue Girl, and others not as recognized. After the exhibition of The Spirit of '76 he saw himself as an elevated artist, despite the minimal critical acclaim. His later works were characterized as returns to The Spirit of '76 and his folksy retellings of U.S. history. They were hardly recognized and did not make him as much money. His prominence as an artist would only return briefly in 1895 when The Spirit of '76 and possibly another work by Willard's involving the same subjects marching into Havana were being advertised for the Spanish\u2013American War."

        "content": "In July 1939 the cover of Mickey Mouse Magazine featured a parody of the painting with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy substituted for the soldiers. The art was adapted by Disney in 1975 as part of the logo for America on Parade at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. It was the basis for the design of the opening float in the parade. The final scene of the 1950s Merrie Melodies short Bunker Hill Bunny, starring Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam, parodies the painting. On the 1961 comedy album Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume One: The Early Years, the track \"Yankee Doodle Go Home \" features the \"hip\" fife player and younger drummer objecting to the \"square\" playing of the older drummer. In the 1963 World War II film The Great Escape, Hilts and Hendley are seen celebrating the 4th of July in a Nazi German POW camp. They wake up the camp in the morning by playing of \"Yankee Doodle\" and are dressed similarly to the characters in the painting. Kurt Vonnegut referred to the painting in his 1969 novel Slaughterhouse Five, in a passage where the protagonist Billy Pilgrim walks through a POW camp near Dresden. Billy is thus described: \"Billy was carrying his little coat as though it were a lady's muff. It was wrapped around and around his hands. He was the central clown in an unconscious travesty of that famous oil painting, The Spirit of '76.\" New York hardcore band Warzone used the painting for the cover of their 1996 LP The Sound of Revolution."

In 1961, Bartu transferred to ACF Fiorentina in Italy. Later, he played for Venezia A.C. in 1962 and for S.S. Lazio in 1964. He is the first ever Turkish footballer, who played a final game in Europe with Fiorentina against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 1962.

After successful seasons in Italy, Bartu returned to Turkey in 1967 to play in his former club Fenerbah\u00e7e for more three years. Overall, Bartu played 326 games with Fenerbah\u00e7e and scored 162 goals. He became four-time Turkish Super League champion in 1959, 1961, 1968 and 1970 with Fenerbah\u00e7e.

Marsh is credited with coining the term punk rock in a 1971 article he wrote about Question Mark & the Mysterians. While supportive of punk music in general, he said in a 2001 interview that \"I don't know that it was any more important than disco,\" and believes rap is more significant than punk in the history of rock music. He has written extensively about his favorite artists, including Marvin Gaye, whose song \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" he chose as the number one single of all-time in his book The Heart of Rock and Soul: the 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made, and Sly Stone, whom he called \"one of the greatest musical adventurers rock has ever known.\" Along with Rolling Stone magazine publisher Jann Wenner, Marsh has been involved in organizing and maintaining the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Marsh has at times courted controversy with his style of maintaining selections. Marsh has published four books about  Bruce Springsteen. Some of these became bestsellers, including Born to Run and Glory Days. Marsh has edited and contributed to Rock and Roll Confidential, a newsletter about rock music and social issues. The newsletter has since been renamed Rock and Rap Confidential. Marsh contributed to the 1994 book Mid-Life Confidential, a book about and by the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock band composed of American authors. He has also worked for Newsday and The Real Paper. Marsh's book 360 Sound: The Columbia Records Story \u2014 Legends and Legacy, was released in October 2012. In the same format as Heart of Rock and Soul, this book covers the 264 greatest songs from Columbia Records beginning with the 1890 performance of John Philip Sousa's \"Washington Post March\" and working its way chronologically up to Adele's \"Rolling in the Deep\" . To promote the music of Columbia Records, Legends and Legacy is available as a free eBook on iTunes.\""

        "content": "Marsh has been characterised as a \"grumpy rock and roll journalist\" due to his acerbic comments on popular musicians whom he dislikes. In 1976, he wrote that Led Zeppelin had an \"insurmountable flaw\" in drummer John Bonham , whom he saw as \"something like clinically incompetent\" and responsible for marring every Zeppelin album to date. Marsh wrote in 1978: \"Queen isn't here just to entertain. This group has come to make it clear exactly who is superior and who is inferior. Its anthem, 'We Will Rock You', is a marching order: you will not rock us, we will rock you. Indeed, Queen may be the first truly fascist rock band...[I] wonder why anyone would indulge these creeps and their polluting ideas.\" Marsh had previously described Queen frontman Freddie Mercury \u2013 who is regarded as one of the best rock singers of all time \u2013 as possessing a \"passable pop voice\". Marsh described Bob Seger's 1980 album Against the Wind as \"absolutely cowardly\". He was much more supportive of Seger's earlier work. In the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide, Marsh called Journey \"a dead end for San Francisco area rock\", and their music \"calculated\". He awarded every single Journey album released up to that point \u2013 seven studio albums, a compilation album and a live album \u2013 the minimum possible score of 1/5 stars. When asked about Marsh's unrelenting derision of Journey on a 1986 television program during which other critics had defended the band, lead singer, Steve Perry, called Marsh \"an unusual little man who all too often thinks that his subjective opinions translate to inarguable fact\". Also in the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide, Marsh described Air Supply as \"The most calculated and soulless pseudo-group of its kind, which is saying something\". In 1989, Marsh referred to the Grateful Dead as the \"worst band in creation\". Regarding a possible Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction for Kiss, Marsh said: \"Kiss is not a great band. Kiss was never a great band. Kiss never will be a great band, and I have done my share to keep them off the ballot.\" Kiss were ultimately inducted in 2014; in the lead-up, Marsh said: \"I was done with them before I ever turned the first album over to the second side... all that mediocrity was harmless enough until the boastful bassist decided to turn it into a propaganda machine for the only two things he's ever loved: Gene Simmons and money.\" Lead singer Paul Stanley described Marsh as \"pompous\", and pointed to his derision of Led Zeppelin and Queen as evidence that he had \"no clue\" about music. In the March 13, 1975 edition of Rolling Stone, Marsh was one of a number of critics asked about Bob Dylan's \"Blood on the Tracks.\" Marsh wrote: \"The long songs, particularly, suffer from flat, tangled imagery, and the music, with all its hints at the old glory, is often incompetently performed. I suppose it's all a matter of what you're willing to settle for.\""

At the time, he was the youngest elected statewide constitutional officer in Illinois, since William Stratton was elected Treasurer of Illinois in 1942. Since first entering office in 1999, he was the first Comptroller to establish a \"Rainy Day Fund\" for Illinois as a way to secure funding for the state whenever there is a slowdown in revenue. Hynes also spearheaded bipartisan reform of laws governing the state's private cemeteries and funeral homes in 2001, the most extensive overhaul of these industries in 25 years. Dan Hynes has sponsored new legislation that prohibited tax scofflaws from receiving state contracts. He also introduced legislation in 2003, that would do the same to corporations that have falsified their financial reports. Among his other measures as Comptroller, was to reform the Local Government Division of his office, increasing the percentage of compliance from Illinois's local government units in financial reporting from 65 to 95 percent. Hynes also expanded the office's commercial direct deposit program, encouraging state vendors to receive payments electronically, which saves taxpayer money and improves efficiency. Daniel Hynes was elected to a second term as Comptroller on November 5, 2002, with a margin of more than one million votes. He was elected to a third term in 2006, by a similarly large margin."

According to Billboard, Brown is one of the most influential and successful R&B singers ever, with several considering him the \"King of R&B\" alongside Usher and R. Kelly. His musical style has been defined as polyhedric, with his R&B being characterized by several influences from other genres, mainly hip hop and pop music. His lyrics develop predominantly over themes of sex, lovesickness, regret, romantic love, fast life, desire, and the difficulty of managing emotions. Being described by media outlets and critics as one of the biggest talents of his time in urban music, Brown gained a cult following, and wide comparisons to Michael Jackson for his stage presence as a singer-dancer. Born in Tappahannock, Virginia, he was involved in his church choir and several local talent shows from a young age. Having signed with Jive Records in 2004, Brown released his self-titled debut studio album the following year, which became certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . With his first single \"Run It!\" peaking atop the Billboard Hot 100, Brown became the first male artist since 1995 to have his debut single top the chart. His second album, Exclusive , reached an even bigger commercial success worldwide, also spawning his second Billboard Hot 100 number one \"Kiss Kiss\". In 2009, Brown pled guilty to felony assault of his then girlfriend, singer Rihanna. In the same year of the episode there was the release of his third album Graffiti, which was considered to be a commercial failure compared to his previous works. Following Graffiti, Brown's fourth album F.A.M.E. became one of his biggest successes, being his first to top the Billboard 200, containing internationally successful singles such as \"Yeah 3x\", \"Look at Me Now\" and \"Beautiful People\", also earning him the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album. His fifth album Fortune, released in 2012, also topped the Billboard 200. Following the releases of X and Royalty, his 2017 double-disc album, Heartbreak on a Full Moon, consisting of 45 tracks, was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 units after one week, and in 2019 it has been certified Double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Brown's ninth studio album Indigo was released in 2019, and became his third Billboard 200 number-one album. It included the Drake featured track \"No Guidance\" which peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its chart success was outdone with the single \"Go Crazy\" released the following year, alongside Young Thug as part of their collaborative mixtape Slime & B . The track reached number 3 on the Hot 100. Brown has sold over 193 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. Additionally, he is tied for the most digital single sales among R&B artists in the United States with Bruno Mars. Throughout his career, Brown has won several awards, including a Grammy Award, eighteen BET Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, and thirteen Soul Train Music Awards. According to Billboard, Brown has the seventh most Billboard Hot 100 entries with 106 - which is the most of any R&B artist in history. Brown was also ranked 3rd in the Billboard top R&B/Hip-Hop artists of the decade for the 2010s, behind peers Rihanna and Drake in 2nd and 1st, respectively. Brown has also pursued an acting career. In 2007, he made his on-screen feature film debut in Stomp the Yard, and appeared as a guest on the television series The O.C.

He would listen to soul albums that his parents owned, and eventually began to show interest in the hip-hop scene. Brown taught himself to sing and dance at a young age and often cites Michael Jackson as his inspiration. He began to perform in his church choir and in several local talent shows. When he mimicked an Usher performance of \"My Way\", his mother recognized his vocal talent, and they began to look for the opportunity of a record deal.

Hitmission's Lamont Fleming provided voice coaching for Brown, and the team helped to arrange a demo package, under the name of \"C. Sizzle\", and approached contacts in New York, where Brown started to sojourn, to seek a record deal. Brown attended Essex High School in Virginia until late 2004, when he moved to New York to pursue his music career. Tina Davis, senior A&R executive at Def Jam Recordings, was impressed when Brown auditioned in her New York office, and she immediately took him to meet the former president of the Island Def Jam Music Group, Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, who offered to sign him that day, but Brown refused his proposal. \"I knew that Chris had real talent,\" says Davis. \"I just knew I wanted to be part of it.\" The negotiations with Def Jam continued for two months, and ended when Davis lost her job due to a corporate merger. Brown asked her to be his manager, and once Davis accepted, she promoted the singer to other labels such as Jive Records, J-Records and Warner Bros. Records. According to Mark Pitts, in an interview with HitQuarters, Davis presented Brown with a video recording, and Pitts' reaction was: \"I saw huge potential ... I didn't love all the records, but I loved his voice. It wasn't a problem because I knew that he could sing, and I knew how to make records.\" Brown ultimately chose Jive due to its successful work with then-young acts such as Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. Brown stated, \"I picked Jive because they had the best success with younger artists in the pop market, [...] I knew I was going to capture my African American audience, but Jive had a lot of strength in the pop area as well as longevity in careers.\" Brown said that during his permanence in Harlem, when he was trying to get his music heard by major labels, his artistic intention was to both rap and sing on his records, but Jive convinced him to stick to just singing, because he said that \"it wasn't acceptable yet\" for an R&B singer to also rap on records."

Brown co-wrote half of the tracks. \"I write about the things that 16 year olds go through every day,\" says Brown. \"Like you just got in trouble for sneaking your girl into the house, or you can't drive, so you steal a car or something.\" The whole album took less than eight weeks to produce. Released on November 29, 2005, the self-titled Chris Brown album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first week sales of 154,000 copies.

        "content": "In 2008, Brown began work on his third studio album, to be called Graffiti, promising to experiment with a different musical direction inspired by singers Prince and Michael Jackson. He stated, \"I wanted to change it up and really be different. Like my style nowadays, I don't try to be typical urban. I want to be like how Prince, Michael and Stevie Wonder were. They can cross over to any genre of music.\" Following the domestic violence scandal involving the singer and Rihanna on February 8, 2009, the majority of media took positions against the singer. The incident also caused Brown to lose significant commercial contracts, including one with Doublemint. The singer later participated in numerous television appearances during the year to express himself publicly about it. Graffiti 's lead single \"I Can Transform Ya\" was released on September 29, 2009. The song peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. \"Crawl\" was released as the album's second single on November 23, 2009. The song reached number 53 on the Billboard Hot 100. Graffiti was then released on December 8, 2009, featuring an R&B sound mixed with Eurodisco and rock. Brown, with this album, started to take full control of his art, managing the artistic direction, and writing every song of the album . Brown started to be the only artistic director of all his future projects. He said that his decision to entirely direct and write his albums and songs came from the fact that he wanted to give his \"own perspective of the music [he] wanted to make\" and by his wanting to \"verbalize whatever [he] was going through\". The album, compared to its two precessors, was a commercial and critical failure, debuting at number 7 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 102,000 copies in its first week, and receiving generally negative reviews from critics. As of March 23, 2011, it has sold 341,000 copies in the United States. While performing a Michael Jackson Tribute at the 2010 BET Awards, Brown started to cry and fell to his knees while singing Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\". The performance and his emotional turmoil resonated with several celebrities present at the ceremony, including Trey Songz, Diddy and Taraji P. Henson. Songz said, \"He left his heart on the stage. He gave genuine emotion. I was proud of him and I was happy for him for having that moment\". Michael's brother, Jermaine Jackson, expressed similar sentiments stating, \"it was very emotional for me, because it was an acceptance from his fans from what has happened to him and also paying tribute to my brother\". Later during the award ceremony, Brown stated, \"I let y'all down before, but I won't do it again...I promise\", while accepting the award for the AOL Fandemonium prize. In August 2010, Brown starred alongside an ensemble cast, including Matt Dillon, Paul Walker, Idris Elba, Hayden Christensen and T.I. in the crime thriller Takers, and also served as executive producer of the film. During 2010 Brown released the 3 free mixtapes In My Zone , Fan of a Fan , and In My Zone 2, which featured a new style of writing with grown themes, and a different musical style, mixing R&B with hip hop. For the mixtapes he worked with new producers, most notably Kevin McCall. The mixtapes were highly appreciated by the artist's loyal audience, consolidating it. The single \"Deuces\", extracted from the Fan of a Fan mixtape, obtained critical acclaim, also achieving a good success, peaking at number 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The song was later remixed by the biggest names in the hip-hop scene of that time, including Drake, Kanye West, Andr\u00e9 3000, Rick Ross, Fabolous, and T.I. He later released the solo track \"No BS\" as his second single from Fan of a Fan, and decided to include the two singles from the mixtape as anticipation singles for his next album."

However the project ended up never being released. On March 15, 2018, Brown was featured in Lil Dicky's smash hit single \"Freaky Friday\".

On January 4, 2019, Brown released \"Undecided\", the first single off it, alongside a video for the song. \"Undecided\" saw Brown reunite with producer Scott Storch, who previously worked with Brown in 2005 on his breakout hit \"Run It!\".

Vibe's Iyana Robertson says \"As traditional R&B flourished around him, the young singer began an evolution of the genre\". She saw his debut single \"Run It!\" as a \"prelude to what Brown would continue to do for the next decade: relentlessly disrupt the constructs of rhythm and blues.\" By his second album Exclusive, she says he was \"tapping more electric up-tempos, swimming deep in hip-hop waters and annihilating the pop arena\". Describing the Grammy Award winning F.A.M.E. as \"his most diverse offering to date\", she remarked \"There was no level of musical flexibility comparable. There still isn't.\" F.A.M.E. is considered to be the album that defined Brown's musical style and persona. Brown is considered to be, by a big part of critics and general public, the biggest R&B artist of the 2010s, with Andy Kellman of AllMusic crediting him as the \"spearhead\" of the genre during the period. Brad Wete of Billboard said that his sixth album X showcased \"the height of his musical talents\", while cultural critic and media personality Joe Budden defined his 2017 album Heartbreak on a Full Moon as \"one of the greatest things ever happened to R&B music\"."

The multitude of genres influencing his music can be heard in many of his singles, like \"Deuces\", \"Sweet Love\", \"Liquor\", \"Zero\", \"Back to Love\" or \"Don't Check on Me\". His pure side of R&B is densely shown on every album that he has done, even after that his music started to be more tinged from other genres, with some examples being \"No BS\", \"Don't Judge Me\", \"Back To Sleep\" and \"Privacy\". Throughout his career Brown has always had a strong influence from hip hop in his music, and following his 2010 mixtapes, he approached the genre differently, starting to rap frequently on mixtapes and features, adding to his albums straight hip-hop songs like \"Look at Me Now\", \"Till I Die\" and \"Loyal\", or by doing performances that switch from his R&B singing to his rapping, like he did in several tracks from his album Heartbreak on a Full Moon.  His dance-pop side in the single \"Forever\" off his second album Exclusive opened the door for many other Europop songs like \"Yeah 3x\", \"Beautiful People\", \"Turn Up The Music\" and \"Don't Wake Me Up\", but it begun to be less present in his music starting from his album X."

        "content": "Brown's lyrical production is typically considered to be \"emotional\" or \"hedonistic\". His songs mainly cover themes of sex, lovesickness, regret, romantic love, desire, fast life, and internal conflict, also having some introspections over loneliness and the dark side of fame. Along with his vocal and dancing abilities, his songwriting is considered to be one of the things that distincts him for the better compared to other R&B singers of his time. American media executive and radio personality Ebro Darden stated that Brown is the \"most all-around talented person in R&B. Trey Songz is talented, but he can't dance like Chris Brown. Usher is probably the only one that could come close to him, but he doesn't have the songwriting abilities that Chris Brown has\". Brown said in 2013, during an interview for Rolling Stone, that his songs are always \"derived from personal experiences, my personal life. Then creativity brings my reality to another dimention. That's what my songs are made of. I always like mixing reality with art\"."

        "content": "Brown possesses a light lyric tenor voice, which spans three and a half octaves, rising from the bass F\u266f to its peak at the soprano C\u266f.His vocal ability was first recognized by his mother at a young age, as Brown tells People magazine \"I was 11 and watching Usher perform 'My Way', and I started trying to mimic it. My mom was like, 'You can sing?' And I was like, 'Well, yeah, Mama.'\" subsequently leading to the start of his career. \"Take You Down\" most notably earned him a Grammy award nomination for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2009. His vocal performances are characterized by his harmonization, timbre, vocal runs and soulfulness. While his voice on his first two albums, Chris Brown and Exclusive, was considered to be \"honeyed\", due to his young age, with subsequent projects like Graffiti and F.A.M.E. it was noted for maturing to a \"more mature, distinctive and melodious voice\", with Brown \"coming into his own as a singer\". On F.A.M.E. critics noted huge flexibility in his voice, with Steve Jones of USA Today praising the singer's ability to \"give top notch vocal performances in R&B, Europop, rap, rock and acoustic records\". X and Indigo were noted for displaying his timbre, exemplifying his singing performances. His harmonizing was found by Andrew Unterberger of Billboard to be notably shown on his songs \"Liquor\" and \"Go Crazy\". On \"Another Round\", \"Don't Judge Me\" and \"It Won't Stop\" he did what was considered by Lee Hildebrand of San Francisco Chronicle to be \"some of the most soothing and smooth singing of his discography\". Jake Indiana of Highsnobiety said that his feature on Kanye West's song \"Waves\" is one of his best vocal performances, and that it \"sounds like ascending to heaven with a choir of angels at your back\". The singer was particularly noted for his emotional singing that illustrated his vocal range on songs like \"Covered In You\", \"Lost & Found\", \"No Guidance\" and \"Red\". On tracks like \"Look at Me Now\", \"No Romeo No Juliet\" and \"Stranger Things\" he displayed his ability of fast-rapping."

According to Brown, he taught himself how to dance by imitating Jackson's moves since childhood, then developing his own distinct style throughout his career. Most of his music videos feature complex choreographies, including the \"futuristic\" \"Turn Up the Music\", the Jackson-inspired choreography of \"Fine China\", \"Zero\", where he displayed different dancing styles, including popping and his signature spin move, \"Party\", where he showcased his remarked footwork, and \"Heat\", described by The Source as a \"silky smooth choreography that shows Brown's unmatchable dancing talent in the classiest way\". Some of his most notable dancing live performances include his \"Thriller\" recreation at the 2006 World Music Awards, his medley at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed a choreography that included flying parts, and his 2015 freestyled dancing over Future's \"March Madness\" at the Vestival The Hague Malieveld, that included a highly acclaimed front-flip, done with no hands by standing still, landed perfectly on beat. In films such as Stomp the Yard and Battle of the Year, Brown displayed his ability to breakdance while in-character."

Brown has produced street art under the pseudonym Konfused, partnering with street artist Kai to produce works for the Miami Basel. The singer painted the buildings of different radio stations such as Hot 97. In 2015 he worked on some of the walls of The Grammy Museum, mixing his spray paint drawings with images of James Brown, Prince, Michael Jackson and himself. Brown has made graffiti works for different cities worldwide, including Los Angeles, London and Amsterdam. His painting and dancing skills were shown at the same time when Brown, partnering with Spotify's Rap Caviar, painted Heartbreak on a Full Moon 's album cover, mostly from dancing around the canvas. In 2020 he painted a mural in memory of Kobe Bryant, doing a portray that includes Kobe's face, a mamba, and a few pictures of Kobe dribbling and dunking a basketball."

His emotional state following the happening was theme of a big part of his album Graffiti. In 2011, Brown began dating Karrueche Tran, that at the time was a personal shopper. In October 2012, Brown announced that he ended his relationship with Tran because he did not \"want to see her hurt over my friendship with Rihanna.\" The day after the announcement, Brown released a video entitled \"The Real Chris Brown\", which features images of himself, Tran, and Rihanna, as Brown wonders, \"Is there such thing as loving two people? I don't know if it's possible, but I feel like that.\" In January 2013, Rihanna confirmed that she and Brown had resumed their romantic relationship, stating, \"It's different now. We don't have those types of arguments anymore. We talk about shit. We value each other. We know exactly what we have now, and we don't want to lose that.\" Speaking of Brown, Rihanna also said, \"He's not the monster everybody thinks. He's a good person. He has a fantastic heart. He's giving and loving. And he's fun to be around. That's what I love about him \u2013 he always makes me laugh. All I want to do is laugh, really \u2013 and I do that with him\". In a May 2013 interview, Brown stated that he and Rihanna had broken up again. He subsequently reunited with Tran, but they parted ways following confirmation of Brown's daughter Royalty with Nia Guzman in 2015. His breakup with Tran inspired several songs off his albums Royalty and Heartbreak on a Full Moon. In 2017, Tran received a 5-year restraining order against Brown after testifying under oath that, during their relationship, in two episodes he was physically abusive, and that he threatened her after they broke up. On November 20, 2019, Brown welcomed his second child, son Aeko Catori Brown, with Ammika Harris ."

Speaking about prayers he said \"I pray everyday, I think we pray unconsciously too. Personally I don't pray for success. I pray for knowledge for understanding and peace of mind. I really try to pray for that because it's a big world, and you can get wrapped up in it trying to please every city. So I just try to get a peace of mind and me understanding that being at peace with my flaws and my talents. I'm cool with that. That's why I think once He shows me certain things, or even the choices that I make, and decisions that I make that are healthy for me. He shows me the right path.

        "content": "At around 12:30\u00a0a.m. on February 8, 2009, Brown and his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna, had an argument which escalated into physical violence, leaving Rihanna with visible facial injuries which required hospitalization. Brown turned himself in to the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire station at 6:30\u00a0p.m. and was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats. The police report did not name the female in the incident as is policy, but media sources soon revealed that the victim was Rihanna. Following Brown's arrest, several commercial ads and some TV shows featuring him were suspended, his music was withdrawn from multiple radio stations, and he withdrew from public appearances, including one at the 2009 Grammy Awards, where he was replaced by Justin Timberlake and Al Green. Brown hired a crisis management team and released a statement saying, \"Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired.\" On March 5, 2009, Brown was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats. He was arraigned on April 6, 2009, and pleaded not guilty to one count of assault and one count of making criminal threats. On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years of probation, and domestic violence counseling. On July 20, 2009, Brown released a two-minute video on his official YouTube page apologizing to fans and Rihanna for the assault, expressing the incident as his \"deepest regret\" and saying that he has repeatedly apologized to Rihanna and \"accepts full responsibility\". In the video, Brown said he wanted to speak out earlier about the case but was advised by his attorney not to until the legal ramifications were settled. The video was removed, but is still available online. On August 25, Brown received five years of probation. He was ordered to attend one year of domestic violence counseling and undergo six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which required him to remain 50 yards away from Rihanna, reduced to 10 yards at public events. Andy Kellman of AllMusic stated, \"A fairly substantial backlash resulted in Brown's songs being pulled from rotation on several radio stations. Ultimately, however, it had little bearing on the progress of his music and acting careers.\" On September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a pre-recorded Larry King Live interview, his first public interview about the matter. He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\" Brown's mother said Brown \"has never, ever been a violent person, ever\" and that she does not believe in the cycle of violence. Brown said that it is \"tough\" for him to look at the famous photograph released of Rihanna's battered face, which may be the one image to haunt and define him forever, and that he still loved her. \"I'm pretty sure we can always be friends,\" said Brown, \"and I don't know about our relationship, but I just know definitely that we ended as friends.\" He stated he did not feel that his career was over, and likened his relationship with Rihanna to Romeo and Juliet, blaming the media attention in the aftermath of the assault for driving them apart. In June 2010, Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was rejected on the grounds of him \"being guilty of a serious criminal offence\" due to his assault on Rihanna. Brown had been planning to do a tour of British cities as part of a European tour but Sony stated that due to \"issues surrounding his work visa\" the tour was to be postponed. In February 2011, at the request of Brown's lawyer, Judge Patricia Schnegg modified with Rihanna's agreement the restraining order to a \"level one order,\" allowing both singers to appear at awards shows together in the future. The following month, on March 22, 2011, during an interview with Robin Roberts on Good Morning America at the Times Square Studios, where he was asked about the Rihanna situation and restraining order, Brown started crying and became violent in his dressing room during a commercial break before his second performance ending that day's program, and punched a window overlooking Times Square, causing damage to it. He then took off his shirt, and after several angry confrontations with the segment producer, other show staff and building security, left the building shirtless. Following the incident, he apologized and said that he was very tired of people bringing up the incident. On July 11, 2012, Brown's community service was evaluated and he was ordered to meet a judge. The evaluation was ordered by Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg on July 10, 2012. He was scheduled to appear in court with regard to the evaluation on August 21, 2012. While conducting his community service in Virginia, however, Brown was tested positive for cannabis and appeared in court on September 25, 2012, at which time his hearing date was changed to November, to determine whether or not he had violated the terms of his court order. He reappeared in court on November 1, 2012, he attempted to address the court and was told by his lawyer, Mark Geragos, \"I don't dance; you don't talk.\" On March 20, 2015, Brown's probation ended, formally closing the felony case emanating from the Rihanna assault which happened over six years prior. In a 2017 self-documentary, Welcome to My Life, Brown goes into detail about the abusive relationship, saying he intended to marry Rihanna, but that he lost her trust after finding out that he lied about a sexual encounter with someone who worked with him, that happened prior to their relationship. He also talked about how they already had lighter episodes where they put their hands against each other during their relationship, and he gave a detailed description on how the known fight went down."

        "content": "On June 14, 2012, Drake and his entourage were involved in a scuffle with Brown at a nightclub called WIP in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. About eight people were injured during the brawl, including San Antonio Spurs star Tony Parker, who had to have surgery to remove a piece of glass from his eye. Drake was not arrested. Brown's attorney alleged Drake was the instigator. Brown himself tweeted about the incident and publicly criticized Drake weeks later. In January 2013, Brown was involved in an altercation with Frank Ocean over a parking space, outside a recording studio in West Hollywood. Police officers in Los Angeles said that Brown was under investigation, describing the incident as \"battery\" due to Brown allegedly punching Ocean. Although Ocean alleged that Brown had threatened to shoot him, he said he would not press charges. In July 2013, Brown's probation was revoked after he was involved in an alleged hit-and-run in Los Angeles. He was released from court and was scheduled to reappear in August 2013, to learn whether or not he would serve time in prison. The charges would later be dropped, but Brown would have 1,000 additional hours of community service added to his probation terms. In October 2013, Brown was arrested for felony assault in Washington, D.C., after refusing to take a picture with a man. The charge was reduced to a misdemeanor. Brown spent 36 hours in a Washington jail and was taken to court in shackles. He was released and ordered to report to his California probation officer within 48 hours. The probation officer prepared a report for the Los Angeles judge, who could have ordered him to complete as many as four years in prison for the beating of Rihanna if found to be in violation of his probation. On October 30, 2013, Brown voluntarily decided to enter rehab. After Brown completed his 90 days, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until a hearing on April 23, 2014. The deal was if Brown left rehab, he would go directly to jail. On March 14, 2014, Brown was kicked out of the rehab facility and sent to Northern Neck Regional Jail for violating internal rules. He was expected to be released on April 23, 2014, but a judge denied his release request from custody either on bail or his own recognizance. At his May 9, 2014, court date, Brown was ordered to serve 131 days in jail for his probation violation. He was sentenced to serve 365 days in custody; however, he was given credit for the 234 days he has already spent in rehab and jail. He was given early release from jail just after midnight on June 2, 2014, because of jail overcrowding calculations that count one day in custody as two days. During Brown's rehab, a probation officer noted in a letter that Brown's brushes with the law may have been caused by untreated bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, specifically that \"Mr. Brown became aggressive and acted out physically due to his untreated mental health disorder, severe sleep deprivation, inappropriate self-medicating and untreated PTSD\". According to the court documents, which were received by E! News and later The Hollywood Reporter, Brown was formally diagnosed with both Bipolar II and PTSD at the unnamed rehab facility. In the early hours of August 30, 2016, a woman called the police to report that Brown had threatened her with a gun inside his house. Due to his previous felony assault conviction, Brown is prohibited to possess any firearms. Police were called, but Brown denied them entry without a warrant.  When they returned with one, Brown refused them entry and began what news sources referred to as a \"standoff\" with the LAPD, including the robbery-homicide division and SWAT team. During this time, Brown was seen posting videos on Instagram, in which he rails against the police and the media coverage of the activity at his house. He denounced media reports that he was \"barricaded\" inside his house, complained about the helicopters flying overhead, and called the police \"idiots\" and \"the worst gang in the world.\" He said that he was innocent and \"What I do care about is you are defacing  my name and my character and integrity\". Brown was arrested and later released from jail on $250,000 bail. On September 1, 2016, Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, stated that there was no standoff and that, with regard to the LAPD search, \"nothing was found to corroborate her statement.\" In September, Japan denied Brown entry due to the allegations. Charges were later dropped after prosecutors declined to arraign Brown on the felony charges. Brown later sued the accuser for defamation, prevailing in the lawsuit, after an investigation that proved that the defendant brought to court false and defamatory statements about the singer, through her incriminating text messages where she said \"don't you know this freak Chris Brown is kicking me out of his house because I called his friend jewelry fake can you come get me my Uber is messing up if not I'm going to set him up and call the cops and say that he tried to shoot me and that will teach him a lesson I'm going to set his a** up.\",. Brown later said through his social media accounts \"Because of my past, my character keeps on being defaced by these fake news and allegations highlighted by the media, but I'm glad that all my real supporters know who i really am and can see the truth\" Brown was arrested after his concert during July 6, 2018, night on a felony battery charge stemming from an incident that occurred more than a year before. The battery charge was connected to an April 2017 incident in a Tampa club, where Brown allegedly punched a man who photographed him without his permission. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office said Brown was released after about an hour, after that he posted $2,000 bond. In 2021, Brown was sued by his housekeeper over a 2020 attack by one of his dogs, a Caucasian Ovcharka. , due to his criminal record, Brown is banned from entering Australia and New Zealand. Previously, other countries that banned the singer because of his criminal record were Canada and United Kingdom, and they revoked their ban respectively in 2019 and 2020. In January 2022, an anonymous woman filed a civil suit accusing Brown of raping her on a yacht in Miami in December 2020. Court documents revealed that she was not pursuing a criminal case and remained in contact with Brown after the alleged incident took place - visiting his home on two separate occasions in California in January and August 2021 to listen to him record music. The woman is suing Brown for $20 million. Brown has denied the allegation."

        "title": "Pieter van Laer_Life",
        "content": "Pieter van Laer was born in Haarlem as the second child of Jacob Claesz. Boddingh of Haarlem and Magdalena Heyns of Antwerp. He adopted the surname van Laer only later in life.  This surname was probably taken from his brother's godfather. He came from a well to do family and his parents operated a private school in Haarlem started by Magdalena's father, the well-known writer and publisher Peeter Heyns, after whom Pieter van Laer was named. His older brother was Roedolff van Laer, who also became a painter and was known as Roeland van Laer and Orlando van Laer. His youngest brother Nicolaes Bodding became known later in life as Nicolaes Boddingius and was a prominent schoolmaster and minister.  He also had two sisters called Barbara and Anthoynetta Pieter van Laer was possibly a pupil of Esaias van de Velde in Haarlem. His early work shows the influence of this painter as is evidenced by a drawing signed Pieter Bodink , which is close to van de Velde's style. He traveled to Rome in 1625 via France, likely in the company of his brother Roeland.  In 1626 their father is also recorded in Rome as a witness to a will. Here he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mostly Flemish and Dutch artists in Rome who were known for their initiation rituals, which involved a lot of drinking.  Pieter van Laer's nickname in Italy was Il Bamboccio, which means \"ugly doll\" or \"puppet\". This was an allusion to van Laer's ungainly appearance, as he is said to have had unusually long legs, short chest and almost no neck.  Pieter van Laer was also known for his pointed moustache.  Van Laer shared a home in the Via Margutta with Giovanni di Filippo del Campo, whose pupil he is said to have been according to certain art historians. However, such apprenticeship is unlikely since the two artists had approximately the same age.  He was also a close friend of Joachim von Sandrart in Rome. Through the works he created in Rome Pieter van Laer initiated a new style of genre painting.  Paintings in this new style were named Bambocciate after his nickname.  He became the inspiration and focal point around which likeminded artists congregated during his stay in Italy. The initial Bamboccianti included Jan Miel, Andries and Jan Both, Karel Dujardin, Johannes Lingelbach and the Italian Michelangelo Cerquozzi.  The Frenchman S\u00e9bastien Bourdon was also associated with this group during his early career. Other Bamboccianti include Michiel Sweerts, Thomas Wijck, Dirck Helmbreker, Jan Asselyn, Anton Goubau, Willem Reuter, Jacob van Staverden and Johan Filip Lemke. Pieter van Laer had a successful career in Rome.  He returned to the Netherlands c. 1639.  Here he lived chiefly in Amsterdam and later in Haarlem with his younger brother Nicolaes.  The date, place and cause of van Laer's death are unknown.  It must have occurred after 1641 when he is known to have made a drawing in a Haarlem song book. It is believed he travelled back to Italy around that time.  According to a statement in the testament of his sister made in 1654 there had not been any signs of life from Pieter van Laer in the previous 12 years.  The Italian biographer Giovanni Battista Passeri stated that van Laer died in the fall of 1642.  The Dutch biographer Arnold Houbraken reported that van Laer became depressed at the end of his life and committed suicide by drowning."

        "content": "Pieter van Laer is mainly known for his genre scenes set in Italianate landscapes as well as for his landscapes and animal scenes.  He also painted some battle scenes.  He further engraved a number of plates of animals.  He was one of the first artists to develop the painting of cattle as a specialist genre.  He left one painting with a religious theme, the Annunciation to the shepherds .  This composition is also van Laer's earliest surviving cattle painting.   His paintings were typically of a small format. The influence of a long stay in Rome is seen in his treatment of landscape and backgrounds. One of his important contributions is the introduction to Roman painting of new subjects derived from Flemish and Dutch genre paintings including according to a contemporary source, \"rogues, cheats, pickpockets, bands of drunks and gluttons, scabby tobacconists, barbers, and other 'sordid' subjects.\" His subjects also included blacksmiths shoeing horses in grottoes, travelers in front of inns, brigands attacking travelers, military actions, idlers around Roman lime-kilns, markets, feasts and scenes with hunters.  He further depicted people playing popular games of chance such as morra as well as excretory functions. Several of his compositions deal with lively scenes from peasant life.  His pictures are marked by skillful composition and good drawing. He was especially careful in perspective. Despite their lowly subject matter, van Laer's works themselves sold for high prices and were held in some of the most prestigious collections of his time. The traditional art historical view was that the Bamboccianti style practised by Pieter van Laer offered a realist \"true portrait of Rome and its popular life without variation or alteration\" of what the artist sees. However, their contemporaries did not generally regard the Bamboccianti as realists.  An alternative view of the art of the Bamboccianti is that their works constitute complex allegories that provide a commentary on classical art with a view to bringing the observer to contemplate elevated ideas. They thus stand in a long tradition of paradox in which low or vulgar subjects were the vehicle for conveying important philosophical meanings. While his style of painting was openly disdained by pre-eminent Italian painters in Rome and Bologna, such as Sacchi, Albani, and Reni, this did not translate into a poverty of commissions. In fact, van Laer paintings over time became highly sought after. Initially, the painter must have depended on an open market and dealers, rather than commissions for sales. However, within a decade of work in Rome, he could ask a very respectable price for his paintings. Among those owning his work were Pietro Testa, Cassiano dal Pozzo, the marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, and later, the Flemish merchant in Naples Gaspar Roomer. Pieter van Laer was an accomplished printmaker and he produced two series of prints of animals. One series of 8 plates of domestic animals published in 1636 in Rome under the title Various animals was dedicated to Don Ferdinando Afan de Ribera, the Spanish Viceroy in Naples. This series of engravings had an important influence on the Dutch animal painter Paulus Potter, in particular the way in which van Laer was able to place figures, animals, buildings and trees in a coherent pictorial space.  A second set of 6 plates was entitled Horses and depicts the bleak lot of horses belonging to poor peasants."

        "content": "He was educated at St Anthony's College, Leuven, and returning to Ireland became a priest at Wexford. In 1641, war broke out in Ireland after a Rebellion of Irish Catholics in October of that year. French, along with several other Catholic clerics and gentry, helped to organise the rebels into a more cohesive political movement, the Confederate Catholics of Ireland in March 1642, with the intention of attaining freedom of religion and legal equality for Catholics and self-government for Ireland. The Confederates established their capital at Kilkenny and with the collapse of Royal authority as a result of Civil War became the de facto government of Ireland between 1642 and 1649. In 1646 French was appointed bishop of Ferns. In the same year, he helped the Papal Nuncio Giovanni Battista Rinuccini to bring down a peace agreement signed by the Confederate Supreme Council with the English Royalists and Charles I that fell short of the original Confederate demands. French and a lawyer named Nicholas Plunkett then assumed control of the Supreme Council and tried to promote a better peace treaty with the Royalists at the same time as a more vigorous prosecution of the war in Ireland. A new Treaty was signed with the Royalists in 1648 and French was prominent in trying to secure the widest possible support within the Confederation for it. However, the most hardline Catholic elements remained hostile to it. In any event, the Royalist/Confederate alliance lasted little more than a year -as they were crushed by an English Parliamentarian conquest of Ireland which began in 1649. The Parliamentarians were extremely hostile to Catholic clergy, executing them when they apprehended them, and French deemed it prudent to leave Ireland in 1651, and the remainder of his life was passed on the continent of Europe. He acted as coadjutor to the archbishops of Santiago de Compostella and Paris, and to the bishop of Ghent, and died at Ghent on 23 August 1678. French, along with many Irish Catholics, was very disappointed with the treatment Irish Catholics received when the English monarchy was restored in 1660. Only a \"favoured minority\" of Irish Catholic Royalists were returned the land confiscated from them by the Parliamentarians under the Act of Settlement 1662 and the public practice of Catholicism remained illegal. In 1676 French published his attack on James Butler, marquess of Ormonde , entitled \"The Unkinde Desertor of Loyall Men and True Friends,\" and shortly afterward \"The Bleeding Iphigenia.\" The most important of his other pamphlets is the \"Narrative of the Settlement and Sale of Ireland\" . The Historical Works of Bishop French, comprising the three pamphlets already mentioned and some letters, were published by SH Bindon at Dublin in 1846."

He was the first member of a Dravidian party to hold either post. He was well known for his oratorical skills and was an acclaimed writer in the Tamil language. He scripted and acted in several plays. Some of his plays were later made into movies. He was the first politician from the Dravidian parties to use Tamil cinema extensively for political propaganda. Born in a middle-class family, he first worked as a school teacher, then moved into the political scene of the Madras Presidency as a journalist. He edited several political journals and enrolled as a member of the Dravidar Kazhagam. As an ardent follower of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, he rose in stature as a prominent member of the party. Due to differences looming with Periyar, on issues of separate independent state of Dravida Nadu and union with India, he crossed swords with his political mentor. The friction between the two finally erupted when Periyar married Maniammai, who was much younger than him. Angered by this action of Periyar, Annadurai with his supporters parted from Dravidar Kazhagam and launched his own party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam . The DMK initially followed the same ideologies as its parent, Dravidar Kazhagam. But with the evolution of national politics and the constitution of India after the Sino-Indian war in 1962, Annadurai dropped the claim for an independent Dravida Nadu. Various protests against the ruling Congress government took him to prison on several occasions; the last of which was during the Madras anti-Hindi agitation of 1965. The agitation itself helped Annadurai to gain popular support for his party. His party won a landslide victory in the 1967 state elections. His cabinet was the youngest at that time in India. He legalised Self-Respect marriages, enforced a two language policy , implemented subsidies for rice, and renamed Madras State to Tamil Nadu. However, he died of cancer just two years into office. His funeral had the highest attendance of any to that date. Several institutions and organisations are named after him. A splinter party launched by M. G. Ramachandran in 1972 was named after him as All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam."

His father Natarajan Mudaliar was a weaver and his mother was Bangaru Ammal. He was raised by her sister Rajamani Ammal. At the age of 21, he married Rani while he was still a student. The couple had no children of their own, so they later adopted and raised Rajamani's grandchildren. He attended Pachaiyappa's High School, but left school to work as a clerk in the town's Municipal office to assist with the family finances. In 1934, he graduated with a B.A. degree from Pachaiyappa's College in Chennai. He then earned an MA degree in Economics and Politics from the same college. He worked as an English teacher in Pachaiyappa High School.

Though secular to the core, he later described himself as a Hindu sans the sacred ash, a Christian minus the holy cross, and a Muslim without the prayer cap. Annadurai would attack superstitions and religious exploitation but would never fight against the spiritual values of society. He once explained his stance towards God and religion as \"I do not break coconuts for Pillaiyar, neither do I break his idols.\" Entry into politics Annadurai's interest in politics made him join the Justice party in 1935. The Justice party was formed by non-Brahmin elites in 1917. The Justice party originated with the Madras United League which was initially started as a work group that helped non-Brahmin students in Madras with accommodation and later grew into a political party under the efforts of leaders like C. Natesa Mudaliar, Sir Pitti Theagaroya Chetty and Dr. T. M. Nair. The party was named South Indian Liberal Federation \u2013 popularly known as Justice party. The party had been in power in Madras Presidency since self-governance was introduced in 1920, until it was defeated by the Indian National Congress in 1937. By the time Annadurai joined the Justice party, Periyar E. V. Ramasami was the party president. Annadurai served as the sub-editor of the Justice magazine. He later became the editor for Viduthalai and was also associated with the Tamil weekly paper, Kudi Arasu. He started his own journal Dravida Nadu .  In 1944, Periyar renamed the Justice party to Dravidar Kazhagam and gave up contesting in the elections."

        "content": "The Indian National Congress, which had been fighting for the independence of India from colonial British rule, was dominated by Brahmins. Periyar assumed that independent India would bring South Indians, especially Tamils, under the dominance of Brahmins and North Indians. For these reasons Periyar called for 15 August 1947, the day of Indian independence, to be a day of mourning. Annadurai opposed this move and the schism between his supporters and Periyar widened. He saw the gaining of independence as an overall achievement of India rather than solely that of Aryan North. Moreover, Periyar's decision on giving up participating in democratic elections was also opposed by Annadurai, in reaction to which he walked out of a party meeting in 1948. Periyar considered that candidates in elections must compromise their ideologies. Moreover, it was Periyar's idea that social reformation can be better achieved outside politics, through education and canvassing the masses, rather than governments. Eventually, when Periyar married Maniammai, who was 40 years younger than he, the personal differences between Annadurai and Periyar split their supporters. Annadurai launched his own party with his party fragment, along with E. V. K. Sampath . The new party was named Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. DMK's presence was initially restricted to urban centres and its surrounding areas. But by appealing to the urban lower, lower middle and working classes, students, Dalits and lower castes, Annadurai was able to accelerate its growth and spread. He fought for the social justice of the lower castes and thus rapidly gained popular support."

The claim for such an independent state stayed alive in the initial days of DMK. E. V. K. Sampath, who had earlier forfeited his inheritance from Periyar to join DMK, saw the call for Dravida Nadu as an unrealistic goal. Responding to Sampath's concern, Annadurai said Sampath's opposition to using film stars made him cross swords with many other members of the party. Eventually, with looming differences with Annadurai and other leaders on Dravida Nadu, Sampath left the DMK and formed his own party, the Tamil Nationalist Party, in 1961. In 1962, Annadurai said in the Rajya Sabha that Dravidians want the right of self-determination ... We want a separate country for southern India. However, the reorganisation of states in India on linguistic basis removed Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam speaking regions from the Madras Presidency leaving behind a predominantly Tamil Madras State. Giving in to realities, Annadurai and his DMK changed the call of independent Dravida Nadu for Dravidians to independent Tamil Nadu for Tamils. Annadurai felt that remaining in the Indian Union meant accepting linguistic domination and economic backwardness. Nevertheless, the Sino-Indian war brought about changes in the Indian constitution. The Sixteenth Amendment banned any party with sectarian principles from participating in elections. When this amendment was presented in the Parliament of India, Annadurai was one of its members. He vehemently debated against the amendment, but eventually could not stop it from being passed. Faced with the new constitutional changes, Annadurai and his DMK left the call for an independent Tamil homeland on the back burner. From then on Annadurai and his DMK aimed at achieving better co-operation between the southern states and claimed more autonomy for Tamil Nadu."

        "content": "When India became a republic with its own constitution in 1950, the constitution had given special status to the Hindi language, which was to gain official status after 15 years in 1965. This move was regarded with anxiety by students in Tamil Nadu. Speaking of making Hindi as official language of India, Annadurai said It is claimed that Hindi should be the common language because it is spoken by the majority. Why should we then claim the tiger as our national animal instead of the rat which is so much more numerous? Or the peacock as our national bird when the crow is ubiquitous?. In view of continued threat to impose Hindi, the DMK held an open-air conference against Hindi imposition at Kodambakkam, Chennai in August 1960, which Annadurai presided over. He gave black flags to leading functionaries, to be shown to the President of India during his visit to the state. Sensing an uprising, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru assured in the Parliament that English would continue to be the official language of India, as long as non-Hindi speaking people desire. DMK gave up the plan of showing black flags and Annadurai appealed to the Union Government to bring about a constitutional amendment incorporating the assurance. With no constitutional amendment done, Annadurai declared 26 January 1965, the 15th Republic Day of India and also the day the Constitution, which in essence enshrined Hindi as the official language of India, came into practice, as a day of mourning. This move was opposed by the then Chief Minister of Madras State, Bhakthavatchalam, as blasphemous. Hence Annadurai, who by then had been trying to shake off the secessionist image of his party, declared 24 January as a day of mourning. He also replaced the slogan of the protests to Down with Hindi; Long live the Republic. Nevertheless, violence broke out on 26 January, initially in Madurai which within days spread throughout the state. Robert Hardgrave Jr, professor of humanities, government and Asian studies, suggests that the elements contributing to the riots were not instigated by DMK or Leftists or even the industrialists, as the Congress government of the state suggested, but were genuine frustrations and discontentment which lay beneath the surface of the people of the state. With violence surging, Annadurai asked the students to forfeit the protests, but some DMK leaders like Karunanidhi kept the agitations going. Nevertheless, Annadurai was arrested for instigating the agitation. Although the violence were not directly instigated by the DMK, the agitation itself aided DMK to win the 1967 elections and Annadurai became the new Chief Minister of Madras State."

He developed a style in Tamil public speaking using metaphors and pleasing alliterations, both in spoken and written language. Anna was also best known for his extempore speaking ability being very well affluent on rhetoric skills. He has published several novels, short stories and plays which incorporate political themes. He himself acted in some of his plays during his time in the Dravidar Kazhagam. He introduced movie media as a major organ for propaganda of Dravidian politics. In total Annadurai scripted six screen plays. His first movie Nallathambi which starred N. S. Krishnan promoted cooperative farming and abolition of zamindari system. His novels such as Velaikaari and Or Iravu, which were later made into movies, carried the hallmarks of propaganda for Dravidian politics. On Velaikari, Annadurai said that the movie Velaikari made direct references against the suppressive landlords who were traditionally allied with Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi. His movies had some elements of Dravidian political ideologies like anti-Brahminism and messages differing against Congress with detailed reasons and scenarios behind. Popular stage and cine actors who stood by Anna in early years were D. V. Narayanasamy, K. R. Ramasamy, N. S. Krishnan, S. S. Rajendran, Sivaji Ganesan and M. G. Ramachandran. Some of his books had a social approach and its content were debatable, such as \"Arya Mayai\" in which he highlighted the view point of bringing an equal living society regardless of any caste dominance and especially drawing similarities which existed by then of the upper-caste Brahmin people. He was fined INR 700 for sedition and was also sent to prison. Some of his well-known works are his books Annavin Sattasabai Sorpolivukal , Ilatchiya varalaru , Valkkaip puyal and Rankon rata . His work Kambarasam criticises Ramayana of Kamban. His works of fiction such as Kapothipura kathal , Parvathy B.A., Kalinga rani and Pavayin payanam carried elements of political propaganda. At times when Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam was extensively using movies for its propaganda, censorship crippled the process. To evade censorships, DMK movies used Annadurai's popular nickname Anna, which also means elder brother in Tamil, as a pun. When praises were bestowed on the Anna on screen, the crowd would break into applause. Kannadasan has criticised Anna's works that apart from Sivaji Kanda Hindu Rajyam and Needhi Devan Mayakkam, the rest lacked even a plot"

        "content": "In 1967, the Congress lost nine states to opposition parties, but it was only in Madras state that a single non-Congress party majority was achieved. The electoral victory of 1967 is also reputed to an electoral fusion among the non-Congress parties to avoid a split in the Opposition votes. Rajagopalachari, a former senior leader of the Congress party, had by then left the Congress and launched the right-wing Swatantra Party. He played a vital role in bringing about the electoral fusion amongst the opposition parties to align against the Congress. At that time, his cabinet was the youngest in the country. Annadurai legalised Self-respect marriages for the first time in the country. Such marriages were void of priests to preside over the ceremony and thus did not need a Brahmin to carry out the wedding. Self-respect marriages were a brainchild of Periyar, who regarded the then conventional marriages as mere financial arrangements which often caused great debt through dowry. Self-Respect marriages, according to him, encouraged inter-caste marriages and caused arranged marriages to be replaced by love marriages. Annadurai was also the first to use subsidising of the price of rice for election victory. He promised one rupee a measure of rice, which he initially implemented once in government, but had to withdraw later. Subsidising rice costs are still used as an election promise in Tamil Nadu. It was Annadurai's government that renamed the Madras State to its present-day form declaring officially as Tamil Nadu. The name change itself was first presented in the upper house of the Parliament of India by Bhupesh Gupta, a communist MP from West Bengal, but was then defeated. With Annadurai as chief minister, the state assembly succeeded in passing the bill renaming the states. Anna was instrumental in organising the World Tamil Conference under the aegies of UNESCO in 1967. Another major achievement of Annadurai's government was to introduce a two language policy over the then popular three language formula. The three language formula, which was implemented in the neighbouring states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, entitled students to study three languages: the regional language, English and Hindi. It was during the period of his Chief Ministership that the Second World Conference was conducted on a grand scale on 3 January 1968. Nevertheless, when a commemorative stamp was released to mark the Tamil conference, Annadurai expressed his dissatisfaction that the stamp contained Hindi when it was for Tamil. Annadurai also issued an order for the removal of the pictures of gods and religious symbols from public offices and buildings. He proceeded on a world tour as an invitee of the Yale University's Chubb Fellowship Programme and was also a guest of the State Department in the US in April\u2013May 1968. He was awarded the Chubb Fellowship at Yale University, being the first non-American to receive this honour. The same year he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Annamalai University."

        "content": "Scholes wrote over 30 books, mainly concerning music appreciation. His best-known work is The Oxford Companion to Music, which was first published in 1938.  Like Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians the Companion sought to reach out beyond professional musicians to the amateur as well. This work took him six years to produce and consisted of over a million words . Scholes was assisted by various clerical assistants, but wrote virtually all the text himself. The only exceptions were the article on tonic sol-fa and the synopses of the plots of operas . Although the Oxford Companion to Music was regarded as authoritative, the text of the first edition is enlivened by Scholes' own anecdotal and sometimes quirky style. He was also the author of Puritans and Music in England and New England: A Contribution to the Cultural History of Two Nations  .  In 1947 he produced the two volume, 960 page The Mirror of Music, compiling, enlarging and commenting on material published in The Musical Times between 1844 and 1944. Scholes was deeply concerned with connecting music with a wider audience through musical appreciation in the tradition of Dr Burney, an influence he cited himself and the subject of his biography in 1948. Frank Howes called The Listener's Guide to Music \"that masterpiece of simplification\". He recognised very early the possibilities of the gramophone as an aid to knowledge and understanding of music. His First Book of the Gramophone Record lists fifty records of music from the sixteenth to the twentieth century, with a commentary on each; a Second Book followed in 1925. From 1930 onwards, Scholes collaborated with the Columbia Graphophone Company in The Columbia History of Music by Ear and Eye; this comprised five volumes, each containing an explanatory booklet and eight 78rpm records specially made for the series, including Renaissance vocal and instrumental items performed by Arnold Dolmetsch and his family."

        "content": "\"Nothing he put out was ever \"ghosted\"; all bore the individual stamp of the salty P.A.S style.\" wrote W.R Anderson in 1958. In his writing for this work, and elsewhere, Scholes never believed in holding back his personal views in favour of a neutral point of view. He is credited  with the description of harpsichord music as sounding like \"a toasting fork on a birdcage\"; when describing Handel and Bach, he said that \"Handel was the more elegant composer, but Bach was the more thorough\". Scholes led the public denunciations of Arthur Eaglefield Hull when it was found that his book Music: Classical, Romantic and Modern was found to have borrowed material from other writers. How much of this was plagiarism and how much a mere careless, hasty failure to cite sources is not known, but the scandal left Hull very upset. He took his own life by throwing himself under a train at Huddersfield station on 4 November, 1928. Reviews of Christian Darnton's You and Music were generally positive until Scholes catalogued so many serious and obvious errors that he presented the work as an elaborate joke to trap unwary reviewers. In The Oxford Companion to Music some composers were described in somewhat unsympathetic and dismissive terms. His article on Jazz states that \"jazz is to serious music as daily journalism is to serious writing\"; similarly, his article on the composer John Henry Maunder states that Maunder's \"seemingly inexhaustible cantatas, Penitence, Pardon and Peace and From Olivet to Calvary, long enjoyed popularity, and still aid the devotions of undemanding congregations in less sophisticated areas.\""

Shortly before his death, his \"professional\" library was acquired by the National Library of Canada. This comprised approximately 50 linear metres of research files and correspondence. His former assistant John Owen Ward revised the Tenth Edition of the Companion in 1970. Ward considered it \"inappropriate to change radically the characteristic rich anecdotal quality of Dr. Scholes' style.\" and left much of Scholes' distinctive work intact. In 1983 Oxford University Press produced The New Oxford Companion to Music, edited by Denis Arnold, which consciously tried to overcome some of the perceived deficiencies of the Scholes' work. This included taking a more eclectic line on music to be included, and resulted in a two-volume work of some 2000 pages. The 2002 edition, edited by Alison Latham, reverted to the original title, and single-volume format."

He was acclaimed for his oratory and command over the English language. Srinivasa Sastri was born to a poor temple priest in the village of Valangaiman near Kumbakonam, India. He completed his education at Kumbakonam and worked as a school teacher and later, headmaster in Triplicane, Madras. He entered politics in 1905 when he joined the Servants of India Society.  Sastri served as a member of the Indian National Congress from 1908 to 1922, but later resigned in protest against the Non-Cooperation movement. Sastri was one of the founding members of the Indian Liberal Party. In his later days, he was strongly opposed to the partition of India. Srinivasa Sastri served as a member of the Madras Legislative Council from 1913 to 1916, Imperial Legislative Council of India from 1916 to 1919 and the Council of State from 1920 to 1925. Sastri also functioned as India's delegate to the League of Nations, as member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and agent to the Union of South Africa. Sastri gained worldwide fame for his prowess in the English language. He was a close follower of Gopal Krishna Gokhale. He was also a close friend and associate of Mahatma Gandhi, who addressed Sastri as his \"elder brother\" in writings. Sastri was made a Companion of Honour in 1930. In 1921, the Freedom of the City of London was conferred on him, and in 1931 he received the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh. However, some members of the Indian freedom struggle such as Nehru felt that Sastri was too sympathetic to the British rulers, and too co-operative with them. This was especially apparent at the Round table conferences where Sastri and his party member agreed to the unfair proposals of the British."

His father, Vaidik Sankaranarayana Sastri, was a poor Hindu priest. He was educated at the Native High School in Kumbakonam and in 1887, graduated from Pachaiyappa's College, Chennai with a first class degree in English and Sanskrit. On graduation, he found employment as a teacher at Municipal College, Salem. Srinivasa Sastri married Parvathi in 1885. His granddaughters are, Parvathy, married to Ramamurti and Kausalya, married to the renowned Indian scientist and nephew of Sir C. V. Raman, S. Ramaseshan. In 1894, Srinivasa Sastri was appointed headmaster of Hindu High School, Triplicane and served for a period of eight years, until 1902. During this period, he achieved fame for his proficiency in English and his good administrative skills. In his late years, he also served as Vice-Chancellor of the Annamalai University. During his tenure as Vice-Chancellor, he demonstrated his scholarship in Sanskrit and Oriental Literature. He persuaded Mahavidwan R. Raghava Iyengar, then Head of the Tamil Research Department, to translate Kalidasan's epic poem Abhignana Sakuntalam in Tamil. The poem was translated in the Sandam Metre and published in 1938. He delivered the Kamala lectures in Calcutta University which are widely cherished and remembered."

Srinivasa Sastri met Indian independence activist Gopal Krishna Gokhale for the first time in 1906.

He joined the Indian National Congress in 1908 and became the Secretary of the Madras District Congress Committee in 1911. As a member of the Congress, he was instrumental in bringing about a pact between the Congress and the Muslim League. Srinivasa Sastri was nominated to the Madras Legislative Council in 1913 and to the Imperial Legislative Council of India in 1916. He opposed the Rowlatt Act which empowered the Government of India to imprison anyone without trial and delivered a well-appreciated speech in the Imperial Legislative Council denouncing the bill.  In 1919, he was appointed a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. In 1922, Sastri resigned his membership of the Indian National Congress after disagreeing with its leadership on the issue of non-cooperation and established the Indian Liberal Party along with Tej Bahadur Sapru. He consequently served as a President of the Indian Liberal Federation. In 1924, he accompanied Annie Besant on a visit to England demanding Home Rule for India.

As a member of the Viceregal council, Srinivasa Sastri was also a part of the British delegation which participated in the Washington Naval Conference and a signatory to the Five Power Naval Disarmament Treaty. During one of his speeches on \"The Political Situation in India\", he was accused of being a British agent and attacked by a mob and had to be hastily escorted away by mounted police. In 1922, the Government of India sent Sastri on delegations to Australia, New Zealand and Canada in order to investigate the conditions of Indians living in those countries. Due to his efforts, the Government of Australia passed the Commonwealth Electoral Act enlarging the franchise to include \"natives of British India\". In 1919, Srinivasa Sastri visited the Union of South Africa along with Sir Benjamin Robertson as a part of the delegation which signed the Cape Town Agreement with the Government of South Africa. As a result of this agreement, South Africa gave up its Class Area Bill intended to segregate Indians in South Africa. Initially, Jan Smuts, the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, refused to treat Srinivasa Sastri on par with the European delegate. However, on Srinivasa Sastri's departure from South Africa as India's Agent in 1928, Smuts recognized Sastri as the \"most respected man in South Africa\". Srinivasa Sastri was sent to the Federated Malay States in 1937, to report on the conditions of the Indian labourers in the country. The delegation submitted a controversial report titled Conditions of Indian labour in Malaya which was published in Madras and Kuala Lumpur, the very same year. Srinivasa Sastri, being the author of the report, was criticized by Indian nationalists for \"his reluctance to comment at length on the political and social status of Indians in Malaya\"."

Soon after taking over, Srinivasa Sastri successfully pressurized the South African government to withdraw Section 5 of the Immigration and Indian Relief Bill which empowered South African immigration officers and boards to cancel registration certificates. Through his efforts, the Natal Commission for Indian Education was appointed on 17 November 1927. With Sastri's support and encouragement, dissidents of the Transvaal British Indian Association founded the Transvaal Indian Congress on 18 December 1927. The TBIA later merged with the South African Indian Congress. Section 104 of the Liquor Bill prohibiting Indians from entering licensed premises was withdrawn. The Thornton Committee was established in 1928 to investigate the sanitary conditions of Indians in and around Durban. During the early part of Sastri's tenure, a number of segregationary laws were passed targeting Indians and Indian immigrants in South Africa. The period also witnessed the establishment of a number of trade unions.  Sastri campaigned against racial segregation of Indians and got the Class Area Bill segregating Indians withdrawn. Sastri returned to India in January 1929 and was succeeded by Kurma Venkata Reddy Naidu."

In 1935, Sastri was appointed Vice-Chancellor of Annamalai University, in Tamil Nadu, and served from 1935 to 1940. At the peak of the Second World War, he participated in a 15-member Indian delegation which appealed to the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill to provide dominion status to India. He strongly opposed Muslim League demands for the partition of India. In June 1940, the Government of Madras appointed a committee headed by Srinivasa Sastri to frame a set of general principles for coining words for scientific and technical terms in vernacular languages. The constitution of the committee was strongly condemned by the Madras Presidency Tamil Sangam and its Secretary E. M. Subramania Pillai who felt that Srinivasa Sastri was biased in favour of Sanskrit and hence, Anti-Tamil. The committee submitted its report after three months recommending the retention of the existing Sanskrit loanwords in Tamil and rejecting the need for them to be replaced. The deliberations of the Sastri Committee provoked widespread agitations in Madras Presidency. The committee was eventually reshuffled by Provincial Education Minister T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar soon after the demise of Srinivasa Sastri and balanced with the introduction of more members supporting the replacement of Sanskrit loan words. Srinivasa Sastri's health began to deteriorate in early 1946. In January, Srinivasa Sastri was admitted to the General Hospital, Madras. He died at 10:30\u00a0p.m. on 17 April at the age of 76."

Whenever he was on visit to the United Kingdom, Sastri was often consulted over spellings and pronunciations. His mastery over the English language was recognized by King George V, Winston Churchill, Lady Lytton and Lord Balfour who rated him amongst the five best English-language orators of the century. The Master of Balliol, Arthur Lionel Smith swore that he had never realized the beauty of the English language until he heard Sastri. while Lord Balfour remarked that listening to Srinivasa Sastri made him realise the heights to which the English language could rise. Thomas Smart conferred upon Sastri the appellation \"Silver Tongued Orator of the British Empire\" and he was so called all over the United Kingdom. Srinivasa Sastri's inspirations were William Shakespeare, Sir Walter Scott, George Eliot, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Harvey, Victor Hugo and Valmiki \u2013 Indian sage and the author of the Hindu epic Ramayana. However, others noticed that Sastri often repeated the rhetoric of the British empire. In a meeting with students in Lucknow in 1891, he advised students to follow the rules laid out by the British colonial government and not to disobey them. Some time later, when Annie Besant was interned due to her idea regarding Home rule, Sastry fell silent when followers of Besant and Servants of India needed guidance the most. This led Nehru to later comment in his autobiography that while Sastri was an excellent orator, he appeared to advocate mute submission and was not very effective in times of crisis."

Between 1968 and 1970, he studied at the School of Design and Crafts in G\u00f6teborg, where he researched textile kinetic objects. There, through his discussions with artists Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto, Carlos Cruz-Diez and Julio Le Parc, he became increasingly interested in by Op art and decided to devote all his research to Kinetic art. He started to increasingly integrate movement and geometric shapes in his textiles and oil paintings. In 1968, he received the first prize for Swiss contemporary engraving art as well as a scholarship from the Swedish government. In 1970, he worked in Hamburg, collaborating with North German artists on monumental projects, and created a kinetic sculpture for Gould in Eichstetten, Germany. Youri Messen-Jaschin traveled in South America, where he was able to discuss architecture \u2013 which plays an important role in his work \u2013 and its relations to his own research on movement with architects and artists like Oscar Niemeyer and Roberto Burle Marx in Rio de Janeiro, Ruy Ohtake in S\u00e3o Paulo, and Clorindo Testa in Buenos Aires. In 1984 in Caracas, he staged theatre and choreography of his own works at the Ateneo, the Eugenio Mendoza Foundation, the Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Humboldt , and at the Alliance fran\u00e7aise. After a stay of several months in New York, he returned to Switzerland in 1971, where he took up residence in Bern, where he lived for eleven years. During his stay, he frequently exhibited at the Kunsthalle and other local museums. He currently lives in Lausanne, Switzerland. He participated in many international exhibitions. His works are in private collections, in national and international museums."

        "content": "Vezin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Charles Henri/Carl Heinrich Vezin , a German merchant of French heritage, and his wife Emilie, n\u00e9e Kalinsky . His great-great-grandfather Pierre Vezin was married on the 14th August 1689 in the St. Clement's Basilica in Hanover to the seventeenth-century French actress Marie Charlotte P\u00e2tissier de Ch\u00e2teauneuf . Rouget de Lisle, the composer of the French national anthem, \"La Marseillaise,\" was one of his distant cousins. After studying law for several years, Vezin graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with an A.B. in 1847 and later a master's degree in 1850. Despite resistance from his family, Vezin was determined to work as an actor and departed America for the UK shortly after graduation. He made his first appearance at the York Theatre Royal in St Leonard's Place, York, England. After playing minor roles in several provincial engagements, he began performing leading characters as Cardinal Richelieu, Sir Edward Mortimer, Claude Melnotte, and Young Norval. He made his London d\u00e9but in 1852 at the Princess's Theatre.  On February 21, 1863, at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, he married the former child actress, English-born Jane Elizabeth Thompson who, appearing as an adult under the name Mrs. Charles Young, had made a reputation as an actress both in Australia and in England. They appeared in many plays with together until her death in 1902. Together they had a son, the silent film actor, Arthur Vezin. Apart from a brief professional tour of the United States in 1857\u201358, the majority of Vezin's acting career took place on the English stage.  Though primarily an actor, in 1866 he collaborated with the playwrights W. G. Wills and James Albery to write the vaudeville inspired play Doctor Davey based on the 1842 play Le Docteur Robin by French writer Jules de Pr\u00e9maray in which he also played the title role. The following year he starred as a troubled Scottish poet James Harebell in Wills' Man o' Airlie to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Vezin followed up with other successful showings, such as The Turn of the Tide by F. C. Burnand , Son of the Soil ; As You Like It ; and W. S. Gilbert's Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith, which ran for one hundred and nineteen performances at the Haymarket Theatre ; He acted with Charles Fechter, Samuel Phelps, Henry Irving, and in 1878 played Dr. Primrose alongside actress Ellen Terry in Wills' Olivia, Vicar of Wakefield , a highly successful adaptation of Oliver Goldsmith's novel, The Vicar of Wakefield . Sir J. Forbes-Robertson described Vezin in the London Post as a \"bright and dapper little man, who was both \"learned and dictatorial on the art of acting.\" The Illustrated London News review of Vezin in the title role of Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith noted that \"Mr. Vezin is probably the most intellectual of our actors, and is the very man for creating an original part, such as that of Dan'l Druce\" and described one scene as \"an acting hit by Mr. Hermann Vezin which literally electrified the house.\" He was one of W. S. Gilbert's favourite actors. and, besides the aforementioned Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith, he also starred in Gilbert's Randall's Thumb, , and played Mousta in an 1882 revival of Broken Hearts alongside Gilbert himself as Florian . A benefit matinee was held for Vezin at the Haymarket Theatre on March 19, 1896.  For this, George Grossmith gave a sketch, and play scenes featured Gerald du Maurier, Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Cyril Maude, among others.  Vezin continued to act, appearing in The Happy Life in 1897 and as Rowley in The School for Scandal opposite Herbert Beerbohm Tree in 1909. In his declining years, Vezin appear infrequently on the stage, rather spending most of his time giving lessons to aspiring thespians, including the actors Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Baliol Holloway and Frank Benson as well as the actress Mary Mannering. He also dedicated himself to appearances at recitals and play readings. His last stage role was Old Rowley in Tree's production of playwright Richard Sheridan's The School for Scandal at His Majesty's Theatre in Scotland, in April 1909. He had been active on the British stage for nearly sixty years, and had been a resident of London, where he died at his home, 10 Lancaster Place, Strand, on June 12, 1910. His body was cremated at Golders Green and his ashes were scattered."

Shukhevych propagated the idea that the revolution was an uncompromising conflict in order to permanently defeat the foe. Shukhevych took an active part in developing a concept regarding the formation of a Ukrainian army. At that time two diametrically opposed arguments existed.

Shukhevych organized financial aid for the government of the fledgling republic and sent OUN members to set up the Carpathian Sich. In December 1938, he illegally crossed the border from Poland into Czechoslovakia, traveling to the Ruthenian city of Khust. There, with the aid of local OUN members and German intelligence, he set up the general headquarters for the fight against the Czechoslovak central government. Moreover, in January 1939 the OUN decided to throw off the autonomous government, which seemed too pro-Czechoslovak to them. The coup d'\u00e9tat attempt occurred on the night of 13\u201314 March, in relation to the proclamation of Slovak independence, managed by Germany. With help of sympathizers among the police, the insurgents led by Shukhevych obtained the weapons of the gendarmerie, but their assaults on garrisons of the Czechoslovak army failed. Just in the Khust 11 OUN fighters were killed and 51 captured. However, after the creation of the Slovak client State on 14 March and the Nazis' seizure of Czech lands on 15 March, Carpathian Ruthenia was immediately invaded and annexed by Hungary. Shukhevych took an active part in the short-term armed conflict with Hungarian forces and was almost killed in one of the actions. After the occupation of Carpathian Ruthenia by Hungary ended, Shukhevych traveled through Romania and Yugoslavia to Austria, where he consulted with OUN commanders and was given new orders and sent to Danzig to carry out subversive activities."

The new political realities required new forms of activity. The command of the Ukrainian nationalists could not come to a unified agreement regarding tactics.

Shukhevych became a member the Revolutionary Command of the OUN headed by Bandera, taking charge of the section dealing with territories claimed by the Ukrainians, which after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact had been seized by Germany . A powerful web was formed for the preparation of underground activities in Ukraine. Paramilitary training courses were set up.

        "content": "Prior to Operation Barbarossa, the OUN actively cooperated with Nazi Germany. According to the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and other sources, OUN-B leader Stepan Bandera held meetings with the heads of Germany's intelligence, regarding the formation of \"Nachtigall\" and \"Roland\" Battalions. On 25 February 1941, the head of the Abwehr, Wilhelm Franz Canaris, sanctioned the creation of the \"Ukrainian Legion\" under German command. The unit would have had 800 persons. Shukhevych became a commander of the Legion from the OUN-B side. OUN expected that the unit would become the core of the future Ukrainian army. In the spring the OUN received 2.5 million marks for subversive activities against the USSR. In spring 1941 the legion was reorganized into three units. One of the units became known as Nachtigall Battalion, a second became the Roland Battalion, and a third was immediately dispatched into the Soviet Union to sabotage the Red Army's rear. After intensive training the battalion traveled to Riashiv on 18 June, and entered Lviv on 29 June, where the Act for establishment of the Ukrainian Statehood  was proclaimed. The German administration however did not support this act. At the same time it is estimated that in June\u2013July 1941 over 4,000 Jews were murdered in pogroms in Lviv and other cities in Western Ukraine. There is  controversy regarding the participation of the Nachtigall Battalion and Roman Shukhevych in these atrocities, as well as in the Massacre of Lviv professors. The first company  of the unit remained in Lviv for only seven days, while the remainder of the unit joined later during their eastward march towards Zolochiv, Ternopil and Vinnytsia. There are claims that the soldiers of Nachtigall participated in the killing of Jews. During the march at three villages of the Vinnytsia region, Jews were said to have been shot en masse. The German refusal to accept the OUN-B's 30 June proclamation of Ukrainian independence in Lviv led to a change of the Nachtigall battalion direction. As a result, Shukhevych together with the battalion were recalled to Germany."

It numbered 650 persons who were given individual contracts that required the combatants to serve for one additional year. Shukhevych's titles were that of Hauptmann of the first company and deputy Commander of the Battalion, which was commanded by Yevhen Pobihushchyi. On 19 March 1942, the battalion arrived in Belarus where it served in the triangle between Mahiliou-Vitsebsk-Lepel. With the expiration of the one-year contract, all the Ukrainian soldiers refused to renew their services. On the beginning of January 1943, the battalion was sent to Lviv and there it was disbanded. Its former members formed the core of the OUN security service. The other part joined the Schutzmannschaft Battalion 57, returned to Belarus and continued to fight with the partisans and civilians. Shukhevych decided to join OUN and quickly gained the leading role in the organization. Polish-German historian and Holocaust expert  from the University of Hamburg describes the activities of the 201st Schutzmannschaft Battalion in Belarus as \"fighting partisans and killing Jews\". John Paul Himka, a specialist in Ukrainian history during World War II, notes that although units such as the 201st Battalion were routinely used to fight partisans and kill Jews, no-one has studied the specific activities of the 201st battalion from this perspective and this ought to be a subject for further study. It is alleged that more than 2,000 Soviet partisans were killed by the Battalion during its operation in Belarus."

        "content": "In spring 1943, the OUN-B's UPA launched a campaign of murder and expulsion against the Polish population of Volhynia, and in early 1944 against the Poles in Eastern Galicia. This was done as a preemptive strike, in expectation of another Polish-Ukrainian conflict over the disputed territories, which were internationally recognized as part of Poland in 1923. The Polish government in exile wanted to restore eastern Polish borders beyond the Curzon Line, an aim that was also supported by promises from the Western Allies. The Ukrainian majority in Eastern Galicia, which was promised autonomy, initially considered the Polish administration that followed the Peace of Riga and the Polish-Soviet War to be illegitimate, but after 1923 most Ukrainians grudgingly accepted Polish rule as a fact they could not change and focused on increasing their autonomy. Ukrainians in general were opposed to the Polish regime and all Ukrainian political movements had independence from Poland as a goal.  Ukrainians took two approaches towards independence.  The mainstream parties avoided violence and sought the goal of independence through gradual legal means focused on preserving Ukrainians' limited rights,  while the OUN sought to use terror and violence in opposition to the Polish government. The OUN regarded Galicia and Volhynia as ethnic Ukrainian territory that should be included in a future restored Ukrainian republic. It is estimated that up to 100,000 Poles were killed by the Ukrainian nationalists during the conflict and another 300,000 made refugees as a result of the ethnic cleansing. According to Timothy Snyder, 40,000-60,000 Polish civilians were killed by the UPA in Volhynia in 1943, and some 25,000 in Eastern Galicia. Conversely, killings of Ukrainians by Poles resulted in between 10,000 and 12,000 deaths in Volhynia, Eastern Galicia and present-day Polish territory. University of Alberta historian Per Rudling has stated that Shukhevych commanded the UPA during the summer of 1943, when tens of thousands of Poles were massacred.  However, the initiator of these massacres was Dmytro Klyachkivsky. They reached their height in July 1943, while Shukhevych did not assume command of the OUN until 25 August of that year and command over the UPA until November 1943."

According to Ukrainian historian and former UPA soldier Lev Shankovsky, immediately upon assuming the position of commander of UPA Shukhevych issued an order banning participation in anti-Jewish activities. No written record of this order, however, has been found. The Insurgent Army was joined by various people from the Caucasus and Central Asia who had fought in German formations. The rise of non-Ukrainians in the Ukrainian Insurgent Army gave stimulus to the special conference for Captive Nations of Europe and Asia which took place 21\u201322 November 1943 in Buderazh, not far from Rivne. The agenda included the formation of a unified plan for the attack against occupational forces. During the period of German occupation Shukhevych spent most of his time fighting in the forests, and from August 1944, following Ukraine's annexation by the Soviet Army, he lived in various villages in Western Ukraine. In order to unite all Ukrainian national forces to fight for Ukrainian independence, Shukhevych organized a meeting between all the Ukrainian political parties. As a result, the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council was formed."

According to NKVD officers' memoirs, Roman Shukhevych's body was transported out of western part of Ukraine, burned, and the ashes scattered. This was done on the left bank of the Zbruch River. The unburned remains were thrown into the Zbruch, where a commemorative stone cross was erected in 2003."

On 23 October 2001, the Lviv Historic Museum converted the house in which Shukhevych was killed into a memorial museum. He was portrayed by Ukrainian-Canadian actor Hryhoriy Hladiy in the Ukrainian film Neskorenyi . Postage stamps and coins have been minted in his honour of the 100th anniversary of his birth.  Posthumously, he was awarded the UPA's highest decorations: the Gold Cross of Combat Merit First Class and the Cross of Merit in gold. In June 2017, the Kyiv City Council renamed the city's General Vatutin Avenue into Roman Shukhevych Avenue. On 5 March 2021, the Ternopil City Council named the largest stadium in the city of Ternopil after Roman Shukhevych as the Roman Shukhevych Ternopil city stadium. On 16 March 2021, the Lviv Oblast Council  approved the renaming of their largest stadium after Roman Shukhevych. Hero of Ukraine Award Roman Shukhevych was posthumously conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine by President Viktor Yushchenko on 12 October 2007. On 12 February 2009, an administrative Donetsk region court ruled the Presidential decree awarding the title to be legal after a lawyer had claimed that his rights as a citizen were violated because Shukhevych was never a citizen of Ukraine. President Viktor Yanukovych stated on 5 March 2010 he would make a decision to repeal the decrees to honor the title as Heroes of Ukraine to Shukhevych and fellow nationalist Stepan Bandera before the next Victory Day . Although the Hero of Ukraine decrees do not stipulate the possibility that a decree on awarding this title can be annulled, on 21 April 2010, Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals declared unlawful former Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko's decree of 12 October 2007 to award the Hero of Ukraine title to Roman Shukhevych. The court ruled that the former President had had no right to confer this title to Shukhevych, because Shukhevych had died in 1950 and therefore he had not lived on the territory of independent Ukraine . Consequently, Shukhevych was not a Ukrainian citizen, and this title could not be awarded to him. On 12 August 2010 the High Administrative Court of Ukraine dismissed suits to declare four decrees by President Viktor Yanukovych on awarding the Hero of Ukraine title to Soviet soldiers illegal and cancel them. The filer of these suit stated they were based on the same arguments used by Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeals that on 21 April satisfied an appeal that deprived Roman Shukhevych the Hero of Ukraine title, as Shukhevych was not a citizen of Ukraine. The title however was not rescinded, pending an appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine which set aside all previous court decisions on 17 February 2011. The Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine ruled Shukhevych's Hero of Ukraine title illegal in August 2011. On 1 September 2011 former President Yuschenko filed an appeal at the Supreme Court of Ukraine with a request that it cancel the ruling by the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine."

He is considered to be one of, if not the greatest and most influential warriors during the Plains Indian War of the 1860s. Born during the prosperous days of the fur trade in the 1820s, he was called M\u00f4s\u00e9\u0161kanets\u00e9noon\u00e1he as a youth. He later took the warrior name Wokini, which the whites rendered as Roman Nose. Considered invincible in combat, this fierce warrior distinguished himself in battle to such a degree that the U.S. military mistook him for the Chief of the entire Cheyenne nation."

        "content": "Hook Nose was born around 1830 and was a Northern Suhtai, a band within the Northern Cheyenne tribe. A common mistake is to confuse him with a supposed son of the Minniconjou Lakota Sioux Lone Horn and brother of Spotted Elk and Touch the Clouds called Roman Nose. Following the Sand Creek Massacre in November 1864, Hook Nose became a principal figure among his people, leading retaliatory strikes against Euro-American settlements at the Battle of Julesburg along the Platte Road and Powder River regions of south-central Wyoming and in the Platte valley of Nebraska, western Kansas, and eastern Colorado. The Native American author and physician Charles A. Eastman allegedly wrote of Hook Nose that, \"Perhaps no other warrior attacked more emigrants along the Oregon Trail between 1860\u20131868.\" Contrary to popular myth, Hook Nose was never a chief, nor a leader of any of the six Cheyenne military societies. However, known to all plains Indians as a great warrior, and the acknowledged leader during combat, Hook Nose's reputation spread among the whites who credited him with initiating most hostilities between the Cheyenne and U.S military. A member of the Crooked Lance Warrior Society, Hook Nose continually refused seats among the Cheyenne Chiefs and headsmen, and never held a position of authority within his tribe. Physically imposing in stature, there are several historical references to Hook Nose's flamboyant, intimidating personality and battle prowess. Isaac Coates, General Winfield S. Hancock's surgeon, observed a verbal confrontation between Hancock and Hook Nose outside Fort Larned in April 1867. Coates wrote in his journal; \"of all the chiefs, he is one of the finest specimens, physically, of his race. He is quite six feet in height, finely formed with a large body and muscular limbs. His appearance, decidedly military, and on this occasion, particularly so, since he wore the uniform of a General in the Army. A seven-shooting Spencer carbine hung at the side of his saddle, four large Navy revolvers stuck in his belt, and a bow, already strung with arrows, were grasped in his left hand. Thus armed and mounted on a fine horse, he was a good representative of the God of War; and his manner showed plainly that he did not care whether we talked or fought...\" Hook Nose opposed treaties with the United States Federal Government, while other leaders urged peace. Following the implementation of the Little Arkansas Treaty in 1865, Hook Nose moved south, pledging to assist his friends, Bull Bear, Grey Beard, and the Cheyenne Dog Soldiers, defend their ancestral hunting grounds along the Smoky Hill River and within the Republican Valley. He was killed by American soldiers during the Battle of Beecher Island on September 17, 1868, while attempting to charge the island in the Arikaree River, and annihilate General Forsyth's command. He was mostly known as \"Roman Nose\" among the Americans. Some of his other aliases were Arched Nose, and Woo-kay-nay. Hook Nose was known by his peers as being dedicated and willing to protect his people. Hook Nose was known as a warrior with many skillful and bold tactics to fight against his enemies. Hook Nose was also known to be a very spiritual individual and practiced traditional Cheyenne medicine. Hook Nose and his peers believed it was this medicine that protected him and made him such a great warrior. He died during the Battle at Beecher Island in 1868. \"He had refused a chieftaincy when young, on the grounds that he spent the major portion of his time in battle rather than in council\". Although Hook Nose never accepted the role of chief, many of his peers respected him as a leader and protector of his people and their resources. \"Roman Nose, was a leader of Indian warriors and a member of the crooked Lance Society of the Cheyenne Indian Tribe\". Hook Nose's intentions might have been to protect his people; however, non-Indians perceived him a malicious man. \"Roman Nose, the fierce Dog Soldier Warrior, was considered a 'bad' Indian. He wanted the white man evicted from the plains. His lance meant to sweep the lands clean of whites fences, houses, cattle and the 'iron horse'\". Hook Nose's leadership, battle tactics, and spirituality are a few things that made him known to many. Although he died fairly young, Hook Nose left an impact on the west during his time."

Witnesses of Hook Nose's warfare talked highly about his tactics and leadership abilities. \"A common battle tactic of his was to ride up and down the line of army troops within rifle range, getting them to discharge their weapons and waste their ammunition.\" Hook Nose used deadly and effective tactics to protect himself, his people, and his culture. \"Roman Nose was a prominent Southern Cheyenne warrior best remembered for his key role in the ongoing battle against white advancement in the west throughout the 1860s\". Hook Nose did not accept the idea that the west was expanding and being industrialized. Giving in to the enemy did not seem to be an option for him."

It is believed the reason he would show up late to most battles was due, in part, in that he spent a longer amount of time than usual in prayer for blessings and to prepare for warfare. It is known that Hook Nose would spend days on quests to cleanse his spirit and gain strength through his medicine. Not only was Hook Nose protected by his medicine he gained through ceremony, but he also felt that he was protected by his famous War-bonnet that was made and given to him by White Bull. It was also believed that it was because of his war-bonnet and the medicine he practiced to be the reason why he was such a successful warrior."

Some of these rules included never shaking hands with anyone, and never eating food that had been prepared or served using metal. Hook Nose had complete faith in his war-bonnet, and believed that it had always protected him in battle. Hook Nose and his fellow warriors believed that, on the morning of the Battle of Beecher's Island, Hook Nose's medicine had been tampered with. Hook Nose had felt that something was wrong and said, \"Something was done that I was told must not be done, the bread I ate was taken out of the frying pan with something made of iron...

        "content": "Hook Nose possessed an elaborate warbonnet that he believed gave him special powers. The medicine man Ice, later known as White Bull, made the warbonnet, and assured Hook Nose he would be impervious to the white man's bullets as long as he followed certain conditions. Hook Nose could not shake hands in the way of the white man, nor could he eat food that had been touched with any iron implement. Ice told Hook Nose that should he violate either of these conditions, he would surely be killed in battle. Several days prior to the Battle of Beecher Island, Hook Nose visited the nearby Sioux camp, where he participated in a feast. During the feast, he ate some fry bread. However, the woman who cooked the bread had used an iron fork to remove it from the cooking pan, which violated one of the conditions of his medicine. As he left for battle, he was made aware of this fact, but he did not have the time to perform the necessary cleansing ceremony to restore his medicine. Because of this, he did not participate in the fighting as he normally would, preferring to watch the battle from afar. During the battle, he was chastised by an elderly warrior named White Contrary for his lack of participation, and thus decided to enter the battle after all, knowing that he would die. After donning his war clothes, including his war bonnet, he led an assault on the island. He was shot at close range during the attack and died late that afternoon, near sunset. The demise of Hook Nose had devastating effects on the Cheyenne's efforts to defend their lands, which virtually ended with the defeat of Tall Bull and the Dog Soldiers, at the Battle of Summit Springs, near Sterling, Colorado, in July 1869."

He was born Augustin Cuvillier in Quebec City in 1779 and was hired by a Montreal auctioneer, eventually taking over the business when his employer retired. After he formed a partnership with two other men, the business went bankrupt. By this time, Cuvillier had adopted the anglicized first name Austin. By 1807, he was back in the auction business. During the War of 1812, he served with the militia. In 1814, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada representing Huntingdon County, as a member of the Parti canadien. He played an important role in the founding of the Bank of Montreal and was one of its first directors. He also helped found the Montreal Fire Insurance Company and became president in 1820. In 1821, he was part of a commission negotiating the sharing of customs duties between Lower and Upper Canada. He opposed the union of the two Canadas. In 1828, he helped present petitions against Governor Dalhousie's policies in London. In 1829, he began to distance himself from the Parti patriote. He opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions that were presented in 1834. By 1836, he was one of the most important auctioneers in Montreal and served as president on the city's Committee of Trade, later the Montreal Board of Trade. He commanded a battalion in the militia during the Lower Canada Rebellion. In 1841, he was elected to the 1st Parliament of the Province of Canada representing Huntingdon and was elected speaker. In 1844, he defended Governor Charles Theophilus Metcalfe against the Reformers when the governor wished to retain exclusive control over patronage. This led to the end of his political career and Cuvillier returned to his auction business. He had at least one daughter called Luce and two sons called Maurice and Austin. He died of typhus at Montreal in 1849."

        "content": "Joseph Urban was born on May 26, 1872, in Vienna. He received his first architectural commission at age 19 when he was selected to design the new wing of the Abdin Palace in Cairo by Tewfik Pasha. He became known around the world for his innovative use of color, his pointillist technique, and his decorative use of line. He designed buildings throughout the world from Esterhazy Castle in Hungary to the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York. Urban studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under Karl von Hasenauer. In 1890, he and his brother-in-law, Heinrich Lefler, were among the founders of the Hagenbund. Urban's early work with illustrated books was inspired by Lefler and, together, they created what are considered seminal examples of children's book illustration. Urban immigrated to the United States in 1911 to become the art director of the Boston Opera Company. He was already an accomplished international architect, illustrator and theatre set designer with over 50 productions from his home Vienna Royal Opera, the Champs Elys\u00e9e Opera, and Covent Garden. By applying points of primary colors side by side on the canvas backdrops he was able to create and light theatre sets of vivid color reminiscent of the works by Monet or Seurat. In 1914 he moved to New York City, where he designed productions for the Metropolitan Opera and the Ziegfeld Follies; he continued to design for Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. until 1931. William Randolph Hearst was an important client and supporter. He also co-produced with Richard Ordynski Percy MacKaye's \"Community Masque\" Caliban by the Yellow Sands. Beginning in 1917, he was frequently engaged as stage designer by the Metropolitan Opera of New York City. In all he created set designs for 47 new productions at the house through 1933. His many designs provided the opera company with a cohesive production style throughout the tenure of General Manager Giulio Gatti-Casazza. Many of Urban's settings remained in the company's repertoire into the 1950s. Soon his sets and innovative lighting caught the eye of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., who hired him to design the Follies in the 1920s. Urban went to work creating a stunning night-club with glass balconies, a moving stage, and rainbow lighting effects. This Danse de Follies soon became a blend of ideas and talent before serving in the Follies theatre. Urban had success after success in his creating of the Follies' sets, and William Randolph Hearst, a media tycoon, took notice and wanted to hire Urban to work on his films starring Marion Davies, his mistress, and previous Follies starlet. Hearst came to an understanding with his friend Ziegfeld that Urban's work for him would not interfere with any of the Follies productions. Urban worked on 25 films over the years. Urban died July 10, 1933, of a heart attack at his apartment at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, where he had been convalescing following surgery in May."

He went on to win the track championship there the next two years. Following that stint, Hooper moved up to the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series, and won seven races in his first year on the circuit, then won the championship in 1995. In addition to his success on Raceday, he won the pole award sixteen times, the Most Popular Driver award as well as breaking many track records. After that, he moved to the NASCAR Winston West Series. In 1996, he won five races, as well as both the championship and the Rookie of the Year points title. That year, he made his Winston Cup debut as well, running the Dura Lube 500 and finishing 33rd in his own Pontiac. He soon caught the eye of owner Richard Jackson, owner of Precision Products Racing, and the two ran six races together in 1997 in an undeclared Rookie of the Year bid in the Winston Cup Series. In 1998, the two made an abbreviated bid at the Busch Series championship, running 16 races and finishing in the top-20 three times. Hooper did not run much in 1999. He ran one Busch Series race for Jackson, and made an unsuccessful attempt at the Brickyard 400 with Fenley-Moore Motorsports after replacing Jeff Davis during qualifying. He returned to the sport regularly in 2000, running 13 races in the Craftsman Truck Series for Marty Walsh and four races for Alumni Motorsports in the Busch Series, including an outside pole qualifying run. Hooper made 18 Truck Series races in 2001, and had a tenth-place finish at Nazareth Speedway. Hooper also reunited with Jackson competed in a Cup race at Dover for Dark Horse Motorsports. He ran every truck race in 2002, despite switching from Ware Racing Enterprises to Team Racing mid-season. Hooper ran his most recent Cup race to date that year, finishing 31st at Bristol Motor Speedway for Junie Donlavey. In 2003, Hooper began running his own entry in the Truck Series with fan-based sponsorships. He finished 24th in points that year. Hooper ran five races with ThorSport Racing, and had two top-twenty finishes in the No. 13 Silverado. He did not race again for five years, choosing to become a crew chief at the Truck level, working with ThorSport and Key Motorsports. He returned to the driver's seat in 2009 in the Trucks to drive the No. 44 entry for his then-employer, Key Motorsports, before finishing the year at Tagsby Racing."

Addabbo was born in Queens, New York, and lived in the borough his entire life. He was a 1946 graduate of St. John's Law School and practiced law in Ozone Park, New York, before his election to Congress in 1960. Addabbo was the Democratic nominee to replace Queens Rep. Albert H.

        "content": "Although he usually sailed to reelection in his overwhelmingly Democratic and Italian-American Southwestern Queens district, a reapportionment following the 1980 census spelled trouble for Addabbo in his final two campaigns. His district absorbed a considerably larger number of African Americans in Jamaica, Queens than had previously been in the district. His old district was 35 percent black, while his new district was 65 percent black. Some of his Italian-American base were moved into the district of fellow Democrat Charles Schumer while others were moved into the district of fellow Italian-American Democrat Geraldine Ferraro, who had won a closer-than-expected election two years earlier. This left him open to a surprisingly strong primary challenge from black real estate developer Simeon Golar in 1982. Two years later, Golar ran again with the active backing of then-presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, but Addabbo won again. Addabbo's health started to fail shortly after his 1984 re-election. In 1985, he spent four months in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center with a cancer-related kidney ailment. After returning to work for two months in early 1986, he fell ill at a luncheon in March and lapsed into a coma on March 12. He died a month later, aged 61, and was buried in Saint John's Cemetery, Queens. After Addabbo's death, Queens elected its first African-American congressman after a disputed special election between two black candidates. In 2001, Addabbo's son, Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., was elected as the New York City Council representative for District 32 in Queens. He was elected to the New York State Senate in 2008."

Jaswant Singh's advisers suggested a night raid to destroy Aurangzeb's artillery and gunpowder as the Rajput army was almost entirely made up of light cavalry, while Aurangzeb had a well equipped army of heavy cavalry, Artillery and Muskets. However Jaswant Singh replied by saying \"It is inconsistent with the manliness of the Rajputs or usage, to employ stratagems or make a night attack\". Jaswant Singh was defeated and lost 6,000 of his soldiers. Ratan Singh Rathore, Maharaja of Ratlam, Roop Singh Rathore, Maharaja of Kishangarh and Mokand Das Hada, Rao of Kota were amongst those slain in the battle."

He was very saddened because he had no male heir who could seek revenge. Jaswant's reign lasted until his death at Jamrud, near Peshawar, on the Vikram Samvat calendar date of 10 Pausha of 1735, equivalent to 28 December 1678 on the Gregorian calendar.   However, another scholar lists 10 Pausha 1735 V.S. as having been on 28 November 1678. At the time of his death two of his wives were pregnant, and both would later bear sons.

Exiguous amount of stanozolol was found in his system by neglect, therefore his first degree sentence was overruled and reduced to a 6-year suspension from competition. In the committee's explanation of their verdict: R\u00f3bert Fazekas has proved dependably that his system was exposed by stanozolol by taking a nutritional supplement that is legally available in retail stores. Samples from the exact bottle of the supplement, taken by R\u00f3bert Fazekas, and from a randomly bought, sealed bottle of the same brand of supplement were tested in an Austrian accredited laboratory by the Hungarian Anti-Doping Group.

In 2013 he filed a lawsuit against the Canadian company producing the nutritional supplement. As a result of another trial on a civil court started in 2012, his suspension was reduced to 3 years, thus it has been already expired in 2015. Despite he could not compete since the Hungarian Athletics Association disputed the authority of the Hungarian Court arguing a civil court's final decision is not obligatory for the IAAF, thus they appealed to the  Supreme Court for the revision and the cession of the execution of the decision, though the Hungarian Anti-Doping Group reinstated Fazekas to their controlling program that is the first step to be able to have a permission for legal competition. The Hungarian Athletics Association decided not to grant any permission until having the IAAF's official statement. Fazekas asked an accelerated procedure due to 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Finally the Supreme Court repealed the original sentence explaining the case of doping was a fact, the result of the tests were not debated by the athlete, however not the case of deliberation but only the case negligence holds, nevertheless because of the principle of the zero tolerance the 6-year suspension still remains in action. Since the WADA's regulation regarding negligence had been moderated Fazekas made an appeal earlier again for decreasing his suspension, the leader of the Hungarian Anti-Doping Group stated in may be only applied until after the legal procedure, thus Fazekas made its appeal again to reduce the earlier suspension to 4 years, so he could be able to compete from 6 July 2016. Finally he summarized: \"Despite of the happennings I don't have in mind to finish my career, I feel still enough power in me. Nevertheless, I resigned on the Olympic Games. The events of the past month tried me as much I was not able to prepare properly for such an important event\"."

        "content": "Parker was born in Glendale, California.  He trained under his father as a youth for several years before moving away at age 19 to Arizona to do missionary work at various Indian reservations. For two years he worked with the Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Southern Ute, Havasupai, White Mountain Apache and Jicarilla Apache Tribes. Parker then moved to his father\u2019s home state of Hawaii where he attended Brigham Young University-Hawaii majoring in Illustration with a minor in  Theatrical Arts. During his schooling he studied and made student films\u2014one of which won him an award for the Best Student Film for 1982 in the State of Hawaii Film Festival. He was awarded an internship on the television show \"Magnum, P.I.\" He also received 12 University art and theatrical scholarship awards. After finishing school, Parker returned to California where he did graduate work at the Art Center College of Design. Upon completing his training there, he went into partnership with his father. He helped edit and provided illustrations for his father's \"Infinite Insights Into Kenpo\" series of books. From 1983 to 1991 he helped in the production of 8 International Karate Championships. In December 1990, after his father died, Parker continued on within the martial arts industry and produced 6 educational martial arts videos. In June 1992 he published \"The Encyclopedia Of Kenpo\" a complete encyclopedia on American Kenpo Karate as taught by his father. He is also well known for his artwork, including many portraits of notable martial arts practitioners. His illustrations have been commissioned for film projects, DVDs, book and magazine covers, corporate identities, and custom certificates. His artwork has been distributed internationally. He portrayed his father in the 1993 Bruce Lee biography, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story. That same year Parker would earn his 1st degree black belt in American kenpo karate under Ron Chapel, one of his father\u2019s students."

        "content": "De Lue studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and later served as an assistant to sculptors Richard Henry Recchia and Robert P. Baker. This was followed by five years in Paris where he continued his study, while working as an assistant to various French artists. He returned to the United States where he was engaged by Bryant Baker. In 1940 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1943. In 1941, De Lue won a competition to create sculpture for the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse Building in Philadelphia, and from then on he stopped being an assistant for other artists and only worked on his own commissions and creations. De Lue's works can be found in many museums across America. Like many other sculptors of his generation, he executed architectural works. He was also a prolific designer of medals and medallions. De Lue taught at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York City during the early 1940s. In 1960, he won two Henry Hering Awards, given by the National Sculpture Society for outstanding collaboration between a sculptor and an architect, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, and for the Stations of the Cross at the Loyola Jesuit Seminary in Shrub Oak, New York. In 1967, De Lue won the American Numismatic Society's J. Sanford Saltus Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Art of the Medal, known as the Saltus Award. Beginning in 1964, for many years De Lue was a Trustee of Brookgreen Gardens, as well as Chairman of the Art Committee. In his later years, De Lue and his wife Naomi lived in the Leonardo section of Middletown Township, New Jersey, a small shore town with a bayside beach and long-distance view of lower Manhattan. De Lue cited the 23rd Psalm and the words \"He leadeth me beside the still waters...\" as the inspiration by which he arrived in Leonardo from New York City.  Although he continued to maintain his NYC apartment, it was in his Leonardo studio that many of his largest statues were made.  One of the last was a commission by a private individual intended for the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas.  The bigger-than-life statue of Bowie, Travis and Crockett was considered \"too violent\" by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas for placement in a sacred chapel.  A compromise was sought, that the statue be installed outside the building in the large courtyard rather than inside.  DeLue and his patron, a wealthy Texan, preferred the statue be installed in the interior space for which it was made.  Unfortunately, the impasse was never resolved in De Lue's lifetime. Donald and Naomi De Lue are buried in Manalapan Township, New Jersey at the cemetery at Old Tennent Presbyterian Church."

        "content": "G\u00e9rard Fromanger was a French visual artist. A painter who also employed collage, sculpture, photography, cinema, and lithography, he was associated with the French artistic movement of the 1960s and 1970s called Figuration Narrative , somewhat like pop art. Fromanger was alsi associated with photorealism. Fromanger studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where his first solo exhibition was held in 1966. Souffles, his large translucent \"half-balloon\" street sculptures, attracted attention in 1968. He also collaborated with Jean-Luc Godard to make the short \"Film-tract 1968\". Urban life and the consumer society are themes well represented in his work. The Nouvelle Figuration movement is considered to have been a reaction against abstract art, with a more political slant than American pop art. Fromanger has been described as a social critic who takes a political position without neglecting the poetic dimension. Michel Foucault, a friend of Fromanger's, wrote about his work in Photogenic Painting. In 2005 a retrospective exhibition, G\u00e9rard Fromanger: r\u00e9trospective 1962-2005, was shown at various galleries in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. Fromanger lived and worked in both Siena and Paris."

In 1816, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Through his first wife Mary, he met Captain George Manby, amateur artist, inventor and barrack-master of Yarmouth. They corresponded frequently over the next 50 years. By 1820, his interest in botany had been replaced by an interest in antiquities. He and his children were taught drawing by renowned Norfolk artist John Sell Cotman who became a good friend. They travelled to Normandy together and collaborated on a book, Architectural Antiquities of Normandy, published in 1822, with Cotman providing the etchings. Turner died in 1858 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London."

Maia taught him his first chords on guitar. In 1957 Carlos joined Maia's band the  Os Sputniks with Roberto Carlos. Erasmo was introduced to Roberto by Arl\u00eanio Livy. After a fight between Tim and Roberto, the group disbanded. Wellington gave up music, was the sole remaining Arl\u00eanio the next year decided to call Erasmo and other friends from Tijuca, Robert and Jos\u00e9 Edson Trindade, known as \"China\", to form the vocal group \"The Boys of Rock\". At the suggestion of Carlos Imperial, the group was renamed The Snakes. They backed both Roberto and Tim Maia in their respective shows. Roberto Carlos needed the lyrics to the song Hound Dog, a hit by Elvis Presley. Arl\u00eanio Livy told him Erasmo had the lyrics, as he was a big fan of Elvis. Roberto then discovered other affinities with Erasmo, as both of them liked Bob Nelson, James Dean, Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe, and cheering for Vasco da Gama. As part of The Snakes, Tim Maia taught Erasmo how to play guitar. Erasmo decided to adopt the name Carlos in his stage name, in honor of Roberto Carlos and Carlos Imperial. Before going solo, Erasmo was also part of the band Renato e seus Blue Caps. Erasmo participated effectively with Roberto Carlos and Wanderl\u00e9a in the Jovem Guarda TV, show where he had the nickname \"Tremend\u00e3o\" , imitating the clothes and style of his idol Elvis Presley. His greatest successes as a singer in this phase were \"Gatinha manhosa\" and \"Festa de arromba\". He had been rumored to become the main presenter of the program, but Roberto Carlos ended up taking the spot. Roberto and Erasmo, as songwriting partners, were criticized for singing and writing rock music and being thus \"americanized\". As a response, \"Coqueiro verde\" was the first samba-rock recorded by Erasmo."

        "content": "Johannes de Garlandia or John of Garland was a medieval grammarian and university teacher. His dates of birth and death are unknown, but he probably lived from about 1190 to about 1270. He was born in England, and studied at Oxford and then at the medieval University of Paris, where he was teaching by 1220. He lived and taught on the Left Bank at the Clos de Garlande, after which Rue Galande is named. This is the origin of the name by which he is usually known.  The main facts of his life are stated in his long poem De triumphis ecclesiae . In 1229, he was one of the first Masters of the new University of Toulouse.  His poem Epithalamium Beatae Mariae Virginis was presented in 1230 to the Papal legate Romanus de Sancto Angelo, one of the founders of the university.  He was in Toulouse during the turbulent events of 1229\u20131231 , which he describes in De Triumphis. After the death of bishop Foulques of Toulouse in 1231, the Cathars regained influence at Toulouse, university teachers ceased to be paid, and many considered it too dangerous to remain in the city. Johannes de Garlandia was one of those who escaped, disguising himself as a serf or slave. He returned to Paris, where Roger Bacon heard him lecture. He was still there in 1245, writing his poem De triumphis ecclesiae; he finished it in 1252. He was probably still alive in 1270. Garland's grammatical works were much used in England, and were often printed by Richard Pynson and Wynkyn de Worde. He was also a voluminous Latin poet. The best known of his poems beside the De Triumphis Ecclesiae is Epithalamium beatae Mariae Virginis, contained in the same manuscript. Among his other works are his Dictionarius, a Latin vocabulary, the title of which is the origin of the word dictionary in English and several other languages; Compendium totius grammatices printed at Deventer in 1489; and two metrical treatises, entitled Synonyma and Equivoca, frequently printed at the close of the 15th century. A treatise on alchemy, Compendium alchimiae, often printed under his name, was by a 14th-century writer named Ortolanus . The 11th century writings on computus by Garlandus have occasionally been attributed to Johannes de Garlandia."

Before he was killed by the \"Soviets\", Metropolitan Joseph wrote: \"Do not judge me so severely, and clearly understand the following: I am not at all a schismatic, and I call not to a schism. but to the purification of the Church from those who sow real schism and provoke it. To indicate to another his errors and wrongs is not schism but, to speak simply, it is putting an unbridled horse back into harness. The refusal to accept sound reproaches and directives is in reality a schism and a trampling on the truth. In the construction of ecclesiastical life the participants are not only those at the head, but the whole body of the Church, and a schismatic is he who assumes to himself rights which exceed his authority and in the name of the Church presumes to say that which is not shared by his colleagues. Metropolitan Sergius has shown himself to be such a schismatic, for he has far exceeded his authority and has rejected and scorned the voice of many hierarchs, in whose midst the pure truth has been preserved\"."

During World War I he was correspondent for a Hamburg newspaper in neutral Rotterdam and learned to speak Dutch. Influenced deeply by allied atrocity propaganda and what he considered to be humiliating terms forced on German at the end of the war, his political opinions veered considerably towards the right although he soon recognized the potential dangers of extremism in German society. In 1923 he wrote his first book, about the reaction of public opinion to propaganda and national stereotypes on Germans abroad. In addition to his work as a journalist he became an erudite and popular public speaker, including on radio. In 1930 he was offered a position on the faculty of the University of Heidelberg but he refused, on account of the growing anti-Semitic climate in Germany which would make his life and that of his family  difficult. He had meanwhile become editor-in-chief of the journal of newspaper publishers, but was fired as a consequence of the new anti-Jewish laws. Baschwitz continued to write on the history of the press, the hatred of groups in society and censorship."

In 1948 he  became  associate professor in the  Faculty of Political and Social Sciences and four years later he was made full professor in press science, public opinion, and mass psychology. In July 1948 he founded and became the first director of the Dutch Institute for the Science of the Press which organized courses for the training of young journalists, as well as established ones. Baschwitz was considered to be a pioneer in communication science and mass psychology and contributed much to the international exchange of information and research among scholars in the field. First as a driving force behind the International Society for \"Publicistics\", and then as a key figure preparing the International Association of Mass Communication Research IAMCR. After 1945, one of his major efforts was to rediscover information on the field  had been lost because of the war and on the previous underground press. Gazette, the international journal that he founded in 1955, acted as a liaison centre for research and researchers from different parts of the world. His later works all dealt with the mass psychology of witch hunts, but were also a reflection on the mechanisms of mass persecutions in general, and those of Jews in particular. His magnum opus, in his own opinion, Hexen und Hexenprozesse: Geschichte eines Massenwahns und seiner Bekaempfung which discussed methods of fighting attempts at mass delusion appeared in 1963 and was printed in several languages. Baschwitz also contributed to the founding of a \u2018seminarium\u2019 for mass psychology, public opinion and propaganda at the University of Amsterdam.  In 1972 it was renamed the Baschwitz Institute for collective behavior studies, before merging with the public opinion section within the department for communication studies in 1985."

        "content": "In an early commentary in the newsletter Ferguson described her first glimmers of what she called \"the movement that has no name\" - a loose, enthusiastic network of innovators from almost every discipline, united by their apparent desire to create real and lasting change in society and its institutions. Her attempt to compile and synthesize the patterns she was seeing eventually led her to develop a second newsletter, Leading Edge Bulletin, and found its culmination in The Aquarian Conspiracy , the seminal work that earned her a lasting global reputation. The book's title led to some confusion, having to do with astrology only to the extent of drawing from the popular conception of the \"Age of Aquarius\" succeeding a dark \"Piscean\" age. The word conspiracy she used in its literal sense of \"breathing together,\" as one of her great influences, the philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, had done before her. Unabashedly positive in its outlook, the book was praised by such diverse figures as philosophical writer Arthur Koestler, who called it \"stunning and provocative,\" commentator Max Lerner, who found it \"drenched in sunlight,\" and United Nations Assistant Secretary-General Robert Muller, who described it as \"remarkable\" and \"epoch-making.\"  Psychologist Carl Rogers credited her with having \"etched, in unforgettable vividness, the intricate web of changes shaping the inevitable revolution in our culture,\" and said the book \"gives the pioneering spirit the courage to go forward.\" Philosopher and religious scholar Jacob Needleman predicted that the book would help to make \"New Age\" thinking \"more understandable and less threatening\" to the general public in America. This was borne out by its success, as The Aquarian Conspiracy steadily climbed to the best-seller list and its viewpoint began seeping into the popular culture.  Before long the book was being credited as \"the handbook of the New Age\" and a guidepost to a philosophy \"working its way increasingly into the nation's cultural, religious, social, economic and political life\" . Although the book was not explicitly political, it expressed early enthusiasm for the radical centrist perspective. In the \"Right Power\" chapter Ferguson writes, \"Radical Center ... is not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road. From this vantage point, we can see that the various schools of thought on any one issue - political or otherwise - include valuable contributions along with error and exaggeration.\" The book was eventually translated into some 16 foreign languages, and Ferguson became a sought-after speaker across North America and around the world, eventually traveling as far as Brazil, Sweden and India to convey her hopeful message. In 1985 she was featured as a keynote speaker at the United Nations-sponsored \"Spirit of Peace\" conference, where she appeared along with Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama of Tibet."

        "content": "Such validation did not come without a price.  Ferguson was attacked in some quarters for excessive optimism.  Others alleged that her \"new\" ideas were merely a repackaging of old notions of positive thinking, and some saw the \"New Age\" as merely extending the self-absorption that had marked much of the 1970s. Most persistently, some religious groups contended that the \"conspiracy\" was an attempt to subvert Christian views. This view, most notably expressed by author Constance Cumbey in her 1983 book The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow, was restated as recently as 2007, when one online essayist wrote that the Christian church \u201crightly discerned the New Age movement, as outlined in Ferguson\u2019s book, to be demonically inspired in anticipation of the ultimate unveiling of . . . the antichrist.\u201d It was inaccurately alleged that Ferguson, herself raised and confirmed a Lutheran, had written the book at the behest of the Stanford Research Institute with the goal of overtaking western culture with Eastern mysticism."

While the period was marked by undeniable evolution in the fields of politics, education and medicine, many other ideas and practices were transitory. Through it all Ferguson remained an optimist, albeit one who did not ignore the depth of society's chronic problems. Commenting in advance of the 1988 presidential election, she noted that \u201cthere is no panacea for our social maladies\u201d \u2013 but there remained the power of belief. \u201cOur \u2018foolish illusion\u2019 that we can effect change fosters in us the capacity to act \u2013 and therefore to bring about change.\u201d In 1987 The Aquarian Conspiracy was reissued, featuring a new introduction by another of her allies, futurist-author John Naisbitt . While slowly developing a follow-up work, Ferguson returned her primary focus to reporting on scientific research in Brain-Mind Bulletin. There she continued to explore the links between body and mind and new theoretical models in neuroscience, physics, psychology, education and health until the newsletter ceased publication in 1996."

        "content": "Ferguson died unexpectedly of an apparent heart attack on October 19, 2008. The Los Angeles Times described her as a \"galvanizing influence,\" and quoted her U.S. publisher, Jeremy Tarcher, who described his own personal epiphany when he first met with Ferguson and recognized the potential of the information she had collected. The New York Times called The Aquarian Conspiracy \"the Bible of the New Age,\" and mused that the once-radical ideas of her \"benign conspiracy\" may now seem commonplace. Offering a tribute on the website beliefnet.com , author Deepak Chopra described Ferguson as \"a one-woman movement for hope.\" He recalled being a young doctor who was studying meditation when he came across The Aquarian Conspiracy in the early 1980s, and realized the book had instantly unified a movement that otherwise seemed to be resigned to the fringes. At her death, Chopra wrote, Ferguson could rest in the knowledge that \"a watershed had been crossed,\" and that her \"leaderless revolution\" had steadily gained force around the world in the generation since the book was written. The Aquarian Conspiracy was re-issued in a \"Tarcher Cornerstone\" edition in August 2009, featuring a new introduction by Jeremy Tarcher.  In October 2009, Ferguson received a posthumous Distinguished Alumna award from Mesa State College. Divorced in 1978, Ferguson was subsequently married to Ray Gottlieb from 1983 to 1991. She retained the last name of her first husband who remains unnamed, with whom she had three children: Eric Ferguson , Kristin Ferguson Smith and Lynn Ferguson Lewis ."

He was the Automobile Racing Club of America Rookie-of-the-Year in 1968. During the late 1960s and 1970s Anderson was successful in competition, winning a number of track championships, along with several ARCA and American Speed Association races. He moved up to United States Auto Club sprint car and midget car racing in 1977, and ran his first NASCAR race, in the modified series, at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the fall of that year, winning the pole for the event. In 1979 he made his first NASCAR Winston Cup Series start, scoring a fifth-place finish in his first race, at Michigan International Speedway. He ran the majority of the 1980 season for a number of teams, scoring two top-10 finishes; towards the end of the year he was hired by John Rebham to drive for his team; in 1981, driving an Oldsmobile, he was involved in an accident, in which his car got airborne and flipped over multiple times before landing upside down, during the UNO Twin 125 qualifying races for the Daytona 500. Shortly afterwards, Rebham, impatient for results and under pressure from his sponsors, fired Anderson, replacing him with Donnie Allison. Anderson would only run a few additional races in the Winston Cup Series and Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series before retiring. Anderson won over 200 races of various types during his racing career. He was killed in a road accident on Interstate 85 near Charlotte, North Carolina on August 5, 1986, being survived by his wife Mary Ann and two children.

The band emerged from the UK world music crossover scene to become multi-award-winning masters of musical wanderlust with a pan-European fanbase to which they have toured to sold-out venues and headlined festivals ever since. Musically, the band spearheaded a movement of Jewish musicians to bring cultural styles into contemporary songwriting. The band blended their heritage with an emphasis on modern pop sensibilities reflecting their own individual interests in indie rock and alt-folk and the urban dance music of the clubs of London. The band takes its name from a Yiddish-derived exclamation popular in modern Hebrew meaning, approximately, \"Oh, my gosh!\"."

The earliest line-up had Josephine as the singer and Jonathan on trumpet who in turn knew violinist Sophie Solomon. Both of them knew bassist Leo Bryant, clarinetist Steve Levi who had been studying at Oxford Brookes and guitarist Jake Baum. This early line-up had about 4-5 gigs in Autumn 1998 in Oxford and then a gig in London in January 1999. A second guitarist Nik Ammar joined through mutual connections and then Jonathan met drummer Josh Breslaw. After university the band all moved to London and carried on playing together with a regular spot at an Albanian Bar called KOHA. Within a year this core line up started to solidify and the band found a fertile young Jewish urban arts scene in London to grow into and thrive."

        "title": "Oi Va Voi_History",
        "content": "Early years The London scene of the late nineties was a melting pot of world music genres and scenes that were beginning to coalesce around dance music, propelled and facilitated in part by the early days of the internet and to a great extent by the efforts of DJ's and broadcasters such as Charlie Gillett and Gilles Peterson. In the early days of the internet it was radio shows such as The Sound of the World and WorldWide that typified the outward looking perspective of the vibrant UK music scene of that time. JMI booked the band to play at the Southbank Centre in Autumn of 1999 to which conversations followed between the Jewish Music Institute and Oi Va Voi, where guidance, mentoring and financial assistance were given. The outcome was twofold, firstly YADARTS was created by Josephine and Jonathan to be an agency and hub for young Jewish music and arts to which they launched to a series on sell out concerts at Union Chapel. Secondly, JMI saw the potential in the band and had confidence in their ambition and so sponsored the members of the group to go out to KlezKamp Philadelphia where the band learned Klezmer from masters like Frank London of The Klezmatics. Josh recalled in interview,\"I was aware of the sound but never sat inside the music from the drummers stool, it was like BAM! I felt attached to it but no matter I never got the sense I had to play according to a set rhythm rather that I complimented and played drums and bass beats and other rhythms into it.\"The direction took to mix Klezmer and Jewish roots music with House, Drum and Bass, Dubstep and Hip Hop. The line-up found an audience amongst regular performances at The Spitz in East London which is where they found a crowd keen to hear more and it wasn't long before a following started to take shape. With a London following and a fresh new sound, heads started to turn and it wasn't long before shows in LA, Moscow and Washington followed. Former singer Josephine Burton left the band and went to set up the agency Yad Arts together with BBC DJ Max Reinhardt. Yad Arts arranged collaborations for the band, leading to a cross-cultural venture with Moroccan band Momo on a project called Roots & Harmony. The North African musical collaborations continued and they soon collaborated with the French Algerian pianist Maurice El Medioni of El Gusto. Digital Folklore Wanting to capture and record the music that the band had been developing, the band set out to record a self-funded debut. With recording and CD production costs still being high at this moment in time, the band were mentored by record producer, musician and WOMEX founder Ben Mandelson. The band applied to the Jewish Music Institute's Millennium Award Fund and received a grant to record and produce their first album, which was recorded at Livingstone Studio Wood Green and produced and engineered by Josh Breslaw 'and Lemez Lovas. \"Digital Folklore\". Some of the tracks on the album were later abridged and re-recorded for Laughter Through Tears, one example is the Hungarian folk song \"A Csitari\" whose vocals were performed by a female singer on the new album. The response to the album served to not only galvanise their following around the new release but was also nominated for a BBC World Music Award, went on to see them perform a showcase at Womex in Essen and then sign to Outcaste Records. Laughter Through Tears Laughter Through Tears is the second album released by London, England-based experimental band Oi Va Voi. Already having built a long resume of festival live appearances across Europe with no formal release, the band were honing their live show to perfection, the result was to cause the band to get booking requests from world music festivals, rock festivals, solidly touring Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Poland. The band, still self-managing whilst on tour, suddenly got a song from digital folklore called \"7 Brothers\" licensed to Outcaste for a compilation called \"Future of Flamenco\" which was compiled by the band's future A&R person, Martin Morales. Martin subsequently signed to the band to outcaste which marked a watershed for the band and the level on which they operated and performed in entered a whole new realm. The label offered the band mentoring to help the creative process reach a wider audience. The label focused on assisting the band with songwriting and draughted in singers to help strengthen the sound. Outcaste brought in singer KT Tunstall and suggested that the band write songs for her. The label presented the band with a vision of where they could be, taking many of the songs from Digital Folklore and putting them on the new album but with vocals. To add to that, the label brought in producers Grammy Award, Bacon and Quarmby to produce the album. The legal team was headed by Nicky Stein, the label had a great vision for the release and the press hotly anticipated its release. Some of the tracks on the album were originally on the band's debut, Digital Folklore, one example is the Hungarian folk song \"A Csit\u00e1ri\" whose vocals were performed by a male singer in the older album, and by Judit N\u00e9meth in Laughter Through Tears. The album includes a remix of \"7 Brothers\" as a hidden track, it is found after the 3 minutes and 7 seconds of silence after \"Pagamenska\". Having signed to Outcaste Records. The band recorded the album in the studio and had additional production from Moshik Kop and Toni Economedes plus guest singers - Judit Nemeth, Earl Zinger, Lenny Breslaw and Mayer Bogdanski. The album had a strong urban production which was also complemented by numerous remixes which included Hefner and Matthew Herbert Big Band accompanying its release. With the professional team, a well-crafted product and a groundswell of following behind them, the band released the album to a huge response. The album came out in October 2003 with launch show at Bush Hall and was followed by a great press response followed by an extensive European tour in February 2004. So buoyant was the band that on returning to the UK they did a follow up tour May 2004. This in turn carried on into the summer festival circuit, including Glastonbury, Cambridge Folk Festival, Big Chill, Larmer Tree, a whole host of others. After the UK, the band then returned to Europe to switch from venues to festivals for the entire summer of 2004 which saw them break into some of the larger festivals such as Exit Novi Sad, Sziget. After the album release and a year of touring the band returned to London, KT Tunstall finished her role within the band and went to do her solo album, Eye to the Telescope which was released by Relentless later in 2004 to huge acclaim. The band then set about auditioning new singers to replace KT Tunstall and started working on a new record. Sophie Solomon started to write for a solo project. Nick Mander went from managing elements of the band's interests and to stepping in as their manager. The band won the Edison Award in Holland. The band left Outcaste records in 2005 and went to sign with V2 Records and began to work on their second official release. OI VA VOI Oi Va Voi is the third studio album released by the English, London based experimental band Oi Va Voi. After the international success of Laughter Through Tears, the band's second album lived up to the well documented challenges of expectation for any band to deliver on a successful debut. Despite the enormous success that the band had enjoyed by the release of their debut, the band was going through a period of flux. With KT Tunstall having left to work on her own career, Sophie Solomon also left to pursue a solo career that culminated in the release of her album Poison Sweet Madiera. Lemez Lovas took a sabbatical from the band due to his health but carried on working on song writing and composition. The band worked with singer Alice McGlaughlin and producer Mike Spencer at Miloco Studios in London and Zaza Studio in Tel Aviv, Israel. With songs like Yuri, Dissident, Balkani and Spirit of Bulgaria, the strong post-soviet themes ran through the album as the band embraced the emerging post-soviet Eastern European music scene that was steadily reaching a mainstream audience in the UK and Central Europe. In London the vibrant scene established around the Spitz moved from East to West. The band were a pivotal part of the Radio Gagarin club night, Notting Hill Arts Club which was set up by Josephine Burton and Max Reinhardt and on the first night the band headlined a billing with US/Israel band Balkan Beat Box. The pan-European fanbase was established and expanding weekly with the live bookings flooding in. Leo Bryant left to pursue other interests but remained part of the set up and occasionally performed with the band. Lemez Lovas left the band to pursue other interests and projects such as Shtetl Superstars and Yiddish Twist Orchestra. With bookings flooding in, the band embarked on a solid touring programme for two whole years across Europe. Singer Bridget Amofah joined the band, as well as Lucy Shaw on Bass, Anna Phoebe on Violin and David Orchant on Trumpet.  During the middle of this schedule the band played Glastonbury's Avalon Stage in 2007. Over the next two years the band developed a strong performing presence and it was in this period of the burgeoning East European and Balkan music scene that Oi Va Voi found a huge popularity across the Eastern Europe and with that Turkey opened up to them. The Turkish audience found a deep connection in the band's sound with its mix of Eastern European, Balkan, Jewish and Middle Eastern modes and rhythms fused with metropolitan urban dance music and solid songwriting all contributed to them having week long residencies at Istanbul's Babylon Club, regional radio airplay, extensive regional touring and festival headline appearances sometimes touring twice within the same year. Whilst on the road, the band started writing new material and on returning to the UK, the band's relationship with V2 UK records changed as the label was cutting back on its roster of artists due to mergers and global restructuring. The band finished the two years of touring and began recording their next album with producers Bacon and Quarmby. Travelling The Face Of The Globe Travelling the Face of the Globe is the fourth studio album released by London, England based band Oi Va Voi. The first single of the album is \"Every Time\". The album produced by Bacon & Quarmby and RAK Studio. The band's line up was cemented from the two years on the road together and the material was a product of both their experiences of touring, hence the album title and the synergy of the musicianship of the line-up. Lead guest singer Bridget Amofah made her first recording debut for the band and the album also featured other guest singers; the French singer Dick Rivers and Hungarian singer Agi Szaloki . The album marked a critical return with The Guardian exclaiming \"Astonishing. On several counts\" and the Independent stating that \"This London band's third album is undoubtedly their most focused and consistently engaging.\" The band then performed a sold-out concert in London as part of a series of concerts at West London Synagogue . Following that debut show the band embarked on a successful UK and European Tour that culminated in a sold-out concert at Shepherds Bush Empire. Following that tour, Nik Ammar left to pursue other interests and was replaced by Michael Winawer. Live band and writing sessions OI VA VOI continued performing live in Europe and Turkey throughout this period. Memory Drop In 2015 the band began writing their new album. A core writing team consisting of founding members Josh Breslaw and Steve Levi along with longtime band members David Orchant and Michael Vinavar developed all of the music with Steve Levi writing most of the lyrics. Towards the end of the writing process new singer Zohara Niddam began collaborating and co-wrote on 4 of the 6 songs she performed on. In 2017 OI VA VOI recorded Memory Drop, their 5th studio album. Musicians performing on the album include: Steve Levi , Josh Breslaw , David Orchant , Michael Vinaver , Anna Phoebe , John Matts , Zohara Niddam , Georgina Leach . The album was produced by OI VA VOI drummer Josh Breslaw and mixed by Moshik Kop. Memory Drop was released on 9 November 2018 via V2 Records Benelux."

        "content": "Smeaton was born in Carleton Place, Ontario. When he was three years of age, Smeaton's family moved to the Westmount suburb of Montreal, Quebec. During his youth, Smeaton played baseball, football and ice hockey for the Westmount Amateur Athletic Association. By 1908, Smeaton had started refereeing ice hockey games, including those of the Montreal Insurance Hockey League. Smeaton moved to New York in 1910 and played one season of point for the New York Wanderers, while working for Spalding Sporting Goods. On the New York Wanderers Smeaton played alongside fellow Montreal Westmount products Sprague and Odie Cleghorn. Although praised by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle after the season as the best point player in the league the newspaper also pointed out that the Wanderers were involved in many rough house incidents and that Smeaton's \"principal fault lies in the fact that he is inclined not only toward dirty play, but also left a poor impression upon many of the spectators through his actions on the ice.\" Smeaton returned to Montreal for family reasons and joined Sun Life Insurance and started refereeing amateur games as a sideline.  In 1913, he joined the National Hockey Association as a referee. In his first game in 1913, between the Montreal Canadiens and the Montreal Wanderers, he was confronted by Newsy Lalonde after calling an offside. Smeaton promptly fined Lalonde $5 . In 1914, Smeaton joined the Canadian military to serve in the First World War. Smeaton served with the 11th Canadian Siege Battery in France. He was awarded the Military Medal for his service. Smeaton would later be active in the Norman Mitchell VC Branch of the Royal Canadian Legion in Mount Royal, where he lived. In September 1959, Smeaton organized a fund-raising intra-squad game by the Montreal Canadiens to benefit the branch's welfare fund. Smeaton became the NHL's first referee in chief when the NHL formed in 1917. Smeaton was offered the general manager's job of the expansion New York Rangers in 1926, but turned it down to remain in Montreal. He served as referee until 1930 when he became the head coach of the Philadelphia Quakers. The Quakers played only one season, 1930\u201331, finishing out of the playoffs. The following season, Smeaton resumed refereeing. He refereed in the NHL until 1937 when he retired. Smeaton, who officiated numerous Stanley Cup and Allan Cup finals, would be inducted as an on-ice official into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961. Part of the reason Smeaton retired from hockey was to attend to his business career. He retired to accept a promotion to assistant branch manager at Sun Life. Smeaton later became Ottawa branch manager before returning to Montreal to become Montreal branch manager in 1944. Smeaton would continue at Sun Life until retiring in 1954. Smeaton served as president of the Montreal Life Insurance Underwriters Association. P. D. Ross appointed Smeaton trustee of the Stanley Cup on February 24, 1946, replacing the late William Foran. During his term as trustee, the NHL was given control over the Stanley Cup, allowing the league to reject challenges for the Cup from other leagues. As part of his duties Smeaton would, on occasion, present the Cup to the Stanley-Cup winning championship team. Smeaton remained active in retirement with golf. Smeaton died on October 3, 1978 at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. He was survived by his wife Victoria. Smeaton is buried in Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal."

She notably had a lengthy and fruitful partnership with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, singing there for eighteen consecutive seasons between 1932 and 1950. Her greatest successes were from the dramatic soprano repertoire, particularly in operas by Richard Wagner.

She entered Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, where she initially began training as a soprano, but was redirected by her voice teacher into the mezzo-soprano repertoire after a serious bout of laryngitis. Shortly after graduating with a bachelor's degree, Bampton made her professional opera debut as Siebel in Gounod's Faust at the Chautauqua Opera in 1929. Her performance was positively received and she was invited to perform at the Worcester Music Festival in Worcester, Massachusetts that summer. In the fall of 1929 Bampton moved to Philadelphia after being offered a contract to join the roster of singers of the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company where she sang mostly comprimario roles over the next three years. Bampton made her PGOC debut as Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s in Georges Bizet's Carmen on October 23, 1929 with a cast that included Sophie Braslau as Carmen, Ralph Errolle as Don Jos\u00e9, Chief Caupolican as Escamillo, and Henri Elkan conducting. Other roles with the company included Mistress Bentson in Lakm\u00e9 , Feodor in Boris Godunov with Georges Baklanoff in the title role , Mama Lucia in Cavalleria rusticana , Alisa in Lucia di Lammermoor , the shepherd boy in Tosca , Myrtale in Tha\u00efs , the first maid in Elektra with Charlotte Boerner as Chrysothemis , Brang\u00e4ne in Tristan und Isolde with Paul Althouse as Tristan , Wellgunde in both Das Rheingold and G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung , and Waltraute in Die Walk\u00fcre . While performing at the PGOC, Bampton entered the Curtis Institute of Music in 1930 to pursue graduate studies in singing where her voice teachers included Horatio Connell and Queena Mario. She also had the opportunity to attend masterclasses given by Lotte Lehmann. While at Curtis she developed a friendship with fellow students, composers Samuel Barber and Gian Carlo Menotti. Barber notably recruited her to sing in the New York premiere of his vocal chamber work Dover Beach in 1933. Bampton also sang several times with the Philadelphia Orchestra in the early 1930s under the baton of Leopold Stokowski. With the orchestra she notably sang the Wood-Dove in the United States premiere of Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder , was the soloist for a performance of Manuel de Falla's El amor brujo , and sang the role of Kundry in a concert version of Parsifal among other performances. Bampton made several appearances at the Bethlehem Bach Festival during the early 1930s. A recording of Bampton's performance of the Gurre-Lieder with the Philadelphia Orchestra reached the ears of Giulio Gatti-Casazza, then General Director of the Metropolitan Opera. Impressed with her performance, he contacted Bampton to come and audition for the company. She obliged and ended up being offered a Met contract. According to Opera News, Bampton initially hesitated to accept the invitation as \"she had doubts as to whether her true vocal range was mezzo or soprano and was concerned about her lack of stage experience.\" However, she relented and made her first appearance with the company for an out of town engagement in Philadelphia on November 22, 1932 as Laura Adorno in La Gioconda with Rosa Ponselle in the title role, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi as Enzo, and Giuseppe Sturani conducting."

        "title": "Rose Bampton_The Metropolitan Opera and international success: 1932\u20131950",
        "content": "Just six days after her Met debut in Philadelphia, Bampton made her first appearance at the actual Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, reprising the role of Laura. Over the next four years she sang mostly smaller role at the house: the Sandman in H\u00e4nsel und Gretel, Waltraute, Wellgunde, and the Voice from Above in Parsifal. The only two roles of more considerable size that she portrayed were, Amneris in Aida and Brang\u00e4ne in Tristan und Isolde. During these years she began a romantic relationship with noted Canadian conductor and pianist Wilfrid Pelletier who was a regular conductor at the Met and the husband of Queena Mario, Rose's teacher at Curtis Institute. After Pelletier divorced his wife, the couple married in 1937 and, although happily married, never had children. By the year of her marriage, Bampton was feeling highly frustrated with her lack of good roles at the Met. She therefore decided to establish herself in the soprano repertoire, beginning with a portrayal of Leonora in Il Trovatore at the Met on May 7, 1937 with Arthur Carron as Manrico. Her Met career at the Met flourished after this point with her roles at the house over the next thirteen years including Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, Elisabeth in Tannh\u00e4user, Elsa in Lohengrin, Kundry, and the title roles in Gluck's Alceste and Verdi's Aida among others. Her most frequent role at the house was Sieglinde in Die Walk\u00fcre alongside Lauritz Melchior. In January 1940 she showed an incredible level of musical versatility when she sang performances of both Aida and Amneris within a week of each other at the Met. Her last and 112th performance at the house was as Elsa on April 17, 1950 with Set Svanholm in the title role and Fritz Stiedry conducting. In addition to singing at the Met, Bampton sang with many other opera companies throughout the world during the 1930s and 1940s, including performances in Europe and South America. In 1936-1937 she toured Germany and Czechoslovakia in concerts. She made her debut at the Bavarian State Opera as Leonora in 1936, and that same year appeared at the Semperoper in Dresden. In 1937 she made her only appearance at the Royal Opera at Covent Garden as Amneris. That same year she began a decade-long association at the Civic Opera House in Chicago, singing first with the Chicago City Opera Company and later the Chicago Opera Company. Some of her more acclaimed portrayals in Chicago included Maddalena in Andrea Ch\u00e9nier, Sieglinde, and Elsa. Between 1937 and 1939 Bampton toured England, the Netherlands, and Sweden in concerts. In June, 1939, she was in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, for the Community Concert Association. She sang at the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires every year between 1942 and 1948, making her debut with the company as the Marschallin in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier. At the Teatro Col\u00f3n she tackled several roles that she never performed anywhere else, most notably several heroines in Strauss operas , Eva in Die Meistersinger, Agathe in Der Freisch\u00fctz, and Countess Almaviva in Le nozze di Figaro. In 1946 she appeared in operas at the Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro. In 1949 she sang two roles at the San Francisco Opera, Sieglinde and Donna Anna. In autumn 1950 she made her only appearance with the New York City Opera, singing the Marschallin. Bampton also worked actively as a recitalist and concert performer during the 1930s and 1940s. She was a regular guest artist with the New York Philharmonic and other orchestras. A fruitful professional association with Arturo Toscanini began in 1936, when Bampton sang in Debussy's La Damoiselle \u00e9lue with the NYP, and included several broadcasts with the conductor and his NBC Symphony Orchestra. In 1944, she performed the role of Leonore for Toscanini's radio broadcast of Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Others in the cast included Jan Peerce and Eleanor Steber. The performance, originally broadcast in two parts, each on a separate week, was released years later on LP and still later on CD. It was Toscanini's first radio broadcast of a virtually complete opera - all of the music was included, but all of the dialogue was omitted."

        "content": "Bampton and her husband both decided to leave the Met when Rudolf Bing was appointed the company's new general manager in 1950. Bampton stated in a 1989 interview that, \"Both of us got the feeling that we wouldn't be happy with the new regime.\" She continued to appear in operas into the early 1960s, although her opera schedule after 1950 was sparse in comparison to the schedule she kept in the 1930s and 1940s. Bampton's last opera performance was in Dialogues of the Carmelites as  Mme. de Croissy at Mount Saint Mary College in Newburgh, New York in 1963. She continued to perform sporadically in recitals and concerts into the early 1970s. Her husband died in 1982 and she never remarried. After her opera career ended, Bampton embarked on a second career as a voice teacher, serving for lengthy periods on the voice faculties of Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School . She also had shorter stints on the faculties at University of North Carolina School of the Arts, Drake University and Adelphi University."

After finishing his theological studies in 1949, Land\u00e1zuri Ricketts served briefly a faculty member of the Franciscan Theological Seminary in Puerto Ocopa.

His appointment coincided with a radically modernising military dictatorship under Manuel Odria. Efforts at such reform were repeated until 1980. As Archbishop, he collaborated with these efforts for sweeping agricultural and institutional reforms to take Peru into the modern world and develop its great economic potential. He believed that these would improve social conditions in the country. By 1962 he had been selected as Primate of Peru and was made a Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Aracoeli by Pope John XXIII in June 1962. He made great efforts, aided by the Jesuits in Peru, to consolidate the vast archives of the Lima Archdiocese. These had accumulated since Spanish colonisation of Latin America and were invaluable sources of the history of the region."

        "content": "In the following period Land\u00e1zuri Ricketts led during a period when priests rapidly developed liberation theology and a theory of resistance to the military dictatorship under Ricardo Perez Godoy who ruled Peru. Land\u00e1zuri Ricketts responded to this with considerable support, also trying to ensure that the laity and nuns had considerable say in local decision-making. He became a major participant as Acting President in the 1968 Medellin Conference. He was regularly elected as the leader of local episcopal conference almost without opposition until he reached the age of 75 in 1988. During this period, in accordance with his Franciscan ideals, Land\u00e1zuri Ricketts left the Archbishop's palace and moved into a small house in a working-class area of Lima. Although he served on the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue during the 1970s, his relationship with the Vatican soured after the ascension of John Paul II. That pope believed that liberation theology posed problems for Catholicism and was too involved in opposition to temporal political systems. Despite being an extremely respected prelate, Land\u00e1zuri Ricketts had to accept more conservative Opus Dei bishops and sympathisers being appointed in Peru during the 1980s and 1990s. Due to his advancing age, he resigned his role as head of the South American Bishops' conference in 1989. He retired from the see in 1990 and was succeeded by Augusto Vargas Alzamora."

As a 16-year-old rookie in 1943, he was the youngest player to appear in a National League game that season. McKee was one of many ballplayers who appeared in the Major Leagues only during World War II. He made his major league debut on August 18, 1943, in a home doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals at Shibe Park. The best game of his short career, however, came on October 3, 1943, the last day of the season, when he started the second game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field and pitched a complete game, winning 11\u20133. The losing pitcher was Cookie Cuccurullo, who was making his major league debut. Then, at 17, McKee became the youngest pitcher in the 20th century to throw a nine-inning complete-game victory on the final day of the regular season, a feat no one has accomplished since. McKee made his last pitching appearance for the Phillies on September 26, 1944. Overall, he posted a 1\u20130 record and a 5.87 earned run average in five games , allowing 10 runs on 14 hits and six walks, while striking out one in 15 innings of work. He later switched to outfield and spent nine seasons in the minor Leagues spanning 1944\u201357, collecting a batting average of .287 and 115 home runs in 1,173 games. In 2014, McKee died in his hometown of Shelby, North Carolina, 15 days short before of his 88th birthday."

        "content": "Collins was born in Great Titchfield Street, London, son of William Collins Sr., an Irish-born picture-dealer and writer. He showed a great aptitude for art from an early age, and was for a while an informal pupil of George Morland. In 1807, he entered the schools of the Royal Academy , and exhibited at the Academy for the first time in the same year. In 1809 he was awarded a medal in the life school, and exhibited three pictures\\: Boy at Breakfast, Boys with a Bird's-nest and a Portrait of Master Lee as he spoke the Prologue at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1811, Collins sold a picture entitled The Young Fifer to the Marquis of Stafford for 80 guineas , and the next year produced the work which made him famous, The Sale of the Pet Lamb, which was sold for 140 forty guineas and engraved by S. W. Reynolds. He now became the chief support of his family after the death of his father and found some valuable patrons, especially Sir Thomas Freeman Heathcote, Sir John Leicester, Sir Robert Peel, Sir George Beaumont, and Lord Liverpool. In 1814 two pictures, The Blackberry Gatherers and The Birdcatchers won him an associateship of the Royal Academy . In 1815, Collins undertook a sketching tour of the coast near Cromer and produced a Scene on the Coast of Norfolk which was acquired by the Prince Regent.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?maker=13083&object=407233&row=0 |title=Scene on the Coast of Norfolk |publisher=Royal Collection}}</ref> In 1817 he visited Paris with Leslie and Washington Allston and painted The Departure of the Diligence from Rouen, and the Scene on the Boulevards \u2013 these were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1818. He also painted several portraits about this time. In 1820, Collins was elected a Royal Academician , presenting as his diploma picture The Young Anglers. In 1822 he married Harriet Geddes, sister of the portrait painter Margaret Sarah Carpenter. He continued to exhibit with popularity and travel in England and Scotland. In 1826 he painted The Fisherman's Departure, , and in 1828 made a tour of the Netherlands and Belgium, living for short time in Boulogne in 1836. Rustic Hospitality was painted in 1834 and in 1836 Sunday Morning and As Happy as a King, the subject of the latter being suggested to Collins by the story of a country boy whose ideal of regal happiness was swinging on a gate all day and eating fat bacon. In September 1836, Collins left London for Italy, where he remained for two years, occupying himself with advancing his knowledge of painting, but he had to return due to illness. He then began a series of pictures depicting Italian life, including Poor Travellers at the door of a Capuchin Convent near Vico, Bay of Naples and A Scene near Subiaco, both exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839. They were followed in 1840\u20131841 by two New Testament subjects: Our Saviour with the Doctors in the Temple, and The Two Disciples at Emmaus. From 1840 to 1842 Collins was librarian to the Royal Academy and in 1843 moved to a large house at 1 Devonport Street, Hyde Park Gardens. In 1840 he visited Germany and in 1842 the Shetland Islands, the latter inspiring a series of illustrations for Sir Walter Scott's novel Pirate, which appeared in the \"Waverley\" edition of the book. In 1846 Collins's Early Morning was exhibited. Ruskin commented, \"I have never seen the oppression of sunlight in a clear, lurid, rainy atmosphere more perfectly or faithfully rendered, and the various portions of reflected and scattered light are all studied with equal truth and solemn feeling.\" Collins also produced some watercolours such as The Rat-catcher, Landing Fish, A Street in Naples and Kentish Peasant Girls, and did several etchings, most of which were given to the British Museum by Mrs. Collins, along with engravings of his best works."

Her ideas and doctrine of Eros as reported by the character of Socrates in the dialogue are the origin of the concept today known as Platonic love."

        "title": "Diotima of Mantinea_Identity",
        "content": "The name Diotima means one who honors or is honored by Zeus, and her descriptor as \"Mantinik\u00ea\" seems designed to draw attention to the word \"mantis\", which suggests an association with prophecy. However, she is not described or depicted as a priestess or prophetess, but simply as a 'clever woman' and a 'non-Athenian'. Since the adjective includes the word nik\u00ea, \"Diotima Mantinik\u00ea\" has been heard as a pun in Greek indicating \"Diotima prophet of victory\". . The adjective \"Mantinik\u00ea\" would make her come from the Peloponnesian city of Mantinea, which was allied against Athens at the time of the dialogue. In one manuscript her description was mistranscribed mantik\u00ea rather than Mantinik\u00ea, which may be at the root of her persistent misrepresentation as a \"priestess\". Since there is no evidence for 'Diotima' outside Plato's Symposium, it has been doubted whether she was a real historical personage rather than a fictional creation. However, many of the characters named in Plato's dialogues correspond to real people living in ancient Athens. Plato was thought by some 19th and early 20th century scholars to have based Diotima on Aspasia, the companion of Pericles who famously impressed him by her intelligence and eloquence, but they offered no evidence other than a general resemblance. Aspasia herself is a character in Plato's dialogue Menexenus, and it has been argued that Diotima could be an independent historical woman known for her intellectual accomplishments, though she is otherwise unattested. In the Symposium, Diotima expounds ideas that are different from both Socrates's and Plato's, though with clear connections to both. Socrates also claims to have learned from her on more than one occasion. These indications have been used to argue for Diotima's independent existence; but more plausibly they may account for why Plato does not directly attribute \"Diotima's doctrine of Love\" either to Aspasia or to Socrates . In 2019 Armand D'Angour extracted new evidence from the text of Symposium to suggest that at least the main model for Diotima was Aspasia : the connection of the name 'Diotima' to Pericles ; and the relationship of the action of \"postponing the Plague by 10 years\" to the notorious misconduct by Pericles at the siege of Samos in 440-439, which will have caused concerns about divine retribution falling on Athens that in the event did not appear to come to fruition until the Plague of 430-429. A first century bronze relief found in Pompeii depicts Socrates and an unnamed female figure, along with a winged Eros; although some have supposed the seated woman in the image to be Diotima, others have argued her appearance would suggest she is in fact more likely to be Aphrodite or Aspasia. Writings from the second through the fifth centuries A.D. refer to Diotima as a real person, although Plato is probably their only basis for this. A second century AD reference to Diotima can be found in the works of Lucian.  The suggestion that she was a fictional creation was not introduced until the 15th century by Marsilio Ficino. This hypothesis recalls the practise of using fictional characters in other Platonic dialogues , and draws on the fact that Diotima is not mentioned by any contemporary sources and because her name and origin could be understood as symbolic ."

        "content": "In Plato's Symposium the members of a party discuss the meaning of love. Socrates says that in his youth he was taught \"the philosophy of love\" by Diotima, who was a seer or priestess. Socrates also claims that Diotima successfully postponed the Plague of Athens. In a dialogue that Socrates recounts at the symposium, Diotima says that Socrates has confused the idea of love with the idea of the beloved. Love, she says, is neither fully beautiful nor good, as the earlier speakers in the dialogue had argued. Diotima gives Socrates a genealogy of Love , stating that he is the son of \"resource and poverty \". In her view, love drives the individual to seek beauty, first earthly beauty, or beautiful bodies. Then as a lover grows in wisdom, the beauty that is sought is spiritual, or beautiful souls. For Diotima, the most correct use of love of other human beings is to direct one's mind to love of wisdom, or philosophy. The beautiful beloved inspires the mind and the soul and directs one's attention to spiritual things. One proceeds from recognition of another's beauty, to appreciation of Beauty apart from any individual, to consideration of Divinity, the source of Beauty, to love of Divinity.. . . and directing his gaze from now, on towards beauty as a whole, he should turn to the great ocean of beauty, and in contemplation of it give birth to many beautiful and magnificent speeches and thoughts in the abundance of philosophy. Recent interpretations Beginning in the 20th century, the dehistoricization of Diotima became a subject of interest for several scholars, including Mary Ellen Waithe. In 2005, Margaret Urban Walker summarized Waithe's research, stating that \"the evidence for Diotima's reality is substantial, even if not conclusive, and that her imaginary status appears to be a fifteenth-century fiction that stuck.\" In 2010, Australian novelist Gary Corby published The Pericles Commission, the first in a series of mystery novels taking place in ancient Athens.  Diotima is a major recurring character, the love interest, assistant sleuth, and eventually wife of Corby's protagonist, Nicolaos.  Corby's Diotima is a priestess of Artemis who was born the illegitimate daughter of a hetaira and an Athenian oligarch whose murder is Nicolaos's first commissioned investigation from Pericles. In 2019 Oxford professor Armand D'Angour published Socrates in Love: The Making of a Philosopher, presenting for the first time a wholly new case for identifying Diotima with Aspasia. His historical arguments are based on 1) the likelihood of Aspasia's involvement in the warding off of plague that Athenians will have expected to be brought on by Pericles' irreligious actions after his campaign against Samos in 440-39 2) the fact that 'Diotima' means 'honored by/honoring Zeus'; Pericles was called 'Zeus' in comedy and popular parlance, and he was notorious for the unusual honor that he bestowed on Aspasia."

        "content": "On 24 March 2003, de Berk was sentenced by the court in The Hague to life imprisonment for the murder of four patients and the attempted murder of three others. The verdict depended in part on a statistical calculation, according to which the probability was allegedly only 1 in 342 million that a nurse's shifts would coincide with so many of the deaths and resuscitations purely by chance. However, De Berk was only sentenced in cases where, according to a medical expert, other evidence was present or in which, again according to a medical expert, no natural causes could explain the incident. In the appeal on 18 June 2004, de Berk's conviction for the seven murders and three attempted murders was upheld. The crimes were supposed to have taken place in three hospitals in The Hague: the Juliana Child Hospital , the Red Cross Hospital and the Leyenburg Hospital, where de Berk had worked earlier. In two cases the court concluded that there was proof that de Berk had poisoned the patients. Concerning the other cases the judges considered that they could not be explained medically, and that they must have been caused by de Berk, who was present on all those occasions. The idea that only weaker evidence is needed for the subsequent murders after two have been proven beyond reasonable doubt has been dubbed chain-link proof by the prosecution and adopted by the court. At the 2004 trial, besides a life sentence, de Berk also received detention with coerced psychiatric treatment, though the state criminal psychological observation unit did not find any evidence of mental illness. Important evidence at the appeal was to be the statement of a detainee in the Pieter Baan Center, a criminal psychological observation unit, at the same time as Lucia de Berk, that she had said during outdoor exercise: \"I released these 13 people from their suffering\". However, during the appeal, the man withdrew his statement, saying that he had made it up. The news service of the Dutch Broadcasting Foundation and other media that followed the process considered the withdrawal of this evidence to be a huge setback for Public Prosecution Service . A series of articles appeared over the following years in several newspapers, including  Vrij Nederland and the Volkskrant, raising doubts about the conviction. The case was next brought to the Netherlands Supreme Court, which ruled on 14 March 2006 that it was incorrect to combine life imprisonment with subsequent psychiatric detention. Other complaints were not taken into consideration, and the evidence from a re-analysis by a Strasbourg laboratory was not considered relevant. The Supreme Court gave the matter back to the Court in Amsterdam to pass judgement again, on the basis of the same factual conclusions as had been made before. Some days after the ruling of the Supreme Court, de Berk suffered a stroke and was admitted to the hospital of Scheveningen prison. On July 13, 2006, de Berk was sentenced by the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam to life imprisonment, with no subsequent detention in psychiatric care."

        "content": "Of the seven murders and three attempted murders finally attributed to de Berk by the court, the court considered two of them to be proven by medical evidence. According to the court, de Berk had poisoned these two patients. The court then applied a so-called chaining-evidence argument. This means that if the several attempted or actual murders have already been established beyond reasonable doubt, then much weaker evidence than normal is sufficient to establish that a subsequent eight \"suspicious incidents\" are murders or attempted murders carried out by the same defendant. For the two murders found proven by the court in The Hague, many experts  do not exclude a natural cause of death. In the case where digoxin poisoning was alleged, and supposedly detected by independent measurements in two Dutch laboratories, the method used in those laboratories did not exclude that the substance found was actually a related substance naturally produced in the human body. The Strasbourg laboratory used a new method, a test of high specificity and sensitivity, and did not support the digoxin overdose hypothesis. In the second case, the intoxication could have been an overdose caused by a faulty prescription. For both children, it was not clear how and when de Berk was able to administer the poison. Regarding the digoxin case, the prosecution gave a detailed reconstruction of the timing. However, other parts of the evidence discarded by the prosecution showed by the time-stamp on a certain monitor that at the alleged moment of poisoning de Berk was not with the patient at all, and that the specialist and his assistant were with the patient at that time. The prosecution initially charged de Berk of causing thirteen deaths or medical emergencies. In court, the defence was able to show definitively that de Berk could not have been involved at all in several of these cases. For instance, she had been away for several days; the idea that she was there was due to administrative errors. Furthermore, all deaths had been registered as natural, with the exception of the last event. Even that last event was initially thought to be a death by natural causes by the doctors responsible for the child; but within a day, on being connected by other hospital authorities with de Berk and her repeated presence at recent incidents, it became classified as an unnatural death."

        "content": "The court made heavy use of statistical calculations to achieve its conviction. In a 2003 TV special of NOVA, Dutch professor of Criminal Law Theo de Roos stated: \"In the Lucia de B. case statistical evidence has been of enormous importance. I do not see how one could have come to a conviction without it\". The law psychologist Henk Elffers, who was used by the courts as expert witness on statistics both in the original case and on appeal, was also interviewed on the programme and stated that the chance of a nurse working at the three hospitals being present at the scene of so many unexplained deaths and resuscitations is one in 342 million. This value was wrongly calculated. If one wishes to combine p-values of the statistical tests based on data from three separate wards, one must introduce a correction according to the number of tests, as a result of which the chance becomes one in a million. Biased reporting meant that even this lower figure was invalid. Events were attributed to de Berk once suspicions began to fall on her, which could not have had anything to do with her in reality. The statisticians Richard D. Gill and Piet Groeneboom calculated a chance of one in twenty-five that a nurse could experience a sequence of events of the same type as Lucia de Berk. Philip Dawid, Professor of Statistics at the University of Cambridge , stated that Elffers  \"made very big mistakes. He was not sufficiently professional to ask where the data came from and how accurate the data were. Even granted the data were accurate, he did some statistical calculations of a very simplistic nature, based on very simple and unrealistic assumptions. Even granted these assumptions, he had no idea how to interpret the numbers he got\". The use of probability arguments in the de Berk case was discussed in a 2007 Nature article by Mark Buchanan. He wrote: At the initiative of Richard D. Gill, a petition for a reopening of the Lucia de Berk case was started. On 2 November 2007 the signatures were presented to the Minister of Justice, Ernst Hirsch Ballin, and the State Secretary of Justice, Nebahat Albayrak. Over 1300 people signed the petition."

She wrote on other occasions that she had a 'very great secret' and that she was concerned about 'her tendency to give in to her compulsion'. De Berk has stated that these were references to her passion for reading tarot cards, which she explains she did secretly because she did not believe it appropriate to the clinical setting of a hospital. However, the court decided they were evidence that she had euthanised the patients. According to the court, the reading of cards does not accord with a 'compulsion' nor with 'perhaps an expression of fatigue', as she described it at the time. De Berk's daughter Fabi\u00ebnne stated in an interview on the television program Pauw & Witteman that some of her mother's notes in the diaries are 'pure fiction' which she intended to use in writing a thriller."

According to the Public Prosecution, the report contained no new facts, but according to de Berk's defence the report proved that there was not a lethal concentration of digoxin in the first case. The Supreme Court accepts the facts reported by the judges at the appeal court, and is concerned only with jurisprudence and correctness of the sentence, given those facts.

        "content": "In general, in the Dutch legal system, cases are not re-opened unless a new fact, called a novum, is found. New interpretations by experts of old facts and data are generally not considered a novum. In spite of this, Ton Derksen submitted his and Metta de Noo's research on the case to the Posthumus II Commission. This ad hoc, non-permanent commission examines selected closed cases and looks for evidence of errors in the police investigation indicating \"tunnel vision\" and misunderstanding of scientific evidence. Derksen pointed out that the medical experts who had ruled out the possibility of death by natural causes had not been given all relevant information, that the hypothesis of digoxin poisoning was disproven, in particular by the Strasbourg analysis, and that the statistical data were biased and the analysis incorrect, and the conclusions drawn from it invalid. The commission announced on 19 October 2006 that this was one of the few cases it would consider in detail. Three men, recruited by the Public Prosecution service from the full Posthumus II committee, considered the following matters, having been instructed to focus on possible blemishes in the criminal investigation: Whether there were also unexplained deaths when Lucia de Berk was not present, unknown to the public prosecutor. Whether the expert witnesses were given all relevant available information. Whether scientific knowledge now threw a different light on the digoxin question. In October 2007, the commission released its report and recommended that the case be re-opened. They concluded that the case had been seriously marred from the start by tunnel vision. In particular, the same persons, chosen from close circles of the hospital authorities rather than on the basis of recognised relevant expertise, had first helped the hospital in its internal investigations, then had advised the police, and finally had appeared before the courts as independent scientific experts. They noted that there was strong disagreement concerning whether or not baby Amber had died of digoxin poisoning. On 2 April 2008, de Berk was released for three months because after re-examination of the death of the last \"victim\", a natural death could no longer be ruled out."

        "content": "On 17 June 2008, the Advocate-General of the Supreme Court, G. Knigge, made a request for the Supreme Court to reopen the case. On 7 October 2008 the court acceded to his request, acknowledging that new facts uncovered by Knigge substantially undermined earlier evidence. In particular, an independent team of medical researchers with access to all available medical information had reported to Advocate-General Knigge that the death which sparked the case appears to have been a natural death. The key toxicologist of the earlier trials had agreed with the new medical findings, pointing out that at the time of the trial, the court had only given him partial information about the medical state of the child. De Berk's statements about her doings on the night of that child's death had also been shown to be correct; indeed, during the period in which the courts had earlier concluded that she must have administered poison, the baby was actually being treated by a medical specialist and his assistant. De Berk was allowed to remain free while awaiting a retrial at the Court of Arnhem, which first adjourned while further investigations were made. The public prosecution had asked for extensive new forensic investigations, but this request was turned down by the court. Instead it commissioned further independent medical investigations into the cases of two more of the children, again allowing a multidisciplinary medical team access to all possible medical data concerning the children. At a session on 9 December 2009, the court stated that new integral medical investigations of the last nine months had confirmed that the cases of Amber, Achmed and Achraf were all natural deaths/incidents. These were the only cases where there was previously claimed proof of de Berk's culpability. The appeal hearing ended on 17 March 2010. Witnesses heard on the final day stated that the deaths at the Juliana Children's hospital were natural, sometimes caused by wrong treatment or bad hospital management, and sometimes unexpected because of faulty medical diagnosis. The behaviour of the nurses, including de Berk, during a couple of medical crises turned out to have been swift and effective, saving lives on several occasions. The Public Prosecution capitulated, formally requesting the court to deliver a not guilty verdict.  On 14 April 2010, the court delivered the not guilty verdict. It was the new finding of allegedly very high digoxin levels in autopsy blood in a child who was under the care of Lucia de Berk that resulted in her second conviction and life sentence for murder, i.e., at the 2004 appeal hearings. Moreover, this was despite it already being known at that time that digoxin levels on autopsy blood should be expected to be far higher than blood digoxin in a living patient. Living heart cells extract digoxin from the blood, concentrating it at levels up to 1,000 times the therapeutic digoxin levels in the circulating blood.  Heart cells die within minutes after death, allowing this digoxin to diffuse into the blood in the heart and in the surrounding large blood vessels \u2013 the sites from which blood is extracted by pathologists for blood chemistry analysis. Moreover, the autopsy blood did not originate from a proper blood sample but was squeezed out of a piece of gauze left inside the body after two autopsies had disturbed all the organs. Without the misinterpretation of the autopsy blood digoxin levels, there would not have been any consideration of digoxin poisoning \u2013 and no criminal investigation would have occurred. Furthermore, a chemical used in pharmaceutical natural rubber manufacture, MBT , leaches into injections . It can cause death as a cumulative toxin , or from anaphylaxis. MBT is measured as digoxin , using the test methods applied in the criminal investigations of Lucia de Berk and of a Canadian nurse, Susan Nelles. Susan Nelles was similarly charged with murder of children by digoxin poisoning at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children in 1981. She was not convicted because, as in the de Berk case, all the evidence was circumstantial. It was not until 1993 that the causes for high digoxin on autopsy blood were explained in the Canadian Nurse Journal.   The causes of high autopsy blood digoxin are discussed thoroughly in a 2011 book, \u201cThe Nurses are Innocent \u2013 The Digoxin Poisoning Fallacy\u201d . This book presents facts in defense of Susan Nelles which apply similarly to the false charge of digoxin poisoning directed against Lucia de Berk."

By the age of seventeen, she had begun her studies at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome with Edwige Chibaudo, and later with Rinolfi and Pedreni. Due to her wide vocal range, she was initially thought to be a soprano. She made her debut in Cagliari as Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana in 1934.  Within a year, she joined the Teatro alla Scala in Milan as Meg Page in Verdi's Falstaff. Soon she was given the part of Azucena in Il trovatore, which quickly became her signature role and was her debut role at the Metropolitan Opera in 1947. Other roles there included Santuzza, Ulrica in Un ballo in maschera, Mrs Quickly in Falstaff\u2014the latter she recorded in 1950, opposite Giuseppe Valdengo\u2014and Herva Nelli, with Arturo Toscanini conducting. She sang Wagnerian roles in Italian, as was the custom during this time period, including Brangaene at La Scala to the Isolde of Giuseppina Cobelli, and Ortrud. She made a notable recording of Brangaene's watch from Act 2. She also made recordings of lieder by Brahms and Strauss. She also recorded discs of duets from La Gioconda, Aida, and Adriana Lecouvreur with the dramatic soprano Gina Cigna, which reveal both her powerful voice and passionate temperament. She returned to Italy after her tenure at the Metropolitan opera , and she sang at La Scala until 1954 when she abandoned her stage career. By that time, the top notes in her voice had disintegrated. She accepted a teaching position in Ankara, where she remained until her death in 1962. She was known for her warm and natural voice, with its ample lower-register and full high-notes, as well as for her great temperament and passion."

His major breakthrough was beating John Lowe in the semi-finals of the 1983 British Open in which he finished runner-up to Eric Bristow. He lost again to Bristow in the final of that year's World Masters tournament. He made his World Championship debut in 1984 and reached the quarter-final, losing heavily 0\u20135 to Jocky Wilson. Gregory lost at the quarter-final stage of the World Championship in 1987, 1989 and 1993. He made his first semi-final in 1990, losing to Eric Bristow and his only final appearance came in 1992 \u2013 when he lost an epic match 5\u20136 in sets to Taylor. Having missed six darts for the title \u2013 two each for double 20, double 8 and double 10, which he has since jokingly referred to as the Bermuda Triangle \u2013 the match went all the way to a sudden death leg, which comes when the players reach 5\u20135 in both sets and legs. It was the first time this had happened in the World Championship's 14-year history and the match is often mentioned in discussions about the greatest darts match ever played; Taylor himself still lists this as his greatest ever match. Gregory won the bull-off to throw first in the decider, but had a bounce-out on his first turn and Taylor comfortably sealed the win. Gregory would become the only man to have lost a World Championship final having had darts at double to win, and remained so until Mark McGeeney did so in 2018. Whilst he was never a World Champion, he won many televised titles of the era, including the 1984 Unipart British Professional , the 1986 MFI World Matchplay, as well as becoming one of only seven players to win the News of the World Darts Championship twice , joining Tom Barrett and Eric Bristow as the only other players to win it in consecutive years."

        "content": "Mike Gregory was a controversial figure in a dispute which threatened darts during 1992\u201393. Darts had enjoyed a boom-and-bust period during the 1980s and 1990s. At first, sponsors and television companies could not get enough of the game with many major tournaments appearing on the screens. Despite the number of tournaments, the game had a poor image in the eyes of many \u2013 players were allowed to smoke and drink alcohol on stage during matches. The decision of ITV to scrap their World of Sport programme after September 1985 was the first serious blow, as the programme had covered darts on a regular basis. In the summer of 1988, both the BBC and ITV decided in quick succession to axe all their coverage of darts from the start of 1989, with the exception of the World Championship on the BBC. This massive slump in television coverage, combined with the poor image of darts to sponsors, made it very difficult for professional dart players to make a living from the sport. The players formed the World Darts Council in January 1992 with the intention to promote the game more on television and enhance their earnings which had severely diminished in the previous few years. The top 16 players including all the former World Champions stuck together in the WDC and Gregory won their first ever tournament, the 1992 Lada UK Masters which was televised regionally on Anglia Television, with Gregory defeating Dennis Priestley in the final. The players planned to wear WDC logos on their sleeves during the 1993 World Championship as a show of solidarity \u2013 but the governing body, the British Darts Organisation told the players to remove them. Later in the tournament, the WDC players issued a statement, saying that they would only participate in the 1994 World Championship, if it came under the auspices of the WDC, and that they only recognised the WDC as having the authority to sanction their participation in darts tournaments worldwide. Gregory won the second WDC Lada UK Masters in November 1993, defeating Bob Anderson in the final, and the WDC had just signed a contract with Sky Sports to broadcast its own World Championship and World Matchplay, starting in 1994. In late November 1993, Gregory had a change of heart and decided to return to the BDO. Chris Johns was the other player who had gone back to the BDO , but the other 14 stayed united. Gregory's decision to jump back to the BDO caused controversy, as the WDC players felt as if he had let them down, mainly as he had not told them of his decision in advance."

        "content": "The last BDO tournament in which the \"rebel\" players competed was the Finland Open in April 1993. Gregory's return to the BDO was in time for the 1994 British Open, which was staged on New Year's Day, and he reached the semi-finals. He was not able to compete at the Embassy World Darts Championship in 1994, as the tournament draw had been made before he decided to return to the BDO. Later in 1994, he won the Norway Open and Belgian Open. In 1995, he returned to the Lakeside for the first time since the split as the number five seed. He reached the quarter-finals, losing 3\u20134 to Martin Adams. His other WDF titles came in 1995, winning the Swiss Open and the Belgian Open. Gregory then won his last televised title in September 1995, when he won the Unipart European Masters tournament, which was held at Lakeside and broadcast on the BBC. In the semi-final, Gregory defeated the reigning BDO World Champion, Richie Burnett, and beat Peter Manley in the final. After Gregory's Unipart European Masters triumph, his form quickly faded. He suffered first round defeats in each of his next three appearances in the BDO World Championship at Lakeside \u2013 in 1996, 1997 and 1999. Since 1999, Gregory has failed to qualify for the competition. Other than a quarter-final appearance at the 2001 Welsh Open and a defeat to Davy Richardson in the final of the 2003 Scottish Open, he has not featured in the latter stages of Open events since 1999, and he no longer competes on the darts circuit, with his last appearance at a major WDF event being the 2005 Scottish Open when he reached the last 16. Gregory still plays County darts for Somerset and also plays for Radstock in the Somerset Super League where he plays with PDC Player Steve Grubb.  Rumours of comebacks arose for the second BetFred League of Legends and the 2010 Lakeside World Championship, but neither happened."

He became a member of the executive committee of the Fabian Society in 1972, serving until 1980. He was also the Society's chairman from 1977 to 1978. Leonard first stood for Parliament in 1955, when he contested Harrow West for Labour, a constituency which included his native Pinner. At the time, this was a safe seat for the Conservative Party, and he was thus unsuccessful in standing against their incumbent Member of Parliament, in an election which saw the Conservatives re-elected nationally. Fifteen years later, at the 1970 general election, he stood in the marginal Labour-held seat of Romford. Despite his party going into opposition, Leonard retained the seat. In Parliament, he introduced the Council Housing Bill in 1971, and the Life Peers Bill in 1973. During his time in the House of Commons, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Anthony Crosland. He was also a member of the Speaker's Conference on Electoral Law from 1972 to 1974. Leonard stood down at the subsequent February 1974 general election, when there were major changes made to his constituency boundaries, which saw Romford gained by the Conservatives, whilst Labour returned to power."

His 2020 book British Prime Ministers from Walpole to Salisbury: The 18th and 19th Centuries was well received by fellow authors Patrick Diamond and David Marquand. In later years, he had been critical of Britain's 2016 vote to leave the European Union and wanted Brexit to be reversed. In a 2018 letter to The Guardian, Leonard voiced his disapproval of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn removing Owen Smith from the shadow cabinet, and urged Constituency Labour parties to put forward motions asking for a second referendum on Brexit. In 2021, Leonard wrote to his local newspaper, the Camden New Journal, to say that whilst he would give his first preference vote in the London mayoral election to Labour's incumbent Sadiq Khan, he would be giving his second preference to Richard Hewison, a candidate standing under the slogan 'Rejoin EU: Brexit is broken'. Leonard stated that \"it is important to keep alive the prospect of a long-time aspiration to which many adhere.\""

He also created numerous animated sketches for Sesame Street, sometimes in collaboration with John Canemaker. In 1983, he and a former wife, animator Janet Perlman, formed an independent production company. Among their productions was the Sports Cartoons series, which aired on Nickelodeon in the United States. Lamb and Fedorenko collaborated on the first animation sequences for an IMAX film, Skyward, first presented at Expo '85 in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. With Fedorenko and Perlman, Lamb created the animated title sequence of the PBS series Mystery! based on the art of Edward Gorey, and a series of network ID's for YTV in 1991. Lamb was also a musician. In 1962, he released an album of songs on Folkways Records titled She Was Poor But She Was Honest after its title track, which included songs drawn from London music halls and pubs.

        "content": "Born in Leith, Brown was orphaned at the age of 7, along with his five brothers. He entered the coal-mining industry while still at school, but after becoming a Scottish schoolboy international, he decided to pursue a career in football. After playing for Belhavenock, Maryhill and Wishaw Juniors in the Scottish Junior League, he joined Scottish Second Division club East Fife for the 1926\u201327 season. After a successful season in which his team reached the final of the Scottish Cup, he earned a move to England, where he was signed by First Division side Burnley. Burnley narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division in Brown's first two seasons with the club, but they were unable to do so again in 1929\u201330. Two years later, Brown was named as the club's captain. However, in June 1935, he was signed by Manchester United for a fee of \u00a31,000. In his eight years with Burnley, Brown scored five goals in 228 league appearances. He made his debut for Manchester United in a 3\u20131 defeat away to Plymouth Argyle on 31 August 1935. He was the club's starting right-half and captain for most of the season, missing just two matches as Manchester United finished top of the Second Division to earn promotion to the top flight. He continued as the club's first-choice right-half for the next two seasons as they were relegated back to the Second Division and immediately promoted again. Having already lost the captaincy to George Roughton in 1937, Brown lost his place in the team to George Gladwin at the start of the 1938\u201339 season, before Jack Warner took over in November 1938, having been signed the previous summer. This meant that Brown made just three appearances for Manchester United in 1938\u201339 and he was allowed to leave for Bradford Park Avenue in February 1939. He made 13 appearances for Bradford Park Avenue before the end of the season and another in 1939\u201340 before league football was suspended due to the Second World War, during which he retired from football."

The Urbanauts were nominated for Best Pop Artist at the Montreal Independent Music Awards , but disbanded in 2001. Dee released a five-song EP in 2002. In 2004, Dee and his band members Martin Shank and Reda Enan appeared and performed the song \"Slapped\" in the film CQ2 directed by Carole Laure. In 2005, alongside Kid Loco, Sixtoo, Ariane Moffatt, and DJ Champion, Dee remixed a song on the album Jaune 2005 to commemorate the thirty-fifth anniversary of the release of the classic French-Canadian album Jaune by Jean-Pierre Ferland. Also in 2005, five songs by Dee were featured in the soundtrack of the French-Canadian indie film Horloge biologique directed by Ricardo Trogi. Dee released his first album in 2006 on the Canadian indie label La Tribu. Some songs on the album features the voice of female singer Mel, a close collaborator. He also released a song and music video entitled Lonelygirl on the web in 2006. The song is a tribute to or parody of the lonelygirl15 phenomenon, and the music video was shot in an exact replica of the lonelygirl15 bedroom. The video was added on 9 November 2006, and eventually featured on the front page of YouTube on 26 February 2007. A song by Dee called \"Miles and Miles\", whose lyrics include the line \"I like to live on the edge\", was in late 2006, the theme song of Ford's marketing campaign for the crossover Ford Edge. The campaign featured emerging performers and musical celebrities, including Beyonc\u00e9, Kelis, and Funkmaster Flex. Dee and his band have performed at various venues and music festivals in Canada over the years, including Montreal Jazz Fest, North by Northeast, Canadian music week, Mont-Tremblant Music Symposium, Divers/Cit\u00e9, Quebec City Summer Festival, and more. \"After a stint as a guest musician in Cirque du Soleil's 2011 summer production of Kingdom of Tin in Quebec City, DEE returned to the studio to begin a new creative cycle. The fruit of that effort is the concept album The Space Between Us, whose narrative evokes the interstellar expanse between an astronaut on a mission and his fianc\u00e9e back on Earth. Evidently, the time has come for DEE to launch into the stratosphere. The Space Between Us [was released] November 18th 2014.\""

Kachkar was convicted on Feb. 4, 2019, after a three-week trial, of eight counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Jack Kachkar, 56, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Donald L. Graham of the Southern District of Florida, who also presided over the trial in this case.  Judge Graham also ordered the defendant to pay $103,490,005 in restitution to the FDIC, as receiver for Westernbank.  A federal court found Kachkar guilty of eight counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Kachkar, a Key Biscayne, Florida resident and the former CEO and Chairman of a now-bankrupt multinational pharmaceutical company, was sentenced to 30 years in prison followed by five years of supervised release yesterday for his role his role in a $100 million scheme to defraud Westernbank of Puerto Rico. The losses triggered a series of events leading to Westernbank's insolvency and ultimate collapse. According to evidence presented at trial, from 2005 to 2007, Kachkar served as chairman and CEO of Inyx Inc., a publicly traded multinational pharmaceutical manufacturing company.  Beginning in early 2005, Kachkar caused Westernbank to enter into a series of loan agreements in exchange for a security interest in the assets of Inyx and its subsidiaries.  Under the loan agreements, Westernbank agreed to advance money based on Inyx\u2019s customer invoices from \u201cactual and bona fide\u201d sales to Inyx customers, the evidence showed. The trial evidence showed that Kachkar orchestrated a scheme to defraud Westernbank by causing numerous Inyx employees to make tens of millions of dollars worth of fake customer invoices purportedly payable by customers in the United Kingdom, Sweden and elsewhere.  Kachkar caused these invoices to be presented to Westernbank as valid invoices.  Kachkar made false and fraudulent representations to Westernbank executives about purported and imminent repayments from lenders in the United Kingdom, Norway, Libya and elsewhere in order to lull Westernbank into continuing to lend money to Inyx, the evidence showed.  In fact, these lenders had not agreed to repay Westernbank\u2019s loan.  Kachkar made false and fraudulent representations to Westernbank executives that he had additional collateral, including purported mines in Mexico and Canada worth hundreds of millions of dollars, to induce Westernbank to lend additional funds, the evidence showed.  In fact, this additional collateral was worth barely a fraction of that represented by Kachkar. During the course of the scheme, Kachkar caused Westernbank to lend approximately $142 million, primarily based on false and fraudulent customer invoices.  The evidence showed that the defendant diverted tens of millions of dollars for his own personal benefit, including for the purchase of, among other things, a private jet, luxury homes in Key Biscayne and Brickell, Miami, luxury cars, luxury hotel stays, and extravagant jewelry and clothing expenditures."

        "content": "Campbell was born in a family of a doctor, also named John Campbell. He studied first at the Methodist College in Belfast and then at Queen's University Belfast, graduating in 1884. He then won a scholarship to study at the Oxford University, at Hertford College. There he won the Junior Mathematical University Scholarship in 1885, became a College Fellow in 1887, obtained a Senior Scholarship in 1888, and eventually became a tutor. Campbell was noted as a charming and highly devoted teacher and a proponent of women's education. Campbell made his most notable contribution to mathematics in 1897 by introducing a formula for multiplication of exponentials in Lie algebras. This formula was later elaborated by Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Henry Frederick Baker . It was later systematised geometrically by Felix Hausdorff and became known as Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. In 1903, Campbell published a book on Introductory Treatise on Lie's Theory of Finite Continuous Transformation Groups where he popularised the ideas of Sophus Lie. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1905, and served as President of the London Mathematical Society from 1918 to 1920. He was tutor to the future literary scholar C. S. Lewis in 1917, assisting Lewis with Responsions in mathematics as part of the entrance requirements for Oxford University/. Campbell was the first mathematician from Oxford who was invited, shortly before his death, by the Cambridge University to examine the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos."

He completed three years before going to work in various agencies for interior design and furniture until 1986, when he began to design furniture. Van Severen's first piece, a long and slender steel table, has since been recreated as an aluminum model, which has been further refined over the years. In 1989 Van Severen produced his first wooden table. In 1990 he turned his attention to chairs. His work, hand-produced in his workshop in Ghent, reflects his quest for perfection in form, detail and fabrication. Van Severen subsequently worked in various different materials, from aluminium and plywood to bakelite and polyester. His initial work is still manufactured by Vitra and aiki today. Van Severen was also frequently commissioned as a decorator and furniture designer for private residence projects, teamed with Rem Koolhaas. They worked together on the Villa dall'Ava in 1990, then again in Bordeaux in 1996 . He has also created exhibition stands of steel shelving for use at shows and trade fairs. From 1997 onward, he had been involved in industrial production for Target Lighting , Obumex , Vitra , Edra , BULO , among others. Van Severen died of cancer at the age of 48. In accordance with his wish that his artistic legacy be unlocked and made accessible for research, Van Severen's family and friends created the Maarten Van Severen Foundation, which has since been working on the inventory of the Maarten Van Severen archive. The archive is kept in De Zwarte Doos \u2013 City Archives Ghent. Also partnered in the project are the Center for Flemish Architecture Archives, the Design Museum Ghent and the Department of Architecture and Urban Planning at Ghent University."

He was an intendant in Lille , Soissons , and Roussillon . Orry was named Controller-General of Finances in 1730 and combined this function with being director general of the B\u00e2timents du Roi in 1736, after the death of the duc d'Antin. Orry remained Controller-General until 1745, making him the longest continuously-serving holder of the office in the eighteenth-century. An able economist, Orry had to restore the dixi\u00e8me tax and declared the venality of municipal officials, successfully balancing the budget in 1739-40. Applying the principles of Colbert, he sought to develop the domestic manufacture of textiles and paper, and was involved in the production of porcelain in Vincennes in 1740. He supported trade with Canada and the Indies by reforming the statutes of the Compagnie des Indes. As director general of buildings, he established the bi-annual public Paris Salon, and became the vice-protecteur of  the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in April 1737. His directorship has, generally, been harshly judged. The marquis d'Argenson spoke with contempt of \"the bad, bourgeois taste of Monsieur Orry\". However, Orry's selection of Charles-Joseph Natoire in 1730 to decorate his ch\u00e2teau de La Chapelle-Godefroy reveals, on the contrary, a certain discernement in artistic matters: Natoire was one of the most promising young history painters, and his two main rivals - Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Carle Van Loo - were both abroad. As director general of Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es , Orry finished the Crozat canal and maintained and developed France's road system.  He sent to the intendants, in 1738, a detailed instruction on the duty for all inhabitants to spend a fortnight a year on the construction and maintenance of transport routes, classed in five categories. The corv\u00e9e made France's major road network the finest in Europe, and before the Revolution, a great part of the public roads existed thanks to this institution. This policy of improved communications also led to the completion of the Cassini map in 1744. Facing opposition from Madame de Pompadour, Orry resigned in 1745. He was the Treasurer of the Order of the Holy Spirit from February 1743 to his death in 1747."

Born in Toomevara, County Tipperary, O'Brien first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Tipperary minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 2001 league. O'Brien went on to enjoy a lengthy career, and won two All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals and one National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. At club level O'Brien is a two-time Munster medallist with Toomevara. In addition to this he has also won seven championship medals and three county final Man of the Match awards. His brother, Paddy O'Brien, is also an All-Ireland medallist with Tipperary.

After making his senior championship debut as a seventeen-year-old in 1999, Toomevara went on to qualify for a second successive county final. A 1-17 to 0-13 defeat of Nenagh \u00c9ire \u00d3g gave O'Brien his first championship medal. Toomevara's championship dominance continued for a third consecutive year in 2000. A 2-10 to 0-11 defeat of Thurles Sarsfield's gave O'Brien his second championship medal. Both Toomevara and Thurles Sarsfield's met in the county final again in 2001. O'Brien's side were on the verge of history by becoming the third side in history to win four championships in-a-row. A 1-22 to 1-13 trouncing of the Thurles club gave O'Brien his third championship medal. Five-in-a-row proved beyond Toomevara, however, the team reached the county final once again in 2003. A 3-16 to 3-13 defeat of Thurles Sarsfield's once again, gave O'Brien his fourth championship medal. Toomevara retained their title in 2004 following a comfortable 4-12 to 2-12 win over \u00c9ire \u00d3g/Golden. It was also a remarkable fifth championship medal in six seasons for O'Brien.  After a number of early exits from the provincial championship in recent years, Toomevara subsequently defeated Mount Sion by just a single point to give O'Brien his first Munster medal. After surrendering their county and provincial titles in 2005, Toomevara returned to the county championship decider once again the following year. A thrilling 1-21 to 2-14 defeat of Nenagh \u00c9ire \u00d3g, in which O'Brien top scored with 1-4 from play, saw Toomevara take the title once again. O'Brien later won a second Munster medal following a  controversial 2-9 to 2-8 defeat of Erin's Own of Cork. In 2008 O'Brien won a seventh county championship medal following a 2-14 to 0-17 defeat of old rivals Thurles Sarsfield's."

Tipperary remained undefeated during their 2008 league campaign and qualified for the decider against Galway. A Lar Corbett goal proved decisive in the 3-18 to 3-16 victory. It was O'Brien's first National League medal on the field of play. He later collected a second Munster medal as Tipperary continued their winning streak with a 2-21 to 0-19 defeat of a resurgent Clare. After scoring 1-4 in that game he was named man of the match. Tipperary retained their provincial crown in 2009, with O'Brien collecting a third Munster medal following a 4-14 to 2-16 defeat of Waterford. On 6 September 2009 Tipperary faced four-in-a-row hopefuls Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. For long periods Tipp looked the likely winners, however, late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their efforts to secure a 2-22 to 0-23 victory. Three successive Munster titles proved beyond Tipperary, however, in spite of a shock defeat by Cork in the provincial quarter-final, Tipperary used the qualifiers to good effect and qualified for the All-Ireland decider on 5 September 2010. Kilkenny were the opponents once again as they sought a fifth successive All-Ireland crown title. \"The Cats\" lost talisman Henry Shefflin early in the game due to injury, while Tipp's Lar Corbett ran riot and scored a hat-trick of goals before Noel McGrath added a fourth. The 4-17 to 1-18 victory gave O'Brien his first All-Ireland medal on the field of play. Tipperary reclaimed the provincial crown in 2011 following a huge 7-19 to 0-19 drubbing of Waterford in the decider. It was O'Brien's fourth Munster medal. Tipperary subsequently faced Kilkenny in a third successive All-Ireland decider on 4 September 2011. Goals by Michael Fennelly and Richie Hogan in either half gave Kilkenny, who many viewed as the underdogs going into the game, a 2-17 to 1-16 victory."

John O'Dwyer had the chance to win the game, however, his late free drifted wide resulting in a draw. O'Brien was also sprung from the bench in the replay which Kilkenny won by 2-17 to 2-14. O'Brien announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 26 November 2014. In a released statement he said \"I wish to announce my retirement from the Tipperary Hurling team. It has been an honour to have represented my county at senior level since my debut in 2001. I would like to thank everyone who has supported me and made it possible for me to play, most importantly my family and friends, my club Toomevara, the management and backroom teams throughout those years which are too many to mention and also the Tipperary public. I have made many great friends over those years and I would like to wish the current panel and management team the very best of luck.\""

        "content": "Constantine was born in Bulgaria, probably in Kostenets. In his youth, he attended school in Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria, and was taught by Andronik, a pupil of Patriarch Evtimiy of Bulgaria. He continued his studies on Mount Athos and in Constantinople. The Ottoman conquest of Tarnovo in 1393 drove him away and he settled in Stefan Lazarevi\u0107's Serbian Despotate, probably around 1402. He was warmly welcomed by the Despot, also a man of letters and a benefactor of education, and was given the position of educator at his palace in Belgrade. Constantine also frequented the Manasija monastery, where he helped establish the Serbian \"Resava School\" of literature. His high education, life experience and traveling earned him the nickname of \"Filozof\" , after Saint Cyril the Philosopher. On top of the travels in his youth, he traveled to the Holy Land and, judging by his description of three missions to the palaces of eastern rulers , he may also have participated. After the Despot's death in 1427, Constantine left Belgrade and entered into the service of kesar Uglje\u0161a Vlatkovi\u0107, in the area of Vranje, where he later died. Constantine's work had a tremendous impact on medieval Serbian literature and education. He introduced many classical Greek elements of literature and philosophy. His frequent citing of ancient philosophers and comparisons of the Despot in the Biography caused many to consider him a precursor to the Renaissance which, due to the Ottoman conquest, never occurred in Serbian culture."

That order was only fulfilled four years later, after Stefan himself allegedly appeared in Constantine's dream and restated Nikon's order. The biography is one of the most interesting in the old Serbian literature because it contains not only facts about the Despot's life, but also geographic information and thorough descriptions of numerous historical events. He was apparently inspired by the imperial chronicles of Byzantine historians. The Biography of Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 begins with a geographic description of Serbia's natural beauties, going on to describe its residents, praising their character but also mourning their forthcoming fall to the Turks. An exhaustive story of court events and the Despot's life follows, with numerous Biblical and classical references and numerous historical data which have proven invaluable to later historians. On several occasions, Constantine used acrostics, with three masterpiece instances: in the introduction verses, in the titles of central chapters, and in the verses telling of his sorrow for the deceased Despot."

Constantine spoke and wrote a language which could not be identified with either the Bulgarian or Serbian vernaculars.

        "content": "The marriage of Johanna and Christian August turned out to be a mismatch, both because of their large age gap and their different personalities. The soldier husband was a sober and simple man, used to giving orders and not talking much, while his young wife loved socializing. In addition, Christian August could only afford a small townhouse on his military pay, but Johanna was used to the luxury of the ducal court of Br\u00fcnswick. There was also very little entertainment in Stettin compared to the life Johanna had lived as a child, which was full of balls, hunts and theatre plays. Johanna was unhappy, but remained an obedient and dutiful wife, and eighteen months after the wedding, on 21 April 1729, she gave birth to her first child. Everyone had hoped for a son who would have been an heir to his father, including Johanna, who wanted to raise a great ruler with a brighter career than her own as a compensation for having had to marry a minor prince. The baby was a girl, to the mother's great disappointment. She was named Sophie Auguste Friederike, and would later become Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. The labour was intense and life-threatening for Johanna, who had to lie in bed for 19 weeks after the birth to recover. She handed her child over to nurses and servants , and didn't show any affection for her. On 22 January 1729, Christian August was appointed commander of Stettin, which meant that the couple could move into the castle in the middle of the city. Still, Johanna was not satisfied with her position and her isolation from culture and high society, and started travelling to escape her home. She often visited Br\u00fcnswick, her childhood home, and she paid her respects to the King of Prussia every February in the carnival season. Much to her dismay, she was treated as a poor relative everywhere, pitied for having had to marry someone below her in rank. In these years, she had three more children: on 17 November 1730 William Christian Frederick, her favourite, whom she adored and rarely left alone, who suffered of rickets, on 8 August 1734 Frederick Augustus, who would succeed his father as Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, and on 10 November 1736 Auguste Charlotte Christine, who died at the age of two weeks. Her relationship with her eldest child remained strained, and, according to Sophie's memoires, Johanna was often violent and angry towards her with no reason. However, she wanted Sophie to contract an advantageous marriage, so she started bringing her along on her journeys from the age of 8. In 1739, they visited Johanna's brother, Adolf Frederick, Prince-Bishop of L\u00fcbeck , who had just recently become the guardian of Charles Peter Ulrich, the eleven-year-old oprhaned duke of Holstein-Gottorp, only living grandchild of Emperor Peter the Great of Russia , who was a prospective heir to both the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Sweden. In 1741, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Petrovna of Russia ascended to the throne as empress. Elizabeth had once been engaged to Johanna's brother Charles Augustus , who died shortly before the wedding, and Elizabeth cherished his memory her whole life. Johanna was quick to write a congratulatory letter, and later sent a portrait of Elizabeth's deceased sister, Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna, for which she received a very valuable portrait of the Empress. To further the relationship, Johanna sent a portrait of her eldest daughter Sophie to the Empress, who was pleased with her beauty. Meanwhile, the illness of William Christian, Johanna's favourite child was becoming more and more severe, despite regular cures in Baden-Baden and Karlsbad, and he died on 27 August 1742. Johanna was inconsolable. A few months later, on 17 December, she gave birth to her fifth and last child, a daughter, and asked to be allowed to name her after the Empress of Russia, who became the little Elisabeth Ulrike's godmother. In January 1742, Empress Elizabeth brought Peter Ulrich, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, only child of her late beloved sister Anna Petrovna to Saint Petersbourg, adopted him, and appointed him her heir. In turn, Peter renounced his claim the Swedish throne, and Elizabeth was able to appoint the new heir. She chose Peter Ulrich's guardian, Johanna's older brother, Adolf Frederick, which elevated her in rank. In November 1742, Christian August inherited the Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst with his brother, John Louis, and the family moved to Zerbst."

        "content": "On 1 January 1744 at dinner, Johanna was handed a letter from Otto Br\u00fcmmer, the Grand Marshal of Grand Duke Peter's court , who asked Johanna to visit Russia with her eldest daughter, Sophie, as soon as possible on the command of the Empress. Only a few hours later, a letter from Frederick II of Prussia followed informing Johanna that he saw a possibility to arrange a marriage between Peter and Sophie. On 10 January, the Prince, the Princess, and Princess Sophie traveled to Berlin to see Frederick II. Here, the King secretly asked Johanna to become an agent of Prussia in Saint Petersburg, with the intent to remove Vice Chancellor Count Alexey Petrovich Bestuzhev, an enemy of Prussia who wanted Russia to be allied with Austria, and who opposed the marriage of Peter and Sophie. Johanna enthusiastically accepted. On 16 January the family and their company left Berlin. 50 miles from Berlin, Christian August said goodbye and returned to Zerbst, as the Empress had requested him not to go to Russia. Johanna took the pseudonym of \"Countess Reinbeck\" for the journey to hide her identity and the marriage plans. The travel  was very uncomfortable, they often had to sleep in scarcely furnished, roach-infected hotels. On 9 February they arrived in Moscow, just in time for the celebration of Grand Duke Peter's sixteenth birthday. Soon after their arrival, Johanna received news that her infant daughter Elisabeth Ulrike had suddenly died in Zerbst on 5 March . At first, Johanna had a great relationship with Empress Elizabeth, often expressing gratitude for her kindness towards them, but when Sophie fell ill and the doctors wanted to perform bloodletting on her, she refused to allow this, angering the Empress who then removed the mother from her daughter's bed and tended to Sophie herself. With her constant complaining during this period, Johanna became disliked in the Russian court. While in Russia, she was also working on the mission she received from the King of Prussia, trying to undermine Vice Chancellor Bestuzhev, who caught the letters between Johanna, the Prussian and the French ambassador, and the Prussian and French courts. When he eventually presented their copies to the Empress, she was furious and declared that Johanna must leave Russia right after the wedding. Between the bethrothal and the wedding, Johanna's relationship with her future son-in-law also deteriorated. On 21 August 1745 , Sophie and Peter married, and a few weeks later, Johanna had to leave. She didn't say goodbye to Grand Duchess Catherine Alexeievna, as her daughter was now known, whom she would never see again. She left with many presents from the Empress, but in Riga, she was informed that she had to retain a message to the King of Prussia, asking him to call back the ambassador who had been caught in the conspiracy against Bestuzhev, which was a humiliating punishment for Johanna's part in the ploy."

She was born on December 15, 1901, in Stamford, Connecticut, the oldest of three children of Frances Bancroft and William J. Long. She graduated from Vassar College. Long had worked at Vogue and Vanity Fair before finding fame at The New Yorker. Harold Ross hired her to write a column on New York nightlife. Under the name of Lipstick, Lois Long chronicled her nightly escapades of drinking, dining, and dancing. She wrote of the decadence of the decade with an air of aplomb, wit, and satire, becoming quite a celebrity. Because her readers did not know who she was, Long often jested in her columns about being a \"short squat maiden of forty\" or a \"kindly, old, bearded gentleman.\" However, in the announcement of her marriage to The New Yorker cartoonist Peter Arno, she revealed her true identity. She remained with The New Yorker as a columnist until 1968. She died in 1974."

        "content": "As soon as she graduated from college, Long moved to New York and began making a name for herself. She started at Vogue and then went to Vanity Fair, but Long found her niche\u2014and fame\u2014when Harold Ross hired her for his new magazine, The New Yorker, a sophisticated humor magazine designed to appeal to New York City's elite. Even with that target audience, it struggled financially in its early days; by May 1925, the astute Ross\u2014looking for ways to increase readership\u2014realized that Long was just the sort of writer who would. In the changing world of the 1920s, any truly modern magazine needed to appeal to both men and women, and the flapper\u2014high-spirited, beautiful, independent, sexually open\u2014did just that. At 23, Long was paid to review the speakeasies of New York. Her witty, satirical column was called \"When Nights are Bold,\" the title of which changed to \"Tables for Two\" with the issue for September 12, 1925 and ran until June 6, 1931. In addition to her observations on the patrons of speakeasies, it also included criticism of public officials, such as Manhattan District Attorney Emory R. Buckner, who conducted raids on speakeasies. As the archetypal flapper, Long's columns offered women a glimpse of a glamorous lifestyle where they could enjoy many of the same freedoms and vices as men. This new liberty was prompted by women gaining the right to vote in the United States in 1920 as well as the ways in which they defied the Victorian and Edwardian roles proscribed for women. Her comment \u201cI like music, and informality, and gaiety\u201d  is the epitome of the flapper mindset and what some critics felt were the sexual and moral failings of flappers in the Roaring Twenties. Different though they were, she and Ross managed to work together\u2014and knew when, and how, to accommodate the other. Zeitz notes that Long's cubicle was originally on the other side of the building from her assistant, and after growing tired of running back and forth to exchange information, they made the trip on roller skates. In time, Ross grew exasperated and gave them offices next to one another to spare himself and the other journalists such antics. Throughout her career, Long's work appeared in numerous formats, and in 1928, she was recruited by the editor and screenwriter, Gene Fowler, to contribute, along with Ben Hecht, Ring Lardner, Westbrook Pegler, and Walter Winchell, to The New York Morning Telegraph, and in 1936 Long was, for a short time, under contract to Paramount Pictures. She was considered the expert on New York's nightlife. Upon her death, William Shawn, editor of The New Yorker said that \"Lois Long invented fashion criticism,\" adding that she \"was the first American fashion critic to approach fashion as an art and to criticize women's clothes with independence, intelligence, humor and literary style.\""

        "content": "Hertzberger can be considered, along with Aldo van Eyck, as the influence behind the Dutch structuralist movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Among Hertzberger's best known buildings are the experimental houses known as \"Diagoon\" houses , the Montessori school in Delft and the administration building for the Centraal Beheer Insurance Company building in Apeldoorn . He believed that the architect's role was not to provide a complete solution, but to provide a spatial framework to be filled in by the users. This idea comes from the Participation movement, initiated in 1961 by John Habraken with his book \"Supports\". Herman Hertzberger was one of the first architects, who produced architectural solutions with user participation. Centraal Beheer and the \"Diagoon\" houses are belonging to the most inspiring examples of the international Participation movement. Insurance company Centraal Beheer has now left the building, and at the moment it is being converted into houses with roof gardens and various shared facilities. The starting point of Hertzberger \u2013 that the building can be used for multiple functions \u2013 can be tested with this. Hertzberger is criticized for the inelegance of the fa\u00e7ades of his buildings, as he is more interested in the operation and the interior of his buildings rather than in the aesthetics of their fa\u00e7ades. Later buildings with appealing facades \u2013 such as Waternet in Amsterdam \u2013 show that Hertzberger's style has evolved, also through collaboration with Laurens Jan ten Kate."

Sam went on to win every amateur title in Ireland and represented his country in the European, Commonwealth and Olympic Games. After travelling the world as an amateur Sam turned professional at the age of 23 and went on to fight for the British, European and World titles against the likes of Chris Eubank and Steve Collins.

Pettigrew, was the first Canadian surgeon to diagnose the heart condition known as aortic coarctation in 1953. After reading English, French and Italian Literature at the universities of Bishop's, Oxford, and Glasgow , Pettigrew studied cinema at IDHEC in Paris. At the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, he met Brion Gysin and Steve Lacy and began frequenting their artists' circle. If his work is influenced by Gysin's celebrated cut-up technique, the profound and lasting effect on his life was his friendship with Samuel Beckett. In 1983, Pettigrew launched a remake of Film starring Klaus Kinski, with Beckett as consultant and Raoul Coutard as cameraman. Kinski\u2019s scheduling, however, proved intractable. Beckett next proposed Jack Lemmon for the role but the project was abandoned when Lemmon explained he was incapable of competing with Buster Keaton . With Beckett and Pettigrew in 1984, the actor David Warrilow initiated Take 2, a tentative sequel to Film, but the project remained unfinished at the playwright's death in 1989. In 1990, Pettigrew settled in Paris to devote himself to filmmaking. In 1999, he co-founded Portrait et Compagnie with French producer Olivier Gal. He spends a short part of each year on Lake Memphremagog in the Eastern Townships of Quebec."

Nominated for Best Documentary at the European Film Awards, Europe's equivalent of the Oscars, the film established his reputation as a director of \"extraordinarily controlled\" feature documentaries. The interview transcripts were published in 2003 as I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon with 125 illustrations and a preface by Fellini biographer Tullio Kezich. The Italian director pays particular homage to Tullio Pinelli, his co-scriptwriter on such classics as I Vitelloni, La Strada, and La Dolce Vita. Other films include portraits of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Italo Calvino, and Jean Giraud.  His Balthus Through the Looking Glass, a study of the controversial French painter, was filmed in Super 16 over a 12-month period in Switzerland, Italy, France and the Moors of England. Esteemed by Guy Davenport, it was honored in a cycle of film classics by Jean Renoir, Marcel Carn\u00e9, and Jean Vigo at the Museum Ludwig in September 2007. In 2010, Pettigrew directed MetaMoebius, a cinematic essay on French graphic designer Moebius aka Jean Giraud for the Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain and Cin\u00e9Cin\u00e9ma Classic. His documentary, The Irene Hilda Story, based on the European cabaret tradition during the Second World War as experienced by French stars Irene and Bernard Hilda, Micheline Presle and Henri Salvador, was broadcast in France and Germany by ARTE France that same year. A mid-career retrospective of his work in film was held at the Centre des Arts d'Enghien-les-Bains from 5 October 2011 to 28 March 2012. His informal discussion with Ingmar Bergman on the Swedish director's affinities with Samuel Beckett's work was published in L\u2019\u00c2ge d\u2019or du cin\u00e9ma europ\u00e9en in 2011. In 2012, he completed Inside Italo , a feature-length study of Italo Calvino for ARTE France in co-production with Italy\u2019s Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit\u00e0 Culturali and the National Film Board of Canada. Starring Italian actor Neri Marcor\u00e8 and distinguished literary critic Pietro Citati, the docu-fiction uses in-depth conversations filmed at the writer's Rome penthouse a year before his death in 1985 and rare footage from RAI, BBC, and INA television archives. ARTE and SKY ARTE broadcast the 52-minute version on 19 December 2012 and 14 October 2013, respectively. Pettigrew is currently directing the first feature-length documentary on Carolyn Carlson, the France-based American dancer and choreographer. Begun in January 2012 and continuing into 2021, the film focuses on the creation of several major works by Carlson including Synchronicity , Dialogue with Rothko and Woman in a Room with Diana Vishneva, principal dancer with the Mariinsky Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre, Black Over Red with Marie-Agn\u00e8s Gillot, star dancer at the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet, as well as her latest choreography titled The Tree ."

Pot\u2019s paintings were sometimes allegorical in subject and he also painted group schutterstuk portraits, such as The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630. He was also influenced by painter and engraver Willem Buytewech. Pot was commissioned in London to paint portraits of King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria in 1632; the results now hang in the Royal Collection in London. Pot\u2019s type of genre scenes became known as \"Merry Company\" genre paintings. This included his 1635 piece, Portrait of a Young Woman, and a companion piece, now lost, as well as his 1630 piece, A Merry Company at Table. Both these paintings contain several objects considered sensual symbolism. A Merry Company at Table was set in a brothel, a popular theme in Dutch genre painting. The latter piece also contains a common theme addressed in Pot\u2019s works; beauty, age and death. This theme culminates in his well-known piece Allegory of Vanitas, usually referred to simply as Vanity, and which also contains motifs and symbols of sensual love. Other well-known Pot works are A Startling Introduction, The Coin Collector and Flora\u2019s Wagon of Fools , in which he poked fun at the fledgling tulip trade in Haarlem, where for a short while, the flower bulbs were sold by weight. His more standard, though still stylish, portrait works include his Portrait of Sir Robert Phelips and his works of the King and Queen of England."

He became a candidate to the professorship of painting at the Academy of Fine Arts of Florence after Pietro Benvenuti's death in 1844. His large picture in the Academy include The Entry of Charles VIII into Florence . Some of his smaller works, such as The Galatea and the small copy of Raphael's School of Athens , in the Galleria Tosio Martinengo at Brescia, give a more favorable idea of his talent. He painted one of the lunettes in the Tribune of Galileo at the Natural History Museum in Florence, and the more important series of scenes from the life of Caesar in one of the rooms on the ground floor of the Pitti Palace. His Assumption of the Virgin is found in the Museo dell'Opera of the church of Santa Croce. Other principal works include a Baptism of Clovis and a Madonna in fresco for the Pitti Palace. He painted two ceilings for the Borghese Palace at Rome representing  Toilet of Venus, and Venus carrying Ascanius. He died in Florence. Among his pupils at the Academy were Giovanni Fattori, Giuseppe Raggio, Enrico Pollastrini, Carlo Ademollo, Giuseppe Pierotti, Stefano Ussi, and Silvestro Lega."

        "content": "Blair Montgomery Thornton is a Canadian guitarist and songwriter most widely known for his work with the Canadian rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive . He also played in the Vancouver-based band Crosstown Bus prior to joining BTO. Thornton joined the group in early 1974 during the supporting tour for the Bachman-Turner Overdrive II album, replacing Tim Bachman shortly after that album was released. Thornton made his live debut with BTO at a March 1974 televised event for Don Kirshner's In Concert program hosted by Don E. Branker. Thornton's first album with BTO was the highly successful Not Fragile LP, released in the fall of 1974. With Thornton's arrival, BTO began incorporating \"dual-lead\" guitar solos in many new songs, with Thornton playing the lead guitar parts along with primary lead guitarist Randy Bachman. Such solos were not a major feature on the band's first two albums. In interviews years later, Randy noted that Blair Thornton was a welcome addition: He was known for playing in the Eric Clapton/Bluesbreakers style. [He] was more advanced on the guitar than my brother Tim, who was basically a rhythm player who left all the lead to me. I'm not that good. I would repeat myself, my vocabulary is limited and I didn't have time to go out and learn. So Blair brought in a new style. We now had twin lead guitars, and that made my job a lot easier; it gave us more versatility. As a songwriter, Thornton contributed two compositions to the Not Fragile album: \"Givin' It All Away\" and an instrumental called \"Freewheelin'\" that also wound up as the B-side of the No. 1 hit \"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\". He also co-wrote three songs for the follow-up 1975 album, Four Wheel Drive, including the title track , and co-wrote the Top 40 hit \"Take It Like a Man\" for the late 1975 album Head On. Two other songs on Head On, \"It's Over\" and \"Wild Spirit\", also credit Thornton and Turner as songwriters. Following Randy Bachman's departure from the group in 1977, Thornton took over as primary lead guitarist on their next two albums: Street Action and Rock n' Roll Nights , also contributing several compositions. Thornton rejoined the \"classic\" Not Fragile line-up in 1988 for a reunion tour. In 1991, Randy Bachman left the group again and this time was replaced by Vancouver guitarist-singer Randy Murray. This version of BTO proved to be the most enduring, as they toured together until the latter part of 2004. In 2014 Thornton along with original band members Fred Turner, Rob and Randy Bachman were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. Thornton currently enjoys a quiet semi-retirement with his wife, Shane."

        "content": "Marie \u00c9douard Vaillant was a French politician. Born in Vierzon, Cher, son of a lawyer, \u00c9douard Vaillant studied engineering at the \u00c9cole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, graduating in 1862, and then law at the Sorbonne. In Paris he knew Charles Longuet, Louis-Auguste Rogeard, and Jules Vall\u00e8s. A reader of Joseph Proudhon writings, he met Proudhon, and joined the International Workingmen's Association. He went to study in Germany in 1866. At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he returned to  Paris. It was during the Siege of Paris that Vaillant met Auguste Blanqui. Vaillant opposed the Government of National Defence, and took part in the revolts on 31 October 1870 and 22 January 1871. He was one of the four editors of the Affiche Rouge calling for the creation of the Paris Commune. In the elections of February 1871 he stood as a revolutionary socialist candidate for the National Assembly but was not elected. In March 1871 he was elected by the 20th arrondissement to the council of the Commune where he oversaw work on education. Following the bloody suppression of the Commune in late May 1871, Vaillant fled France with Eug\u00e8ne Baudin for Great Britain where he was part of the Blanquist tendency of the First International. He was sentenced to death in absentia in July 1872 and did not return to France until the general amnesty of 1880. Active in socialist politics, Vaillant was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1893, representing the 20th arrondissement. Although he had earlier been a convinced revolutionary, in the Chamber he generally followed a middle ground between the \"revolutionaries\" represented by Jules Guesde and the \"reformists\" represented by Jean Jaur\u00e8s. He was among the founder members of the French Section of the Workers' International , a socialist party uniting revolutionary and reformist groups. Vaillant supported a general strike to prevent French participation in the First World War, but following the assassination of Jaur\u00e8s and the outbreak of war, he joined the majority of socialists in supporting the Union sacr\u00e9e and harshly criticised pacifist members of the SFIO in his speeches. \u00c9douard Vaillant died in Paris on 18 December 1915. Schools in his birthplace of Vierzon, and in Gennevilliers, are named in his honour."

        "content": "Ferenc Paragi was a Hungarian athlete who, on 23 April 1980 established a world record of 96.72 meters in the javelin throw, eclipsing the global standard set by fellow countryman Mikl\u00f3s N\u00e9meth at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. This effort added more than two meters to the previous world record, fueling discussion and speculation regarding the likelihood of alterations to the javelin's design and flight characteristics. Proposed changes would finally take effect in 1986, following another two sizable improvements to the javelin world record; the first coming in 1983, when Tom Petranoff, then of the United States, added precisely three meters to Paragi's mark, and the other in 1984, when East German Uwe Hohn launched the 800\u00a0gram implement to 104.80 meters. Hohn's mark only came after the new design had already been officially proposed, and contrary to a popular myth had nothing to do with the change. Indeed, the primary reason for the change was to get rid of the then frequent flat or ambiguous landings, which often made it hard to assess if a throw should be declared legal, most famously in the high-profile case at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow where the eventual winner Dainis K\u016bla only progressed to the last three rounds with an apparently flat throw. Ambiguous landings were also much more difficult to measure accurately, compared to clearly legal ones where the javelin would stick in the ground at the landing spot. Paragi also competed at the Moscow Olympics. Even though his form had dipped a bit after another monster mark of 96.20 on 18 May 1980, there could be no question he was among the leading favorites. However, he had problems in the qualifying round, languishing more than five meters from a spot in the finals after two rounds with a sub-standard mark of 72.60, but saved himself by throwing 88.76 with his third and final attempt \u2013 the best mark in the whole qualifying competition by almost three meters. Next day in the final however, he could do no better than 79.52 and finished in tenth place. His qualification performance would have been enough for a bronze. Paragi was the Hungarian champion for 5 years."

He later served as superior of the canonries of Barcelona and then Sant Adri\u00e0 de Bes\u00f3s , and later as abbot of the Augustinian monastery of Saint-Ruf in Avignon . As abbot of Saint-Ruf, Olegarius had mediated the Mediterranean alliance between the Republic of Pisa, Kingdom of Cagliari, County of Provence, and Barcelona against the Almoravid pirates based on the Balearic Islands, resulting in the expedition of 1113\u201315. In the Gesta triumphalla per Pisanos, facta de captione Hierusalem et civitatis Mayoricarum of the Pisan deacon Enric , Olegarius names is misspelled Nogelarius or Nigelarius. At some point he joined the cofrad\u00eda of San Pedro de la Portella. Raymond Berenguer III named him bishop of Barcelona in 1116, and he was consecrated by Cardinal Boso of Sant'Anastasia in the cathedral of Maguelone in Occitania during the pontificate of Paschal II. In 1117 he went to Rome to pay homage to Pope Gelasius II."

He attended Toulouse in 1119, Rheims in 1120, First Lateran in 1123, Narbonne in 1129, Clermont in 1130, and Rheims in 1131. At First Lateran he had been declared legate a latere over the Crusade in New Catalonia and began to take the title dispensator or rector of Tarragona. At Narbonne the council confirmed the interprovincial archconfraternity for the restoration of the church of Tarragona which Olegarius had established on a more local level a year earlier. Members of the confraternity, lay and ecclesiastical, noble or otherwise, paid membership dues which went to Olegarius' archdiocese. At Clermont he probably met Bernard of Clairvaux and his arguments were influential in the condemnation of Antipope Anacletus II. He attended the council of San Zoilo in Castile on 4 February 1130. In the 1120s Olegarius reformed the monastery of Santa Eul\u00e0lia outside Barcelona, turning it into a community of Augustinian canons. Indeed, he was extensively involved in the Augustinian reform of the Catalan monasteries. In 1132 he excommunicated the monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll over the right to exercise justice for crimes committed on the monastery's land. In 1133 Olegarius granted the sheets and beds of all deceased clergy to the hospital of En Guitard in Barcelona."

He received the bull of confirmation and the pallium on 21 March. He was granted full jurisdiction over Tarragona and its countryside by Ramon Berenguer III\u2014through a process, agreed on 23 January 1118, whereby the secular lordship was granted to the church pending reconquest\u2014and also received ecclesiastical administrative rights over the projected diocese of Tortosa from Pope Gelasius. He was a close counsellor to Ramon Berenguer III and Ramon Berenguer IV. At some point after the Battle of Corbins\u2014a great Catalan defeat\u2014in 1124, Olegarius is said to have gone on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He cut his stay short at Antioch because of concern for Tarragona and had returned by 1127. Between 1126 and 1130 Olegarius was very active in rebuilding Tarragona, its churches especially. He also actively encouraged resettlement and colonisation and laboured to bring in knights and other soldiers for the new territory's defence. He \"conferred benefices regularly\", according to his vita. In 1126\u20131127, the period of his greatest activity in New Catalonia, he began encouraging a second Crusade effort. He began by compensating William V of Montpellier for the knights he had lent to Barcelona in 1124\u20131125 and by reconciling William with his son, Bernard IV of Melgueil, in order to strengthen the anti-Almoravid alliance. On 14 March 1129 he ceded this secular authority in the district of Tarragona to Robert Bordet, with whom he had an antagonistic relationship, with the title of princeps Tarraconensis, effectively the archiepiscopate's vidame or defensor. Instead Olegarius concentrated on restoring the metropolitan."

Olegarius helped establish the Knights Templar in Catalonia \"to serve God and fight in our land\" in 1134. In 1122 he was a signatory at Montearag\u00f3n to the foundation charter of the military confraternity of Belchite, founded by Alfonso the Battler. He played an important role in December 1134 when, at Zaragoza, he brokered a peace between Ramiro II of Aragon and Alfonso VII of Castile.

The latter is more representative of the small religious scenes on copper that make up most of his oeuvre, with a highly polished finish and borrowings from Rubens' treatment of the same subject. He also painted large altarpieces of churches in Flanders such as in Antwerp, Herentals, Ostend and Londerzeel. Many of his paintings can be regarded as copies or pastiches of original compositions by Antwerp painters such as Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, Gerard Seghers, Jan Boeckhorst, Hendrick van Balen, Erasmus Quellinus the Younger, Gaspar de Crayer and Artus Wolffort as well as of Italian masters such as Raffael and Guido Reni.

When they contacted the label and sent them a demo of her song \"Rise\", she was signed on to a single deal. After a while, she was signed to do a full-length album. When she released her first single \"Rise\" in 2006, it reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Shortly after releasing her debut album, she toured around the world. In 2009, James announced that she was working on a new album named Subconscious. James later stated that just before Rise was released, her father died and she took some time off before producing material for the new album. On the new album she worked with producer Shane Drasin since Morton was busy working on other projects. On June 22, 2010, James released the album. James released the song \"Wings of Faith\", dedicated to Japan, due to the tsunami in March 2011."

This might have been Viator's prior occupation, or refer to his family of origin. According to tradition, he was a lector or a catechist at the cathedral of Lyons, and was held in high esteem by the bishop of Lyons, Justus , and by the congregants. Around 381 Justus decided to live as a hermit in Egypt and Viator knowing his intentions, decided to follow his bishop and master. He caught up with the bishop at Marseilles, and together they boarded ship for Egypt. They died at a monastery of Scetes in AD 389."

In 374, Bishop Just assisted at regional Council at Valence. In 382, he attended the Council of Aquileia, as one of the two representatives of the Bishops of Gaul. Shortly after returning from the Council of Aquileia, Bishop Just confided to Viator intention to abandon the See of Lyons in order to take up the ascetical life a monk in the desert of Scete in Egypt. This decision seems to have motivated by a number of factors: his character, that of a mild studious and contemplative man; his age, for he had been a bishop many years and it seems he was already in his sixties; and by a sad event which had occurred in Lyons a short time before. A mad man had raced through the market place of the city, slashing wildly with a sword, and wounding and killing many citizens. He then dashed to the Cathedral and claimed the right of sanctuary. A mob gathered to storm the church. Bishop Just intervened, but on being assured that the man would be given a fair trial he agreed to hand the man over. No sooner had this been done, than the mob seized the man from the magistrate's guard, and killed him on the spot. The bishop came to believe that his failure to adequately protect the murderer had made him unworthy to continue to lead the Christian community, and he resolved to devote the remainder of his life to doing penance. In 381 Bishop Just secretly left Lyons for Marseilles, where he took ship for Alexandria in Egypt. Once there, they joined the community of monks in the desert of Scetes, about 40 or 50 miles south of Alexandria, beyond the mountains of Nitria, in the Libyan Desert. At that time the leader or abbot of this community was St. Macarius of Egypt , a disciple of one of the founders of monasticism in Egypt, St. Anthony . Macarius had a reputation for great holiness and a fierce asceticism. Most of the monks lived in cells, either dug in the ground or built of stones, and each out of sight of others. They came together only on Saturdays to celebrate the liturgy. They supported themselves by manual labor, and ate only the poorest of foods. Fasting, prayer, silence, and the keeping of night vigils, characterized their lives. Bishop Just died around 389."

Guthrie and J. S. Robinson in nearby Grimsby. He attained the FRCO diploma in 1925. He was then organist of Old Clee parish church and was supplementing his modest income by playing in the local theatre and by working as a compass adjuster. Seeking better prospects, he left for Canada in 1929 to become organist of St. Matthew's Anglican Church in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In 1936 while at St. Matthew's, he earned an external BMus from Durham University. After nine years, he left for the Church of the Ascension in Hamilton, Ontario, but stayed there only nine months. In 1937, he was back in Winnipeg, at the downtown parish of All Saints, where he developed a men and boys choir of national renown and initiated choral evensongs on the model of the Church of England cathedrals. Also in Winnipeg, he met and married his wife Eldred Curle. From 1946 to 1948 he was organist of Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver, British Columbia, director of the Vancouver Bach Choir, and an instructor at the British Columbia Institute of Music and Drama. He left Vancouver to become master of music at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney, Australia, but in 1953 returned to All Saints in Winnipeg. On a visit to Cambridge University on his way back from Australia, he experienced the annual Advent Carol service of King's College, and the next year introduced the tradition to Canada at All Saints' Church. He was briefly at Christ Church Cathedral in Nassau, Bahamas, before moving to All Saints' Cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1958, where he remained until his retirement in 1980. From 1968 to 1977 he also taught for the Department of Music of the University of Alberta in Edmonton. Bancroft was also known as a teacher, and instructed many students who went on to have careers as composers and organists, including Hugh McLean , Barry Anderson, Barbara Pentland, Douglas Bodle,  Elwyn Davies and Herbert Sadler. An active composer and arranger, Bancroft was an Associate Composer of the Canadian Music Centre and published numerous pieces, including anthems, motets, chorale and organ works.

In 1653 the Roos family returned to Germany, where Johann and his brother Theodor Roos worked together on a commission for a cloister in Mainz. Between 1654 and 1659, Johann worked for Ernst, Landgrave of Hesse-Rheinfels , where he painted a portrait of A Prince and religious scenes. In 1664 he was invited to paint at the court of Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine. Due to unsatisfactory working conditions, he moved with his family to Frankfurt in 1667 and was very successful, but lost everything in a fire in 1685. He died trying to save his belongings. Four sons and a daughter survived to become good painters. Though not registered as a pupil of Rembrandt, he made a copy of a painting by Rembrandt that he saw presumably in Amsterdam while he trained there from 1647 to 1653:"

Previous men reckoned High King had belonged to the great U\u00ed N\u00e9ill kindred, that large group of families who traced their descent from Niall of the Nine Hostages, which dominated much of central and northern Ireland from the 7th century onwards. No king from the south, where Brian's kindred, the hitherto rather obscure D\u00e1l gCais of the region of Thomond, had come close to dominating Ireland since the time of Feidlimid mac Crimthainn in the early 9th century, and none had been included in the more widely accepted lists of high kings in historic times. The last effective high king of Ireland from Munster was Cathal mac Finguine , and likely before him the prehistoric Crimthann mac Fidaig. Brian, building on his own resources, and those of the Viking towns of the south such as Limerick and Cork first took control of Munster, overthrowing the domination of the E\u00f3ganachta, a kindred which had dominated the kingship of Munster as effectively as the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill had dominated the High Kingship, and for just as long. With the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill disunited, and the resources of Munster, Brian first brought the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill to recognise him as an equal, and then as the master of Ireland. Brian met his death at the Battle of Clontarf on 23 April 1014, Good Friday, fighting against the King of Leinster and his allies. In myth and medieval pseudohistory this battle would become the last and greatest between the Irish and the Vikings and Brian the greatest of all Irish kings."

        "content": "Donnchad was the son of Brian and his wife Gormlaith . His year of birth is unknown, but a date in the 980s is likely, as it would accord with the political policy of his father at the time and mean that Donnchad was old enough to be militarily active in the 1010s, when he first appears in historical records. Brian's son Murchad, Donnchad's half-brother, died with his father at Clontarf. Another brother or half-brother, Domnall, had died in 1011. Two other half-brothers, Conchobar and Flann, are mentioned in some sources but leave no trace in the Irish annals. So, of Brian's sons, only Donnchad and his half-brother Tadc are known to have survived their father. According to Geoffrey Keating's account in Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn, an account which is not backed by any annalistic evidence, Donnchad, leading the survivors of the D\u00e1l gCais back from Clontarf, faced down armies from Osraige and Munster. The Munster king lists have Brian followed by D\u00fangal Ua Donnchada of the Cashel branch of the E\u00f3ganachta rather than by one of his sons. D\u00fangal did not die until 1025, at about the time that Donnchad started to make his presence felt outside Munster. His half-brother Tadc was assassinated in 1023\u2014the Annals of Tigernach add that this was done on Donnchad's order\u2014while he had himself lost his right hand in what may have been a failed assassination attempt in 1019."

Donnchad's main rivals were Diarmait mac Ma\u00edl na mB\u00f3, King of Leinster from 1042, and \u00c1ed in Ga\u00ed Bernaig, King of Connacht from 1046. Diarmait in particular was a serious threat; allied with Niall mac Eochada, King of Ulster, he installed his son Murchad as ruler of Dublin in 1052, driving out Donnchad's brother-in-law and ally Echmarcach mac Ragnaill. Toirdelbach first joined with \u00c1ed in the early 1050s, raiding into Tuadmumu in 1052 and inflicting a heavy defeat on Donnchad's son Murchad in Corco Mruad, the north-west of modern County Clare in 1055. By 1058 Toirdelbach had gained Diarmait's support, for he was present when Diarmait, the Leinstermen and the Osraige drove Donnchad from Limerick, which he burned so that it would not fall into the hands of his enemies, and defeated him at Sliabh gCrot in the Galtee Mountains."

Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn recounts that Donnchad granted the crown of Ireland to the Pope\u2014Pope Urban II according to Keating, who places these events in 1092\u2014and asked for papal aid to return him to power. This story is repeated in many 19th century and earlier works of popular history and is given as an explanation of how the English Pope Adrian IV came to issue the papal bull Laudabiliter granting rule of Ireland to King Henry II of England. Elsewhere Keating is more skeptical regarding other stories associated with Donnchad's time in Rome. He disbelieves claims that Donnchad took up with a daughter of a Holy Roman Emperor and had at least two sons from whom some later Old English families were descended. Keating writes that \"this story cannot be true, for before setting out on that expedition [Donnchad] was a very old decrepit man of over eighty years of age, and it is not likely that an emperor's daughter would covet intercourse with such a veteran\". Domnall's descendants were excluded from the succession in Munster. His grandsons Conchobhar and Cenn\u00e9tig, sons of Lorcan, became kings of Tulach \u00d3c in east Tyrone and operated against their cousins in the 1070s and 1080s."

        "title": "Alma Karlin_Biography",
        "content": "She was born in the Styrian town of Celje in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire as the daughter of Jakob Karlin, a major in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and Vilibalda Miheljak, a teacher. Her father died when she was eight years old. Alma grew in a predominately German-speaking milieu, and regarded herself chiefly as Austrian rather than ethnic German or Slovene. After completing her secondary education in Graz, she traveled to London, where she studied languages. She learned English, French, Latin, Italian, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Russian, and Spanish. In the later years, she also studied Persian, Chinese, and Japanese. She also spent six months in Paris, where she attended various languages courses at the Sorbonne. It was at this time when she started work on her dictionary of ten languages, including Slovene. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Karlin had to move to Sweden and Norway, since she was considered a persona non grata in the United Kingdom for being an Austrian-Hungarian citizen. It was in Scandinavia that she met the Swedish writer Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, who was so impressed by Karlin and her writing that she proposed her for a Nobel Prize. In 1919, she returned home, to Celje, then already part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Almost immediately thereafter, however, she started raising money for another journey. To this purpose, she opened a language school in Celje, where she taught up to ten hours a day, while her spare time was spent in painting and writing. On 24 November 1919, she took off again, this time on a nine-year-long journey around the world. She visited South and North America, the Pacific Islands, Australia, and various Asian countries. The last leg of her journey around the world was India. While she is often regarded as the first European women who travelled solo around-the-globe, she was the second woman to do so, preceded by Ida Pfeiffer. In January 1928, at the request of her dying mother, Alma Karlin returned home, herself exhausted by physical illness and deep depression. She never traveled again. She devoted most of her time to writing. Around 1934, she started developing a keen interest in the study of theosophy. In the later years, especially during World War II, she became close to Roman Catholicism. Karlin had chronicled her journey in hundreds of reports published in various magazines and newspapers, including the gazette of the Germans in Celje, the Cillier Zeitung, and the German newspapers Neue Illustrierte Zeitung and Der Deutschen Bergknappe. After her return home, she wrote numerous works of fiction and non-fiction. She wrote in German until the rise of the Nazi German regime, when she abandoned German as an act of protest. In Germany, her books were burned by the regime. She also wrote in English for the English-speaking areas. In 1937\u201338, the Franco-German journalist and anti-Nazi writer Hans Joachim Bonsack found refuge in her home. Soon after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 and the German occupation of Lower Styria, she was arrested and sent to Maribor where she waited for the extradition in Serbia, along with thousands of Slovenes. She was released thanks to the vigorous intervention of her lifetime friend Thea Gamelin. She could return to Celje, where she lived in house arrest. In spring 1944, she decided to escape to the southern Slovenian region of White Carniola, which was controlled by the Slovene partisan resistance. Even though she was severely ill, the Communist-led Partisans did not allow her to fly to the Allied-occupied town of Bari in Southern Italy. Instead, she was transported to Dalmatia where she stayed until the end of the war, when she moved back to Celje. She died of breast cancer and tuberculosis on 14 January 1950, in the village of Pe\u010dovnik near Celje and is buried alongside Thea Schreiber Gammelin in the Svetina churchyard. Almost inevitably, Karlin also became a collector and ethnologist. Most of the objects she acquired on her journeys she sent home, where she later set up a small private museum. Some of the exhibits are now housed in the Celje Regional Museum. Many of her writings have not yet been published; most of them are kept in the National and University Library of Slovenia and in the Berlin State Library."

However, after Abrahamian refused to take home the bronze medal, he decided to take it. However, the IOC would not allow him that medal, as it was not affected by Abrahamian's tantrum. Furious, Noumonvi began to attack the IOC, but was stopped by security. He was eventually banned from wrestling for a year, but as of 2010, his ban has been lifted. At the London 2012 Olympics, he controversially lost his quarter-final bout to Egypt's Karam Gaber. Two seconds from the end of the third period of that bout, he appeared to manage to take down his opponent. The referees validated the takedown but the judge overruled it.

        "content": "Robert Darley Waddilove was Dean of Ripon. Waddilove was born in November 1736, was son of Abel Darley of Boroughbridge. This branch of the Darley family had lived for four generations at Ripley in Yorkshire, but the Waddilove's father migrated to Scoreby in East Riding. He was educated at Westminster School and Clare Hall, Cambridge, of which society he became a scholar, but was unable to take a fellowship, having inherited landed property at Boroughbridge from his uncle, Robert Waddilove , president of Barnard's Inn, whose name he assumed. He graduated BA in 1759, and MA in 1762. He was curate of Wotton in Surrey, and in 1767 rector of Whitby. From 1771 to 1779 he was chaplain to Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham, ambassador to the Court at Madrid, during which time he exchanged Whitby for Topcliffe, and appointed himself rector of Cherry Burton, both in Yorkshire. In 1780 he became prebendary of Ripon, 1782 prebendary of York, and in 1786 Archdeacon of the East Riding. He was chaplain to Robert Hay Drummond and William Markham, Archbishops of York, and in 1791 became Dean of Ripon. He received the degree of LLD from John Moore . He held the deanery of Ripon with the archdeaconry until his death. During his residence in Spain Waddilove became friends with Abbe Bayer, tutor to the Spanish court, and had access to the library of the Escorial, where he collated the manuscript of Strabo for Thomas Falconer's edition , and obtained much useful information for Robertson's History of America, which the historian gratefully acknowledges in the preface. He also wrote remarks on the pictures in the king of Spain's collection which had formerly belonged to Charles I of England, translated Mengs's Essay on Painting , and received from Infante Gabriel of Spain a copy of the translation of Salluse made by the prince. In 1775, while in Spain, he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, for which he wrote several papers, among them 'An Historical and Descriptive Account of Ripon Minster' At his death he left to the library of York Minster a magnificent copy of Falconer's 'Strabo,' and of the rare work Bibliotheca Ar\u00e1bica del Escurial. Waddilove was an active magistrate and zealous in his ecclesiastical duties; in one instance he was recorded as having destroyed a stage to prevent an illegal boxing match in the village of Grewelthorpe near Ripon. He was president of the Society for the Relief of the North Riding Clergy, and earnestly promoted its interests. His private charities were extensive, and he gave on several occasions large sums to increase the endowments of parishes in his own patronage or that of the chapter. Waddilove died at the deanery, Ripon, on 18 August 1828. On 3 April 1781, at the age of 45, he married Anne Hope Grant, daughter of Ludovic Grant who was 10 years his junior. Anne died in May 1797 after a long and painful illness, aged just 51. Waddilove's eldest son, Thomas Darley Waddilove, died in March 1799 aged only 17, and his youngest son , Robert Darley Waddilove, died in Penzance, Cornwall in July 1813 at the age of 24. The only one of Waddilove's sons to father children was William James Darley Waddilove MA ; he became chaplain to the Duke of Roxburghe and married Elizabeth Anne, the sister of the statesman James Graham of Netherby. William was the father of naval lieutenant Robert Waddilove and admiral Charles Waddilove of Beacon Grange, Hexham. One of the Waddiove's daughters, Georgiana Maria, married Charles Christopher Oxley, of Minster House, Ripon."

After a period as an engineer's draughtsman in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, Hardiman resumed his studies and in 1920 was awarded the British Prix de Rome scholarship, spending two years at the British School at Rome. There he developed his style, a blend of naturalism and classicism influenced by Roman and Etruscan art and early fifth century Greek sculpture. Hardiman's best-known work is the Earl Haig Memorial on Whitehall in London. More universally admired are the heraldic lions flanking the main entrance to the City Hall, Norwich, a work which fully epitomises his style. He was appointed consultant sculptor to the building, having worked with one of the architects, Stephen Rowland Pierce, on the Haig Memorial. Hardiman also carved three large stone figures for the outside of the council chamber, and worked with other sculptors on the project including James Woodford and Eric Aumonier. Hardiman was elected Associate of the Royal Academy in 1936 and a full Academician in 1944. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1938 and the following year received their silver medal for his statue of Haig. In 1946 he won a gold medal for his bronze fountain figure for the New Council House, College Green, Bristol, which however was never erected. In 1918 he married Violet, daughter of Herbert Clifton White, of London, and had two daughters. He died at Stoke Poges 17 April 1949."

        "content": "Israel Horowitz was an American record producer who became an editor and columnist on classical music at Billboard magazine. Horowitz was born in New York City on September 6, 1916. He attended the Juilliard School where he studied the violin. He was drafted in 1943 into the United States Army Air Forces, where he was an ordnance technician. His commanding officer had him write a history of his battalion after having seen the quality of his writing while censoring his mail. He remained in the Army Air Forces as a writer and historian until 1947. After leaving military service, he was hired as a reporter by Billboard in 1948, where he first covered the coin-operated machine beat and moved on to cover music. He was hired by Decca Records in 1956. When Horowitz was hired by Decca, the label had not been producing classical music, and it was Horowitz's efforts that enabled Decca to compete with Columbia Records and RCA Records. He served as director of classical artists and repertory from 1958 to 1971. In this role he produced recordings by organist Virgil Fox, violinists Erica Morini and Ruggiero Ricci, conductor Leopold Stokowski, New York Pro Musica and classical guitarist Andr\u00e9s Segovia. Some of Horowitz's best known recording were the works he did with Segovia at Decca and as an independent producer. The albums they produced included lute and vihuela pieces, as well as original works written for Segovia by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Manuel Mar\u00eda Ponce and Alexandre Tansman. Segovia won the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1959 for the Golden Jubilee album they worked on. Segovia and Horowitz also collaborated on The Guitar and I, which was to include records with music on one side and autobiographical material on the other. The pair had produced the first two volumes in the planned series by 1971, when Decca ended its production of classical recordings. He returned to Billboard in 1973, serving variously as the publication's New York bureau chief, classical music editor and executive editor. After retiring from his editing responsibilities in the 1980s, he continued to write Keeping Score, a weekly column covering classical music until the early 1990s. After his retirement in 1994, Timothy White, then editor-in-chief at Billboard described Horowitz as \"one of the most distinguished and admired figures in the music industry, but also one of its modern architects, helping pioneer contemporary music journalism and criticism, as well as playing a consummate role as A&R executive and astute producer of some of the foremost classical artists of our era. Horowitz exemplifies the finest aspects of journalism and the arts. He was one of four survivors of American Airlines Flight 383 that crashed on approach to the Greater Cincinnati Airport on November 8, 1965 with 62 people on board. Horowitz died at age 92 on December 26, 2008 at his home in Closter, New Jersey. He was survived by his wife of 62 years, Mildred Horowitz, and two sons Robert, of Manhattan, New York, and Michael, of Bern, Switzerland."

He became the first person in the United Kingdom to hold a pilots certificate for an airship when the Royal Aero Club awarded him Airship Pilots Certificate No. 1. Willows was born in Cardiff, Wales on 11 July 1886. He was educated at Clifton College in Bristol, entering the school in 1896 and leaving  in 1901 aged 15 to train as a dentist. He built his first airship, the Willows No. 1, in 1905 when he was 19. It was first flown  from East Moors, Cardiff on 5 August 1905, the flight lasting 85 minutes. This was soon followed by an improved Willows No. 2, in which he landed outside Cardiff City Hall on 4 June 1910. No. 2 was re-built as No. 3 which he named the City of Cardiff before he flew it from London to Paris in 1910. This was the first airship crossing of the English Channel at night and the first from England to France. The journey was not without incident, including dropping the maps over the side during the night, and problems with the envelope caused the airship to land at Corbehem near Douai at two o'clock in the morning. With the help of the local French aviator Louis Breguet the airship was repaired and arrived at Paris on 28 December 1910. He celebrated New Year's Eve with a flight around the Eiffel Tower. Willows moved to Birmingham to build his next airship, the Willows No. 4. First flown in 1912, it was sold to the Admiralty for \u00a31,050 and it became His Majesty's Naval Airship No. 2. With the money from the Navy Willows established a spherical gas balloon school at Welsh Harp, Hendon near London, although this did not stop him building Willows No. 5 in 1913, a four-seater airship designed to give joy rides over London. During the first world war Willows built kite or barrage balloons in  Cardiff. After the war he continued with ballooning but on 3 August 1926 he died in a balloon accident at Hoo Park, Kempston, Bedford instantly, together with a passenger. Three other passengers died later that day either in hospital or on their way to it making 5 deaths in all There is a school named Willows High School built on his old airfield to remember him. There is also a pub called The Ernest Willows which is situated not far from the school."

As the renowned Nicaraguan poet Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo wrote, \"Ramos Mart\u00ednez is one of those who paints poems; he does not copy, he interprets; he understands how to express the sorrow of the fisherman and the melancholy of the village.\""

        "content": "Ramos Mart\u00ednez was born in 1871 in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, the ninth child of Jacobo Ramos and his wife Luisa Mart\u00ednez. His father was a successful merchant trading in jewelry, fine fabrics, silver, embroidered suits and hand-woven sarapes from Saltillo. All members of the Ramos Mart\u00ednez family were involved with their father's business and it was expected that the artist, too, would one day join the ranks of \"honorable merchant\". However, Ramos Mart\u00ednez's evident talent and instincts propelled him towards a career in the arts; a choice that his family ultimately supported. At the age of nine, one of Ramos Mart\u00ednez's drawings, a portrait of the governor of Monterrey was sent to an exhibition in San Antonio, Texas, and won first prize. A portion of that prize included a scholarship to study at the most prestigious art school in all of Mexico, the Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes in Mexico City.  Thus the entire Ramos Mart\u00ednez family relocated to Coyoac\u00e1n, a small town on the outskirts of Mexico City. From an early age Ramos Mart\u00ednez was recognized as prodigiously talented. As a student, his preferred medium was watercolor and he won numerous awards for his achievements. Though he found the teaching methods at the Academy repressive and counter-intuitive to his more emotional plein air impulses, Ramos Mart\u00ednez created a significant body of work that he was able to sell while still a student.  Gratifying as his youthful accomplishments were, the news from France, and the examples of the brilliance of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, persuaded the young painter that he needed to be in Europe to continue his education and define his career. Though his family was by no means poor, they did not have funds to support Ramos Mart\u00ednez's European dream. In a supreme bit of good fortune, Phoebe Hearst attended a dinner in Mexico City for the President of Mexico, Porfirio D\u00edaz, which featured place mats designed and painted by the young Ramos Mart\u00ednez. Hearst was so impressed with the decoration that she asked to meet the artist and see other examples of his work. After their meeting, she not only bought all of Ramos Mart\u00ednez's watercolors, but agreed to provide financial support for the artist's continued study in Paris."

        "content": "Ramos Mart\u00ednez's arrival in Paris in 1900 coincided with further development of the Post-Impressionist movement. He was able to see firsthand the work of Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Georges Seurat and Odilon Redon. Furthermore, Hearst's monthly stipend of 500 francs, combined with Ramos Mart\u00ednez's fluent French, afforded him a comfortable lifestyle and the ability to travel throughout Europe. While in Paris, Ramos Mart\u00ednez attended various artistic and literary salons and made the acquaintance of the modernist Nicaraguan poet, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo. Dar\u00edo and Ramos Mart\u00ednez became close friends, thus insuring Ramos Mart\u00ednez 's inclusion in a circle of rather extraordinary bon vivants such as Isadora Duncan, Paul Verlaine, Eleonora Duse, R\u00e9my de Gourmont and Anna Pavlova. Dar\u00edo wrote at length about the painterly and literary ideas that defined the creative output of both artists during those years. The two sojourned to Belgium and Holland to study the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh. The artist's works from this period are strongly influenced by the somber tonalities of the Dutch sky and sea. Also, it was in Brittany, that Ramos Mart\u00ednez began painting and drawing on newspapers, a material/medium he used to superb effect during his years in California.  When the artist discovered he had run out of drawing paper, he asked the concierge at the inn where he was staying during a holiday weekend if he had any paper suitable for drawing. The gentleman offered him discarded newspapers in abundance. In 1905, Ramos Mart\u00ednez began participating in the yearly Salon d'Automne in Paris, perhaps the most important of all the salons of that era.  Within a year of his first showing there, his painting Le Printemps was awarded the Gold medal. However, after this great acknowledgment, Hearst decided she would no longer give him his monthly stipend and Ramos Mart\u00ednez began the struggle of earning his living as an artist. Ramos Mart\u00ednez showed at a number of galleries in Paris. One of the leading art critics of the day, Camille Mauclair wrote that the work of Ramos Mart\u00ednez was in the same class as the finest Impressionist landscapes exhibited in Paris. Though sales of his artwork were proceeding, and Ramos Mart\u00ednez had achieved a degree of comfort as a 'Parisian', in 1909 he felt a strong desire to return home to Mexico."

        "content": "By the time Ramos Mart\u00ednez arrived in early 1910, Mexico was a nation in turmoil. The Mexican Revolution was beginning in earnest and the 30-year rule of President Porfirio D\u00edaz was on the verge of collapse due to the pressure of the political reforms of Francisco I. Madero. Within a year of the President's resignation in 1911, the art students at the National Academy called a strike in order to protest the 'aesthetic dictatorship' of the Academy. They demanded the establishment of a 'Free Academy' and proposed Ramos Mart\u00ednez as director. Hailed as a distinguished alumnus, a bona fide European success, and sympathetic to the students' cause, Ramos Mart\u00ednez became first the assistant Director and, by 1913, the Director of the Academy. Now, as Director, he was able to open the first of his Open Air Schools of Painting.  With the example of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists in mind and fortified by his sense of the primacy of the artist's personal vision, Ramos Mart\u00ednez's Open Air Schools redefined the nature of artistic instruction in Mexico. The first school was established in the Santa Anita Iztapalapa borough of Mexico City with an initial class of 10 students, including David Alfaro Siqueiros and Federico Cant\u00fa, who would later become successful artists in their own right. By 1914, Ramos Mart\u00ednez stepped down as Director of the Academy but opened another Open Air School in Coyoac\u00e1n. That same year, his students' work was featured in the \"Exhibition of Works from Public and Art Schools\" at the Spanish Pavilion and met with extremely favorable response. The political situation in Mexico remained extremely volatile for the next decade and by 1920 Ramos Mart\u00ednez was reinstated as Director of the Academy. Despite all the politics, the Open Air Schools flourished and Ramos Mart\u00ednez was acknowledged as a true innovator in the Mexican art world and frequently  called the 'Father of Modern Mexican Art'. To quote Ram\u00f3n Alva de la Canal in \"Los acaparadores de murales\", \"...the true force behind contemporary Mexican painting wasn't Diego Rivera; it was Alfredo Ramos Mart\u00ednez.\" Ramos Mart\u00ednez' art pedagocial ideas were introduced in Japan by the Japanese painter Tamiji Kitagawa, who worked as a teacher at the Open Air Schools in Tlalpan and Taxco during the 1920s and 1930s, and became an influential figure in the liberal art education movement in postwar Japan. While Ramos Mart\u00ednez invested most of his energy in teaching and the establishment of his Open Air Schools, he also continued his own work as a painter. In 1923, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold by King Albert I of Belgium in recognition of his contributions to the visual arts. In 1928, Ramos Mart\u00ednez married Maria de Sodi Romero of Oaxaca. Their daughter, Maria was born one year later, suffering from a crippling bone disease. Ramos Mart\u00ednez resigned as Director of the Academy and sought treatment for his daughter's condition. The family first traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and eventually settled in the milder climate of Los Angeles, with Maria under the care of Dr. John A. Wilson."

        "content": "Having relocated to Los Angeles in 1929, Ramos Mart\u00ednez was offered an exhibition by William Alanson Bryan, Director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art at Exposition Park. A number of subsequent exhibitions followed, with Mart\u00ednez developing a strong following in the Hollywood community. Warner Brothers art director and interior decorator to the stars Harold Grieve acquired a number of works by the artist and championed the artist's work to his clients.  Noted film directors Ernst Lubitsch and Alfred Hitchcock, costume designer Edith Head, screenwriter Jo Swerling, and actors Charles Laughton, Gary Cooper, James Stewart, and Beulah Bondi, among others, were collectors. Ramos Mart\u00ednez was also exhibited with great success in San Diego at the Fine Arts Gallery of Balboa Park and in San Francisco at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. It was there that celebrated Bay Area art patron Albert M. Bender first saw Ramos Mart\u00ednez's work.  Bender became a lifelong friend of the artist and acquired numerous works for his personal collection.  Furthermore, he purchased and donated Ramos Mart\u00ednez works to several San Francisco institutions, including the Legion of Honor, the San Francisco Museum of Art, the California Historical Society, and Mills College. In addition to his mastery of all conventional media including drawing, printmaking, watercolor, and easel painting, Ramos Mart\u00ednez was an extremely skilled muralist who excelled in the technically challenging art of traditional fresco painting. Though a number of his murals were destroyed, including those at the Chapman Park Hotel in Los Angeles and the Normal School for Teachers in Mexico City, several important examples have survived. These include the Chapel of the Santa Barbara Cemetery ; the La Avenida Caf\u00e9, Coronado, California ; and the unfinished fresco project, The Flower Vendors in the Margaret Fowler Garden at Scripps College, Claremont, California . The Scripps mural was commissioned by the College at the urging of Millard Sheets, the much loved California artist and long-time admirer of Ramos Mart\u00ednez. Another fresco, one of Ramos Mart\u00ednez' most significant works, the La Guelaguetza, which was named after the ancient Oaxacan celebration of the Earth's abundance, was commissioned in 1933 by screenwriter Jo Swerling for his Beverly Hills home.  Having fallen into obscurity for many years it was rescued before demolition of the residence in 1990. Alfredo Ramos Mart\u00ednez died unexpectedly at the age of 73 on November 8, 1946, in Los Angeles. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. At the time of his death, Ramos Mart\u00ednez was working on a series of murals entitled \"The Flower Vendors\" at Scripps College. The unfinished murals have been preserved as a tribute to the artist."

        "content": "After the artist's death, the Dalzell Hatfield Gallery in Los Angeles continued to showcase his paintings and drawings. Maria Sodi de Ramos Mart\u00ednez, the artist's widow, saw to it that Ramos Mart\u00ednez was included in numerous gallery exhibitions. Until her death in 1985, she was the primary champion of her late husband's work. In 1991, Louis Stern presented the first major retrospective of the artist's work since his death. The exhibition, \"Alfredo Ramos Mart\u00ednez ,\" was on view at Louis Stern Galleries in Beverly Hills from October 1, 1991, through January 6, 1992.  This exhibition was the foundation of the monumental Ramos Mart\u00ednez exhibition, \"Alfredo Ramos Mart\u00ednez , Une Visi\u00f3n Retrospectiva,\" at Mexico City's renowned Museo Nacional de Arte in April 1992. These two exhibitions became the cornerstones of a re-examination of Ramos Mart\u00ednez's work and subsequent development of a secondary market for these works. As with the other major Mexican modernists, indigenous peoples were the principal subjects in the mature works of Ramos Mart\u00ednez. In recent years, several of these paintings have realized high prices on the international art market. His 1938 painting Flowers of Mexico brought over $4 million at Christie's, New York in May 2007."

After graduating from Connecticut College in 1993, Armstrong was responsible for teaching high school students in summer classes at Wellesley College, for a program called Exploration. A colleague convinced him to pursue a media career, which resulted in him establishing a financial newspaper for young people in Boston. Titled BIB , this paper offered advice to young college graduates on entering the workforce. To finance the newspaper, Armstrong and friend Michael Dressler sold their mountain bikes and amounted to a debt of about $100,000. In the fall of 1994, Armstrong and Dressler closed down BIB to run a larger, rival newspaper, Square Deal at Harvard Square, following the death of its chief editor. Armstrong saw considerable potential for publishing online and earning revenue through advertising. He sold Square Deal and commenced working as an ad-sales director for I-Way, run by the Boston-based International Data Group. Armstrong was later appointed to Starwave, a Seattle-based online entertainment-and-news portal, in 1995. Disney acquired the firm in 1998.

At the time, the firm's revenues had dropped around 22% to just under $3.3 billion between 2008 and 2009. Bewkes appointed Armstrong as CEO of AOL on March 12, 2009, seeing him as a way to regain and secure the trust of Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and advertisers. Under Armstrong, AOL became a player in advertising. In 2009, Armstrong was named by Fortune magazine as one of the \"40 under 40\". Armstrong helped AOL rebrand as a content company, focusing on original material, and making the decision to cut the number of ads generated by the firm to make advertising more exclusive and appealing to the most prominent advertisers. In 2010, Time Warner formally consented to AOL becoming a privately traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. It resulted in a cut of the company's workforce by one-third and a reduction to often a single featured advert a day, instead of the 15 previously. That year, Armstrong sold AOL-owned social networking site Bebo for around $10 million, a reported eightieth of its original cost. Another 1000 employees were laid off in March 2011. According to the Cambridge University Press, Armstrong's strategy focuses on digital journalism in local communities, especially ones without their own newspapers. Consolidating the move into journalism came in June 2011 with the acquisition of The Huffington Post. Armstrong appointed Arianna Huffington, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of the paper as president. Armstrong launched a number of sites under the AOL banner which specifically cater to women, including StyleList.com, AOL Shopping, and KitchenDaily.com, and 60% of the readers at Patch Media are female. In the early 2010s, Armstrong has pursued a number of platform acquisitions for AOL, including the purchases of technology news portal TechCrunch in September 2010, Adap.tv in 2013 for $405 million, and Gravity in January 2014. Armstrong appointed Saul Hansell, a technology and finance reporter of \"The New York Times\" to run a journalism and engineering system for AOL called Seed, based on the concept that editors can make decisions on what to write about by compiling data and algorithms from the leading search engines like Google and social network sites like Facebook. By January 2011, Seed had a staff of 25 and had taken an active role in writing both news stories and compiling videos for AOL sites. The Patch remains a productive news source, and as of January 2011, it reportedly cost AOL approximately 30 million dollars a quarter to run. In a 2011 interview, Armstrong claimed that Patch was responsible for the \"largest investment in local communities outside of what the Obama administration is doing.\" In 2010, Armstrong launched AOL's \"Monster Help Day,\" which commits AOL employees worldwide to work for free for a day to raise money for charity. By the 6th Annual Help Day in 2015, the scheme had 85 projects running worldwide, with over 50,000 work hours donated. In May 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for $4.4 billion, moving AOL's stock up by over 17%. Armstrong remained in his position as CEO. Fortune conjectured that the Verizon deal would bring Armstrong himself approximately $59 million in stock options. Video content is increasingly becoming a major part of AOL in what CNBC describes as the \"content golden age.\" The following month, he announced that AOL had entered into a ten-year agreement with Microsoft, giving AOL the responsibility for its advertising sales across Microsoft platforms, and AOL in return, agreed to use the Bing search engine instead of Google on its sites. In July, Armstrong was awarded the Life Achievement Award at the Corporate Social Responsibility Awards organized by Capalino+Company, a New York City-based government and community relations company. In September, Armstrong and AOL acquired mobile ad tech company Millennial Media in a deal worth a reported $238 million, to add a \"leading supply-side platform for app monetization\" to AOL's assets. Speaking at the MPA's American Magazine Media Conference in New York in January 2016, Armstrong stated: \"I thought the Internet was the biggest thing to ever happen in my lifetime. I think mobile will dwarf that\". In January 2016, AOL bought off French programmatic ad platform AlephD, complementing the programmatic ad platform Armstrong had established for AOL in 2014, entitled ONE. Armstrong summarized the direction that AOL was going in 2014: \"AOL has spent the last four years building platforms to facilitate the efficient and effective flow of advertising dollars to digital. We build brands \u2013 our own, and those of more than 22,000 publishers in our global network and the thousands of marketers we work with daily to help them accomplish their business goals in today's fast-moving, dynamic market. On the side of the platform of our business, as machines automate more media decisions across TV to digital, we are well-positioned to help advertisers, agencies, and publishers realize the true value of data-driven advertising.\""

Her 1974 meticulously furnished bedroom in a loft on Augustinergasse in Zurich presents a little universe filled with fetish objects, feathers, and glittery materials, and would become the starting point for her first installation 'Das lachsfarbene Boudoir' at the art gallery Li Tobler. It was reconstructed in 2006 and thereafter shown at the Migros Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst, at the Helmhaus in 2008 and the Swiss Institute for Contemporary Art in New York City in 2009.

His father was a manager for AT&T and his position moved his family around.

Fortunately, he did improve and even went on to play football in High School and for 1 semester at Southwestern Louisiana Institute in Lafayette, Louisiana - now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Golden said that his love for the Mississippi Delta was formed in his childhood, while living in these rural areas, notably Grenada, MS. \"I didn't realize it at the time,\" Rolland told 'Southwest Art Magazine' in 1978, \"but the beauty of the rural South was making quite an impact on my young mind.\""

His training served him well as a painter, providing \"a practical nautical knowledge\" of his subjects. He earned a reputation for \"accuracy and refinement of detail\" and was admired for his bright, clear colours. He worked in both oils and watercolours. He based his style on that of well-known Dutch maritime painters of the 17th century. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1787 and the Royal Institution in 1810, and continued to exhibit annually until 1811. He then exhibited intermittently until 1834. His best work was executed in the years 1790\u20131810, during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, at which time the demand for naval paintings was high. His painting was not restricted to marine subjects and included an exhibit in 1822 of a painting depicting the Battle of Waterloo. Like other artists of the time, Anderson's paintings of marine incidents were often based on sketches by participants and were bought by individuals who had risen in social standing and wealth during the wars. Commissions that took Anderson back north introduced him to the Hull school of painters, notably influencing the young John Ward , who copied at least one of Anderson's paintings. He was also a friend and possibly a collaborator of the painter Julius Caesar Ibbetson . His work was influenced by his travels in the North, which led to depictions of Berwick-on-Tweed and Tynemouth. His last exhibit was of Lord Howe's fleet at Spithead at the Royal Academy in 1834, the last of 45 paintings that he exhibited there. He died in London on 27 May 1837."

While in Venice he also took piano lessons with Professor Trivellini. Upon graduating in 1894, he returned to his native city. Yet, his impulse to continue his music studies took him back to Italy, where he settled in Padua and worked with composer Luigi Bottazzo, focusing on harmony, counterpoint and fugue."

        "title": "Edgar Manas_Professional career",
        "content": "Back in Istanbul, Manas pursued his music studies further. He concentrated primarily on composition by examining the classics and the works of contemporary French masters. He produced a series of piano composition in the idiom of Chopin, including \u201cMinuet-Valse\u201d which was published in 1905 by A. Comendinger of Istanbul. During the same year, Edgar Manas conducted the Gallia choral group in a concert at Salle de f\u00eates de l'Union fran\u00e7aise, a local auditorium, which earned him the order of Officier d\u2019acad\u00e9mie from the French government. In 1912, Manas made the acquaintance of Komitas, the founder of modern Armenian music. Although their relationship was cordial, it was not particularly close, for Manas and Komitas lived in two different aesthetic worlds. The same year, Leipzig-based Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel published two of Edgar Manas's compositions \u2013 Suite for piano and String Quartet. It was followed by other European publishing houses, including Salabert, Senard and Hamelle. Manas's music was performed often in Istanbul, and, on occasion, in European music capitals. The String Quartet, mentioned above, was premiered in an all-Manas program on May 6, 1921, at Union fran\u00e7aise. Members of the quartet were violinists Ekrem Zeki \u00dcn and Krikor Garabedian, violist Diran Israelian and cellist Kalayov. On this occasion, the composer performed his Piano Suite and accompanied soprano A. Khandjian in a number of songs. A few years later, the Quartet was performed in Leipzig with much success. Martin Friedland wrote the following in Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik: Manas was soon appointed to the directorship of the Lyre chorus, associated with Armenian Youth League of Istanbul. Between the years 1920 \u2013 22, he became affiliated with the Devotee of the Arts music organization, conducting their annual presentations. During the final concert on January 20, 1922, the program included Manas's own composition, My Death , in addition to works from the standard repertoire. Manas was engaged to teach music at the Esayan Armenian day school and was hired by the D\u00e2r\u00fclelhan) . The vocal-symphonic ensemble of the conservatory presented its first concert at the historic Galatasaray High School on March 28, 1924. The program included excerpts from Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s Samson et Dalila, Meyerbeer\u2019s L'Africaine, Brahms\u2019 N\u00e4nie, as well as purely orchestral works by Gluck, Schmitt, Schumann and Mendelssohn. In 1923, Hamelle published a collection of songs by Manas, which were based on Armenian poetry but were presented in their French translation by Yetvart Kolandjian. In 1924, it was followed by the publication of his Sonata for violin and piano, premiered to critical acclaim on December 19, 1932, at the main auditorium of the Paris Conservatoire. Kevork Sinanian was the violinist and the composer was at the piano. In February 1926, Salabert of Paris printed Manas's piano work, Les \u00eeles des princes . The composition consisted of four movements, each portraying one of the main islands of the archipelago in the Sea of Marmara. Manas soon made an orchestral version of the work. Edgar Manas perhaps is best remembered for his work on \u0130stiklal Mar\u015f\u0131, the Turkish National Anthem. In 1932, he was commissioned by the Turkish Republic to harmonize and orchestrate the melody created by Zeki \u00dcng\u00f6r. In 1933, a choir of 160 members performed his Vatan \u015eark\u0131s\u0131 at the Tepeba\u015f\u0131 Tiyatrosu in Istanbul. The following year, Manas arranged and published 5 T\u00fcrk Halk \u015eark\u0131s\u0131 and, in 1935, composed Danses populaires Turques for piano, published by Editions Maurice Senard in Paris. Manas was appointed choirmaster of The Choir of Goghtn of the Armenian patriarchal church in Istanbul, where he served for twenty years until 1957.  His Rapsodie de l'orient was performed by Istanbul Municipal Orchestra under the baton of Cemal Re\u015fit Rey in 1959. Edgar Manas has composed a sizable body of sacred music. The most significant among them is perhaps the Armenian Divine Liturgy for soloists, choir and organ. It was initially conceived in 1912, but was given its final form in 1948. The large scale composition was premiered in Istanbul in 1961 and published in Vienna in 1962. In the foreword of the printed score, the composer writes: Compared to the Latin Mass, which consists of five movements of various lengths, the Armenian Divine Liturgy is made of several short segments that are interconnected. In order to avoid any kind of monotony and to conclude the work with a proper ending, I decided to augment certain numbers...and finish the composition with a chorale and fugue. This particular Divine Liturgy with organ obbligato, reserved for special occasions, requires a big chorus in order to project the necessary volume in loud portions, and create an even and opaque sonority in soft passages."

Born in Mackay, Queensland, Mellor grew up in Scotland, Australia, and South Africa before undertaking tertiary studies at North Adelaide School of Art, the Australian National University and Birmingham Institute of Art and Design. He then took up a post lecturing at Sydney College of the Arts. He works in different media including printmaking, drawing, painting, and sculpture. Considered a key figure in contemporary Indigenous Australian art, the dominant theme in Mellor's art is the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian cultures. Since 2000, Mellor's works have been included regularly in National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award exhibitions; in 2003 he was awarded a \"highly commended\", for his print Cyathea cooperi, and in 2009 he won the principal prize, for a mixed media work From Rite to Ritual. His other major exhibitions have included the Primavera 2005 show at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, and the inaugural National Indigenous Art Triennial at the National Gallery of Australia in 2007. In 2012, his work was included in the National Museum of Australia's exhibition Menagerie: Contemporary Indigenous Sculpture as well as in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial, while international recognition came in 2013 with representation in the National Gallery of Canada's exhibition of international indigenous art."

        "content": "Mellor was born in Mackay, Queensland, in 1971. His father was of American and Australian descent; his mother had Irish, Mamu, Ngagen, and Ngajan heritage. Mellor's maternal great-great-grandmother, Eleanor Kelly, and great-grandmother, May Kelly, were Indigenous Australian people from the rainforest country around Cairns. The family was peripatetic: in his first twenty years, Mellor lived in Mackay, Queensland; Scotland; Brisbane, Queensland; Sutton Grange, Victoria; Adelaide, South Australia; and Cape Town, South Africa, as well as in the Northern Territory. Mellor went to school at Steiner Schools in South Australia and South Africa; in high school he was taught art by his mother. Looking back at the influence of his schooling upon his art, he remarked how, despite the Eurocentric origins of Rudolf Steiner's approach to education, \"there are comparable elements and themes inherent in [Steiner's] philosophical narrative that parallel an Indigenous outlook, which is holistic in the way it approaches deeper and more intuitive readings of the environment and landscape.\" After completing a Certificate in Art at the North Adelaide School of Art in 1991, Mellor undertook a Bachelor of Arts with Honours at the ANU in 1992\u20131994, and a Masters in Fine Art at Birmingham Institute of Art and Design, part of the Birmingham City University, in 1995\u20131996. In the early 2000s, he entered a doctorate at the ANU, where he also taught print-media and drawing. He completed his PhD in 2004. As of 2013, Mellor is a lecturer at Sydney College of the Arts, within the University of Sydney. Mellor is married to artist Joanne Kennedy."

        "content": "In the early 1990s, Mellor won drawing prizes at the ANU's Canberra School of Art and the Grafton Regional Gallery in New South Wales. Through the mid-1990s, while studying in Canberra and Birmingham, he was represented in numerous student and other exhibitions, in Australia, Belgium, Japan, Korea and the United Kingdom. These included exhibitions titled Passage, at Kyoto Seika University in Japan in 1994, and Fragile Objects at the National Library of Australia in 1996. Mellor's works have been included in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award on several occasions, in 2000, 2001, and every year from 2003 to 2010. In 2003, his mezzotint print Cyathea cooperi, portraying tree ferns native to the Queensland rainforest, was highly commended. Subsequent entries have included Of fragile dreams the heart which nevermore in 2005, Untitled in 2006, Exotic lies and sacred ties in 2008, and A Transcendent Vision in 2010. Reviewing the 2008 exhibition, academic Sarah Scott expressed surprise that Mellor's 2008 piece had neither attracted an award nor been purchased for the Northern Territory's public collection. Primavera 2005, an annual exhibition of young artists' work held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney, included Mellor's work Fig 1-100 , a mixed media composition that included specimens of Ulysses butterflies. He has had numerous other exhibitions, both individually and as part of group shows, at galleries including the Queensland Art Gallery in 2003, the Canberra Museum and Art Gallery in 2006, and the Indigenous Ceramic Art Awards, at Shepparton Gallery in Victoria in 2007. Mellor's work was represented in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial in 2007, with the elaborate sculpture The contrivance of a vintage Wonderland featuring a diorama that included sculpted kangaroos made with blue and white crockery fragments , real kangaroo skin , and synthetic eyeballs; stuffed birds sat in a life-sized mixed-media tree overhead. The work featured in media reports of the exhibition, including by The Adelaide Advertiser, The Canberra Times, The West Australian and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Since graduating, Mellor has won several awards, including the Canberra Critic's Choice Award in 2006, and the $15,000 John Tallis National Works on Paper Acquisitive Award in 2008. The following year, he won the Victorian Indigenous Ceramic Art Award, held at Shepparton Art Gallery in Shepparton, Victoria. In August 2009, Mellor won the AU$40,000 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, for his mixed media work From Rite to Ritual. It was only the third time in the award's 26 years that an urban Aboriginal artist had been the winner. Earlier that year his solo show at Brisbane's Jan Murphy Gallery had sold out. Also in that year, Mellor's work was featured alongside that of Patricia Piccinini and Cherry Hood in the Newcastle Region Art Gallery's show Animal Attraction. Though Mellor has not had a painting hung in the Archibald Prize, he was the subject of Paul Ryan's portrait that was a 2010 finalist in that competition. In 2012, his work was included in the National Museum of Australia's exhibition Menagerie: Contemporary Indigenous Sculpture, and in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial. He was also selected for inclusion in that year's Blake Prize, with his work Bulluru Storywater. Mellor received international recognition in 2013, when he was included in Sakah\u00e0n, the National Gallery of Canada's \"most ambitious contemporary art exhibition in its history\". Among the national collections containing Mellor's work are the National Gallery of Australia, which owns his prize-winning From Rite to Ritual, and the Parliament House Art Collection. Most other major Australian art collections have holdings, including the state gallery of his birth state, Queensland, and the main public gallery of the city where he completed much of his tertiary study, the Canberra Museum and Gallery. Other state and territory galleries in which he is represented include the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory and the National Gallery of Victoria. Public regional galleries that have collected Mellor's creations include Newcastle Regional Art Gallery in New South Wales, and Warrnambool Art Gallery in Victoria. He is also represented in the Australian government's collection, Artbank, as well as in large, private collections such as the Kerry Stokes. In the 2010s, Mellor became involved in administrative and leadership roles in the arts community. In 2010, he became a member of the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts. In 2011, Mellor was not an entrant in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, as he instead became one of its judges. Appointed to the Visual Arts Board for a further term, Mellor in 2013 became its Chair. At the same time, Mellor continued to exhibit works. In 2014, a survey of his works opened at the University of Queensland Art Museum, and was scheduled to travel to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory later in the year. The exhibition was favourably reviewed in theguardian.com, with art critic Sharne Wolff drawing attention to Mellor's newest sculpture, Anima, which she said \"marks a dramatic change\" for the artist, bearing \"no resemblance to Mellor\u2019s more glamorous output\". His work featured as part of the Edinburgh International Festival, with a show titled Primordial: SuperNaturalBayiMinyjirral displayed at the National Museum of Scotland. A large work of Mellor's, Entelekheia , consisting of photographic images of plants etched in concrete, can be found on the exterior walls of the International Convention Centre in Sydney."

        "content": "Mellor's extensive scholarly art education has led to his art having a strong theoretical base. In interviews he has acknowledged the influence of diverse artists, including Indigenous painter Rover Thomas, Australian Sulman Prize winner Tim Storrier, Romantic painters including Germany's Caspar David Friedrich, and contemporary German artists Joseph Beuys, and Beuys' student Anselm Kiefer. He has harnessed a wide range of media during his career, including printmaking, drawing, painting and sculpture utilising wood, glass, steel and ceramics, as well as a range of more unorthodox materials, as his 2007 Indigenous Art Triennial entry demonstrated. Reflecting on that sculpture, Artlink Magazine'''s reviewer, Daniel Thomas, remarked on how the work signified \"how colonisers always get things wrong; how Europeans looking for China, and its fine porcelain manufactures, stumbled instead upon the land of the kangaroo, and traded and planted ideas of racial and cultural superiority\". When Sarah Scott considered the 2008 work Exotic Lies and Sacred Ties, which, like From Rite to Ritual, drew on evocations of Spode china, she highlighted its exploration of the history of cross-cultural relations. Noting the landscape that forms the central element of the painting, she observed:From Rite to Ritual examined relationships between Indigenous and settler cultures, including differences in spiritual practices. Mellor, in an artist's statement for the awards, described the work as showing \"what is a moment of contact, a conversation and interaction between two cultures; it speaks of the challenges of settlement, and the differences in spiritual enactment and belief\". Commenting on the work, the judges of the prize remarked that the \"surprising scale and layering of imagery, with its understated political and historical references\" made the work \"outstanding\" and of \"great complexity and grace\". Art writer Nicolas Rothwell described the work as drawing a parallel \"between Aboriginal initiation rituals and the ceremonies inside a Masonic lodge.\" Mellor's earlier works examined the relationships between cultures, including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed \"images of native and introduced flora and fauna\u2014for example, a kangaroo with a bull\u2014to symbolise two different peoples and cultures\". These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition Native Titled Now'', shown in South Australia in 1996. Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, it was important to be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, \"so you can talk about their interaction and the whole set of issues that arise from those two things being parallel\". Mellor's emphasis on past interactions between cultures led gallerist and critic Michael Reid to consider that Mellor's works had earned him \"an important place in the visual narrative of Australian history\". For Mellor, Indigenous identity is a theme highlighted both in his work and in public life. As a fair-skinned man with blue eyes and caucasian features, his appearance has occasionally raised questions of \"authenticity\". Mellor found himself the target of columnist Andrew Bolt, who took issue with Mellor entering and winning the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Bolt wrote \"This white university lecturer, with his nice Canberra studio, has by winning pushed aside real draw-in-the-dirt Aboriginal artists such as Dorothy Napangardi, Mitjili Napanangka Gibson and Walangkura Napanangka, who had also entered and could really have used that cash and recognition.\" Commentator Ellie Savage, criticising Bolt, wondered why someone who \"neither draws in the dirt nor lives in it\" should therefore have \"no right to enter competitions for Indigenous artists\". Bolt two years later lost a case brought by nine Indigenous Australians\u2014not including Mellor\u2014for racial discrimination over articles that criticised fair-skinned Indigenous people, including the post that had lambasted Mellor. Art writer Maurice O'Riordan, reviewing the 2009 Award, noted the Bolt controversy, but pointed out that Mellor, while in early works acknowledging his own Indigenous heritage, is not concerned with the definition of Aboriginality, but with historical interaction between cultures and the re-imagining of history."

He moved with his family to Amsterdam in 1589, after the Siege of Antwerp, probably because they were Protestants. His three sons Willem van Nieulandt II , Adriaen van Nieulandt the younger, and Jacob van Nieulandt all became painters. Willem was a pupil of Roelant Savery in 1599, and in 1601 he travelled to Rome, where he became a student of Paulus Bril. According to Arnold Houbraken, he specialized in painting artistic ruins of monuments, arches, and temples, many of which he then engraved himself. In Spring 1606 the 22-year-old married Anna Hustaert in Amsterdam, but the couple settled in Antwerp. Nieulandt was better known as a poet and playwright than as a painter. He was a member of the Antwerp chamber of rhetoric the Olyftack from 1613 to 1621, transferring to the rival Violieren from 1621 to 1629. In May 1620 he won the prize for best poem at a rhetoric competition in Mechelen, writing under the pen name Dient uwen Al . In May 1624 the Violieren produced his play Aegyptica . His daughter Constantia, who later married Adriaen van Utrecht, was likewise a well regarded poet. At some point after May 1629 he returned to Amsterdam, where he lived until his death in 1635."

        "content": "Jan van de Cappelle \u2013 22 December 1679 ) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of seascapes and winter landscapes, also notable as an industrialist and art collector.  He is \"now considered the outstanding marine painter of 17th century Holland\". He lived all his life in Amsterdam, and as well as working as an artist spent much, or most, of his time helping to manage his father Franchoy's large dyeworks, which specialized in the expensive dye carmine, and which he eventually inherited in 1674.  Presumably because of this dual career, there are fewer than 150 surviving paintings, a relatively small number for the industrious painters of the Dutch Golden Age.  His marine paintings usually show estuary or river scenes rather than the open sea, and the water is always very calm, allowing it to act as a mirror reflecting the cloud formations above; this effect was Cappelle's speciality."

        "content": "His father was a cloth-dyer, his mother came from Rotterdam; they married in 1622 in Amsterdam. Joannes' baptism is recorded in the Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam on 25 January 1626.  He was described as a self-taught artist, but probably received some form of training from Simon de Vlieger, whose style he copied or is closest to his early paintings, and perhaps other masters such as Willem van de Velde the Elder. He received the citizenship of Amsterdam on 24 July 1653, an essentially honorific ceremony for one of the city elite. A few months before, on 2 February 1653, he had married Annetje Jansdr. Grotingh, the daughter of a bricklayer. Van de Cappelle was a very wealthy man who never needed to rely on his painting for his livelihood, and it is not known if he joined the city's Guild of Saint Luke, or the separate \"brotherhood of painters\" founded in 1653. Whether he sold his work, or how he did so, is unclear. Abraham Bredius suggested Van de Cappelle was a friend of Rembrandt, at whose insolvency sales in 1656 and 1658 he was a large buyer, and who painted portraits of him and his wife. It has been speculated that he may have used his business contacts to help obtain the commission for Rembrandt's last, and financially very useful, group portrait commission, the Syndics of the Drapers' Guild of 1662. His earliest dated painting is an important and already highly accomplished one from 1645, and only one is dated in the 1660s. From this most authors assume he devoted his later years to his business, in which his brother Franchois also worked.  In May 1661 he bought a house in the Koestraat, near Nieuwmarkt, moving from the even more expensive Keizersgracht. The house with a garden, next to a school, was sold by a son  of Sweelinck, and in the deed of purchase van de Cappelle is simply called schilder and not a master painter. His wife predeceased him in 1677, and van de Cappelle himself was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk on 22 December 1679. He left seven children.  The inventory of his property at death has survived and is the main source of information about his impressive art collection. It took seven months to list all.  He left his children six houses, a country house south of Loenen on the river Vecht , a pleasure yacht, \"44 bags of ducats\", silk and bonds together valued at 92,720 guilders.  A lengthy list of the items from his splendid wardrobe was made, as well as a list of his large and important art collection."

        "content": "The majority of his works are marine or river views, nearly always with several vessels, but he also left a number of small winter landscapes somewhat in the manner of Aert van der Neer; these all seem to date between 1652 and 1654.  His seascapes may be large or small; the nine examples in the National Gallery, London, the largest group in a single collection, vary between 122 x 154.5\u00a0cm and 34.8 x 48.1\u00a0cm . He had no interest in rough seas or cloudless skies, showing large cloudy skies, with the horizon low, about 15-20% of the way up the vertical axis.  The clouds are often mirrored in the dead calm water, although light ripples may be shown.  As is often the case in Dutch seascapes, there is often a warship or \"statenjacht\" , an official yacht used for transport, official salutes and other business.  The edge of the composition often slices through vessels, leaving them half seen.  Van de Cappelle painted many parade marine subjects, depicting \"a formal gathering of ships for a ceremonial occasion\".   Other paintings, mostly smaller and of less busy subjects, a type often called \"calms\", show \"an all-pervading luminous atmosphere that softens all outlines and unifies forms and local colours\", or as Kenneth Clark puts it, \"When sky was reflected on water, there was achieved that unity of luminous atmosphere which is ... the whole point of van de Capelle and van de Velde\". In his early works he followed the muted palette of the \"tonal school\", but enlived with local highlights of bright colour, but moved in his later works to \"a warmer golden tonality, exceptionally allowing himself a greater colouristic exuberance when setting the rosy glow of a sunset sky against water of a deep turquoise blue, as in the River Scene with Sailing Vessels \".  According to his leading scholar, Margarita Russell, \"More than any other artist of his time, with the exception only of Rembrandt, van de Cappelle was a painter of light\". Cappelle made a small number of etchings; only two signed ones of landscapes are now firmly attributed to him.  Fewer than twenty of the nearly 750 of his own drawings in the 1680 inventory have survived identifiably."

He had portraits of himself by both Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and he is the only person known to have been painted by both of the greatest Dutch portraitists.  However, if they survive the identity of both paintings has been lost.  The Rembrandt was claimed to be a portrait of an artist of 1648, once at Castle Howard, and in 1961 Norton Simon bought a Hals then called a portrait of Cappelle, but now just Portrait of a Young Man.

Van de Capelle owned 83 drawings by Jan den Uyl. The large groups of drawings by individual artists suggest that he had bought their studio stock of working drawings complete after their death or retirement.  The Rembrandt drawings were probably acquired at his insolvency sales in 1656 and 1658."

        "content": "Van de Cappelle had a considerable influence on painters of both marine and winter subjects, including Willem van de Velde the Younger in the former group, Jan van Kessel in the latter, and Hendrick Dubbels in both. Van de Cappelle does not seem to have participated much in the commercial art world of his day, which may account for his absence from all the contemporary collections of artists' biographies such as the over 500 lives by Arnold Houbraken's in his De groote schouwburg der Nederlandsche kunstschilders en schilderessen \u2013 \"The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters\", .  Joachim von Sandrart and Samuel van Hoogstraten also overlook him.  This was also probably partly the result of the biographers' following contemporary prejudices against marine, landscape, and still life painting, regarded as the lowest in the hierarchy of genres.  He was for long perhaps better known in England than Holland, and the distribution of his works still reflects this. The largest collection of his work is the nine paintings in London, as mentioned above.  There are works in the Rijksmuseum, the Mauritshuis, Rijksmuseum Twenthe, in the Getty Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Museum of Wales, Detroit Institute of Arts, Manchester Art Gallery , Nationalmuseum, Wallraf-Richartz Museum and elsewhere."

In December 1941, Schergat was one of a team of six which attacked Alexandria harbour. They used the new Italian secret torpedo S.L.C. , a small underwater assault vehicle with a crew of two. As a result, four ships were damaged in Alexandria: the British battleships  and  , and the tanker Sagona with the destroyer . Spartaco Schergat personally placed the limpet mine under the hull of Queen Elizabeth. However, the two capital ships were in shallow water, Queen Elizabeth settling on the sea bed, Valiant down by the bow, but both maintaining the illusion from the air that they were undamaged. Temporary repairs were quickly effected; Queen Elizabeth was sent to the United States for permanent full repairs, Valiant to Durban, South Africa. Both ships were out of action for over one year. This represented a dramatic change of fortunes against the Allies from the strategic point of view in the central Mediterranean Sea during the next half-year or more. The Italian fleet - with the Alexandria Raid - had nominally achieved naval supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, called in that year Italy's Mare Nostrum by fascist propaganda."

        "content": "From the beginning of his philosophical career Ricardo Maliandi has researched on material ethics of values, especially Nicolai Hartmann's approach . Two problems were always under his attention in ethics: foundation and conflicti. He was convinced the intuitionism of axiological ethics is not enough for a rigorous foundation, but aware as well of the very suggestions of Hartmann analysis on conflictive relations among values, ethical thinking of Maliandi develops as a pursuit of an ethical foundation non-intuitionist, that recognizes conflicts. Sometimes, this research was close to Philosophical Anthropology . In his newest works are very important transcendental pragmatics and Discourse Ethics of Karl-Otto Apel. They both offer a new aprioristic foundation, but different of the intuitionist. Maliandi introduces, as a programmatic propose, an approaching between Harmtann's and Apel's ethics, in the sense of the conflictive structure of  ethos and a pragmatic-trascendental reflexive foundation . The aprioristic axis that, despite of multiple differences of these approaches, linked these two philosophers, allows Maliandi to make a defense of universalism against the unilateral stressing of difference, as appeared in actual irrational trends . This effort is complemented with the development of a theory of reason and stresses its  \"bidimensionality\" and its \"dialogicity\" . Maliandi's ethical conception can be summarized, as he proposed, as \"ethics of convergence\", he continues working on this topic. . \u201cConvergence\u201d is understood as: 1) an approaching between material ethics of values and discourse ethics, and as a result, between the admission of the inevitability of conflicts and a propose for strong foundation, a priori . 2) a basic feature of an ethics that recognizes a plurality of principles, but as well, at the same time, demands to maximize harmony between them."

        "content": "The French had received a concession of ten years for their establishment, in Veracruz, of a French trading post dealing in black slaves. Upon his arrival in Veracruz he enforced Spanish law, and allowed their stay, until their concession was over. After which point, the French trading post was to stop operating within the slave trade, as it was illegal to openly operate such facilities within Spanish territory. He arrived in Chapultepec in November, 1702 and made his formal entry into Mexico City on 8 December 1702. He was a fervent supporter of the Bourbon monarchy and of King Philip V of Spain, and he worked in New Spain to suppress any kind of discontent that could result in support for the Habsburg party. This viceroy's administration was known for its luxury and magnificence. On 6 January 1703 the palace guards in the viceregal palace appeared in uniforms of the French mode for the first time, three-cornered hats and all. This attracted much attention, and fashions at the court and beyond quickly followed along the same lines. This was a fashion of luxury, starkly contrasted with the poverty of the majority of the people."

He devoted much of the armed forces to dislodging the English and Dutch from the coast of the Seno Mexicano . He sent reinforcements and supplies to Saint Augustine, Florida, which was besieged by the English. He confiscated the property of the English and Dutch, and used the proceeds to fend off their incursions. He worked to protect the newly established Jesuit missions in California. He also worked hard to provide financial aid to the Bourbons in the Spanish War of Succession. He demanded that the clergy turn over one tenth of their rents to the government. The archbishop strongly objected. When Fern\u00e1ndez de La Cueva's term in office was extended, in gratitude he remitted two million pesos to the Crown. To raise this money, he resorted to shady methods, such as selling government positions. His remissions to Spain were so large that the government found itself unable to pay many police and other employees, and they were laid off. The streets and highways became infested with brigands."

        "content": "In September 1991, she entered junior high school in Yantai, and in 1994 entered Yantai Yizhong High School, graduating in 1997. She was admitted to the Changchun Flight College of the People's Liberation Army Air Force and joined the force in August 1997. Wang was from the seventh batch of female military pilots in China, one of 37 members, and graduated from Aviation University and flight school in 2001 with the rank of First Lieutenant. As a pilot with the Air Force's transport aircraft crew in Wuhan, she has participated in tasks such as combat readiness exercises, the Wenchuan Earthquake relief effort, and cloud seeding and weather modification for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games to eliminate clouds and reduce rain. After accumulating safe flights for 1600 hours, she was named Air Force Class II pilot. In May 2010 she officially became the second female astronaut of China. At that time Wang was a captain in the People's Liberation Army Air Force. She was a candidate for the space mission Shenzhou 9 in 2012. However, Liu Yang was selected over her for the historic mission of the first Chinese female space traveller. Wang was a member of the backup crew for SZ-9. Wang became the second Chinese female spacefarer as a member of the Shenzhou 10 spaceship crew, which orbited the Earth in June 2013, and of the Tiangong-1 orbiting space station with which it docked. She was known as the \u201cGoddess II\u201d. She was the first member of the crew announced, in April, while the remainder of the crew were announced in June. Wang Yaping was one of two women in space on the 50th anniversary of Vostok 6, the first spaceflight by a woman, Valentina Tereshkova. The other woman in space on 16 June 2013 was Karen Nyberg, an American astronaut aboard the International Space Station. While aboard Tiangong-1, Wang conducted scientific experiments and taught a physics lesson to Chinese students by live television broadcast. In 2018, she held the rank of Air Force Colonel, and had trained to fly four aircraft models. In March 2018, Wang was elected for a five-year-term as a deputy to the National People's Congress. In October 2021, it was announced that Wang was selected as one of the three crew members to fly on Shenzhou 13 to the Tiangong space station, marking her second spaceflight and the first time a Chinese woman would travel to space twice. She was to be the first female astronaut to board the Tiangong space station and to perform an extravehicular activity. On 15 October 2021, the three Shenzhou 13 crewmembers arrived at the Tianhe space station module, hours after launch. On 7 November, the China Manned Space Agency announced that a spacewalk was underway and it was being performed by astronauts Zhai Zhigang, the Shenzhou 13 mission commander, and Wang Yaping, who was now China's first female spacewalker. EVA operations started at 6:21\u00a0p.m.. Wang exited from the node cabin of the Tianhe Core Module at 8:28\u00a0p.m.. Zhai and Wang completed their EVAs and returned to Tianhe by 1:16\u00a0a.m. on 8 November, the entire operation having lasted 6 hours and 25 minutes. Wang wore a new spacesuit, delivered to the station by the Tianzhou 3 cargo resupply craft in September. According to Chinese state media, this suit was optimized for her shorter height."

Tony Quine of NasaSpaceFlight noted that she probably has a child, \"as Chinese officials have previously said that only women who have already given birth would be considered for the taikonaut program.\" A former official claimed that it was due to concerns that spaceflight could potentially harm women's fertility. However, this requirement has been officially denied by the director of the China Astronaut Center, stating that this is a preference but not a strict limitation."

Born in Brisbane, he was a businessman when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve in 1937. Called up for active duty shortly after the outbreak of war in September 1939, he served with No.\u00a023 Squadron in Australia before posting to the South West Pacific theatre with No.\u00a021 Squadron in Singapore. In March 1942 he joined No.\u00a075 Squadron in Port Moresby, New Guinea, flying P-40 Kittyhawks under the command of his eldest brother, John. During the ensuing Battle of Port Moresby, Les shot down four Japanese aircraft. Jackson took over command of No.\u00a075 Squadron after his brother was killed in action on 28\u00a0April 1942, leading it in the Battle of Milne Bay later that year. Credited with a fifth aerial victory, he became the RAAF's first ace in the New Guinea campaign, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . By 1944, Jackson was wing leader of No.\u00a078 Wing in Western New Guinea, gaining promotion to wing commander in September that year. Awarded a bar to his DFC in March 1945, he served as chief flying instructor at No.\u00a08 Operational Training Unit in Australia, and saw out the war as commander of Air Defence Headquarters, Madang.

His first job following education at Brisbane Grammar School was as an accountant in the family firm of J.\u00a0Jackson & Co. Pty Ltd. He then set up his own business running a service station and garage in Surat, a rural area south-west of Brisbane. In February 1935, Jackson enlisted in the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment, a Queensland-based Militia unit. Jackson followed his eldest brother, John, into the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force, in July 1937. With the outbreak of World War\u00a0II, Les was called up for active duty in the RAAF on 6\u00a0November 1939. He learnt to fly as an air cadet at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. Graduating as a pilot in February 1940, he served initially with No.\u00a023 Squadron at Archerfield, Queensland.

In March 1942, he joined No.\u00a075 Squadron in New Guinea as a flight lieutenant, under the command of his brother, known as \"Old John\". Operating P-40 Kittyhawks, the unit quickly became engaged in the defence of Port Moresby, one of the crucial early battles in the New Guinea campaign. As one of No.\u00a075 Squadron's flight commanders, Jackson took part in a surprise raid against Lae airfield on 22\u00a0March. Five Kittyhawks led by John Jackson attacked and destroyed a dozen Japanese planes on the ground, while four others including Les provided protective cover above; he survived an encounter with three Mitsubishi Zeros that saw two of his fellow pilots shot down. Two days later he recorded his first aerial victory when he intercepted and destroyed a Zero escorting a force of bombers towards Port Moresby. On 6\u00a0April, Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef, but made it to shore with the aid of a life jacket that his brother John dropped to him.  In the following weeks, Les accounted for another three Japanese aircraft shot down.  On 5\u00a0April, he was attacked from behind by a Zero while firing on bombers front-on, but was able to turn the tables on the Japanese fighter and shoot it down in flames. The next day he went head to head with more Zeros, damaging two before being forced to ditch on a reef with a smoking engine; once down he scrambled out of the cockpit and danced on the wing to let his comrades know he was safe. Jackson shot down his third victim on 17\u00a0April. He achieved his fourth victory against another Zero on 24\u00a0April, to become the highest Australian scorer in the Battle of Port Moresby. On 28\u00a0April, John Jackson was shot down and killed while leading the interception of a Japanese raid; Les took over command of No.\u00a075 Squadron the next day. On 30\u00a0April, the squadron was recalled to Australia to refit and regroup; Jackson flew one of its last remaining serviceable aircraft to Cairns, Queensland, on 9\u00a0May."

During the Battle of Milne Bay, Jackson's squadron was engaged in air defence against Japanese raiders and offensive strikes against convoys and other targets in support of Australian ground forces. On 25\u00a0August, the Kittyhawks launched an attack on enemy barges at Goodenough Island that resulted in all seven vessels being set on fire without the loss of any aircraft. The next day, Jackson personally led two of his unit's five concerted strafing assaults on the main Japanese convoy approaching Milne Bay. On 27\u00a0August, he and a fellow pilot each claimed a Zero; the Japanese fighters had been focussing on machine-gunning one of their own aircraft that had crash-landed following combat with a USAAF B-26 Marauder, presumably to prevent it falling into Allied hands, and were 'bounced' by the Australian pilots.  His victory made Jackson an ace, the first from the RAAF in New Guinea.  By 28\u00a0August, Japanese troops were threatening to overrun the RAAF airfield at Milne Bay, and the Kittyhawk squadrons were ordered to withdraw to Port Moresby for one night. Returning to Milne Bay the next day, Jackson's plane developed trouble and he had to ditch on the coast; with the help of New Guinea natives, he reached Port Moresby by boat three days later. By 7\u00a0September the Japanese had withdrawn their troops from the Milne Bay area; Generals Sydney Rowell and Cyril Clowes both described the efforts of Nos.\u00a075 and 76 Squadrons as \"the decisive factor\" in repulsing the invading forces. No.\u00a075 Squadron was redeployed to Horn Island, Queensland, in September 1942, and Jackson handed over command to Squadron Leader John Meehan the following January. In recognition of his \"courage and leadership\" in New Guinea, Jackson was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross , which was promulgated in the London Gazette on 26\u00a0March 1943. Having served in staff positions in Australia during the year, he was appointed wing leader of No.\u00a078 Wing, a component of the newly formed No.\u00a010 Operational Group, in December 1943. The wing participated in Operations Reckless and Persecution, the assault on Hollandia and Aitape that opened the Western New Guinea campaign, in April 1944. This was followed by the attack on Noemfoor, commencing in June. Jackson was promoted to acting wing commander in September 1944. Completing his tour with No.\u00a078 Wing in December, he was posted to No.\u00a08 Operational Training Unit, New South Wales, as chief flying instructor. In March 1945, Jackson was awarded a bar to his DFC for \"determined and successful attacks on enemy installations and shipping\". That June, he took command of Air Defence Headquarters in Madang."

He and Delacroix shared a studio during the 1820s and even lithographed each other's works. His religious and historical paintings are characterised by a style based on a careful study of the old masters, while his genre pieces are vigorous and lifelike. Among the latter may be noticed his French Fish-Market in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin, and his Gipsies Resting. Among the former may be named Christopher Columbus, Flight into Egypt, and Assumption of the Virgin. He also illustrated scenes for literary works, such as Shakespeare's Othello and Macbeth. Colin had four children with two wives: Ana\u00efs, H\u00e9lo\u00efse, Laure, and Paul, all of whom followed in his footsteps as painters. He gradually modified his style during his long career, making it acceptable to salon juries who rejected several early works from the 1820s because of the very painterly qualities we admire today. He died in 1875."

In a letter that Bonger wrote to his parents on March 31, 1885, he describes Theo van Gogh as having received unexpected news the prior week that his father had died due to a \"stroke of apoplexy\" after having received a letter the previous day that he was in perfect health. He mentioned that Van Gogh was not very strong, and so this was a very melancholy circumstance. In several letters over the remainder of the year, Bonger comments on a growing appreciation for and friendship with Theo. In 1886, Vincent van Gogh arrived in Paris, which meant that Bonger saw less of Theo. Bonger expressed his concern that Vincent's harshness towards Theo, who had begun to look haggard.

        "content": "English had been a member of the Ulster Defence Association since the early days of the Troubles. He first came to prominence in the 1980s when he was involved in writing Common Sense, a UDA policy document that supported a form of power-sharing with Catholics. He was an opponent of Davy Payne, the UDA's North Belfast brigadier and an unpopular figure with many members due to allegations of racketeering and involvement in the death of John McMichael. He served as acting brigadier in South East Antrim following illness striking existing brigadier Alan Snoddy and in this role voted to retain the leadership of Andy Tyrie, a motion that was not successful. English served an advisor to the UDA's Inner Council and in 1990 whilst in this position he was arrested as part of the Stevens Inquiries. English was taken in, along with East Belfast brigadier Billy Elliot, for possessing confidential security documents. Whilst on remand English, who was subsequently released without charge, had a confrontation with Danny Morrison who was also on remand over kidnapping charges. Along with Ray Smallwoods, English, as representative of the Combined Loyalist Military Command, was in regular contact with Robin Eames during the early 1990s and the Archbishop of Armagh's pleas for peace impacted on English's thinking."

        "content": "The structure of the UDA changed following the removal of Andy Tyrie as chairman in March 1988 and leadership became shared between the six regional brigadiers. This became known as the Inner Council. Along with this a number of new brigadiers were appointed and amongst these was English who was given command of the UDA's East Antrim brigade. Despite his high rank English was fairly weak on military matters and garnered a reputation within the UDA for being more politically minded rather than militant. Given his seniority, English chaired the meetings of the Inner Council although at these meetings he often struggled to control West Belfast brigadier Johnny Adair. Adair disliked English, considering him too political; as a result he dismissed English and the other brigadiers as \"old ginnies\" and \"cardboard cut-outs\". For his part, English was said to fear Adair, who had a fearsome reputation for violence, and was careful not to push him too far. English's rivalry with Adair was strong and when Adair's leading hitman Stephen McKeag murdered Marie Teresa Dowds de Mogollon on 30 August 1993 in what was an unpopular killing with the UDA outside the Shankill area. Adair even threatened to shoot English when he suggested that the UDA should not claim the murder. Later in the year English was forced to confront Adair about rumours that he was considering attending an Inner Council meeting armed in order to eliminate the other five brigadiers and assume sole control of the UDA. On the Inner Council English represented the strongest advocate of the proposed ceasefire and as 1994 approached, he was able to get the support of Tom Reid and Gary Matthews, the north and east Belfast brigadiers respectively. In between Adair and English stood Billy McFarland and Alex Kerr, both of whom appeared to sympathise with English's pro-settlement agenda but who also were on good terms with Adair. As well as his advocacy of the Downing Street Declaration, English had also held dialogue with representatives of the Workers' Party of Ireland."

Before long he accompanied party colleagues Gary McMichael and Davy Adams, as well as Progressive Unionist Party leaders Gusty Spence, Billy Hutchinson and David Ervine on a tour of the United States that included a speaking engagement at the National Committee on American Foreign Policy. On 17 March 1995 English was one of the UDP delegates to attend a meeting with US president Bill Clinton. At the public St Patrick's day celebrations that followed the meeting English gained media attention when he cried at a rendition of the traditional Irish ballad 'Danny Boy'. English stood for the UDP in East Antrim at the Northern Ireland Forum election of 1996, and was also fourth on the party's \"top-up\" list, but he was not elected."

        "content": "In common with many of the older members of the UDA, English was vehemently opposed to the drugs trade and when individual brigadiers took up drug dealing he would give their names to contacts he had in the press. However English's anti-drugs stance was eventually to be the cause of his downfall. Amongst those that English had mentioned to journalists was John \"Grugg\" Gregg; but English's fellow Rathcoole native, who had replaced English as brigadier, discovered that English had given information to the press. As a result, Gregg, who had a reputation as one of the UDA's fiercest members outside the Shankill Road, forced English out of the UDA and removed him from the political scene. He resigned from his role as chairman of the UDP in 1997. English was allowed to continue living in Rathcoole but was considered persona non grata to the point that in 2001 a recently released UDA prisoner was beaten up on the estate for continuing to treat English as a friend. In December 2000, nine shots were fired through the window of his home, although no one was hurt in the attack. His Doagh Road home was again attacked in July 2001 when three shots were fired through the window. Gregg was killed in February 2003 as part of a loyalist feud and a new leadership took charge of the UDA Southeast Antrim Brigade. His most recent public appearance was in 2009 at the funeral of peace activist Reverend Roy Magee."

Because of the troubles in the Balkans his family moved first to Istanbul but settled later back to Thessaloniki when he was an infant. He studied in the military academy, enrolled in the army and became a member of the Committee of Union and Progress. He took part in the Italo-Turkish War and then in the Balkan Warsin which his hometown was lost to the Greeks. He took part in World War I where he fought in the rank of a Lieutenant Colonel under the command of Kress von Kressenstein in the Battle of Romani where the Ottoman forces were defeated. In the Palestine front and during the Second battle of Gaza he served with distinction. First refusing a surrender and then successfully organizing the withdrawal of the Ottoman and German forces with their weaponry. Never the less Bele was together with Ismet blamed for the defeat of the Ottomans by Erich Von Falkenhayn. After the British advance in 1918 he was cut off by his troops but managed to reach the Ottoman base at Tyre 75 miles north, after traveling one week through British lines. He did not speak English but because he moved at night and responded to questions with saluting and riding on a walk he avoided to be captured. He returned to Istanbul after the Armistice of Mudros in 1918. While in Istanbul, most of Anatolia began to be occupied by foreign powers, the Greeks landed at Smyrna in 1919. In response to the occupation he decided to join the Turkish nationalist movement and crossed over to Anatolia to organize resistance. He took part in the Amasya Circular of 1919 and then also in the Erzurum Congress, Ala\u015fehir Congress and Sivas Congress. He later served as minister and later as commander at the Western Front against the Greek armies. He put down several local revolts against the Ankara government. However he had several political disputes with Atat\u00fcrk and became out of favor. He was tried in court but acquitted of the attempted assassination of Atat\u00fcrk in 1926. In 1926 he retired from the army and parliament deputy. In his later life he took several different occupations including a second deputy time. He died in Istanbul in 1963."

        "content": "Louis Winter was the youngest of six children. He attended Jarvis Collegiate Institute in Toronto where he made the honour roll. He was  accepted into the biochemistry program at the University of Toronto, and graduated with a master's degree in the subject. In 1948 he borrowed $10,000 from his father Abraham, and opened his first venture, Winter Laboratories. The business was based in the family's garage processing blood work and pregnancy tests for local pharmacies, doctors' offices and medical clinics. With just his school mate, Toby Johansen, to handle initial sales, the company quickly outgrew its space and moved into a house near the University of Toronto's main campus. The business continued to expand; Winter Laboratories leased the basement of the Mothercraft Building on Bloor Street, where Rochdale College was built in 1968. Louis Winter recognized that brand name pharmaceutical drugs and popular over-the-counter medications were expensive, and that many consumers were having a difficult time purchasing their required prescriptions. He knew that many of these products could be synthesized or purchased in bulk and then manufactured or packaged into their required dosage forms for a fraction of their retail cost. He investigated this prospect further with the Canadian government authorities, and he discovered from Industry Canada, their Patent Office, and the government's Health Protection Branch, that he could establish a pharmaceutical manufacturing business providing that he adhered to their strict plant conditions and production standards. Before officially starting his own generic pharmaceutical company, on July 20, 1955, Louis Winter incorporated Anchor Serum Company of Canada Limited, after negotiating the exclusive Canadian rights to manufacture the product line of Anchor Serum Company of St. Louis, MO. Anchor Serum primarily specialized in supplying pharmaceuticals to veterinarians. As his manufacturing business expanded, Winter then purchased a four-story industrial building at 77 Florence Street, the former candy manufacturing facility of Jenny Lynn Chocolates, and on August 21, 1959, he incorporated Empire Laboratories Limited."

This landmark Supreme Court case was instrumental in the development of Canada's generic drug industry. Louis Winter soon had to expand his operations and purchased a larger five-story building from the Reichmann family, the former Planter's Peanut factory at 301 Lansdowne Avenue, just two blocks from Empire's current base on Florence Street, and he added additional production, including a synthesis laboratory on the top floor for the manufacturing of saccharine, the low-calorie sweetener. Winter also purchased a printing facility which he renamed Professional Printing Services Limited from the Mount family in 1963 that was originally located at 1389 Weston Road, Toronto, and Walter and Peter Mount became Empire employees. Empire Laboratories could then provide all its independent pharmacies from coast to coast with customized prescription delivery bags, point-of-purchase displays, posters, and signage as a loyalty incentive, in an era prior to the dominance of national chain drug stores. Empire also provided medical practitioners with complimentary stationery and prescription pads. To offset these marketing costs, Empire's printing division also retained dedicated print brokers and a couple of sales representatives to ensure that the division did not operate at a loss, and it processed all of the company's product labels and plant packaging. The Empire pharmaceutical operation became diversified and expanded, and it became one of Canada's largest pharmaceutical companies with over 100 products in its 1964 product catalog. Empire was the first Canadian firm to license and manufacture popular medications like Valium , Orinase and Tetracyn . The United States market was becoming a greater focus, and the U.S. military became a client, and a special manufacturing facility was being built in Puerto Rico under PRIDCO to ship products tariff free to the US Mainland. Lou Winter also invested in Vanguard Medical Supplies, the first Canadian mail-order based pharmaceutical business with Israel Kerzner and Murray Rubin, to service rural regions via catalog mail order, and Professional Printing Services handled all of the catalog production."

The Executor, Royal Trust, now a division of Royal Bank of Canada , processed this transaction on behalf of the infant beneficiaries of Beverley and Louis Winter. Barry Sherman would eventually launch Apotex Inc. in 1974. To facilitate the corporate acquisition, Barry and Joel Ulster offered five-percent equity options to each of the four children and a fifteen-year royalty on four of its patented products . Litigation was before the courts concerning the purchase of the corporate assets and brands from the Winter children's estate, as Sherman and his partner never paid the royalties nor provided the promised equity in the businesses. In September 2017, an Ontario Superior Court justice ruled against the cousins saying the case was \"wishful thinking, and beyond fanciful.\" At the time of the judgement, a lawyer for the cousins said they would appeal, though no appeal occurred, and Sherman died a few months later under unknown circumstances."

His parents both died while he was at school. In 1889, he was barred from graduating after taking part in protests against the forced russification of German schools. He joined the Russian army as a volunteer, and in 1891 he was transferred to the reserves as a junior officer, and returned to Moscow. Liadov was first drawn to the populist Narodnik movement in Moscow in 1891, but by 1893, he had been converted to Marxism by his brother, Grigori Mandelstam, who had returned to Moscow from Paris, and was involved in founding the Moscow Workers\u2019 Union, the first Marxist organisation to have a following among factory workers in Moscow. He was arrested in 1892, and spent a short time in prison. In May 1895, he organised a meeting of the Central Workers' Union that drew a crowd of several hundred - the first of its kind held in Moscow. The meeting resulted in mass arrests, including Liadov's. He was held in prison for two years, then exiled to Verkhoiansk in 1897, for five years, after which he was sentenced to spend another two years under police supervision in Saratov, where he joined the Saratov Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party . In 1903, Liadov emigrated in 1903 to Geneva, and attended the Second Congress of the RSDLP, where he supported Vladimir Lenin in the disputes that led to the RSDLP splitting between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. He stayed loyal to Lenin when others were seeking to reunite the two factions, and took part in 1904 in the meeting of 22 Bolsheviks in Geneva, which created the 'Bureau of the Committees of the Majority', the forerunner of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, of which he was a member. He then attended the International Socialist Congress, Amsterdam 1904 as a Bolshevik delegate. During the 1905 Revolution, Liadov led the Baku Bolsheviks, during a strike by oil workers, but was arrested in August. He escaped and reached Moscow on 13 October,. There he was originally one of a triumvirate who led the Moscow Bolsheviks. The other two - V.L.Shanster and M.I.Vasilyev-Yushin - were arrested on 7 December, which meant that Liadov was leading the Moscow Bolsheviks when the workers put up barricades and fought the army for control of the working class districts of Moscow, but, according to the historian J.H.L.Keep, Liadov \"spent these two days wandering aimlessly through the streets. He had no headquarters from which to transmit orders to the militia groups.\" In January 1906, after the Moscow insurrection had been suppressed, Liadov travelled the Urals and Siberia, helping to organise the 4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in Stockholm, which he attended as a delegate. He was also a delegate to the Fifth Party Congress in London in May 1907. When the Bolsheviks split in June 1909, Liadov backed the Otzovisty faction, led by Alexander Bogdanov, and accused Lenin of being obsessed with \"the statutory strengthening of his personal influence\", an attitude which, he alleged, meant that the Bolsheviks had lost touch with the workers. In 1911, he moved to Baku and gave up illegal activity, to work in the oil industry, and later as an employee of the Nobel brothers. After the February Revolution, in 1917, Liadov was elected acting Chairman of the Baku Soviet, until the chairman, Stepan Shaumian, returned from exile in Siberia, and was appointed editor of the soviet's newspaper, Izvestya Bakinskogo soveta. At this time, he was aligned with neither faction of the RSDLP, but was ousted when the Bolsheviks seized control in October 1917. He was arrested when the Turkish army occupied Baku, held in prison for two months, then deported to Georgia, where he worked for the Menshevik government for two years. Liadov returned to Moscow in 1920. He was then readmitted into the Bolshevik Party and served on the Supreme Council of the National Economy. From 1923 to 1929, he was rector of the Sverdlov Communist University. Then he headed Glavnauka. His history of the party, first published in 1906\u201307, was reissued in 1923\u201326. He was also head of the agitprop department of the Moscow regional party, whose first secretary was Nikolai Uglanov. In 1929, when Stalin began the forced collectivisation of agriculture, Liadov, supported the right wing opposition, led by Uglanov and Nikolai Bukharin, for which he was sacked, and ostracised after Stalinist gained control of the Moscow organisation. In 1930 he was appointed director of the Archive of the October Revolution and served as a member of the academic boards of the Lenin Institute and of Istpart. He retired with a special pension in 1932. He died in Moscow in 1947 aged 74."

        "content": "Hieronymus Francken I was born in Herentals as the son of Nicolaes Francken, a painter from Herentals.  His father later settled in Antwerp and was likely his first teacher. His brothers Frans Francken I and Ambrosius Francken I both became successful painters. According to the early 17th century biographer Karel van Mander, who referred to him three times using three different names, i.e. Ieroon Francken van Herenthals, Ieroon Vrancks, and Ieroon Franck, Francken was a pupil of Frans Floris. He probably went to work with Floris in the early 1560s. It is unclear whether he traveled to Italy after his training in Antwerp. Such a trip is suggested by a work of his hand dated 1565 that depicts a scene from the Carnival of Venice . From 1566 to 1572 he was in France where he was one of the masters employed to decorate the Palace of Fontainebleau. Cornelis Floris, the Antwerp architect and brother of Francken's master Frans Floris, sent his son to Paris in 1568 to train with Hieronymus Francken I.  Hieronymus became a master in Paris in 1570 and a naturalized French citizen in 1572.  This did not stop him from returning to Antwerp regularly. In 1571 he was back in Antwerp to finish the Adoration of the Magi that had been left unfinished by Frans Floris when he died in 1570.  In 1574 he is documented in Antwerp. In 1571 he collaborated with his younger brother Frans on a large Adoration of the Magi triptych which bears his monogram as well as that of his younger brother Frans.  The brothers included self-portraits in profile: Hieronymus on the left side and Frans on the right side of the triptych.   From 1578 until his death Hieronymus lived in Paris and Fontainebleau. In 1578 Hieronymus married for the second time.  His second wife was Fran\u00e7oise Miraille, the daughter of an Italian embroiderer who was also concierge of Madame de la Roche-sur-Yon in Tournon Street.  The couple went on to have seven children. In 1619 four of his children were recorded as still being alive.  His daughter Isabella was a history and genre painter.  He was successful and frequented higher middle-class circles.  It is possibly that he also operated a side business as an art dealer. Hieronymus was appointed court painter to the French court in 1594.  His service at the French court had already started before this date. In the course of his career he served a large number of kings and queens including Louise de Lorraine , Henry III of France , the Queen-mother Catherine de' Medici and Henry IV of France as well as Marie de' Medici .  Near the end of his life, in 1607, Hieronymus was elevated to the nobility and could from then onwards refer to himself as 'noble homme, peintre du roy' . Hieronymus Francken I was the teacher of Abraham Bloemaert during Bloemaert's short stay in Paris and Fontainebleau from 1581 to 1583."

        "content": "Hieronymus Francken I painted religious works, that were idealistic and fully in line with 16th-century taste. He also painted allegorical works and groups of dancers at the court.  Along with the work of Lodewijk Toeput,  these compositions with elegant groups of dancing figures, musicians and courtiers of Francken anticipate the development of this genre in the 17th century, especially in the work of his nephew Frans Francken II. He also painted portraits. A self-portrait has been preserved and he included self-portraits in various of his history paintings.  In 1602, Hieronymus made a group-portrait of the senior merchants, city officers and aldermen of Paris . His paintings are in an elegant Mannerist style and unite elements of the Antwerp, Italian and French styles, although the influence of Fontainebleau is the most pronounced. Hieronymus was much acclaimed for his anatomical drawings, as is confirmed by Philip Galle's series of prints published under the title Instruction et fondements de bien pourtraire.  He likely also made designs for prints. A signed Let the children come unto me was engraved by Peeter Baltens but no other print design by his hand is known."

His father died in 1914, his mother in 1919. Ernst Bargheer, 24 years old at the time, assumed the guardianship of his younger brother and sisters and at his insistence Eduard trained to become a primary school teacher. During these early years, Eduard Bargheer not only benefited from his artistic training at the college of arts and crafts in Hamburg-Lerchenfeld but also embarked upon his own private studies, which he continued throughout his entire life. In 1924, the two brothers, Ernst and Eduard, fell out with one another, and Eduard set his own course toward becoming a painter. In 1925, Eduard Bargheer visited Italy for the first time, where he spent a long time in Florence. His deep affection for Italy and its culture was to be a principal theme of his life. Extended travels to Paris followed in 1926 and 1927. In 1928, Bargheer built himself a studio close to the Westerdeich in Finkenwerder. In 1929, he became a member of the Hamburg Secession. It was about this time that he became closely involved in the circles around the art historians Aby Warburg and Erwin Panofsky. In 1932/33, Bargheer used a grant from the City of Hamburg to live in Paris for several months, and there he made friends with Heinrich Heydenreich, a student of Panofsky's. In 1933, the Hamburg Secession disbanded of its own accord, for it did not wish to exclude its Jewish members, as the Nazi party required. Bargheer visited Switzerland in 1935 and met Paul Klee there. In the same year he bought a small fisherman's cottage \u2013 now the Bargheer Haus \u2013 on the slopes of the S\u00fcllberg in Blankenese, Hamburg. Four years later, in 1939, Bargheer left Germany for Ischia. After the war, he took part in documenta I in Kassel in 1955 and in documenta II in 1959. He was made an honorary citizen of Forio/Ischia in 1948; while still retaining his German nationality, he received Italian citizenship in 1951. He died in Blankenese, Hamburg in 1979."

        "content": "Hyder was most noted for his strong anti-nuclear stance, as well as for hunger strikes which he used to advocate his causes. Age 56, he began a supposed 218-day hunger strike on September 23, 1986, near the White House in Washington, demanding that Ronald Reagan stop the arms race and eliminate the use of nuclear weapons. Hyder's strike place was visited by a movie star Charlie Sheen, Congresswoman Barbara Boxer, as well as by his University students and colleagues. All visitors praised his dedication and determination, but begged to stop the strike for health-related concerns. U.S. Senator Tom Harkin spoke in support of Hyder's action, though he said he is \"not sure that his [Hyder's] death could contribute for the world peace as much as his life and work could.\" In the Soviet Union, Hyder was a regular participant in the broadcast program Vremya . A commemorative medal was minted in his honor. A lot of collective letters, briefly summarized as \"Save Doctor Hyder,\" were sent to Ronald Reagan by various Soviet worker assemblies. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev wrote a letter to Hyder, asking him to stop the strike and move to Moscow to continue his scientific work in the USSR. Hyder accepted only the first of Gorbachev's proposals. On the 218th day of the strike, frustrated and thinking that the U.S. President ignores him, Hyder went to a nearby restaurant and ordered dinner, thus ending the strike. When the hunger strike ended, Soviet punk rock band Nol composed a satirical song entitled \"\u0414\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0425\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0440\" , with its refrain meaning \"Dr. Hyder has started to eat again!\""

The Russian Gosteleradio correspondent in Washington, Vladimir Dunaev, introduced and explained the scientist's story to the Russian audience. Dunaev's son later revealed that to make the hunger strike look continuous, Dunaev would shoot five stories in succession every day, asking Dr. Hyder to change into different suits and ties. According to Dunaev, Hyder was advised by doctors to diet, as his weight openly threatened his health. During the hunger strike he lost almost half of his weight of 300 pounds. It was later revealed that Hyder drank fruit juice and took vitamins during the hunger strike. According to the most skeptical physicians, he fasted only in the daytime. After the end of the hunger strike, Hyder ran for president. He also subsequently accused the USSR of environmental pollution, after which Russian news agencies stopped reporting about him in the USSR. In 1999, he published the book \"Human Survival on a Plutonium-Contaminated Planet,\" again trying to fast in order to fight against the storage of nuclear waste ."

During his scholarship at the B\u00e9n\u00e9dictins of the Abbaye de Maredsours, Gaston-Fran\u00e7ois met the british zoologist George Albert Boulenger, who came to study fossils from Den\u00e9e. They became friends and Boulenger encouraged de Witte to study reptiles. When the First World War broke out, de Witte fled to Boulenger's house in London. There, he learned English. He worked at the British Museum of Natural history where Boulenger taught him technical preparations of zoological collections. On 9 February 1916, de Witte enlisted himself voluntarily. After the war, he studied at the Free University of Bruxelles. There, he would get his PhD. In 1920, he was temporarily associated with the Royal Museum for Central Africa of Tervuren, to replace, between 1920-1921, Henri Schouteden. In 1922, he married Marguerite del Marmol. From November 1924 to September 1925, he went, partially with the company of Schouteden, on a trip to explore the Belgian Congo. He brought back  specimens, mostly snakes and fish, but also an ethnographic ensemble and many photos, leaving everything to the Museum of the Belgian Congo. Nominated in 1927 as a definitive member, after Jean-Marie Derscheid left, he became in 1936 head of the zoology and entomology sections. From August 1930 to September 1931, he went on a mission to Katanga, finding zoological and botanical specimens, but also cultural artifacts. From August 1933 to 26 July 1935, he explored the Parc national Albert in the Congo, in the region of Kivu."

Moralee scored in 1 of his 32 League games for Doncaster in that season, and once in 2 FA Cup games. The following season he scored 3 times, all from the penalty spot.

She was the one woman in England under the bourgeoisie to be known as a classical scholar. The principal source for Catherine Tishem's life is a worshipful tribute to her son, Jan Gruter, written by one of his pupils, Balthasar Venator. According to Venator, Tishem was a remarkably erudite woman, fluent in Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and English and able to read Galen's original text. In 1558 in Antwerp, Tishem married a widowed and wealthy merchant and juror, Wouter Gruter , originally from Breda. They had four children, Jan being born in December 1560. Her husband co-signed the Compromise of Nobles in 1566, and to flee prosecution in the Spanish Netherlands, they moved to the Dutch Calvinist exile community of Norwich. Some biographies of Jan Gruter claim that Tishem was originally from Norwich herself, though Thijsmans/Thysmans was a regular Flemish patronymic. When their son enrolled at the new Leiden University in Holland in 1578/1579, Catherine and Wouter returned to Antwerp, but the Siege of Antwerp in 1584 made them flee again, this time to L\u00fcbeck and then Gda\u0144sk. Wouter Gruter died in Gda\u0144sk in 1588, and, according to Peter Fuchs, Catherine died in 1595."

His mother, Lisa Bennett, worked for the Illinois Attorney General. Bennett grew up in the middle-class neighborhood of West Chatham on Chicago's South Side. When Bennett was sixteen, his father began to work in the Department of Labor during President Barack Obama's first term. Bennett personally met President Obama in his youth and discussed his aspirations to be a rapper, to which Obama responded with \"word\". Bennett was originally going to move to Washington, D.C. following Obama's win in the 2008 presidential election, though those plans eventually fell through. Bennett attended Jones College Prep High School where he was a member of the Jewish Student Union. Bennett's interest in music began with Michael Jackson, who he exclusively listened to on cassettes until the fifth grade. Growing up, Bennett's parents were constantly playing music, including Billie Holiday, Sam Cooke and other artists in the jazz and gospel genres. Bennett began listening to hip-hop after hearing \"Through the Wire\" by Kanye West on the radio while walking through Hyde Park, Chicago. After finding out the song was on West's debut album The College Dropout, Bennett purchased the album, making it the first hip-hop album that Bennett listened to. Bennett considers West a huge influence on him and has said that he was inspired to begin rapping by West. Bennett and West met each other in August 2014 at Bonnaroo Music Festival. Bennett began rapping in the sixth grade when his cousin let him start using his studio. In his freshman year at Jones College Prep High School, Bennett formed the hip-hop duo Instrumentality alongside a friend. Many of Chance's earliest performances took place at the YOUmedia Lyricist Loft at Harold Washington Library in Chicago. After placing second in a local songwriting contest, Bennett met then-Chicago Mayor, Richard M. Daley who enjoyed his music. Bennett spent most of his junior year and a small amount of his senior year writing a draft for his debut project, 10 Day, which was later released after Bennett was suspended for ten days after being caught smoking cannabis."

        "title": "Chance the Rapper_Activism and politics",
        "content": "Bennett's father, Ken Bennett, has been involved in Democratic Party politics on the local and national level. Ken Bennett worked for Barack Obama as a presidential appointee and as an aide. Ken Bennett also worked on Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, and has worked as an aide to Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel and as 2019 Chicago mayoral campaign co-chair for Toni Preckwinkle. Despite his family's ties to the Democratic Party, Bennett has called himself an independent voter, though he has a history of supporting Democrats. Bennett volunteered with Barack Obama's reelection campaign by phonebanking in Hyde Park, Chicago and has given speeches at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. In November 2014, Emanuel named Bennett as Chicago's Outstanding Youth of the Year for his activism. Bennett's work to support Chicago youth includes hosting Open Mike nights for Chicago-area high school students in collaboration with Chicago Public Library, which drew the attendance of fellow Chicago natives and celebrities like Hannibal Buress and Kanye West. In December 2015, Bennett joined with Detroit-based nonprofit group Empowerment Plan to start an initiative called Warmest Winter 2016. The initiative raised money to give 1,000 specially manufactured coats, which doubled as sleeping bags and shoulder bags, and were manufactured by homeless citizens of Detroit, to homeless citizens of Chicago. In June 2016, he hosted the Teens in the Park event, a free youth festival on Chicago's Northerly Island that drew an attendance of 3,300. Bennett co-created a new nonprofit called SocialWorks in September 2016, an extension of his Open Mike program which aimed to create youth programs for residents of Chicago, among other goals. Open Mike nights and the Warmest Winter initiative later became part of SocialWorks. Bennett has actively fought to combat gun violence in his hometown of Chicago and in 2014, along with his father, promoted the \"#SaveChicago\" campaign. The campaign sought to stop gun violence over Memorial Day Weekend. During 2014's Memorial Day weekend, Chicago went 42 straight hours without a shooting. Bennett met with President Obama at the White House on April 16, 2016, to discuss My Brother's Keeper Challenge, an initiative of the United States Federal Government to promote intervention by civic leaders in the lives of young men of color to address their unique challenges and to promote racial justice, with other musicians, including Alicia Keys, Busta Rhymes, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, J. Cole, and others. Bennett started a Twitter campaign for May 23, 2016 using #May23 to stop gun violence for 42 hours. On March 6, 2017, after a meeting with Governor Bruce Rauner that did not go well only days before, Bennett announced his intention to donate $1,000,000 to Chicago Public Schools in order to help offset the lack of government funding provided. Following this, a movement arose to try and inspire Bennett to run for mayor of Chicago. This was backed by fellow media personalities including musician Drake. Bennett is an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, having criticized him numerous times and drawn comparisons to former President Barack Obama. During the 2016 Presidential election, Bennett said he was not scared of a Trump presidency. When asked why by GQ, Bennett said \"You gotta just understand, like, shit has been fucked-up, right? Like, 'Make America Great Again', that's not a real thing because shit ain't really switched up for [white middle class]\". Bennett endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on October 6, 2016, expressing concerns about the way she was treated in the media and also expressing that she could \"fix Chicago\" and led a \"march\" to numerous polling stations with thousands of Chicagoans. Following the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, Bennett said \"Trump was going to win, anybody in the world who's surprised by the election of Donald Trump has been ignorant of racism, and the tides and patterns of American history and world history.\" In February 2017, Bennett posted publicly on Twitter that he was worried President Trump was going to change constitutional term limits. Bennett has compared Trump's fascination with Chicago to \"going to war\". In August 2017, Bennett claimed to have a \"bigger voice than Donald Trump\". Bennett also became an outspoken critic of Chicago Mayor Emanuel later in his term, though his father had worked for Emanuel and he himself had earlier accepted Emanuel's support. Bennett has been an active Twitter user, with several of his tweets on social issues going viral. For example, Bennett garnered attention from Time magazine when he tweeted criticism of an article titled \"In Wake of Weinstein, Men Wonder If Hugging Women Still OK\". Following Kanye West's Tweets announcing his support of Donald Trump in April 2018, Bennett tweeted in support of West's freedom to choose to be Republican, sparking controversy among his fanbase. Trump later tweeted thanking Bennett for his support of West, though Bennett disavowed Trump's praise. In July 2018, Bennett purchased the Chicago journalism website Chicagoist from WNYC. The website had been inactive since it was abruptly shut down by former owner Joe Ricketts in November 2017, and Bennett planned to relaunch the website later in 2018. Chicagoist did not relaunch in 2018, and it is currently planning a 2019 reopening, according to its website. In the 2019 Chicago mayoral election, Bennett was an active supporter of Amara Enyia. Bennett initially endorsed Enyia at a press conference in October 2018. Bennett campaigned with Enyia and made major donations to her mayoral bid. Fellow rapper and Chicago native Kanye West also donated to Enyia's campaign. In the February 2019 election, Enyia finished fifth out of fourteen candidates, and did not advance to the mayoral runoff. Lori Lightfoot and Preckwinkle, who had hired Chance's father as campaign co-chair, instead advanced to the runoff. In the runoff, Bennett endorsed Preckwinkle, criticizing Lightfoot as having worked against the interests of Chicago's black community. In 2020, Bennett will be honored by UNICEF at their annual gala in Chicago with the UNICEF Chicago Humanitarian Award. In 2020, Bennett endorsed Kanye West for president in West's 2020 presidential campaign. Bennett took to Twitter to praise West, stating he trusted in him more than he trusted Joe Biden. His Tweets were criticized heavily, but Bennett reiterated that he did not take them back."

In September 2015, Corley gave birth to their daughter, Kensli. Kensli was kept out of social media until December 31, 2016, when Bennett posted a picture of her on Instagram. In May 2016, after they had stopped living together, Corley wanted the courts to declare Bennett as the father of their daughter, requiring him to pay child support. In February 2017, Bennett's child support case reopened in an attempt to work out child support terms and a parenting schedule as Bennett and Corley moved to separate residences. The Chicago Sun-Times published an article about a dispute between the two in March 2017. Bennett replied to the article saying \"Y'all better do y'all jobs and stop worrying about how good my family is. Just a friendly reminder. Don't let anybody get between you and your family.\" On March 21, 2017, the dispute was settled out of court. Corley and Bennett reconciled, and on July 4, 2018, they became engaged after 5 years together. The two married on March 9, 2019 at the Pelican Hill Resort in Newport Beach, California with guests including Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Bennett spends much of his free time with his daughter, and frequently takes her on outings. These have included a Chicago Bulls basketball game, meeting the Obamas and working out.

He was trained by his father, Christian Grund, who worked as a court painter in Kolovrat. In 1737, Grund completed his apprenticeship and subsequently traveled to Vienna and Venice. Grund returned to Prague in 1751, and in 1753 he joined the painters' guild of Mal\u00e1 Strana. His works were influenced by concern for the welfare of his extended family. Therefore, he typically painted smaller formats and more marketable subjects. The basis of his works were small cabinet pictures, often genre works, but also landscapes and biblical themed works."

        "content": "Raymond Bernard Strauss was an Australian sportsman who played both cricket and field hockey at high levels. From Perth, Western Australia, Strauss attended Perth Modern School and later the University of Western Australia, playing for the university's hockey club. Twice named captain of the all-Australian universities side, he was captain of the side on several occasions, including when the team shared the 1952 Syme Cup with the University of Adelaide. Strauss represented Western Australia on various occasions from 1949 to 1955, and made his Test debut for the Australian national team in August 1954, against New Zealand , though it is unclear if he played further matches for the national side. At both club and state levels, he had largely played as a defender, usually as a fullback, and was known for his \"interceptions and long clearances\". Playing first for East Perth and then University at WACA district level, Strauss had played cricket matches for state colts teams as early as the 1950\u201351 season, but did not make his first-class debut for the state's senior team until the end of the 1952\u201353 season, playing for the state against the touring Australian and South African national teams. Opening the bowling with Harry Price against the South Africans, he took 7/75 in the side's second innings, although Western Australia still lost the match by 175 runs. A regular in the side throughout the remainder of the 1950s, Strauss took 25 wickets in a season on three separate occasions , often partnering with Des Hoare and Ron Gaunt. His best bowling figures came during the 1956\u201357 season in the opening Sheffield Shield match against South Australia, when he took 7/59 from 18 eight-ball overs. He finished that season with 33 wickets at an average of 22.48, the most of any fast bowler and second only to Victoria's Lindsay Kline overall. Having played his last matches for Western Australia during the 1959\u201360 season, Strauss spent both the 1960 and 1961 English seasons as the professional player for the East Lancashire Cricket Club in the Lancashire League, playing 52 league and seven cup matches over the two seasons. East Lancashire made the final of the Worsley Cup in both seasons, winning in 1961. Strauss took five-wicket hauls in both years, as well as scoring a half-century in the 1960 loss. However, his performance in that match was largely overshadowed by that of Burnley's professional, Indian Test player Dattu Phadkar, who took 8/54 and scored 68 not out. In league matches, Strauss took the most wickets for the club in both seasons, as well as leading the club's runs aggregates in the 1960 season. His 104 wickets during that season was only bettered by West Indies international Roy Gilchrist. He finished his first-class career with 139 wickets from 37 matches. Strauss died in Perth in July 2013, aged 85."

At the outbreak of World War I, he fled to England and established himself as a portraitist. In 1917, he moved to Italy to await the end of the war, then returned to Belgium. Wherever he was, he sought out humble people as the subjects for his paintings. His depictions of the fisherman of Nieuwpoort are especially popular. Many of them can be seen at the National Fishery Museum in Oostduinkerke. His son, Robert , was also a painter, as was his grandson  . His great-granddaughter, Nele, is currently a painter in Ghent."

He was one of the leaders of the Historical Right and prime minister of the Kingdom of Piedmont\u2013Sardinia, a position he maintained throughout the Second Italian War of Independence and Giuseppe Garibaldi's campaigns to unite Italy. After the declaration of a united Kingdom of Italy, Cavour took office as the first prime minister of Italy; he died after only three months in office and did not live to see the Roman Question solved through the complete unification of the country after the Capture of Rome in 1870. Cavour put forth several economic reforms in his native region of Piedmont, at that time part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, in his earlier years and founded the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. After being elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he quickly rose in rank through the Piedmontese government, coming to dominate the Chamber of Deputies through a union of centre-left and centre-right politicians. After a large rail system expansion program, Cavour became prime minister in 1852. As prime minister, Cavour successfully negotiated Piedmont's way through the Crimean War, the Second Italian War of Independence, and Garibaldi's Expedition of the Thousand, managing to maneuver Piedmont diplomatically to become a new great power in Europe, controlling a nearly united Italy that was five times as large as Piedmont had been before he came to power. Cavour was a Freemason of the Italian Symbolic Rite. English historian Denis Mack Smith says Cavour was the most successful parliamentarian in Italian history, but he was not especially democratic. Cavour was often dictatorial, ignored his ministerial colleagues and parliament, and interfered in parliamentary elections. He also practiced trasformismo and other policies which were carried over into post-Risorgimento Italy."

        "content": "Cavour was born in Turin during Napoleonic rule, into a family which had acquired estates during the French occupation. He was the second of two sons of Michele Giuseppe Francesco Antonio Benso, 4th Marquess of Cavour and Count of Isolabella and Leri, Lord of Corveglia, Dusino, Mondonio, Ottiglio and Ponticelli, Co-Lord of Castagnole, Cellarengo and Menabi, Cereaglio, Chieri, San Salvatore Monferrato, Santena and Valfenera, 1st Baron of the French Empire and his wife Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Suzanne, Marchioness of Sellon , herself of French origin. His godparents were Napoleon's sister Pauline, and her husband, Prince Camillo Borghese, after whom Camillo was named. Camillo and his older brother Gustavo were initially educated at home. He was sent to the Turin Military Academy when he was only ten years old. In July 1824 he was named a page to Charles Albert, the king of Piedmont . Cavour frequently ran afoul of the authorities in the academy, as he was too headstrong to deal with the rigid military discipline. He was once forced to live three days on bread and water because he had been caught with books that the academy had banned. He was found to be apt at the mathematical disciplines, and was therefore enlisted in the Engineer Corps in the Piedmontese-Sardinian army in 1827. While in the army, he studied the English language as well as the works of Jeremy Bentham and Benjamin Constant, developing liberal tendencies which made him suspect to police forces at the time. He resigned his commission in the army in November 1831, both because of boredom with military life and because of his dislike of the reactionary policies of King Charles Albert. He administered the family estate at Grinzane, some forty kilometers outside the capital, serving as mayor there from 1832 to the revolutionary upheaval of 1848. Cavour then lived for a time in Switzerland, with his Protestant relatives in Geneva. He grew acquainted with Calvinist teachings, and for a short while he converted from a form of unorthodox Catholicism, only to go back later. A Reformed pastor, Alexandre Vinet, impressed upon Cavour the need for the separation of church and state, a doctrine Cavour followed for the remainder of his life. He then traveled to Paris where he was impressed by parliamentary debates, especially those of Fran\u00e7ois Guizot and Adolphe Thiers, confirming his devotion to a political career. He next went to London, where he was much more disappointed by British politics, and toured the country, visiting Oxford, Liverpool, Birmingham, Chester, Nottingham, and Manchester. A quick tour through the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland eventually landed him back in Turin. Cavour believed that economic progress had to precede political change, and stressed the advantages of railroad construction in the peninsula. He was a strong supporter of transportation by steam engine, sponsoring the building of many railroads and canals. Between 1838 and 1842 Cavour began several initiatives in attempts to solve economic problems in his area. He experimented with different agricultural techniques on his estate, such as growing sugar beets, and was one of the first Italian landowners to use chemical fertilizers. He also founded the Piedmontese Agricultural Society. In his spare time, he again traveled extensively, mostly in France and the United Kingdom."

        "content": "The first apparently liberal moves of Pope Pope Pius IX and the Revolutions of 1848 spawned a new movement of Italian liberalism, allowing Cavour to enter the political arena, no longer in fear of the police. He then gave a speech in front of numerous journalists in favor of a constitution for Piedmont, which was eventually granted. Cavour, unlike several other political thinkers, was not at first offered a position in the new Chamber of Deputies, as he was still a somewhat suspicious character to the nation. Cavour never planned for the establishment of a united country, and even later during his Premiership his objective was to expand Piedmont with the annexation of Lombardy and Venetia, rather than a unified Italy. For example, during the conservative period, he gained a reputation as a non-revolutionary progressive. He was a poor public speaker.  Cavour then lost the next election, while the Piedmontese army was destroyed at the Battle of Novara, leading Charles Albert to abdicate, passing the throne to his son, Victor Emmanuel II. Cavour was then brought back into Parliament by the voters, where he was much more successful. His knowledge of European markets and modern economics earned him the positions of Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Commerce, and Minister of the Navy in 1850. Cavour soon came to dominate the cabinet of Prime Minister Massimo d'Azeglio.  Cavour united the Right Center and the Left Center in the chamber to show dominance there as well. In 1851, Cavour gained a Cabinet promotion to Minister of Finance  by working against his colleague from inside the Cabinet in a somewhat disreputable takeover, although this was to Piedmont's advantage because of his many economic reforms. It allowed Cavour to begin his railway expansion program, giving Piedmont 800 kilometres of track by the year 1860, one third of the railways in Italy at the time.  He took the lead in legislation weakening the powers of the Church to own land, control the schools and supervise marriage laws.  When the bishops protested, they were punished or exiled, making Cavour the hero of liberal anticlerical elements across Italy."

        "title": "Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour_Prime Minister of Piedmont\u2013Sardinia",
        "content": "Cavour formed a coalition with Urbano Rattazzi known as the Connubio , uniting the moderate men of the Right and of the Left, and brought about the fall of the d'Azeglio cabinet in November 1852. The King reluctantly accepted Cavour as prime minister, the most conservative possible choice, but their relationship was never an easy one. Cavour was generally liberal and believed in free trade, freedom of opinion, and secular rule, but he was an enemy of republicans and revolutionaries, whom he feared as disorganized radicals who would upset the social order. Cavour dominated debate in Parliament but is criticized for the controversial methods he used while Prime Minister, including excessive use of emergency powers, employing friends, bribing some newspapers while suppressing others, and rigging elections, though these were fairly common practices for the time. The national debt soared by a factor of six because of his heavy spending on modernizing projects, especially railways, and building up the army and the Royal Sardinian Navy. When he became Prime Minister Piedmont had just suffered a major defeat by Austria, but when he died, Victor Emmanuel II ruled a state five times as large, which dominated Italy and ranked among Europe's great powers. The allied powers of Britain and France asked Piedmont to enter the Crimean War, partially to encourage Austria to enter, which it would not do unless it was certain that Piedmontese troops were not available to attack Austrian positions in Italy. Cavour, who hoped that the allies would support Piedmont's expansion in Italy, agreed as soon as his colleagues' support would allow and entered the war on 10 January 1855. This was too late to truly distinguish themselves militarily, but the 18,000 man contingent earned Piedmont a position at the Congress of Paris that ended the war. In January 1858, the Italian Felice Orsini's attempted assassination of Napoleon III paradoxically opened an avenue of diplomacy between France and Piedmont. While in jail awaiting trial, Orsini wrote a public letter to the Emperor of the French, ending with, \"Remember that, so long as Italy is not independent, the peace of Europe and Your Majesty is but an empty dream... Set my country free, and the blessings of twenty-five million people will follow you everywhere and forever.\" Orsini was still executed, but Napoleon III began to explore the possibility of joint operation with Piedmont against Austria. Cavour and Napoleon met in July 1858 at Plombi\u00e8res-les-Bains, and the two agreed that Piedmont would attempt to provoke war with the Duchy of Modena, obliging Austria to enter, and France would then aid Piedmont. In return, Cavour reluctantly agreed to cede Savoy and the  County of Nice to France, and also arranged a royal marriage between Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy and Prince Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, surprisingly without Victor Emmanuel's consent. In the same year, Cavour sent his cousin, the famous beauty, photographic artist, and secret agent Virginia Oldo\u00efni, to further the interests of Italian unification with the emperor by whatever means possible, and by all accounts she succeeded, famously becoming the mistress of Napoleon. Both France and Piedmont began to prepare for war, but diplomatic support diminished rapidly. Napoleon III quickly soured on the plot, and Britain, Prussia, and Russia proposed an international congress, with one likely goal the disarmament of Piedmont. Piedmont was saved by Austria's sending an ultimatum on 23 April, demanding that Piedmont disarm itself, thus casting Austria as an aggressor. France mobilised and slowly began to enter Italy, but Piedmont needed to defend itself for a short period. Fortunately, rainstorms and Austrian indecision under Ferencz Graf Gyulai gave time for France to arrive in force. The battles of Magenta and Solferino left Franco-Piedmontese forces in control of Lombardy, but the Austrians remained confident of defending their \"fortress quadrilateral\" area, with four fortresses in Verona, Legnago, Peschiera, and Mantua. These defenses, the horrors of the Battle of Solferino, the possibility of Prussian entry into the war, and the potential for an over-strong Piedmontese state convinced Napoleon to sign a separate peace with Austria in the Treaty of Villafranca on 11 July 1859, ending the Second Italian War of Independence. Victor Emmanuel accepted the peace, but Cavour was so infuriated after reading the terms of the treaty that he tendered his resignation. He soon regained his optimism, however, as several of the terms, such as the restoration to power of the rulers of Tuscany and Modena, and the establishment of an Italian Confederation including Austria, were not actually carried out. General La Marmora succeeded to Cavour's post and insisted on following the treaty terms, even sending a letter to Tuscany asking that they restore their Grand Duke. Bettino Ricasoli, virtual dictator of Tuscany at the time, wrote about this appeal to his brother, saying: \"Tell General La Marmora that I have torn his letter into a thousand pieces.\" France continued direct talks with Piedmont on the destiny of the central Italian states, all of whose autocrats supported unification with Piedmont but were restrained by the treaty, which called for the restoration of their old governments. Cavour had retired to his estate at Leri, out of politics but concerned about the King's alliance with Garibaldi's revolutionaries and his desire to renew the war with Austria without allied support. When the weak La Marmora cabinet resigned, Victor Emmanuel was reluctant to have Cavour as premier again due both to their quarrel over the treaty of Villafranca and Cavour's success in preventing the king from marrying his mistress after the queen's death. But Cavour was sent for on 20 January 1860. Cavour agreed with Napoleon to cede Savoy and Nice to France, in order to annex Tuscany and Emilia to Piedmont. Plebiscites were arranged with huge majorities in all these provinces to approve the changes. Cavour managed to convince most that uniting Italy would make up for these territorial losses. With this, the first stage of unification was completed. It was now up to Garibaldi to overthrow the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and bring southern Italy into Piedmont's control. Garibaldi was furious that his birthplace, Nice, had been ceded to France, and wished to recapture the city, but a popular insurrection in Palermo on 4 April 1860 diverted him southward. He requested a brigade of Piedmontese to take Sicily, but Cavour refused. So instead, Garibaldi raised a force of a thousand redshirt volunteers. They landed at Marsala in Sicily on 11 May and won the battles of Calatafimi and Milazzo, gaining control of Sicily. Cavour attempted to annex Sicily to Piedmont, but Garibaldi and his comrade Francesco Crispi would not allow it. Cavour persuaded Victor Emmanuel to write a letter to Garibaldi, requesting that he not invade the mainland; the letter was indeed sent, but the King secretly wished Garibaldi to invade. He wrote another letter asking him to go ahead, but this was apparently never sent. Cavour meanwhile attempted to stir up a liberal revolution in Naples, but the populace was unreceptive. Garibaldi invaded, attempting to reach Naples quickly before Cavour found a way to stop him. On 7 September he entered Naples, at that time the largest city in Italy, and unilaterally declared Victor Emmanuel the King of Italy. Garibaldi was now military dictator of southern Italy and Sicily, and he imposed the Piedmontese constitution but publicly demanded that Cavour be removed, which alienated him slightly from Victor Emmanuel. Garibaldi was unwilling to stop at this point, and planned an immediate invasion of the Papal States. Cavour feared France in that case would declare war to defend the Pope and successfully stopped Garibaldi from initiating his attack. Garibaldi had been weakened by the Battle of Volturno, so Cavour quickly invaded the Papal regions of Umbria and Marche. This linked the territories conquered by Piedmont with those taken by Garibaldi. The King met with Garibaldi, who handed over control of southern Italy and Sicily, thus uniting Italy. The relationship between Cavour and Garibaldi was always fractious: Cavour likened Garibaldi to \"a savage\" while Garibaldi memorably called Cavour \"a low intriguer\"."

        "content": "In 1861, Victor Emmanuel II declared the Kingdom of Italy, making Cavour  Prime Minister of Italy. Cavour had many difficult issues to consider, including how to create a national military, which legal institutions should be retained in what locations, and especially the future of Rome. Most Italians thought Rome must be capital of a united Italy, but this conflicted with the temporal power of the Pope and also the independence of the Church. Cavour believed that Rome should remain the seat of \"a free church in a free state\", which would maintain its independence but give up temporal power. These issues would become known as the \"Roman Question\". Still Austrian Venetia was also a problem. Cavour recognized that Venice must be an integral part of Italy but refused to take a stance on how to achieve it, saying \"Will the deliverance of Venice come by arms or diplomacy? I do not know. It is the secret of Providence.\" A motion approving of his foreign policy passed by a huge majority, basically only opposed by left-wing and right-wing extremist groups. Creating Italy was no easy task, but ruling it proved a worse strain on the Prime Minister. In 1861, at the peak of his career, months of long days coupled with insomnia and constant worry took their toll on Cavour. He fell ill, presumably of malaria, and to make matters worse insisted upon being bled. His regular doctor would have refused, but he was not available; so Cavour was bled several times until it was nearly impossible to draw any blood from him. He was buried in Santena, near Turin. After his death, Italy would gain Venice in 1866 in the course of the Third Italian War of Independence, connected to the Austro-Prussian War. The Capture of Rome completed the unification of Italy in 1870."

        "content": "Ko Wen-je grew up in a modest household. His father Ko Cheng-fa had aspirations for Ko, as the eldest son, to become a medical doctor. His mother is Ho Jui-ying. After graduating from National Hsinchu Senior High School, Ko was accepted into the Medical School at NTU. Between August 1986 and September 1988, Ko served in the 269th mechanized infantry division of the Republic of China Army to fulfill his military service obligation. He was a combat medic with a rank of second lieutenant. Upon graduation, Ko placed first nationwide on the medical qualification exams and received his medical license. On the advice of his professor, Dr. Chu Shu-hsun, Ko decided to specialize in surgery and critical care within the department of Emergency Medicine, working on the front lines of the emergency room. After working in emergency services for 11 years, Ko traveled to the United States in 1993 for a one-year clinical fellowship program on artificial liver research at the University of Minnesota under Wei-Shou Hu. After returning to Taiwan in 1994, Ko continued to work in the emergency room while at the same time beginning his Ph.D. studies at NTU. With an invitation from Dr. Chu Shu-hsun, Ko helped found NTU's first organ transplant team with the goal of doing heart transplants. With the hope of increasing the transplant success rate, Ko brought in ECMO treatment from the US, and improved transplant success rate from 19% to 51%. On 30 January 2008, Ko set the world record for keeping a patient alive with ECMO machine for 117 consecutive days. Using the US treatment standards as a guide, Ko established a set of standards for organ transplant procedures in Taiwan that was later promulgated throughout Taiwan by the then Department of Health. In 2002, Ko received his PhD degree in clinical medicine from NTU. Aside from his work improving medical technology in Taiwan, Ko has since the year 2000 participated in many foreign medical conferences in the People's Republic of China , where he was also responsible for introducing ECMO treatment to the nation. On 15 July 2006, Ko wrote an article for the Min Sheng Daily titled \"Reflections, Errors, and Apologies: Chao Chien-ming\" that received considerable media attention and led to a number of politics-related interviews. On 18 November, Ko used ECMO to save the life of Shirley Shaw, wife of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who had fallen into a coma after a car accident. This incident in particular and the media attention it drew caused Ko Wen-je to become a household name. In 2010, Ko introduced the American concept of Integrated Care to Taiwan, and established the Integrated Care Unit at NTU Hospital with the aim of reducing treatment cost and improving quality of treatment and quality of life for the attendant doctors and nurses. Ko directed the emergency care team that treated Sean Lien for critical wounds after he was shot in the face through-and through at close range with a 9mm pistol on 26 November. Lien recovered quickly which led the media to speculate on the veracity of his story, but Ko quickly came forward to verify his claims. On 24 August 2011, Ko was held responsible for an organ transplant error and subsequently reprimanded by the university hospital and the Ministry of Health in Taiwan. He was the acting director for a standard organ transplant procedure which organs were taken from a coma patient who was also HIV-positive to 5 awaiting patients. In 2012, the Control Yuan accused Ko of misconduct for violating organ transplant procedure. In May 2013, the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice suspected Ko of involvement in the misappropriation of National Science Council funds by creating fraudulent receipts, and asked Ko for an itemized list of payment details. Ko was thus drawn into the Accounting Act Amendment scandal, but the Control Yuan never brought charges. In June that year, Ko's emergency trauma care student Dr. Tseng Yue-tsee was hit by a drunk driver and sustained major trauma. She was brought to the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. Ko went to the hospital as soon as he was notified and overseeing her treatment, but was unable to save her life at the end. As a result of this incident, Ko started a foundation for the prevention of drunk driving. In August, Ko was invited by Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung to attend a conference in Beijing and to visit Yan'an, Shaanxi Province. Ko became more focused on politics and announced his candidacy for Taipei City Mayor on 6 January 2014. Ko has made claims of having Asperger syndrome."

On 16 June, the DPP agreed not to put forward a candidate for the election, and to support Ko as representative of the Pan-Green Coalition without forcing Ko to join a party. On 10 November, Ko announced his intention to reject further monetary donations to his campaign, as the amount received by 31 October exceeded the NT$87\u00a0million cap set for Taipei mayoral elections. Ko's campaign was managed by: Yao Li-ming - general manager, Lee Ying-yuan - political platform, Chi Cheng - civic organisations, Chiou Yue-yee - youth organisation . Ko's advisers included Julian Kuo; political activist, and filmmaker Yang Huei-ju; and former DPP secretary Chang Yee-shan. DPP city councillor Chien Yue-yen, neurologist Pan Cheng-chih, and two recruits from youth outreach efforts were the acting spokespeople for the campaign."

        "content": "In October 2014, reports surfaced that according to Ethan Gutmann, an investigative writer who testified before the U.S. Congress on forced organ harvesting, Ko reportedly visited China in 2004 and tried to negotiate good prices for the organs illegally harvested from newly executed Falun Gong practitioners. Ko denied the accusation, and said he told Gutmann that there were some doctors in Taiwan who had been involved in buying or selling organs for transplant, but that he was not one of them. He added that he did not know whether the organs came from Falun Gong practitioners or not, and that he only stated in the interview with Gutmann that the majority of organ sources in mainland China were unclear. Ko's office stated that a recording of a conversation between Gutmann and Ko drastically contradict with details provided by Gutmann. Ko has also designated an attorney to request Gutmann to correct all false allegations in his book. Gutmann responded saying he had not said that Ko was involved in the organ trade and that he might have been intentionally misinterpreted. On 27 November, Gutmann released a legal response with lawyer Clive Ansley, stating that \"no English speaking reviewer of the book has understood page 255 in the way it has apparently been understood in Taiwan by readers whose first language is Chinese\", meaning that he has never accused Dr. Ko of being an organ broker. Instead, the readers have praised Ko for his significant contribution to \"the international effort to expose the medical crimes which continue to be perpetrated in China.\" In addition, Gutmann and Ansley state that \"the book was peer-reviewed by three expert readers and subjected to a lengthy internal editing process by Prometheus. This review included not only the text itself, but also the author's notes, interview tapes, and electronic communications.\" In the endnotes of The Slaughter, Gutmann says he gave Ko an advance draft of the section, and that Ko signed off on it, and only a few minor edits were made afterwards. A full explanation, including the actual email correspondence where Ko signed off on the story for publication, was provided by Gutmann in December."

In Brisbane Grade Cricket, he plays for Easts-Redlands District Cricket Club.

After playing just once for Queensland Academy, Labuschagne made his first-class cricket debut in the first round of the 2014\u201315 Sheffield Shield season against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Opening the batting with Joe Burns, he scored 83 runs in Queensland's first innings, featuring in a 99-run fourth-wicket partnership with Nick Stevens. Later in the 2014\u201315 season, Labuschagne was used as a substitute fielder for the Australian national side in the second Test against India at the Gabba, taking a low catch at short leg. Labuschagne made his List A debut for Queensland in the 2015 One-Day Cup in October 2015 and scored his maiden first-class century in the following month, making 112 runs in his eighth Sheffield Shield match. He scored 273 runs at a batting average of 45 in the 2016 One-Day Cup and was named player of the tournament. In September 2017, during a 2017 One-Day Cup match between Queensland and Cricket Australia XI, he became the first fielder to be penalised under the newly introduced Law designed to stop fielders deceiving batsmen. Labuschagne dived to field a ball in the covers, and although he failed to stop the ball he feigned throwing to the wicket-keeper. His team was penalised five runs. After being Queensland's leading run-scorer in the 2017\u201318 Sheffield Shield, Cricket Australia named him in their Sheffield Shield team of the season."

        "content": "Liz is Mad Decent's first pop artist and the first woman signed to the label. Before signing with Mad Decent, Liz was writing for and working with many different DJs and studios in the EDM community. It was through this community that she was introduced to Diplo who later signed her to his label in 2013. Throughout 2013, Liz released two EPs and a total of eight songs which included collaborating with producers such as The Picard Brothers, Djemba Djemba, Ryan Hemsworth, and Kevin Seaton. She also released the music videos for \"Hush\" and \"U Over Them\" during this year. The website Kick Kick Snare named Liz as their favorite solo artist of 2013 and stated that her melodies \"bend, twist, and weave around the nostalgic backing tracks in just the right way\" and that she was \"90's influenced, but forward thinking\". In addition to this, Charli XCX asked her to open for her True Romance U.S. Tour alongside KITTEN. It was during this tour that Liz sold her Tour CD. In 2014, Liz released her seven track EP Just Like You which she made available to download for free through her SoundCloud. She also collaborated with Pharrell Williams for the song \"That's My Man,\" which appeared on The Amazing Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. The music video for this song was released the same year as well as her music video for \"All Them Boys.\" Liz had met and collaborated with producer Sophie for the song \"When I Rule the World\" in 2014 but it was not released until 2015. It first appeared in a Samsung commercial and then later appeared in an episode of MTV's Scream. Shortly following the song's release was its music video which gained a lot of attention for its over-the-top glossy and early 2000s aesthetic and hyperpop sound. The song made both The Guardian's and The Idolator's list for \"one of the best songs of 2015.\" During October 2016, Liz released her mixtape, Cross Your Heart, which she made available to stream through her SoundCloud. It was a 33-minute, one-track file consisting of 16 different songs made with producers such as Henrik the Artist, Lido, Mess Kid, King Henry, and Valentino Khan. To complement the mixtape, Liz teamed up with Nicopanda to create a five-part fashion editorial. During the shoot, Liz had to continuously put glycerine on her face to achieve the \"plastic\" look seen in the photos. The mixtape received a lot of positive press which included Noisey calling it \"one of 2016's most forward-thinking pop releases.\" Liz has stated that being influential and being a \"tastemaker\" is important to her and her musical career. She places high value on being able to progress with music and pop culture and does not follow music trends without fully understanding the source of that music's origin. On November 15, 2019, Liz released her first full-length studio album Planet Y2K under Moving Castle with the singles \"Diamond in the Dark\", \"BTR 2GTHR\", \"Lottery\", \"Laguna Nights\", and \"Intuition\"."

She says those sounds had a big impact on her and helped her figure out who she was as an artist and as a person. Other artists that influenced her are Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, Gwen Stefani, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Robyn, Christina Aguilera, and Mariah Carey. Additionally, Liz says that Spears taught her \"how to be a pop star\". Japanese culture has been stated to have an effect on her music as well. She likes to explore the idea of innocence in her work, which she feels is present in a lot of Japanese music. Her music can also be tongue-in-cheek at times, and she enjoys taking on a different character for each of her songs."

The first flights were recorded and posted on YouTube and received 2.5 million views in just 15 days. In 2016, Zapata sold Zapata Racing to U.S. defense contractor Implant Sciences. In 2017, he provided the U.S. Army with demonstrations of the Flyboard Air . A July 2019 news report provided no indication of any serious interest as of that time for the flyboard technology."

        "content": "In April 2016, Zapata unveiled the Flyboard Air, a flight surfboard powered by four micro-turbines equipped with stabilizers to provide its pilots with approximately  approximately ten minutes of flight time. In March 2017, there was a media incident: Zapata flew a Flyboard Air near Marseille Provence Airport  and Airbus Helicopters in Marignane, much to the discomfort of the local flight authority. The Flyboard Air can fly autonomously as a plane and is subject to regulations governing the overflight of airspace.  Zapata flew unknowingly at this time, which led to the official threat of a flight ban and temporarily threatened the further development. Zapata used the incident to raise consumer and investor awareness. By negotiating with  the relevant authorities, including the military, he was allowed to continue development. Further development is planned in the areas of leisure, entertainment, military, medicine and industry. On July 14, 2019, Franky Zapata participated in the Bastille Day military parade riding his invention, the so-called \"jet-powered hoverboard\"; that model was powered by five turbines and fueled by kerosene. Three weeks later he succeeded in crossing the English Channel with his device. The previous attempt on 25 July had been unsuccessful, but during the second try on 4 August 2019, escorted by French Army helicopters and using a backpack fuel reservoir, he accomplished the  journey in about 20 minutes, including a fueling stop at the midpoint. Zapata reached a speed of  and maintained an altitude of approximately . The trip started at Sangatte in the Pas de Calais region of France and concluded at St Margaret's at Cliffe in Kent, UK where he landed safely. When reporters compared his journey to the first cross-channel flight by Louis Bl\u00e9riot in a monoplane on 25 July 1909, Zapata told BFM television: \"It\u2019s not really comparable, he was one of the first men to fly. Let\u2019s just say that I achieved my dream\". During a press conference after the crossing he also said, \"Whether this is a historic event or not, I\u2019m not the one to decide that, time will tell\". Zapata's company, Z-AIR, had received a \u20ac1.3m grant from the French military in December 2018. However, he has said that the flyboard was not yet suitable for military use due to the noise it creates and the challenge of learning how to fly the device. In 2017, Zapata had provided the U.S. Army with demonstrations of the Flyboard Air referred to as the EZ-Fly in some news reports, which suggested the price per unit might be $250,000. A July 2019 report provided no indication of any serious interest by the American military as of that time for this new technology. On 5 August 2019, Zapata said that he was working on a flying car and had flown a prototype chassis powered by four gas turbines. \"I need to finish building my flying car, I need to introduce it before the end of the year\", he told BFM TV after his English Channel crossing."
