At , it is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework, and was the world's tallest building for 11 months after its completion in 1930. , the Chrysler is the 11th-tallest building in the city, tied with The New York Times Building. Originally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the building was constructed by Walter Chrysler, the head of the Chrysler Corporation. The construction of the Chrysler Building, an early skyscraper, was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. Although the Chrysler Building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it; Walter Chrysler decided to fund the entire cost personally so his children could inherit it. An annex was completed in 1952, and the building was sold by the Chrysler family the next year, with numerous subsequent owners. When the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, ranging from views of it as inane and unoriginal to the idea that it was modernist and iconic. Perceptions of the building have slowly evolved into its now being seen as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style; and in 2007, it was ranked ninth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1978, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1976."

        "content": "Belton House is a Grade I listed country house in the parish of Belton near Grantham in Lincolnshire, England, built between 1685 and 1688 by Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet. It is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period. It is considered to be a complete example of a typical English country house. For about three centuries until 1984, Belton House was the seat successively of the Brownlow family, which had first acquired land in the area in the late 16th century, and of its heirs the Cust family (in 1815 created Earl Brownlow). Despite his great wealth Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet, chose to build a comparatively modest house rather than one of the grand Baroque palaces being built by others at the time. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. The new house was fitted with the latest innovations such as sash windows for the principal rooms, and more significantly, with completely separate areas for the staff. Successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the fabric and design of the house changed little. Following World War I the Custs, like many wealthy English families, were faced with mounting financial problems and finally in 1984 they donated the house, with most of its contents, to the National Trust, which now opens Belton to the public. It is in a good state of repair and is visited by many thousands of tourists each year."

Roosevelt thought that it was a suitable memorial to the Founding Fathers of the United States and to Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the United States Declaration of Independence and the founder of the Democratic-Republican Party. The neoclassical building is situated in West Potomac Park on the shore of the Potomac River. It was designed by John Russell Pope and built by Philadelphia contractor John McShain. Construction began in 1939 and was completed in 1943. The bronze statue of Jefferson was added in 1947. Pope made references to the Roman Pantheon whose designer was Apollodorus of Damascus, and to Jefferson's own design for the rotunda at the University of Virginia. The Jefferson Memorial and the White House form one of the main anchor points in the area of the National Mall in D.C. The Washington Monument was intended to be located at the intersection of the White House and the site for the Jefferson Memorial, but soft swampy ground required that it be situated to the east. The national memorial is managed by the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior  under its National Mall and Memorial Parks division.

It is not an administrative building but a civic suite, Lord Mayor's parlour and Council chamber; local government administration is centred at the nearby Cunard Building. The town hall was built between 1749 and 1754 to a design by John Wood the Elder replacing an earlier town hall nearby. An extension to the north designed by James Wyatt was added in 1785. Following a fire in 1795 the hall was largely rebuilt and a dome designed by Wyatt was built. Minor alterations have subsequently been made. The streets surrounding its site have altered since its initiation, notably when viewed from Castle Street, the south-side, it appears as off-centre. This is because Water Street which ran to the junction with Dale Street, the west-east axis, was continuous and built up across the junction so that the town hall was not visible originally from that aspect. The structures were removed 150 years after this to expose the building from this position. The ground floor contains the city's Council Chamber and a Hall of Remembrance for the Liverpool servicemen killed in the First World War. The upper floor consists of a suite of lavishly decorated rooms which are used for a variety of events and functions. Conducted tours of the building are arranged for the general public and the hall is licensed for weddings."

The first Carmelites were Christian hermits living on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land during the late 12th and early to mid-13th century. They built in the midst of their hermitages a chapel which they dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, whom they conceived of in chivalric terms as the \"Lady of the place.\" Our Lady of Mount Carmel was adopted in the 19th century as the patron saint of Chile. Since the 15th century, popular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel has centered on the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, also known as the Brown Scapular. Traditionally, Mary is said to have given the Scapular to an early Carmelite named Saint Simon Stock (1165-1265). The liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated on 16 July. The solemn liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was probably first celebrated in England in the later part of the 14th century. Its object was thanksgiving to Mary, the patroness of the Carmelite Order, for the benefits she had accorded to it through its difficult early years. The institution of the feast may have come in the wake of the vindication of their title \"Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary\" at Cambridge, England, in 1374. The date chosen was 17 July; on the European mainland this date conflicted with the feast of St. Alexis, requiring a shift to 16 July, which remains the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel on the Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church. The Latin poem \"Flos Carmeli\" (meaning \"Flower of Carmel\") first appears as the sequence for this Mass."

Built by Prussian King Frederick the Great as his summer palace, it is often counted among the German rivals of Versailles. While Sanssouci is in the more intimate Rococo style and is far smaller than its French Baroque counterpart, it, too, is notable for the numerous temples and follies in the surrounding park. The palace was designed and built by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff between 1745 and 1747 to meet Frederick's need for a private residence where he could escape the pomp and ceremony of the royal court. The palace's name is a French phrase (sans souci) that translates as \"without concerns\", meaning \"without worries\" or \"carefree\", emphasising that the palace was meant as a place of relaxation, rather than a seat of power. Sanssouci is little more than a large, single-story villa\u2014more like the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly than Versailles. Containing just ten principal rooms, it was built on the brow of a terraced hill at the centre of the park. The influence of King Frederick's personal taste in the design and decoration of the palace was so great that its style is characterised as \"Frederician Rococo\", and his feelings for the palace were so strong that he conceived it as \"a place that would die with him\". Because of a disagreement about the site of the palace in the park, Knobelsdorff was fired in 1746. Jan Bouman, a Dutch architect, finished the project. During the 19th century, the palace became a residence of Frederick William IV. He employed the architect Ludwig Persius to restore and enlarge the palace, while Ferdinand von Arnim was charged with improving the grounds and thus the view from the palace. The town of Potsdam, with its palaces, was a favourite place of residence for the German imperial family until the fall of the Hohenzollern dynasty in 1918. After World War II, the palace became a tourist attraction in East Germany. Following German reunification in 1990, Frederick's body was returned to the palace and buried in a new tomb overlooking the gardens he had created. Sanssouci and its extensive gardens became a World Heritage Site in 1990 under the protection of UNESCO; in 1995, the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg was established to care for Sanssouci and the other former imperial palaces in and around Berlin.

The important late Gothic abbey church with early Baroque stucco work by the Wessobrunn stuccoist Georg Schmuzer is now the parish church. Part of what few buildings remained came into the possession of the Dominican sisters in 1892. The dispensary and the service block passed into private ownership.

He had a relationship of mutual respect with the Dakota Indians with whom he traded, even to the degree of sheltering friendly Indians during the Dakota War of 1862.  In 1853, he built a large frame house.  His house reflected his prosperity, with nine bedrooms, a music room, a parlor, a sitting room, an office, a kitchen, a summer kitchen, and a sewing room.  Part of his wealth came from \"traders' claims\" stemming from the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, but he was also the proprietor of a sawmill and a flour mill.  In turn, he was generous to the community, donating $3,000 to Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple for the church and for Shattuck School.  He also donated land for the Seabury Divinity School.  He served as a delegate to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature and remained friends with Henry Mower Rice and Henry Hastings Sibley, even though Rice and Sibley were personal and political enemies."

The most sophisticated and best-preserved house is that of Nathaniel Root, at 1044 Boston Turnpike.  The ground in the area of the glassworks (of which no structures survive) is littered with melted glass fragments and burnt brick fragments. The Coventry Glassworks was established in 1813, in part to meet demand for glass objects that had previously been fulfilled by English companies, a source cut off by the War of 1812.  The glassworks founders included experienced glassblowers and local businessmen, who combined their capital and expertise.  The company produced small bottles, inkstands, and flasks, and is credited with creating the first \"portrait flask\", bearing a depiction of the Marquis de Lafayette in commemoration of his 1825 visit to the United States.  The company had a rotating cast of partners and glassblowers, and remained in operation until about 1845, when its proprietors at that time moved the business to Willington.  Most of the houses in this area were built by or for either the proprietors, or the workers they hired."

It is located on Minnesota State Highway 1 about one mile east of Isabella.  The complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its association with New Deal federal relief construction. Of the 21 buildings, 11 are listed as contributing properties to the district.  These were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s and were built of horizontally-laid wood logs, mostly aspen and pine.  These buildings consist of dwellings, an office building, storage facilities, and warehouses.  Some other buildings on the site were constructed after the CCC built the original complex, and are not considered contributing properties. The ranger station is nationally significant for its use as an administration center that supported multiple federal land management functions within the Isabella Ranger District of the Superior National Forest.  The rustic architecture is also significant because it was common to the design of land management administrative buildings within this time period.  The historic context of the Superior National Forest began with a recommendation by General C.C. Andrews that all of the public land within Cook County, Minnesota and Lake County, Minnesota, totaling around , should be preserved as a forest reserve.  On February 13, 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt established the Superior National Forest with an area of .  Additional proclamations raised the size of the forest to .  During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps was formed to provide relief for unemployment, and also to stimulate local economies through federally funded, grassroots development projects.  The Isabella guard station served as a facility for crews that were working in an often roadless area within the Superior National Forest.  While crews and their assignments changed frequently, CCC Company 701, based in Ely, Minnesota, and Company 3703, based in Baptism River, Minnesota were confirmed to be involved in the construction of this station.

In 1899 it was donated to the church and converted to a chapel. In 1930 it was restyled Gothic Revival to complement the church. In 1898 the parish built a guildhall west of the firehouse. It is styled Gothic Revival like the other buildings, with lancet windows and a cross in the brickwork. Between 1905 and 1910 the rectory was added, a -story cream-brick building designed by A. Arthur Guilbert in Gothic Revival style. It has since been converted to serve as Parish Center, with an auditorium added in 1956."

Its significance is related to the local social movement that provided a safe place to live for young women and education programs that encouraged their business and professional development. The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) was established in Ottumwa in 1894 by 64 charter members. They began with opening reading and rest rooms before they opened a boarding house. In 1903 they acquired the former First Baptist Church building for their use. They cooperated with the local Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) for recreational and camping activities. The YMCA built a new larger facility in 1921 and the YWCA considered buying their old building, but they decided to build their own building instead. The YWCA hired the Minneapolis architectural firm of Croft & Boerner to design the Renaissance Revival building. It was completed in 1925 by contractor C.W. Ennis. The three-story brick structure features round arch openings on the first floor and windows that diminish in size on the upper floors.  The interior features terrazzo floors and oak woodwork that exhibits an American Craftsman influence. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005."

It is a substantial house whose architecture includes Late Victorian and Classical Revival elements.  It is significant as a well-preserved artifact from the boom period in Lehi's development. The house was built by/for Christian Knudsen, a successful stockman who was prominent in his industry and also known in the town for his philanthropy and for his service in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  While Knudsen and others made money from cattle, other wealth in Lehi derived from the Utah Sugar Company Factory based there; both industries benefited from the railroad which had first connected Lehi in 1872\u2014the same year that Christian Knudsen, 15 years old, arrived with his family from Norway.  The wealth and connection to the rest of the nation brought awareness of architectural styles, and many elaborate homes were built. Knudsen married Sarah L. Otteson, of Spanish Fork in 1879 and they had 10 children.  His Mormon church service included doing a mission that took him to Norway in 1896, and serving as head teacher in the Sunday school.  According to the National Register nomination, the house was intended to stand until the Millennium.  The Knudsens donated significantly to help build the Stake houses (Mormon administration offices) in Alpine, Lehi, and Provo. The house is also of interest for serving, under the Knudsens, as a \"halfway house for Scandinavian travelers on their way to and from Salt Lake City.\" Much later, during World War II, the house served as a relocation center for four \"Japanese\" families.  (Note that the Topaz War Relocation Center, one of 10 Japanese-American internment camps was located in rural area only about 110 miles away.)  It was renovated into three apartments to help address Lehi's wartime housing shortage.  Lehi was the location near to Camp Williams, the Geneva Steel Plant, and industry in the Salt Lake Valley. The building was converted back to a single family house in 1964 and a restoration of the house began in 1985. The restored home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998."

The district encompasses 158 contributing buildings in the town of Accomac, mainly grouped into two periods of construction. From its founding in 1786 through the second quarter of the nineteenth century, several residential, commercial, governmental, and religious structures were built in the core of Accomac, representing both high-style and vernacular examples of late Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles. Notable structures surviving from this period include the rectory of St. George's Episcopal Parish (1798, 1811); the Seymour House (1791-1815); Roseland (1750-1850); Seven Gables (1786-1905); Rural Hill (1816, 1835), and the Francis Makemie Presbyterian Church (1840). The second period of construction reflected in the town dates to the last quarter of the nineteenth century, when the arrival of the New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk Railroad spawned renewed growth and economic prosperity in Accomack County following the Civil War. These buildings also display both high-style and vernacular expressions of Victorian Era styles, including Second Empire, Italianate, Gothic Revival, and Romanesque. Notable structures from this time period include Bayly Memorial Hall (a former Baptist Church built in 1870 and later moved), the County Clerk's Office (1887), the Accomack County Courthouse (1899), and houses found in the Lilliston Avenue extension of the town built in the 1880s-1890s. There are also contributing structures dating from the first quarter of the twentieth century, including the Drummondtown Baptist Church (1914), Drummondtown United Methodist Church (1920), and the former hotel at the town square (1925). There are three structures within the Accomac Historic District which are listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places. They are the Debtors' Prison, the Bank Building, and St. James Episcopal Church. The Accomac Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992."

Cole Fairbanks City Hall, also known as Main School and Old Main for its previous use as a school building, is located at 800 Cushman Street in downtown Fairbanks, Alaska.  An Art Deco concrete building, it was built in 1934 to replace the original Fairbanks school, a wooden building constructed in 1907 which burned down in late 1932.  As Fairbanks grew exponentially with the military buildup associated with World War II and the Cold War, the building was enlarged in 1939 and again in 1948. It was the city's only school from its opening in 1934 until the opening of Denali Elementary School in 1951.  It became a junior/senior high school for several years until Lathrop High School began operation.  The school then became Main Junior High School until it was replaced by Ryan Junior High School and Tanana Junior High School during the early 1970s. Following the disestablishment of Main Junior High, instruction in the building was mostly limited to alternative education programs.  The building's primary purpose at that point was to house the administrative offices of the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District, a role it filled from 1976 until 1993.  Most of those offices moved to the school district's current Fifth Avenue headquarters in the mid 1980s, and the building sat largely vacant for many years, eventually being completely abandoned. The building has housed city offices since 1994, which moved from the longtime Fairbanks City Hall three blocks to the north.  In addition to city offices, the former school gymnasium is home to the Fairbanks Boys & Girls Club.  Previous non-governmental tenants of the building under city ownership have included the Fairbanks Boxing Club and the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 as Main School."

The construction of the palace that was initially designed by French architect \u00c9tienne Bouchard in the Louis XIII style was soon suspended after the death of Prince Semyon Mikhailovich Vorontsov. In 1889 the unfinished palace was bought by the Russian Imperial Domains Agency for Alexander III of Russia.  The new owner commissioned his favorite architect Maximilian Messmacher to modernize the villa's design. Although Massandra was listed among imperial residences, no royals ever stayed there over night (rather preferring the neighboring Livadia Palace). After the October Revolution and before World War II, the residence was used as a government sanatorium \"Proletarian Health\" for people ill with tuberculosis. After World War II it was used as a state cottage (dacha) under the name \"Stalinskaya\". After the fall of the Soviet Union, Massandra Palace was used as one of the Ukrainian official residences where were signed the Massandra Accords in 1993. In 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea, the residence was taken over by the Russian Presidential Affairs Administration. A bust of Alexander III was unveiled in front of the villa in 2017."

It was built around 1873 by carpenter Harley McDonald, one of the first settlers to offer architectural services in Oregon, and is one of only two houses designed by McDonald remaining in Forest Grove. Its Italianate form and Gothic details are highly distinctive in Forest Grove, while its veranda (added around 1900) exhibits Colonial styling. Benjamin and Rachel Cornelius, the first occupants of the house, had crossed the Oregon Trail via the Meek Cutoff in 1845; the Cornelius family was instrumental in the foundation of Hillsboro and the town of Cornelius during their lifetime, and Benjamin was also prominently involved in early real estate transactions in the area. Benjamin  was murdered in 1881, during the couple's tenure at this house. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, and included as part of the Clark Historic District in 2002."

More precisely, it is an early-Gothic building with Romanesque elements that dates back to the beginning of the 13th century (mentioned in 1208), partly reconstructed after World War II. It was the centre for the Cistercians of Trzebnica, which is why it was called the House of the Ladies of Trzebnica. Nearby, along the Kotlarska Street, were the Nowe Jatki, a medieval shopping center belonging to the monastery. The building was erected on a trapezoidal plan made of brick laid in a Wendish thread (two-wheeled, also called Slavonic). The Romanesque elements of this building, including the arches in the central part, are mixed with Gothic details of the windows and the arches of the vaults. On each of the two floors of the building there were originally three rooms. The building was repeatedly rebuilt, and remained the property of the monastery until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1810. During WWII the site around Bishop Nankier's Square was damaged. During the renovation in 1959, historic fragments of the oldest architectural foundation of the building located under the street level were discovered. From 1966 to 1969, the site was partially reconstructed according to the project of Henryk Dziurla. Over eight centuries, the level of neighbouring streets has risen to the height of the upper storey of the building, which is why the entrance today is subterranean. In the southern part of the lower storey there are fragments of the old barrel vaults, and on the upper floor, cross vaults. During the reconstruction the ceiling was partially removed, joining the upper and lower storeys, and the whole building was covered with a contemporary reinforced concrete roof. The above-ground part was glazed from the outside. The place was then adapted for the needs of the art gallery under the patronage of the Center for Cultural Arts in Wroc\u0142aw (OKiS). Later, the gallery was transformed into Foto-Medium-Art Gallery, and become one of the most important Neo-avantgarde centres in Poland. Then it changed its name to the Lower Silesia Centre of Photography, \"Romanesque House\". From January 2017 it is called the Foto-Gen Gallery. In April 2017, a bronze plaque commemorating the Cistercian foundation \"House of the Ladies of Trzebnica\" was placed in the facade of the building and the name Dom Panien Trzebnickich (House of the Ladies of Trzebnica) came back into official use . Foto-Gen Gallery specializes in showing photography and new media. There are regular exhibitions for home and international artists, presentations as well as lectures organized there. Media reportages from these events can be seen on Centre for Cultural Arts in Wroc\u0142aw (OKiS) video channel, local and nationwide media."

It is the fourth and final residence designed by architect Wade Pipes (1877\u20131961) for his friends John and Elizabeth Bates, and the penultimate and finest commission of his career. In it, Pipes designed not only the building but also the landscape, furnishings, and interior finishes, representing the culmination of his work as a pivotal figure in the Arts and Crafts movement in Oregon, while also giving a nod to the Northwest Regional style. Built in 1954 on a lot fronting Oswego Lake, it is distinguished by clean, flowing lines, attention to its setting, a rubblestone wall buffering it from the nearby street, one of Pipes' signature bay windows, a central courtyard, and other features. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. By 2018, most of the house's significant features were either significantly deteriorated or gone altogether, including the complete loss of Pipes' custom furniture and built-ins. This loss of integrity prompted the owner to petition for it to be removed from the National Register."

        "content": "The Camino del Monte Sol Historic District, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is a  historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  The listing included 106 contributing buildings. It includes some works by architect John Gaw Meem, and works by notable artists if not certified architects. The district is in the southeast corner of Santa Fe, to the south of the Santa Fe River, and extends south of the Acequia Madre (Mother Ditch).  It consists mostly of north-south streets.  It adjoins the National Register-listed Santa Fe Historic District to the north and west.  It is roughly bounded by the Acequia Madre, Camino del Monte Sol, El Caminito, and Garcia St. Its significance was described in its 1987 National Register nomination:Beginning in the years following New Mexican statehood in 1912, and continuing until World War II, this district was the center of a nationally known colony of artists, a remarkable group of multi-talented, creative people, many of whom had national reputations before settling in a remote and little known region of the country. These artists made important contributions not only to their own fields, primarily literature and painting, but also to the community to the extent that they can be considered in large part responsible for the unique milieu of Santa Fe today. Although no longer functioning as a colony, many creative people continue to live in Santa Fe and contribute to its character. The city depends heavily on tourists who are drawn not only by its 150 galleries many of which specialize in Indian and Spanish artists and regional art, and by its yearly markets and traditions like the annual Fiesta, but also by the special environment created by its architecture. The artists who founded Santa Fe's original art colony were drawn to the region by its pre-American cultures and were instrumental in efforts to preserve and revive the fine arts, crafts, customs, and architecture of those cultures. The artists* colony had perhaps its most widely felt impact in the field of architecture. Although the movement to preserve and recreate the city's historic adobe architecture was already under way when the colony began to come together on the Camino del Monte Sol, the artists joined it with vigor, leading efforts to preserve historic architecture and building their own Pueblo Revival adobe houses. The district also contains some of the first houses designed by John Gaw Meem, the premier professional architect of the Revival styles. It has remained a residential neighborhood, unlike Canyon Road, a street north of the boundary of this district and included in the Santa Fe Historic District, where artists lived which has become predominantly commercial. The artists' homes on the Camino del Monte Sol and adjoining streets are a unique grouping of Pueblo Revival and, to a much lesser extent, Territorial Revival dwellings, built by the group who played a significant role in the conversion of Santa Fe into a city which is dominated by historic styles. \"Artists who were leaders of the art colony and prime contributors to the architectural and cultural character\" of the district include: Alice Corbin Henderson (1881-1949) and William Penhallow Henderson (1877-1943), of 555 Camino del Monte Sol and 557 Camino del Monte Sol; Frank Applegate, of 830 El Caminito, 831 El Caminito, and 408 Camino del Monte Sol;"
