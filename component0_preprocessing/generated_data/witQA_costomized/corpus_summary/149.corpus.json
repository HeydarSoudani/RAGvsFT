Built by Prussian King Frederick the Great as his summer palace, it is often counted among the German rivals of Versailles. While Sanssouci is in the more intimate Rococo style and is far smaller than its French Baroque counterpart, it, too, is notable for the numerous temples and follies in the surrounding park. The palace was designed and built by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff between 1745 and 1747 to meet Frederick's need for a private residence where he could escape the pomp and ceremony of the royal court. The palace's name is a French phrase (sans souci) meaning \"without worries\" or \"carefree\", emphasising that the palace was meant as a place of relaxation rather than a seat of power.\nSanssouci is little more than a large, single-storey villa\u2014more like the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly than Versailles. Containing just ten principal rooms, it was built on the brow of a terraced hill at the centre of the park. The influence of King Frederick's personal taste in the design and decoration of the palace was so great that its style is characterised as \"Frederician Rococo\", and his feelings for the palace were so strong that he conceived it as \"a place that would die with him\". Because of a disagreement about the site of the palace in the park, Knobelsdorff was fired in 1746. Jan Bouman, a Dutch architect, finished the project.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the palace became a residence of Frederick William IV. He employed the architect Ludwig Persius to restore and enlarge the palace, while Ferdinand von Arnim was charged with improving the grounds and thus the view from the palace. The town of Potsdam, with its palaces, was a favourite place of residence for the German imperial family until the fall of the Hohenzollern dynasty in 1918.\nAfter World War II, the palace became a tourist attraction in East Germany. Following German reunification in 1990, Frederick's body was returned to the palace and buried in a new tomb overlooking the gardens he had created. Sanssouci and its extensive gardens became a World Heritage Site in 1990 under the protection of UNESCO; in 1995, the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg was established to care for Sanssouci and the other former imperial palaces in and around Berlin. These palaces are now visited by more than two million people each year from all over the world."

Its first church building burned in 1866. That same year E. Townsend Mix of Milwaukee began designing the replacement, which remains the current church building. Lucas Bradley built it. Its style is Gothic Revival, with walls of cream brick, buttresses, a rose window above the main entrance, lancet windows, and a 150-foot corner tower turned 45 degrees from the rest of the building. The steeple is octagonal, with four clocks from the Seth Thomas Co.

It was originally built in 1849 as an early fire station \u2014 Engine House No. 3. In 1899 it was donated to the church and converted to a chapel. In 1930 it was restyled Gothic Revival to complement the church.In 1898 the parish built a guildhall west of the firehouse.

In it, Pipes designed not only the building but also the landscape, furnishings, and interior finishes, representing the culmination of his work as a pivotal figure in the Arts and Crafts movement in Oregon, while also giving a nod to the Northwest Regional style. Built in 1954 on a lot fronting Oswego Lake, it is distinguished by clean, flowing lines, attention to its setting, a rubblestone wall buffering it from the nearby street, one of Pipes' signature bay windows, a central courtyard, and other features.The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. By 2018, most of the house's significant features were either significantly deteriorated or gone altogether, including the complete loss of Pipes' custom furniture and built-ins. This loss of integrity prompted the owner to petition for it to be removed from the National Register."

The temple interiors did not serve as meeting places, since the sacrifices and rituals dedicated to the respective ouranic (a god or goddess that does not reside on the Earth) deity took place outside them, within the wider precinct of the sanctuary, which might be large. Temples were frequently used to store votive offerings. They are the most important and most widespread surviving building type in Greek architecture. In the Hellenistic kingdoms of Southwest Asia and of North Africa, buildings erected to fulfill the functions of a temple often continued to follow the local traditions. Even where a Greek influence is visible, such structures are not normally considered as Greek temples. This applies, for example, to the Graeco-Parthian and Bactrian temples, or to the Ptolemaic examples, which follow Egyptian tradition. Most Greek temples were oriented astronomically.\nBetween the 9th century BCE and the 6th century BCE, the ancient Greek temples developed from the small mud brick structures into double-porched monumental \"peripteral\" buildings with colonnade on all sides, often reaching more than 20 metres in height (not including the roof). Stylistically, they were governed by the regionally specific architectural orders. Whereas the distinction was originally between the Doric and Ionic orders, a third alternative arose in late 3rd century BCE with the Corinthian order. A multitude of different ground plans were developed, each of which could be combined with the superstructure in the different orders. Temples would be destroyed due to warfare in the Greek World or from lack of repairs. Some of these temples such as the temple of Poseidon Soter (The Savior) would be rebuilt outside of Athens after the defeat of the Persian Empire in 449 BCE. From the 3rd century BCE onward, the construction of large temples became less common; after a short 2nd century BCE flourish, it ceased nearly entirely in the 1st century BCE. Thereafter, only smaller structures were started, while older temples continued to be renovated or brought to completion if in an unfinished state.\nGreek temples were designed and constructed according to set proportions, mostly determined by the lower diameter of the columns or by the dimensions of the foundation levels. The nearly mathematical strictness of the basic designs thus reached was lightened by optical refinements. In spite of the still widespread idealised image, Greek temples were painted, so that bright reds and blues contrasted with the white of the building stones or of stucco. The more elaborate temples were equipped with very rich figural decoration in the form of reliefs and sculptures on the pediment. The construction of temples was usually organised and financed by cities or by the administrations of sanctuaries. Private individuals, especially Hellenistic rulers, could also sponsor such buildings. In the late Hellenistic period, their decreasing financial wealth, along with the progressive incorporation of the Greek world within the Roman state, whose officials and rulers took over as sponsors, led to the end of Greek temple construction. New temples now belonged to the tradition of the Roman temple, which, in spite of the very strong Greek influence on it, aimed for different goals and followed different aesthetic principles (for a comparison, see the other article).\nThe main temple building sat within a larger precinct or temenos, usually surrounded by a peribolos fence or wall; the whole is usually called a \"sanctuary\". The Acropolis of Athens is the most famous example, though this was apparently walled as a citadel before a temple was ever built there. This might include many subsidiary buildings, sacred groves or springs, animals dedicated to the deity, and sometimes people who had taken sanctuary from the law, which some temples offered, for example to runaway slaves."

The construction of the palace that was initially designed by French architect \u00c9tienne Bouchard in the Louis XIII style was soon suspended after the death of Prince Semyon Mikhailovich Vorontsov.\nIn 1889 the unfinished palace was bought by the Imperial Domains Agency for Alexander III of Russia.  The new owner commissioned his favorite architect Maximilian Messmacher to modernize the villa's design. Although Massandra was listed among imperial residences, no royals ever stayed there overnight (rather preferring the neighboring Livadia Palace).\nAfter the October Revolution and before World War II, the residence was used as a government sanatorium \"Proletarian Health\" for people ill with tuberculosis.

It is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, said to be the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period. It is considered to be a complete example of a typical English country house; the claim has even been made that Belton's principal fa\u00e7ade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to stately homes.\nFor about three centuries until 1984, Belton House was the seat of the Brownlow family, which had first acquired land in the area in the late 16th century. Their heirs, the Cust family, were created Baron Brownlow in 1776. Despite his great wealth Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet, chose to build a comparatively modest house rather than one of the grand Baroque palaces being built by others at the time. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. Nevertheless, the new house was fitted with the latest innovations, such as sash windows for the principal rooms, and followed the latest thinking on house-planning, in seeking to separate those parts of the building that were for the use of the family from the areas where servants carried out their domestic duties. Successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the fabric and design of the house changed little.\nIn August 1914, Belton House and its park were used as the assembly point for the newly-formed 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment in World War I, and in October 1915 it was used as the home depot and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps. During World War II, RAF Belton Park was established in the grounds of the house, as were two RAF Regiment squadrons, by November 1944 1,850 personnel were based at Belton.\nThe Custs, like many previously wealthy English families, were faced with mounting financial problems. The seventh Baron opened the estate to the public. An adventure playground was built in the nearby woods to attract families to the house as a tourist attraction. However, the financial difficulties were too great and in 1984 they donated the house, with most of its contents, to the National Trust. The trust introduced new features and attractions to fund repairs and conservation. Further revenue is raised from the use of the property as a filming location, and from licensing the Marble Hall for civil weddings. It was visited by 340,290 people during 2021."

The city depends heavily on tourists who are drawn not only by its 150 galleries many of which specialize in Indian and Spanish artists and regional art, and by its yearly markets and traditions like the annual Fiesta, but also by the special environment created by its architecture. The artists who founded Santa Fe's original art colony were drawn to the region by its pre-American cultures and were instrumental in efforts to preserve and revive the fine arts, crafts, customs, and architecture of those cultures. The artists* colony had perhaps its most widely felt impact in the field of architecture. Although the movement to preserve and recreate the city's historic adobe architecture was already under way when the colony began to come together on the Camino del Monte Sol, the artists joined it with vigor, leading efforts to preserve historic architecture and building their own Pueblo Revival adobe houses. The district also contains some of the first houses designed by John Gaw Meem, the premier professional architect of the Revival styles. It has remained a residential neighborhood, unlike Canyon Road, a street north of the boundary of this district and included in the Santa Fe Historic District, where artists lived which has become predominantly commercial. The artists' homes on the Camino del Monte Sol and adjoining streets are a unique grouping of Pueblo Revival and, to a much lesser extent, Territorial Revival dwellings, built by the group who played a significant role in the conversion of Santa Fe into a city which is dominated by historic styles.\nThe district includes:\n\nAcequia Madre House, 614 Acequia Madre, associated with artists Eva Scott F\u00e9nyes (1849\u20131930) and her granddaughter Leonora Frances Curtin Paloheimo (1903\u20131999).  The house contained hundreds of works by them and by many other artists, including invited self-portraits.  It also included traditional arts and crafts from New Mexico associated with the Spanish Colonial Arts Society (founded in 1925) and the Native Market on West Palace Avenue in Santa Fe (founded in 1934), and also works collected in their international travels which were partly used to inspire local arts and crafts.  The house, since 2013, has also been home of the Women's International Study Center.Other artists \"who were leaders of the art colony and prime contributors to the architectural and cultural character\" of the district include:\n\nAlice Corbin Henderson (1881-1949) and William Penhallow Henderson (1877-1943), of 555 Camino del Monte Sol and 557 Camino del Monte Sol;\nFrank Applegate, of 830 El Caminito, 831 El Caminito, and 408 Camino del Monte Sol;\nFremont Ellis, 586 Camino del Monte Sol, one of Los Cinco Pintores;\nWalter Mruk, of 542 Camino del Monte Sol, one of Los Cinco Pintores;\nJoseph Bakos (1891-1977), of 576 Camino del Monte Sol, one of Los Cinco Pintores;\nWillard Nash (1898-1943), of 566 Camino del Monte Sol, one of Los Cinco Pintores;\nWill Shuster of 580 Camino del Monte Sol, one of Los Cinco Pintores;\nAndrew Dasburg (1887\u20131979), of 520 Camino del Monte Sol and 524 Camino del Monte Sol;\nDatus Myers and Alice Clark Myers, of 503 Camino del Monte Sol;\nMary Hunter Austin (1868-1934), of 439 Camino del Monte Sol;\nAlfred Morang (1901-1958), of 1 Placita Rafaela;\nLynn Riggs (1899-1954), of 770 Acequia Madre Road;\nPhilip Stevenson (d.1965), of 408 Delgado Street;  Stevenson bought the home in 1930 and lived there until about 1939.  He was a novelist and screenwriter sympathetic to Communism, who, along with his wife Janet Stevenson, was blacklisted.  The home was in a Garcia family from 1848 to 1920.  The eastern half of the property was owned and remodeled by John Gaw Meem in 1954, for Marian Gebhardt.  Gebhardt \"made it her home and established the well-known Children's Patio Day School in an L-shaped addition created along the Acequia Madre and Delgado Street by connecting an adobe outbuilding to the house. The pegs where the children hung their coats are still to be seen.\" and\nElizabeth DeHuff (1886\u20131983), of 828 Camino del Poniente."

It was declared the seat of the Bishop of Acireale in 1870.\n \nThe present cathedral building, which is located in the Piazza Duomo, was constructed as a simple parish church between 1597 and 1618 that was greatly enlarged a few years later when it received the relics of Saint Venera, one of the two patron saints of the city,. The structure survived the earthquake of 1693, and the present cathedral is a 17th-century building with significant additions from each succeeding century.\nOf particular note are the Baroque portal representing the Annunciation by Placido Blandamonte of Messina, dating from 1668, combined with a Neo-Gothic west front by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, completed after his death in 1891 to his plans, of c.1900. The two campaniles, in Mannerist style with octagonal bases, although identical in appearance, are centuries apart in construction: the one to the south is from 1655, as is the cupola, while the one to the north, as well as the rose window, are from 1890. The interior is 17th century Baroque.

It was built between 1939 and 1943 in honor of Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the United States Declaration of Independence, a central intellectual force behind the American Revolution, founder of the Democratic-Republican Party, and the nation's third president. \nThe memorial features multiple quotes from Jefferson intended to capture his ideology and philosophy, known as Jeffersonian democracy, which was staunchly supportive of American republicanism, individual rights, religious freedom, states' rights, virtue and prioritized and valued what he saw as the undervalued independent yeoman. Jefferson was simultaneously deeply skeptical of cities and financiers and hostile to aristocracy, elitism, and corruption. He is widely considered among the most influential political minds of his age and one of the most consequential intellectual forces behind the American Revolution.  \nThe Jefferson Memorial is built in neoclassical style and is situated in West Potomac Park on the shore of the Potomac River. It was designed by John Russell Pope, a New York City architect, and built by Philadelphia contractor John McShain. Construction on it began in 1939 and was completed in 1943, though the bronze statue of Jefferson was not completed and added until four years after its dedication and opening, in 1947. Pope made references to the Roman Pantheon, whose designer was Apollodorus of Damascus, and to Jefferson's own design for the rotunda at the University of Virginia as inspirations for the memorial's aesthetics. \nThe Jefferson Memorial and the White House form anchor points to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The Washington Monument, initially intended to be built at the intersection of the White House and the Jefferson Memorial's site, was ultimately built farther east because the ground at that location was deemed too soft and swampy.The Jefferson Memorial is a designated national memorial and is managed by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior's National Mall and Memorial Parks division. In 1966, the Jefferson Memorial was named to the National Register of Historic Places. In 2007, it ranked fourth on the \"list of America's favorite architecture\", published by the American Institute of Architects."

It is located on Minnesota State Highway 1 about one mile east of Isabella.  The complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its association with New Deal federal relief construction.Of the 21 buildings, 11 are listed as contributing properties to the district.  These were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s and were built of horizontally-laid wood logs, mostly aspen and pine.  These buildings consist of dwellings, an office building, storage facilities, and warehouses.  Some other buildings on the site were constructed after the CCC built the original complex, and are not considered contributing properties.The ranger station is nationally significant for its use as an administration center that supported multiple federal land management functions within the Isabella Ranger District of the Superior National Forest.  The rustic architecture is also significant because it was common to the design of land management administrative buildings within this time period.  The historic context of the Superior National Forest began with a recommendation by General C.C. Andrews that all of the public land within Cook County, Minnesota and Lake County, Minnesota, totaling around 500,000 acres (200,000 ha), should be preserved as a forest reserve.  On February 13, 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt established the Superior National Forest with an area of 1,018,638 acres (412,228 ha).  Additional proclamations raised the size of the forest to 2,173,210 acres (879,470 ha).  During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps was formed to provide relief for unemployment, and also to stimulate local economies through federally funded, grassroots development projects.  The Isabella guard station served as a facility for crews that were working in an often roadless area within the Superior National Forest.  While crews and their assignments changed frequently, CCC Company 701, based in Ely, Minnesota, and Company 3703, based in Baptism River, Minnesota were confirmed to be involved in the construction of this station.Other surviving guard stations include the East Bearskin Lake Guard Station, near Gunflint; Crooked Lake Guard Station, near LaCroix; Halfway/North Central Experiment Station; Kekekabic Lake Guard Station; Lac LaCroix Guard Station; Sawbill Lake Guard Station; South Kawishiwi River Pavilion; and Tofte Ranger Station.\n\n\n== References =="

The ground in the area of the glassworks (of which no structures survive) is littered with melted glass fragments and burnt brick fragments.The Coventry Glassworks was established in 1813, in part to meet demand for glass objects that had previously been fulfilled by English companies, a source cut off by the War of 1812.  The glassworks founders included experienced glassblowers and local businessmen, who combined their capital and expertise.  The company produced small bottles, inkstands, and flasks, and is credited with creating the first \"portrait flask\", bearing a depiction of the Marquis de Lafayette in commemoration of his 1825 visit to the United States.  The company had a rotating cast of partners and glassblowers, and remained in operation until about 1845, when its proprietors at that time moved the business to Willington.

The town hall was built between 1749 and 1754 to a design by John Wood the Elder replacing an earlier town hall nearby. An extension to the north designed by James Wyatt was added in 1785. Following a fire in 1795 the hall was largely rebuilt and a dome designed by Wyatt was built. Minor alterations have subsequently been made. The streets surrounding its site have altered since its initiation, notably when viewed from Castle Street, the south-side, it appears as off-centre. This is because Water Street which ran to the junction with Dale Street, the west-east axis, was continuous and built up across the junction so that the town hall was not visible originally from that aspect. The structures were removed 150 years after this to expose the building from this position.\nThe ground floor contains the city's Council Chamber and a Hall of Remembrance for the Liverpool servicemen killed in the First World War. The upper floor consists of a suite of lavishly decorated rooms which are used for a variety of events and functions.

More precisely, it is an early-Gothic building with Romanesque elements that dates back to the beginning of the 13th century (mentioned in 1208), partly reconstructed after World War II. It was the centre for the Cistercians of Trzebnica, which is why it was called the House of the Ladies of Trzebnica. Nearby, along the Kotlarska Street, were the Nowe Jatki, a medieval shopping center belonging to the monastery.\nThe building was erected on a trapezoidal plan made of brick laid in a Wendish thread (two-wheeled, also called Slavonic). The Romanesque elements of this building, including the arches in the central part, are mixed with Gothic details of the windows and the arches of the vaults. On each of the two floors of the building there were originally three rooms. The building was repeatedly rebuilt, and remained the property of the monastery until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1810.During WWII the site around Bishop Nankier's Square was damaged. During the renovation in 1959, historic fragments of the oldest architectural foundation of the building located under the street level were discovered. From 1966 to 1969, the site was partially reconstructed according to the project of Henryk Dziurla. Over eight centuries, the level of neighbouring streets has risen to the height of the upper storey of the building, which is why the entrance today is subterranean. In the southern part of the lower storey there are fragments of the old barrel vaults, and on the upper floor, cross vaults.\n\nDuring the reconstruction the ceiling was partially removed, joining the upper and lower storeys, and the whole building was covered with a contemporary reinforced concrete roof. The above-ground part was glazed from the outside. The place was then adapted for the needs of the art gallery under the patronage of the Center for Cultural Arts in Wroc\u0142aw (OKiS). Later, the gallery was transformed into Foto-Medium-Art Gallery, and become one of the most important Neo-avantgarde centres in Poland. Then it changed its name to the Lower Silesia Centre of Photography, \"Romanesque House\". From January 2017 it is called the Foto-Gen Gallery. In April 2017, a bronze plaque commemorating the Cistercian foundation \"House of the Ladies of Trzebnica\" was placed in the facade of the building and the name Dom Panien Trzebnickich (House of the Ladies of Trzebnica) came back into official use .Foto-Gen Gallery specializes in showing photography and new media. There are regular exhibitions for home and international artists, presentations as well as lectures organized there. Media reportages from these events can be seen on Centre for Cultural Arts in Wroc\u0142aw (OKiS) video channel, local and nationwide media."

For a time, its second floor housed the offices and printing plant of the Hampshire Review newspaper, and by 1947 its ground floor housed office and mercantile space, and the second floor was divided into apartments.\nIn 1964 the Wirgman Building sustained damage in a fire; it was demolished the following year to make way for the new Bank of Romney headquarters building, which opened in 1966. Prior to its demolition, in 1937, the Wirgman Building was photographed and documented by the National Park Service's Historic American Buildings Survey."

He had a relationship of mutual respect with the Dakota Indians with whom he traded, even to the degree of sheltering friendly Indians during the Dakota War of 1862.  In 1853, he built a large frame house.  His house reflected his prosperity, with nine bedrooms, a music room, a parlor, a sitting room, an office, a kitchen, a summer kitchen, and a sewing room.  Part of his wealth came from \"traders' claims\" stemming from the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, but he was also the proprietor of a sawmill and a flour mill.  In turn, he was generous to the community, donating $3,000 to Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple for the church and for Shattuck School.  He also donated land for the Seabury Divinity School.

The district encompasses 158 contributing buildings in the town of Accomac, mainly grouped into two periods of construction. From its founding in 1786 through the second quarter of the nineteenth century, several residential, commercial, governmental, and religious structures were built in the core of Accomac, representing both high-style and vernacular examples of late Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles. Notable structures surviving from this period include the rectory of St. George's Episcopal Parish (1798, 1811); the Seymour House (1791-1815); Roseland (1750-1850); Seven Gables (1786-1905); Rural Hill (1816, 1835), and the Francis Makemie Presbyterian Church (1840). The second period of construction reflected in the town dates to the last quarter of the nineteenth century, when the arrival of the New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk Railroad spawned renewed growth and economic prosperity in Accomack County following the Civil War. These buildings also display both high-style and vernacular expressions of Victorian Era styles, including Second Empire, Italianate, Gothic Revival, and Romanesque. Notable structures from this time period include Bayly Memorial Hall (a former Baptist Church built in 1870 and later moved), the County Clerk's Office (1887), the Accomack County Courthouse (1899), and houses found in the Lilliston Avenue extension of the town built in the 1880s-1890s. There are also contributing structures dating from the first quarter of the twentieth century, including the Drummondtown Baptist Church (1914), Drummondtown United Methodist Church (1920), and the former hotel at the town square (1925).There are three structures within the Accomac Historic District which are listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places.

As Fairbanks grew exponentially with the military buildup associated with World War II and the Cold War, the building was enlarged in 1939 and again in 1948.\nIt was the city's only school from its opening in 1934 until the opening of Denali Elementary School in 1951.  It became a junior/senior high school for several years until Lathrop High School began operation.  The school then became Main Junior High School until it was replaced by Ryan Junior High School and Tanana Junior High School during the early 1970s.Following the disestablishment of Main Junior High, instruction in the building was mostly limited to alternative education programs.  The building's primary purpose at that point was to house the administrative offices of the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District, a role it filled from 1976 until 1993.  Most of those offices moved to the school district's current Fifth Avenue headquarters in the mid 1980s, and the building sat largely vacant for many years, eventually being completely abandoned.\nThe building has housed city offices since 1994, which moved from the longtime Fairbanks City Hall three blocks to the north.  In addition to city offices, the former school gymnasium is home to the Fairbanks Boys & Girls Club.  Previous non-governmental tenants of the building under city ownership have included the Fairbanks Boxing Club and the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 as Main School."

The cathedral has been on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list since 1985, together with the nearby St. Michael's Church because of its unique art and outstanding Romanesque architecture.The cathedral church was built between 1010 and 1020 in the Romanesque style. It follows a symmetrical plan with two apses, that is characteristic of Ottonian Romanesque architecture in Old Saxony. The cathedral's treasures include world-famous artworks, bronze works from the time of Bishop Bernward, Bernward Doors and Bernward Column, as well as two of the four notable Romanesque wheel chandeliers: the Hezilo chandelier and the Azelin chandelier.\nAfter renovations and extensions in the 11th, 12th and 14th centuries, the cathedral was completely destroyed during an air raid on 22 March 1945 and rebuilt from 1950 to 1960.  A thorough renovation of the cathedral began in 2010, including technical and conservation measures.  Some of the cathedral's treasures have been shown further afield, including at an exhibition at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The cathedral was reopened on 15 August 2014."

In 1903 they acquired the former First Baptist Church building for their use. They cooperated with the local Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) for recreational and camping activities. The YMCA built a new larger facility in 1921 and the YWCA considered buying their old building, but they decided to build their own building instead.\nThe YWCA hired the Minneapolis architectural firm of Croft & Boerner to design the Renaissance Revival building. It was completed in 1925 by contractor C.W. Ennis. The three-story brick structure features round arch openings on the first floor and windows that diminish in size on the upper floors.  The interior features terrazzo floors and oak woodwork that exhibits an American Craftsman influence. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="

The former school building is the only structure left from the defunct town of Maysville, the first town established in Franklin County.  It was platted in 1865, and it was located on the stage line between Ackley and Hampton.  Many merchants and professional moved into the community.  This two-story, vernacular stone structure was built for $5,000 in 1867 by James Carn as a combination schoolhouse and meeting hall.  The citizens of Maysville hoped that their community would be chosen as the county seat, but in 1872 the railroad went north to Hampton.  In the 1880s the businessmen and professionals moved out, and the post office closed in 1890.  By the turn of the 20th-century Maysville had become a ghost town.  The school remained in operation until 1957, but the second floor hall continued to be used by various community organizations and the Methodist Church.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.\n\n\n== References =="

It is a substantial house whose architecture includes Late Victorian and Classical Revival elements.  It is significant as a well-preserved artifact from the boom period in Lehi's development.The house was built by/for Christian Knudsen, a successful stockman who was prominent in his industry and also known in the town for his philanthropy and for his service in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  While Knudsen and others made money from cattle, other wealth in Lehi derived from the Utah Sugar Company Factory based there; both industries benefited from the railroad which had first connected Lehi in 1872\u2014the same year that Christian Knudsen, 15 years old, arrived with his family from Norway.  The wealth and connection to the rest of the nation brought awareness of architectural styles, and many elaborate homes were built.Knudsen married Sarah L. Otteson, of Spanish Fork in 1879 and they had 10 children.  His Mormon church service included doing a mission that took him to Norway in 1896, and serving as head teacher in the Sunday school.  According to the National Register nomination, the house was intended to stand until the Millennium.  The Knudsens donated significantly to help build the Stake houses (Mormon administration offices) in Alpine, Lehi, and Provo.The house is also of interest for serving, under the Knudsens, as a \"halfway house for Scandinavian travelers on their way to and from Salt Lake City.\"Much later, during World War II, the house served as a relocation center for four \"Japanese\" families.  (Note that the Topaz War Relocation Center, one of 10 Japanese-American internment camps was located in rural area only about 110 miles away.)  It was renovated into three apartments to help address Lehi's wartime housing shortage.  Lehi was the location near to Camp Williams, the Geneva Steel Plant, and industry in the Salt Lake Valley.The building was converted back to a single family house in 1964 and a restoration of the house began in 1985.The restored home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\n\n\n== References =="

In the ancient Egyptian language, the city was called Abedju (\ua723b\u1e0fw or AbDw)(Arabic Abdu \u0639\u0628\u062f-\u0648).\nThe English name Abydos comes from the Greek \u1f0c\u03b2\u03c5\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, a name borrowed by Greek geographers from the unrelated city of Abydos on the Hellespont. Abydos name in hieroglyphs \nConsidered one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt, the sacred city of Abydos was the site of many ancient temples, including Umm el-Qa'ab, a royal necropolis where early pharaohs were entombed. These tombs began to be seen as extremely significant burials and in later times it became desirable to be buried in the area, leading to the growth of the town's importance as a cult site.\nToday, Abydos is notable for the memorial temple of Seti I, which contains an inscription from the Nineteenth Dynasty known to the modern world as the Abydos King List. This is a chronological list showing cartouches of most dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from Menes until Seti I's father, Ramesses I. It is also notable for the Abydos graffiti, ancient Phoenician and Aramaic graffiti found on the walls of the Temple of Seti I.\nThe Great Temple and most of the ancient town are buried under the modern buildings to the north of the Seti temple. Many of the original structures and the artifacts within them are considered irretrievable and lost; many may have been destroyed by the new construction."

At 1,046 ft (319 m), it is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework, and it was the world's tallest building for 11 months after its completion in 1930. As of 2019, the Chrysler is the 12th-tallest building in the city, tied with The New York Times Building.Originally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the building was commisioned by Walter Chrysler, the head of the Chrysler Corporation. The construction of the Chrysler Building, an early skyscraper, was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The Chrysler Building was designed and funded by Walter Chrysler personally as a real estate investment for his children, but it was not intended as the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters. An annex was completed in 1952, and the building was sold by the Chrysler family the next year, with numerous subsequent owners.\nWhen the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, some calling it inane and unoriginal, others hailing it as modernist and iconic. Reviewers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries regarded the building as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style. In 2007, it was ranked ninth on the American Institute of Architects' list of America's Favorite Architecture. The facade and interior became New York City designated landmarks in 1978, and the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1976."

These added Gothic features such as towers and battlements outside and elaborate decoration inside to create \"gloomth\" to suit Walpole's collection of antiquarian objects, contrasting with the more cheerful or \"riant\" garden. The interior included a Robert Adam fireplace; parts of the exterior were designed by James Essex. The garden contained a large seat shaped like a Rococo sea shell, which was recreated during the 2012 restoration of the garden, one of the many examples of historic garden conservation in the UK."
