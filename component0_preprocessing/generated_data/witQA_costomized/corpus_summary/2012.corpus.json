It is a relatively modern dish, dating to sometime after the introduction of the tomato to Iran at the end of the nineteenth century in the Qajar era. Its primary ingredients are cucumber, tomato, onion, olive oil, herbal spices and verjuice, although lime juice is sometimes used in its preparation. In Iran, it is eaten in the summer as a side dish on its own, and year-round as a side dish alongside meat-based foods such as kebab and as a side dish before and after meals. Shirazi salad is sometimes served as an accompaniment to rice such as loobia polo, an Iranian rice dish made with green beans and tomatoes. Cookbook author Jila Dana-Haeri describes it as a refreshing dish during the summer.Shirazi salad has been described as being akin to a national salad in Iran, and it is a common meal accompaniment. It may also be used in a manner similar to that of a condiment, to reduce the spiciness of stews. It typically has a crisp and moist texture, and is somewhat similar to pico de gallo and mediterranean salad."

It is made from unleavened or leavened dough and usually filled with ground meat and chopped onion. Originally, finely chopped pre-cooked meat was used as a filling, but later raw ground meat became more common. Alternatively, peremech can be filled with potato or quark.Peremech is usually shaped into a flattened sphere with a circular \"window\" in the middle. In contrast to doughnuts, the hole does not go all the way through, but is only made at the top, such that the filling is visible in the middle. The shape is thus somewhat similar to Russian vatrushka. However, dough neatly kneaded around the hole gives the classical peremech its distinctive shape.Peremech is traditionally served with broth, qatiq (yogurt) or ayran.Nowadays, the meat-filled version is popular throughout Russia and other post-Soviet countries where it is usually referred to as belyash (Russian: \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0448, pl. \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0448\u0438, belyashi). This word appeared in Russian in the second half of the 20th century and possibly derives from another Tatar word, b\u0259le\u015f, which denotes a baked full-size pie with meat and potato filling. Modern variants of belyashi can also be made without a hole in the top. Along with pirozhki and chiburekki, belyashi are a common street food in the region.\nIn Finland, the pastry is known as p\u00e4r\u00e4m\u00e4tsi and first appeared in the 1960s in Tampere."

It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in prehistoric societies.The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In the United Kingdom, pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a cr\u00eape. In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) creating a thick fluffy pancake. A cr\u00eape is a thin pancake of Breton origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is palatschinke, a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many other fillings\u2014sweet or savoury\u2014can also be used.\nCommercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries. Like waffles, commercially prepared frozen pancakes are available from companies like Eggo. When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk, the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake, which is common in Scotland, Ireland and the US. Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter, making for a type of buckwheat pancake, a category that includes blini, kaletez, ploye, and memil-buchimgae. When potato is used as a major portion of the batter, the result is a potato pancake.  \nPancakes may be served at any time of the day or year with a variety of toppings or fillings, but they have developed associations with particular times and toppings in different regions. In North America, they are typically considered a breakfast food and serve a similar function to waffles.  In Britain and the Commonwealth, they are associated with Shrove Tuesday, commonly known as \"Pancake Day\", when, historically, perishable ingredients had to be used up before the fasting period of Lent."

Its flavour is rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike an ordinary duck or goose liver.

French law states, \"Foie gras belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France.\"The technique of gavage dates as far back as 2500 BC, when the ancient Egyptians began keeping birds for food and deliberately fattened the birds through force-feeding. Today, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though there are producers and markets worldwide, particularly in other European nations, the United States, and China.Gavage-based foie gras production is controversial, due mainly to animal welfare concerns about force-feeding, intensive housing and husbandry, and enlarging the liver to 10 times its usual volume. A number of countries and jurisdictions have laws against force-feeding and the production, import, or sale of foie gras."

During this time, Charles Masson Sr., co-founder of New York City's famed restaurant La Grenouille had worked under Henri Soul\u00e9 in Le Pavillon. When World War II began, Soul\u00e9 and the Pavillon chef Pierre Franey stayed in the United States as war refugees.\nThe restaurant formally opened on October 15, 1941, at 5 East 55th Street on Fifth Avenue, across the street from the St. Regis New York. In 1957, Le Pavillon moved to the Ritz Tower on Park Avenue and 57th Street. Soul\u00e9 died in 1966, and Le Pavillon closed in 1971.In his autobiography, Jacques P\u00e9pin describes how he was first employed at Le Pavilion after emigrating to the US in 1959. He found that Franey and the rest of the staff were underpaid and treated poorly by Soul\u00e9, who insisted that he was barely making ends meet, even though he would offer complimentary meals and wine to a large number of celebrity guests. When P\u00e9pin and others organized a protest, he found himself physically threatened by organized-crime goons. However, there was soon an exodus of the staff (Franey and P\u00e9pin moved to Howard Johnson's) and the restaurant never recovered. Soul\u00e9's other faux pas was allowing paparazzi to disturb the Kennedy family (who were regular customers) and their staffers during John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign: when the Kennedy team, which was dining at the restaurant, asked the paparazzi to leave, Soul\u00e9 insisted that only he had the right, as owner, to determine who entered and left the restaurant, and stated that, even before the election, \"the Kennedys already think they are running the country.\" (P\u00e9pin was offered the job of White House chef after the election, but declined.)\nDaniel Boulud opened a restaurant with the same name in 2021, in homage to Soul\u00e9's restaurant."

When it was open, it was the oldest French restaurant in Chicago, and was only exceeded in prestige by Le Francais (which is also closed).Bill Contos died in April 1993 and though the restaurant was struggling, his wife, Regina kept it open for a few more years, long enough to see its 50th anniversary.\nPaul Contos opened Chez Paul at Delaware Avenue off Michigan Avenue, but moved it into the Robert Hall McCormick II mansion in 1964 at 660 North Rush Street, after refurbishing the building.  The steps and pillars are marble, as is the mantel in the Louis Room, which was presented to McCormick when he was Ambassador to Italy by Victor Emannuel III, King of Italy.\nA replica of the restaurant's interior was used for a scene in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. Bill Contos said of the replica, \"It was either that or ship the McCormick mansion to the West Coast, and this just seemed easier.\" A similar set was used in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\nChez Paul closed in 1995, and the building is currently used for office space."

Established by Clifton and Alma Washington at 35 N. Kentucky Avenue, Atlantic City, in 1937, the original 20-seat location attained celebrity status for hosting the performers and patrons of the nightclubs in the Kentucky Avenue black entertainment district. The restaurant was known for its sausage sandwiches and soul food, and also served breakfast to customers leaving the 6 a.m. show at Club Harlem.\nIn the 1950s Clifton Washington moved the restaurant a few blocks away to 1702 Arctic Avenue, where it was renamed Wash & Sons' Seafood Restaurant and specialized in seafood, barbecued ribs, and fried chicken. This larger venue, seating over 100, continued to attract both black and white nightclub guests and was also popular with black hotel employees leaving their shifts. Washington's children and grandchildren all worked in the restaurant from a young age, and those who married into the family were also put to work.\nWith the commercial downturn in Atlantic City in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wash's relocated to 128 N. New Road in Pleasantville in 1974. Renamed Wash's Inn and Wash's Catering, the business now focused on catering on-site events and also operated a small dining room, take-out deli, and bar. With the 1994 addition of a large catering hall, the facility hosted hundreds of private parties and community events. The family put the business up for sale in 2010 and closed it in 2012."

Alefantis became the sole owner of Comet Ping Pong in 2009 after Greenwood, a chef at both restaurants, left her position as co-owner and executive chef of Comet.\nThe restaurant is the focus of the Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which has been discredited by a wide variety of organizations, including the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. One Pizzagate activist fired a gun in the restaurant in 2016, and another started a fire in it in 2019. In 2020, the restaurant temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

The word is originally a compound of the two Proven\u00e7al verbs bolhir ('to boil') and abaissar ('to reduce heat', i.e. 'simmer').\nBouillabaisse was originally a dish made by Marseille fishers, using the bony rockfish which they were unable to sell to restaurants or markets. There are at least three kinds of fish in a traditional bouillabaisse, typically red rascasse (Scorpaena scrofa); sea robin; and European conger. It can also include gilt-head bream, turbot, monkfish, mullet, or European hake.  It usually also includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins, mussels, velvet crabs, spider crab or octopus. More expensive versions may add langoustine (Dublin Bay prawn; Norway lobster), though this was not part of the traditional dish made by Marseille fishers.  Vegetables such as leeks, onions, tomatoes, celery, and potatoes are simmered together with the broth and served with the fish. The broth is traditionally served with a rouille, a mayonnaise made of olive oil, garlic, saffron, and cayenne pepper on grilled slices of bread.\nWhat makes a bouillabaisse different from other fish soups is the selection of Proven\u00e7al herbs and spices in the broth; the use of bony local Mediterranean fish; the way the fish are added one at a time, and brought to a boil; and the method of serving. In Marseille, the broth is served first in a soup plate with slices of bread and rouille, then the fish is served separately on a large platter  (see image at top);  or, more simply,  as Julia Child suggests, the fish and broth are brought to the table separately and served together in large soup plates."

Linguistic and genetic evidence suggests that the Romani originated in the Indian subcontinent, in particular the region of present-day Rajasthan. Their subsequent westward migration, possibly in waves, is now believed by historians to have occurred around 1000 CE. Their original name is from the Sanskrit word \u0921\u094b\u092e, doma and means a member of the Dom caste of travelling musicians and dancers. The Roma population moved west into the Persian Ghaznavid Empire and later into the Byzantine Empire. The Roma are thought to have arrived in Europe around the 13th to 14th century. Although they are widely dispersed, their most concentrated populations are located in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Spain, and Turkey.\nIn the English language, Romani people have long been known by the exonym Gypsies or Gipsies, which some Roma consider a racial slur. However, this is not always the case; for example, the term is actually preferred by most English and Welsh Romanies, and is used to refer to them in government documentation. The attendees of the first World Romani Congress in 1971 unanimously voted to reject the use of all exonyms for the Romani, including \"Gypsy\".Since the 19th century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. There are an estimated 1 million Roma in the United States and between 800,000 and 1 million in Brazil, most of whose ancestors emigrated in the 19th century from eastern Europe. Brazilian Romani are mostly descendant from German/Italian Sinti (in the South/Southeast regions), and Roma and Calon people. Brazil also includes a notable Romani community descended from Sinti and Roma deportees from the Portuguese Empire during the Portuguese Inquisition. In migrations since the late 19th century, Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and Canada. Though often confused with Irish Travellers and the Yenish people in western Europe, the Romani are culturally different.The Romani language is an Indo-Aryan language with strong Balkan and Greek influence. It is divided into several dialects, which together are estimated to have more than two million speakers. Because the language has traditionally been oral, many Romani are native speakers of the dominant language in their country of residence, or else of mixed languages combining the dominant language with a dialect of Romani in varieties sometimes called para-Romani."

The menu includes traditional, familiar dishes like prawn toast and sweet & sour pork but there are also many unfamiliar dishes like Nanyang chilli lobster and spring chicken & Sichuan spicy crumble, which is where the restaurant's \"true culinary personality can be found\", according to Yeoh's message at the start of the menu.

It is common to the cuisines of Central, Northern, Eastern and Southeastern Europe and much of Western Asia, Northern China, as well as parts of North Africa.\nMeat fillings are traditional in Europe, and include beef, lamb, or pork seasoned with garlic, onion, and spices. Grains such as rice and barley, mushrooms, and vegetables are often included as well. Fermented cabbage leaves are used for wrapping, particularly in southeastern Europe. In Asia, seafoods, tofu, and shiitake mushrooms or Vegeta may also be used. Chinese cabbage is often used as a wrapping.\nCabbage leaves are stuffed with the filling which are then baked, simmered, or steamed in a covered pot and generally eaten warm, often accompanied with a sauce. The sauce varies widely by cuisine. In Sweden and Finland, stuffed cabbage is served with lingonberry jam, which is both sweet and tart. In Central and Eastern Europe, tomato-based sauces and sour cream are typical. In Lebanon, the cabbage is stuffed with rice and minced meat and only rolled to the size of a cigar. It is usually served with a side dish of yogurt and a type of lemon and olive oil vinaigrette seasoned with garlic and dried mint.\nThe cabbage roll is a staple in the Romanian cuisine with variations of the recipe and sizing depending on the region, typically taking up to 6 hours to cook. Traditionally made with pork, beef, bacon, rice, spices and aromatics, broiled in a tomato sauce and served with polenta, sour cream and spicy pickled peppers.\nCooking textbook author Nancy Krcek stated that the origins are unclear and that it is possible multiple groups of people invented it at the same time. Another cooking book author Malgorzata Caprari stated it is believed that credit is owed to the poorer inhabitants of Central and Eastern European countries. Due to the widespread cultivation of cabbage in these regions, it is likely that the cultures who inhabited them were the original inventors of this dish.Cabbage rolls have found their way into popular culture, becoming one of the most recognizable dishes in Central and Eastern European cuisine. They often appear in literature and films as a symbol of homey comfort and tradition.\nA version called holishkes is traditionally eaten by Jews on Simchat Torah. Recipes vary depending on region; northern Poles prefer a savory sauce, while Galicia, Hungary and Ukraine favor sweet-and-sour, for example."

It was the fast food of the ch\u014dnin class in the Edo period.Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.\nSushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a dish that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat, without sushi rice."

Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food. In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. They are then cooked using a home oven.\nIn 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.

Curries may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are vegetarian. Dry curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume pur\u00e9e, saut\u00e9ed crushed onion, or tomato pur\u00e9e.\nCurry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices marketed in the West, was first exported to Britain in the 18th century when Indian merchants sold a concoction of spices, similar to garam masala, to the British East India Company returning to Britain."

Lamb, and, sometimes, horse meat was used to make a triangular pie. An opening on the top was used to add broth immediately before eating which made it a hot meal. This made cooking in the field fast and easy.\nFor most of the Soviet period, much of the Tatar cuisine including uchpuchmaks was removed from public catering due to regulations.
