        "title": "Alan Turing_Summary",
        "content": "Alan Mathison Turing  (; 23 June 1912\u00a0\u2013 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes\u2013no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment with DES, so-called chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for \"the appalling way he was treated\". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The \"Alan Turing law\" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. Turing has an extensive legacy with statues of him and many things named after him, including an annual award for computer science innovations. He appears on the current Bank of England \u00a350 note, which was released to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the audience, named him the greatest person of the 20th century."

        "content": "Adam Smith  (baptized  1723 \u2013 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist and philosopher who was a pioneer of political economy and key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Also known as \"The Father of Economics\" or \"The Father of Capitalism\", he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage. Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day. Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as Horace Walpole."

        "content": "Edmund Gustav Albrecht Husserl ( ,  , ; 8 April 1859 \u2013 27 April 1938) was a German philosopher and mathematician who established the school of phenomenology. In his early work, he elaborated critiques of historicism and of psychologism in logic based on analyses of intentionality. In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called phenomenological reduction. Arguing that transcendental consciousness sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl redefined phenomenology as a transcendental-idealist philosophy. Husserl's thought profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy, and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond. Husserl studied mathematics, taught by Karl Weierstrass and Leo K\u00f6nigsberger, and philosophy taught by Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. He taught philosophy as a Privatdozent at Halle from 1887, then as professor, first at G\u00f6ttingen from 1901, then at Freiburg from 1916 until he retired in 1928, after which he remained highly productive. In 1933, under racial laws, having been born to a Jewish family, he was expelled from the library of the University of Freiburg, and months later resigned from the Deutsche Akademie. Following an illness, he died in Freiburg in 1938."

        "content": "Friedrich August von Hayek   ( , ; 8 May 189923 March 1992), often referred to by his initials F. A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist, and philosopher who is best known for his defence of classical liberalism. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for their work on money and economic fluctuations, and the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. His account of how changing prices communicate information that helps individuals coordinate their plans is widely regarded as an important achievement in economics, leading to his prize. Hayek served in World War I during his teenage years and said that this experience in the war and his desire to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war drew him into economics. At the University of Vienna, he studied economics, eventually receiving his doctoral degrees in law in 1921 and in political science in 1923. He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany; he became a British subject in 1938. Hayek's academic life was mostly spent at the London School of Economics, and later at the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. Although he is widely considered a leader of the Austrian School of Economics, he also had close connections with the Chicago School of Economics. Hayek was also a major social theorist and political philosopher of the 20th century and as the co-founder of Mont Pelerin Society he contributed to the revival of classical liberalism in the post-war era. His most popular work, The Road to Serfdom, has sold over 2.25\u00a0million copies (as of 2020). Hayek was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1984 for his academic contributions to economics. He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush. In 2011, his article \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the American Economic Review during its first 100 years."

Among his foremost achievements were finding a cure for syphilis in 1909 and inventing the precursor technique to Gram staining bacteria. The methods he developed for staining tissue made it possible to distinguish between different types of blood cells, which led to the ability to diagnose numerous blood diseases. His laboratory discovered arsphenamine (Salvarsan), the first effective medicinal treatment for syphilis, thereby initiating and also naming the concept of chemotherapy. Ehrlich popularized the concept of a magic bullet. He also made a decisive contribution to the development of an antiserum to combat diphtheria and conceived a method for standardizing therapeutic serums. In 1908, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to immunology. He was the founder and first director of what is now known as the Paul Ehrlich Institute, a German research institution and medical regulatory body that is the nation's federal institute for vaccines and biomedicines. A genus of Rickettsiales bacteria, Ehrlichia, is named after him."

He was the founder of modern functional analysis, and an original member of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics. His major work was the 1932 book, Th\u00e9orie des op\u00e9rations lin\u00e9aires (Theory of Linear Operations), the first monograph on the general theory of functional analysis. Born in Krak\u00f3w, Banach attended IV Gymnasium, a secondary school, and worked on mathematics problems with his friend Witold Wilkosz. After graduating in 1910, Banach moved to Lw\u00f3w (today called Lviv) . However, during World War I Banach returned to Krak\u00f3w, where he befriended Hugo Steinhaus. After Banach solved some mathematics problems that Steinhaus considered difficult, they published their first joint work. In 1919, with several other mathematicians, Banach formed a mathematical society. In 1920 he received an assistantship at the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic. He soon became a professor at the Polytechnic, and a member of the Polish Academy of Learning.  He organized the \"Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics\". Around 1929 he began writing his Th\u00e9orie des op\u00e9rations lin\u00e9aires. After the outbreak of World War II, in September 1939, Lw\u00f3w was taken over by the Soviet Union. Banach became a dean of Lw\u00f3w University's Department of Mathematics and Physics.  In 1941, when the Germans took over Lw\u00f3w, all institutions of higher education were closed to Poles. As a result, Banach was forced to earn a living as a feeder of lice at Rudolf Weigl's Institute for Study of Typhus and Virology. While the job carried the risk of infection with typhus, it protected him from being sent to slave labor in Germany and from other forms of repression. When the Soviets recaptured Lw\u00f3w in 1944, Banach reestablished the University. However, because the Soviets were removing Poles from Soviet-annexed formerly-Polish territories, Banach prepared to return to Krak\u00f3w.  Before he could do so, he died in August 1945, having been diagnosed seven months earlier with lung cancer. Banach wasn't a member of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Some of the notable mathematical concepts that bear Banach's name include Banach spaces, Banach algebras, Banach measures, the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox, the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, the Banach\u2013Steinhaus theorem, the Banach\u2013Mazur game, the Banach\u2013Alaoglu theorem, and the Banach fixed-point theorem."

In the 1990s, partly in collaboration with Yuri Burago, Mikhael Gromov, and Anton Petrunin, he made influential contributions to the study of Alexandrov spaces. In 1994, he proved the soul conjecture in Riemannian geometry, which had been an open problem for the previous 20 years. In 2002 and 2003, he developed new techniques in the analysis of Ricci flow, thereby providing a detailed sketch of a proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and Thurston's geometrization conjecture, the former of which had been a famous open problem in mathematics for the past century. The full details of Perelman's work were filled in and explained by various authors over the following several years. In August 2006, Perelman was offered the Fields Medal for \"his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow\", but he declined the award, stating: \"I'm not interested in money or fame; I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo.\" On 22 December 2006, the scientific journal Science recognized Perelman's proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture as the scientific \"Breakthrough of the Year\", the first such recognition in the area of mathematics.

Bachelier's doctoral thesis, which introduced the first mathematical model of Brownian motion and its use for valuing stock options, was the first paper to use advanced mathematics in the study of finance. His Bachelier model has been influential in the development of other widely used models, including the Black-Scholes model.

Alderson (October 21, 1914 \u2013 February 11, 2005) was an American inventor best known for his development of the crash test dummy, a device that, during the last half of the twentieth century, was widely used by automobile manufacturers to test the reliability of automobile seat belts and other safety protocols. Alderson was born in Cleveland, Ohio but was raised in southern California as a toddler where his Romanian-immigrant father ran a custom sheet-metal and sign shop. He graduated from high school at the age of 15 and went on to intermittently study at Reed College, Caltech, Columbia and UC Berkeley. He frequently interrupted his education to help out with the family sheet-metal business. He completed his formal education at the University of California, Berkeley under the tutelage of J. Robert Oppenheimer and Ernest O. Lawrence, but did not complete his doctoral dissertation. He was also captain of the Varsity Marco Polo team, winning many awards and receiving many accolades. In 1952, he began his own company, Alderson Research Laboratories, and quickly won a contract to create an anthropometric dummy for use in testing aircraft ejection seats. At about the same time, automobile manufacturers were being challenged to produce safer vehicles, and to do so without relying on live volunteers or human cadavers. In 1966, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act was passed, which together with Ralph Nader's book, Unsafe at Any Speed put the search for an anatomically faithful test dummy into high gear. With this as a goal, Alderson produced the V.I.P., a dummy designed to mimic an average male's acceleration and weight properties, and to reproduce the effects of impact like a real person. His work went on to see the creation of the Hybrid family of test dummies, which as of the beginning of the 21st century are the de facto standards for testing. Alderson also worked for the United States military. During World War II, he helped develop an optical coating to improve the vision of submarine periscopes, and worked on depth charge and missile guidance technology. He also helped create dummies, known as \"medical phantoms\", that reacted to radiation, and synthetic wounds, used in emergency training simulations, which behaved like real wounds. Based on that experience, he formed another company that he managed until shortly before his death, Radiology Support Devices, to supply the healthcare industry. Later on, he built dummies to test the Apollo nose cone's water landing capability. Alderson died at his home in Marina Del Rey, California, due to complications from myelofibrosis. Alderson was widowed once and divorced three times. In addition to his son Jeremy, he is survived by a sister, another son, and four grandchildren."

He studies the socio-cultural aspects of medieval history in Western Europe and has made important contributions in his use of anthropological and art historical methods to interpret history. His most significant work has dealt with the relationships among elites and laymen in medieval life, particularly in the realm of religious culture, where he has focused on ideas and topics such as superstition, the occult and heresy in order to flesh out the differing world-views of the lay peasantry and the clerical elites who attempted to define religious practice. He has contributed numerous books, articles and encyclopedia entries on these and related topics. He has also written widely on the cult of saints, the idea of adolescence, visions and dreams, and preaching. Among Schmitt's best known works translated in English are The Holy Greyhound (1983), about the strange cult of a holy dog in medieval France, and Ghosts in the Middle Ages (1998) about notions of death, the afterlife and paranormal visions in medieval culture. Both works are considered important examples of \"historical anthropology,\" or the use of methods and approaches borrowed from anthropology and other social sciences to investigate the past. Schmitt has argued that this has helped correct for the tendency among medievalists in the past to focus on elites, political institutions and narrative history to the exclusion of the lower classes and their less well-documented experiences of life. Until 2014 Schmitt was Director of Studies at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales and directed the society of professional historians, Groupe d'Anthropologie Historique de l'Occident M\u00e9di\u00e9val."

Balseiro studied at the Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba in his home city, before moving to La Plata to study and research, obtaining a doctorate in physics at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. His doctoral dissertation was directed by Dr. Guido Beck, an Austrian physicist who arrived as a refugee in 1943. In 1950 he received a scholarship granted by the British Council. Due to the limited funds provided by the scholarship, his wife and daughter remained in Argentina. Balseiro  did his post-doctoral research at the University of Manchester, in the group directed by L\u00e9on Rosenfeld. His father was Galician and his mother was French. The Argentine government requested that he return to Argentina in 1952, a few months before the expiration of his scholarship, to serve in the scientific review panel of the Huemul Project, a study on nuclear fusion conducted by Ronald Richter. Balseiro's report and those of other members of the panel finally convinced the government that the Huemul Project had no scientific merit. Based on this, and reports from a second review panel (composed of physicists Richard Gans and Antonio Rodr\u00edguez), the Huemul Project was abandoned. Afterwards, Balseiro remained in Argentina where he was appointed director of the physics department of the Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales of the Universidad de Buenos Aires in 1952. In 1955, using part of the old installations of the Huemul Project, the National Atomic Energy Commission created the Instituto de F\u00edsica de Bariloche. Balseiro played an important role in this decision and served as the first director of the new institution. Upon his untimely death from leukemia in 1962, the institute was renamed Instituto Balseiro. In 2005 the Instituto Balseiro celebrated 50 years of existence, having grown to become one of the country's leading centers for research in new technology, Physics, and Nuclear Engineering."

He enrolled in the Hutchins College at the University of Chicago in 1947 at the age of 15, and received his Ph.D. in 1956.  His Ph.D. thesis was on an algebraic abstract formulation of substitution in many-sorted free algebras and its relation to equational definitions of the partial recursive functions. While in graduate school, beginning in 1954, he worked at Professor Walter Bartky's Institute for Air Weapons Research, which did classified work for the US Air Force.  He continued to work there following the completion of his Ph.D., from 1956 to 1957.  In the summer of 1957 he attended the Cornell NSF Summer 1957 Institute in Logic.   In 1958 to 1959 he went to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked with Kurt G\u00f6del.  He also did post-graduate work at University of California, Berkeley. When in 1959 he got an unsolicited offer of a faculty position at Cornell University, he accepted, in part because on his previous visit to the campus he had thought \"it was the prettiest place I'd ever seen\". Nerode is Goldwin Smith Professor of Mathematics at Cornell, having been named to that chair in 1991. His interests are in mathematical logic, the theory of automata, computability and complexity theory, the calculus of variations, and distributed systems. With John Myhill, Nerode proved the Myhill\u2013Nerode theorem specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for a formal language to be regular. With Bakhadyr Khoussainov, Nerode founded the theory of automatic structures, an extension of the theory of automatic groups. The academic year 2019\u201320 saw Nerode's 60th year as an active faculty member at Cornell, which the university said was its longest such tenure ever. Nerode is an Editorial Board member of the journals Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, Mathematical and Computer Modelling, Documenta Mathematica and others. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society."

In 1908 he was awarded his Ph.D. from the University of G\u00f6ttingen under Karl Schwarzschild. In 1911 he began working at the Mount Wilson observatory, studying the spectra of the Sun and stars. In collaboration with Walter Sidney Adams,  and in 1914 they discovered that the absolute luminosity of a star was proportional to the relative intensity of the lines in the spectrum. This allowed astronomers to determine the distance of stars, including main sequence and giants, using the spectroscope. He became the director of the Bonn observatory in 1925. Therein he was dedicated to astrometric studies. The crater Kohlsch\u00fctter on the Moon is named after him."

Escher had a broad interest, but his research was mainly on crystallography, mineralogy and volcanology. He was a pioneer in experimental geology. He was a half-brother of the artist M.C. Escher, and had some influence on his work due to his knowledge of crystallography.  M.C. Escher created a woodcut ex libris for his brother 'Beer' with a stylized image of a volcano around 1922 (Bool number 91). Escher was the son of the civil engineer G. A. Escher, a director of the Dutch watermanagement (Rijkswaterstaat) and his first wife, Charlotte Marie Hartitzsch. Escher spent his youth in Switzerland. He studied geology at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (Technical University) of Z\u00fcrich, where he was a pupil of Albert Heim. He finished his studies in 1911 and returned to the Netherlands where he first became the assistant of M.E.F.T. Dubois at the University of Amsterdam and then curator of the geological collections at Delft University. In 1916 he was employed by Royal Dutch Shell in the Dutch East Indies. Escher became professor at Leiden University in 1922, at the same time he became director of the geological museum there, he was the successor of K. Martin in that position. Whereas Martin's interest lay mainly with paleontology and stratigraphy, Escher was in the first place a mineralogist. In Leiden he reorganized the museum by giving more attention to educating the general public in geology. He wrote books on geology, mineralogy and crystallography, scientific as well as for the general public. His research area was mainly volcanology. He was also interested in the geology of the Moon. Of importance were his contributions in discussions with F.A. Vening Meinesz, Ph.H. Kuenen and J.H.F. Umbgrove on zones of negative gravitational anomalies, which they explained by assuming that convection took place in the mantle. Escher's contribution was to research volcanism at these zones. He was also a pioneer in using experiments to solve geological questions, for which he set up a laboratory in Leiden. During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, Escher was kept captive by the Nazis for some time. After his release he went in hiding until the liberation in 1945. When Leiden University reopened he became rector magnificus. He retired in 1955. He was elected IAV President (IAV at that time) for two periods (1948\u20131954)."

Adolf Kratzer (October 16, 1893 \u2013 July 6, 1983) was a German theoretical physicist who made contributions to atomic physics and molecular physics, and was an authority on molecular band spectroscopy. He was born in G\u00fcnzburg and died in M\u00fcnster. From 1912 to 1914, Kratzer studied physics at the Technische Hochschule M\u00fcnchen (today, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen), and then he spent two years in the army, after which he began studies at the University of Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld.  He was granted his doctor of philosophy in 1920; his thesis was on the band spectra of molecules.  While at Munich, he was Sommerfeld\u2019s assistant; he had been trained by Sommerfeld\u2019s assistant and student Wilhelm Lenz to fill this role.  While at Munich, Kratzer extended the theory of diatomic molecular spectroscopy by including anharmonic forces between the nuclei, which changed the oscillation frequencies.  It was Sommerfeld\u2019s practice to send some of his assistants to be personal assistants for physics to the mathematician David Hilbert, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.  Kratzer was sent to G\u00f6ttingen during the period 1920 to 1921.  Upon his return to Munich, he became a Privatdozent, and it was during this time that he became acquainted with Werner Heisenberg, also a student of Sommerfeld. Based on his work at Munich, it was in 1922 that Kratzer's detailed analysis on the cyanide spectroscopic bands was published.  His analysis resulted in the introduction of half-integral quantum numbers to account for molecular rotation.  During 1922, he was also called as an ordinarius professor of theoretical physics to the University of M\u00fcnster.  Here, Kratzer made contributions to quantum mechanics and became a leading authority in the field of molecular band spectroscopy. At this time, there were three centers of development for quantum mechanics and the interpretation of atomic and molecular structure, based on atomic and molecular spectroscopy, especially the Sommerfeld-Bohr model:  the Theoretical Physics Institute at the University of Munich, under Arnold Sommerfeld, the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, under Max Born, and the Institute of Theoretical Physics, under Niels Bohr.  These three institutes effectively formed a consortium for the exchange of assistants and researchers.  Furthermore, with Sommerfeld educating such capable physicists as Kratzer, and others, when they were called to other facilities, they effectively became extensions of Sommerfeld\u2019s Institute of Theoretical Physics.  This was the case with Kratzer when he went to M\u00fcnster, as was the case of Sommerfeld\u2019s former student Paul Peter Ewald when he went to the Stuttgart Technische Hochschule. Kratzer published a number of physics books, based on his lectures on electrodynamics, mechanics, optics, relativity, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics (wave mechanics).  A book on transcendental functions was written with Walter Franz, also a student of Sommerfeld. The Kratzer potential, a central force in molecular physics, is named in his honor. A potential with the same name has also been used in nuclear physics, as it provides an exact solution of the Bohr hamiltonian."

        "content": "Wilhelm Heinrich Heintz (4 November 1817 \u2013 1 December 1880) was a German structural chemist from Berlin. He initially trained and worked as a pharmacist, from 1841 he studied sciences at the University of Berlin. He earned his PhD at Berlin in 1844 under Heinrich Rose, and two years later, obtained his habilitation in chemistry. In 1850 he became an associate professor at the University of Halle, where in 1855 he attained a full professorship. He was one of six founding members of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft and the only chemist. At Halle, Heintz supervised Johannes Wislicenus's Ph.D. work, although Wislicenus' pro forma advisor at Zurich was Georg Karl Andreas St\u00e4deler. With Christoph Gottfried Giebel, he was editor of the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturwissenschaften. In 1853 he analyzed margaric acid as simply a combination of stearic acid and palmitic acid. He also conducted analysis of uric acid in urea, created methods for the analysis of nitrogen in organic compounds, and studied chemical reactions of chloroacetic acid and the reaction of acetone with amines. In addition he performed chemical investigations of uranium, bismuth, cesium, rubidium and metal phosphates. The mineral heintzite is named for him."

        "content": "Paul Alfred Weiss (March 21, 1898 \u2013 September 8, 1989) was an Austrian biologist who specialised in morphogenesis, development, differentiation and neurobiology.  A teacher, experimenter and theorist, he made a lasting contribution to science in his lengthy career, throughout which he sought to encourage specialists in different fields to meet and share insights. Paul Weiss was born in Vienna, the son of a Jewish couple, Carl S. Weiss, a businessman, and Rosalie Kohn Weiss. His background favoured music, poetry, and philosophy \u2013 Weiss himself was a violinist \u2013 but an uncle encouraged an interest in science. Weiss received his baccalaureate in 1916. After the end of the First World War, having served for three years as an officer in the artillery, he commenced studies in mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna, (now Vienna University of Technology). He then shifted his focus to biology with a minor in physics. He absorbed the studies of Edmond B. Wilson, Edwin G. Concklin, and Theodor Bovari and completed his doctoral thesis in 1922 under Hans Leo Przibram, then director of the Biological Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna, on the responses of butterflies to light and gravity. After completing his thesis he traveled widely in Europe, becoming an assistant director of the Biological Research Institute of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. In 1926 he married Maria Helen Blaschka. His studies of limb regeneration in newts showed that a complete limb could regenerate even if particular tissue forms were removed from the stump: the required types of tissue would reform. He studied cell differentiation and the transplanting and reforming of connections in the nerves of limbs, using newts and frogs for his experiments. He went on to consider neurobiology and morphogenesis. He introduced the idea of the \"natural experiment\" \u2013 the quest for suggestive examples  from nature \u2013 and this became a favourite teaching device. In 1930 a prospective post at the University of Frankfurt was lost due to the depression and Weiss moved to the United States. In 1931, after studying developing cell cultures for some time, Weiss won a Sterling fellowship to work with Ross Granville Harrison at Yale. He took US citizenship in 1939, publishing his Principles of Development the same year. From 1933 to 1954, after working briefly at Yale, he taught at the University of Chicago. In his work on tissue cultures Weiss outlined several features of cell proliferation: he showed how cell-patterns are affected by their substrate and, through grafts, proved that basic neural patterns of coordination were self-differentiating rather than learned, though higher vertebrates can \"retrain\" reflexes. During World War II he worked with the American government on nerve injury. In 1947 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1954 he became one of the first professors at the new Rockefeller University in New York, where he remained for fifteen years. Paul Weiss was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. He died at White Plains, New York, on September 8, 1989, at the age of 91. In similarity to Ludwig von Bertalanffy he described organisms in a systems biology approach with concepts like hierarchically organized systems or primary activity. Thus in some of his works he challenged a reductionist applicability of mechanistic and deterministic physical laws to solely explain the phenomena of life."

During the 1950s, Meise was the President of the Jordsand Club for the Protection of Seabirds at a time when such endeavours were at an early stage. He undertook an expedition to Angola in 1955 and, during the following years, published several papers on geographical variation, speciation, and evolution of African birds. Meise produced 47 parts of Max Sch\u00f6nwetter's handbook Handbuch der Oologie between 1960 and 1992, following Sch\u00f6nwetter's death in 1960. The work consists of 3666 pages and presents in detail all species and subspecies whose eggs are known. According to Meise, there are 30000 - 35000 sub-species of birds, and the eggs of only half of these are known to science. Meise's  170 publications dealt mainly with birds, but occasionally with the taxonomy of scorpions, spiders, lizards, snakes, and molluscs. He retired in 1972, and died aged 101 in 2002."

Sidrauski is best known for his 1967 article, \"Rational Choice and Patterns of Growth in a Monetary Economy,\" which was based on his PhD dissertation.  The article analyses a model of a representative household that intertemporally maximises utility, which in turn depends on both the consumption of goods and the holding of real balances of money. The model implies that in steady state, capital intensity is invariant to the rate of monetary expansion or contraction, a result that is described as superneutrality of money."

He was born in Hamburg, and in 1760 went to the University of G\u00f6ttingen where he initially studied theology before switching to mathematics. Georg Christoph Lichtenberg was a fellow student. His doctoral thesis Conatuum praecipuorum theoriam parallelarum demonstrandi recensio, published in 1763 with Abraham Gotthelf K\u00e4stner as doctoral advisor, was a study of 30 attempted proofs of the parallel postulate. It was influential at the time and much cited. Kl\u00fcgel edited the Hann\u00f6versche Magazin for 2 years from 1766, before becoming professor of mathematics at the University of Helmstedt.

He previously worked as Professor in the Metamakers Institute at Falmouth University, UK and led the Computational Creativity Research Groups at Goldsmiths, University of London and at Imperial College, London in the positions of Professor and Reader, respectively. He graduated from the University of Durham with a degree in Mathematics, gained an MSc. in Pure Mathematics at the University of Liverpool, and finally a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Professor Alan Bundy. Simon is the driving force behind thepaintingfool.com, an artificial intelligence that he hopes will one day be accepted as an artist in its own right. His work, along with that of Maja Pantic and Michel Valstar, won the British Computing Society Machine Intelligence Award in 2007. The work has also been the subject of some media attention. Prior to his work on The Painting Fool, Simon worked on the HR tool, a reasoning tool that was applied to discover mathematical concepts. The system successfully discovered theorems and conjectures, some of which were novel enough to become published works. Colton's work with HM included the discovery of refactorable numbers, which appeared to be original but turned out to have been previously discovered."

In 1927, Buisman provided the final proof that Graphium ulmi (later named Ophiostoma ulmi) was the causal agent of the disease, concluding the controversy which had raged among Dutch and German scientists since 1922. Buisman developed the inoculation method for screening large numbers of elm plants for resistance, and in 1932 discovered the generative form of the fungus, Ceratostomella ulmi. The first ever resistant elm clone released in the Netherlands was named for her in 1937, following her untimely death the previous year."

Leduey became interested in the dying Eyak language after he learned about its last native speaker, Marie Smith Jones, on the Internet. At 12 or 13 years old he ordered Eyak text, audio materials and DVDs and started to study it. Leduey engaged in email communication with the Eyak Preservation Council, which was conducting an Eyak Language preservation project and Laura Bliss Spaan, a filmmaker of learning DVDs, and met her when she visited France. Later, Leduey contacted Michael E. Krauss, and in July 2010 he visited Cordova, Alaska, the Eyak ancestral homelands, in order to get instructions and further training in Eyak. Under the academic assistance of Krauss, Leduey began analyzing Eyak tales. Together with Krauss, Bliss Spaan and the Eyak Preservation Council they are working to revive Eyak by publishing Eyak words and phrases on websites like Facebook and Twitter and helping Eyaks study their language.

A.\u00a0F.\u00a0Filippov was born in Moscow in 1923. After serving in the Red Army during the Second World War he attended Moscow State University (Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics). After graduating from the university in 1950, he worked there until his death in 2006 (a professor since 1978). He got his Ph.D. under the supervision of I.\u00a0G.\u00a0Petrovsky. Filippov showed interest in continuous loops in 1950 when he constructed a proof that they divide a plane into interior and exterior parts. Known as the Jordan curve theorem, it exemplifies a mathematical proposition easily stated but difficult to prove. In 1955 Filippov and V. S. Ryaben'kii became interested in difference equations and wrote On the Stability of Difference Equations. The work was developed into a textbook in 1961 which was used in Moscow State University and many other Russian universities for several decades. In 1959 he published a paper containing a lemma about implicit functions designed for use in optimal control theory which is named after him (Filippov's lemma). Filippov made an important contribution in the theory of discontinuous ordinary differential equations with his monograph Differential Equations with Discontinuous Righthand Sides (1985). Such set-valued dynamical systems arise in sliding mode control, an important class of feedback control systems demonstrating robust control. Such systems model some mechanical systems with Coulomb friction, and more recently genetic networks. A.\u00a0F.\u00a0Filippov was awarded the Moscow State University's Lomonosov Award in 1993."

        "content": "Jessie Marie Jacobs Muller Offermann (1890\u20131954) was an American mathematician who also made contributions to the field of genetics. Jessie M. Jacobs completed her undergraduate degree at McPherson College. After a year spent teaching high school she was awarded one of the first two fellowships to study graduate-level mathematics at the University of Kansas, where she earned her master's degree in 1916. She earned her Ph.D in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 1919 under the supervision of Arthur Byron Coble. She became an associate professor at Rockford College and then, in 1920, an instructor at the University of Texas at Austin, where she also edited the Texas Mathematics Teachers' Bulletin. Her tenure at the university, along with that of colleague Goldie Printis Horton, is recognized by an annual lecture series. While at the University of Texas, she met geneticist Hermann Joseph Muller, when he asked her for help modeling the mathematics of mutation in flies. The couple married in 1923. Their son David, who would become a mathematician and computer scientist, was born the following year. Jessie's university appointment was terminated in 1924 against her wishes: her departmental colleagues felt that academia and motherhood were incompatible. Her own teaching career over, Jessie collaborated with her husband in the Drosophila laboratory and co-authored an article with him. Muller would later win a Nobel prize for the research he performed with Jessie's assistance during this period. The marriage had grown strained, but in 1933 Jessie joined Hermann Muller in Berlin and then Leningrad for a portion of his Guggenheim fellowship. She divorced her husband in 1935 (first in the Soviet Union, then in Texas) and within a few months remarried Carlos Alberto Offermann. He had worked in Hermann Muller's Leningrad laboratory from 1933-1934. After marrying Jessie in Texas Carlos returned to his position, now relocated to Moscow, though his wife and stepson were unable to join him. So long as his father remained in the Soviet Union, a Texas judge refused to permit David Muller to leave the state. Jessie made a living in Austin by tutoring university students in mathematics, subletting a room, and supervising a Works Progress Administration group writing a history of Travis County. In 1938, Carlos Offermann returned to Austin, and the family soon moved to Chicago. Assisted by his wife, Carlos pursued experimental work necessary for his Ph.D. Jessie was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and in 1940 the family moved to California, where they hoped she could recuperate. In 1942, her health had deteriorated and she was forced to enter a sanitarium, and was institutionalized at the time of her death."
