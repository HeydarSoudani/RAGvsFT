A conference, National Library exhibition, film screenings, pre-show talks, and the launching of a special issue of The Irish University Review devoted to the playwright ran in conjunction with the festival. Also in 1999, The Irish Times extended him the honour of a lifetime achievement award.\nOn 22 February 2006, President Mary McAleese presented Friel with a gold torc in recognition of his election to the position of Saoi by his fellow members of Aosd\u00e1na.

Friel attended its opening in 2009.Friel's 80th birthday fell in 2009. The journal Irish Theatre International published a Special Issue to commemorate the occasion with seven articles devoted to the playwright.

At the age of 15 he became clerk to the steward of Magdalen College, Oxford and began a lifelong involvement in the management of the college's London estates. After several years working on plans for new buildings, around 1801 he became bailiff and collector of rents for Magdalen College in Freeman's Court, London, and in Southwark, and held this post until his retirement in 1849. The work for the college allowed him ample free time, and he also practised as an architect until 1830, designing buildings such as Halkyn Castle, Flint (1822\u201327) for Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Earl Grosvenor (later created Marquess of Westminster) the tower of the church in Theale, Berkshire (1827\u201328). Glastonbury Priory, also called Abbey House, Somerset (1829\u201330) for J.F. Reeves, and Poll Park, Denbighshire (c. 1828), for William Bagot, 2nd Baron Bagot, \"an early essay in the half-timbered style\", according to Howard Colvin, who suggested that Buckler had a hand in the Gothic remodelling of Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire, for Lord Bagot, 1822\u201323. He or his son also designed the church of St John the Baptist, Pentrobin (now Penymynydd), in the County of Flintshire, 1843, for Sir Stephen Glynne, as one of the first Gothic Revival churches that came out of the Cambridge Camden Society.\nBuckler's interest in art developed over time, and his first published works were two aquatints of Magdalen College in 1797. He followed these in 1799 with an engraving of Lincoln Cathedral; the first in a series which included all the cathedrals in England by 1814, as well as many of the collegiate and parish churches. Shortly after 1800 he was commissioned by Richard Colt Hoare of Stourhead to produce ten volumes of drawings of churches and other historic buildings in Wiltshire, and Buckler's grandson described this commission as \"deciding his brains for antiquarian pursuits\". It was followed by similar commissions from other antiquarians, such as William Salt of Staffordshire, and by the end of his life, by his own account, Buckler had produced around 13,000 drawings of buildings. Many of the buildings Buckler drew had not been previously recorded, and many have since been demolished or substantially altered, so his work is now a valuable source of information on British architectural history. His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy every year from 1798 until 1849, and he became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1810.John Buckler died in Newington, London, in 1851, two years after his retirement.

He explained that he did not have enough troops of his own, but that Artaphernes, Darius\u2019 brother and the Persian satrap of Lydia, who commanded a large army and navy on the coast of Asia, could help supply troops. The Naxians agreed to Aristagoras seeking Artaphernes' support and supplied him with money.\nAristagoras travelled to Sardis and suggested that Artaphernes attack Naxos and restore the exiles. The Persians would then gain control of the island. He explained to Artaphernes that Naxos \u201cwas a fine and fertile island, close to the Ionian coast, and rich both in treasures and slaves.\u201d  It was also the gateway to the Cyclades, which the Persians did not yet rule. Aristagoras promised that he would both fund the expedition and give Artaphernes a bonus sum. He also tempted Artaphernes by adding that capturing the island would place other poleis of the Cyclades under his control. They would serve as bases for an invasion of  Euboea. After securing the permission of Susa, Artaphernes agreed and promised 200 ships.\nThe following spring, Aristagoras and the Naxian exiles sailed with the fleet. Unfortunately for the success of the invasion, Aristagoras quarrelled with the Persian admiral Megabates.

He added, I'm really a huge fan of him, and everything that he has done. I just think all around that he is an extremely talented artist, songwriter, singer, and guitar player. He can do so many different things to evoke emotion. From the soulfulness, to the top end of his range when he gets metal and aggressive, to his choice of melodies and how the melody in itself, despite what he's saying, can incite emotion. I think he'll go down in history as one of the greats.\nAfter hearing about his death, Alice Cooper stated: Chris Cornell, in our circle, was known as 'The Voice' because he had the best voice in rock and roll. I was lucky enough to write and record two songs with him. His death comes as a total shock to all of us. 'Black Hole Sun' will live on as a classic, and his is a true legacy of rock and roll. Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid stated: \"There are barely any words to describe my grief over the loss of Chris Cornell...His impact as a singer, songwriter and guitarist will be felt for generations to come.\"\nPearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said of Cornell: I've always said that Chris was the greatest songwriter to ever come out of Seattle. Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to at different points in our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that's part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there's not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do a lot of different things with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness.\nFollowing his death, the sales and streams of Cornell's discography grew by more than 550% from the week prior to his death. On platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora, his songs were streamed 32.5 million times during the week in which he died. The charting week prior to that, his tracks were played 5 million times.

Eight years later he won the Sulman Award for the Badham House at Cronulla. Bryce's design reflected the firm's adherence to the International style, while anticipating the so-called \u2018Sydney Regional\u2019 style with which the firm would become associated over the next decade.\nAfter Ken Woolley joined them in 1964, Ancher and Mortlock set up offices in Ridge St, North Sydney, establishing the well-known Sydney firm Ancher, Mortlock and Woolley. The firm completed innovative designs for town houses and flats at Wollstonecraft and Cremorne.  Mortlock was also appointed Master Planner for the University of Melbourne in 1968.  It was a position that entailed regular trips from his Cammeray home, but one which he held until the late 1990s, describing it as his most satisfying and challenging.  The University recognized his work with an honorary doctorate.  In 1970 Mortlock, in partnership with others, applied his interest in planning and the need for increasing density to the drafting of a Building Code for North Sydney Council.\nBy that time Mortlock had been living locally for 40 years. He moved to Vernon Street, Cammeray, with his new wife Peggy in 1950, shortly after returning from overseas.  As two of the first residents of that area, the Mortlocks confronted the North Sydney Council who had begun clearing the bush land fronting Long Bay.  The Mortlocks managed to convince the Council to stop this destruction, and over the next four decades they cared for the public land near their home \u2013 tirelessly cutting the lantana and balloon vine that grew in the wake of the clearing. Eventually the Council came to embrace Mortlock's attitude to the preservation of the bush land.

However, she was criticized by sectors of the Catholic Church in Brazil and other religious groups, due to her past support for the legalization of abortion. This was also a main target of criticism by Jos\u00e9 Serra's campaign as well as the newsmagazine Veja, which emphasized Rousseff's past and current positions on its cover. The subject only faded away from the news after the information became public that Jos\u00e9 Serra's wife, Monica Serra, had reportedly had an abortion in her youth\nWhen asked about the criminal prosecution against Flamengo goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes de Souza, accused of killing his former girlfriend Eliza Samudio, Rousseff said that she opposes the death penalty. According to her, \"if it were effective, there would not be such crimes in the United States.\"Rousseff opposes gay marriage, but supports same-sex civil unions. She said, \"Marriage is a religious issue. I, as an individual, would never say what a religion should or should not do. We have to respect them.\" On the subject of same-sex civil union, Rousseff said that \"basic civil rights should be recognized within the civil legal framework.\" She also opposes the decriminalization of illegal drugs, stating that \"Brazil today is in no condition to propose the decriminalization of any drug.\"As a member of the Workers' Party, a social-democratic party which opposes Third Way politics, Rousseff was expected to be against privatization and neoliberalism. The Nation, as an example of this rationale, described Rousseff's victory as a defeat for the Washington Consensus. Rousseff, however, has had an ambiguous stance on issues that involve privatization. She is, for instance, \"in favor of granting to private enterprises the construction of new power plants and roads, should it be cheaper to do them through grants than through public works.\" Additionally, she favored the privatization of airports in order to prepare Brazil's infra-structure for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nShe also pledged to deepen the social welfare network inaugurated by the Lula administration, saying that, under her rule, \"Brazil will continue to grow, with social inclusion and mobility.\"In 2014, during the presidential elections, the president, Dilma Rousseff, supported the criminalization of homophobia, citing the \"high rate\" of acts of violence against homosexuals in the country.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1964, Ball and her second husband Morton attended \"Lucy Day\", a celebration in her honor held by the New York World's Fair.Acting on advice given to her by Norman Vincent Peale in the early 1960s, Ball collaborated with Betty Hannah Hoffman on an autobiography that covered her life until 1964. Her former attorney found the manuscript, postmarked 1966, while going through old files. He sent it and the tapes of interviews, conducted by Hoffman and used to write the manuscript, to Lucie Jr. and Desi Jr, who had been put in charge of Ball's estate. It was subsequently published by Berkley Publishing Group in 1997. The book was released on audio through Audible on July 9, 2018, read by her daughter.In 1976, CBS paid tribute to Ball with the two-hour special CBS Salutes Lucy: The First 25 Years. Both Ball and Arnaz appeared on the screen for the special, which is the first time they appeared together in 16 years since their divorce.On December 7, 1986, Ball was recognized as a Kennedy Center Honors recipient. The part of the event focused on Ball was particularly poignant, as Desi Arnaz, who was to introduce Lucy at the event, had died from cancer just five days earlier. Friend and former Desilu star Robert Stack delivered the emotional introduction in Arnaz's place.Posthumously, Ball received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H. W.

He was educated at the gymnasium of his native city, at that time directed by the famous philosopher Hegel. \nIn 1817 he entered the University of Erlangen as a student of theology, but abandoned that study for philosophy. For a number of years Daumer was professor at the gymnasium of Nuremberg; owing to ill-health he was pensioned in 1832 and henceforth devoted himself entirely to literary work. While at Erlangen he came strongly under the influence of Pietism. Soon, however, he became sceptical and exhibited decided leanings towards pantheism. From an orthodox Protestant he gradually became a bitter enemy of Christianity, which he attacked in a number of writings and for which he strove to substitute a new religion \"of love and peace\", formulated in his work Religion des neuen Weltalters (Hamburg, 1850). \nKarl Marx and Frederick Engels joined in writing a critical review of Daumer's Die Religion des Neuen Weltalters in January through February 1850 which was published in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Politisch-\u00d6konomische Revue.  Marx and Engels criticized Daumer's theory of history from class point of view.  Instead of a struggle between economic classes in society, Daumer saw only a struggle between \"coarseness\" and \"culture.\"\nPrior to writing Die Religion des Neuen Weltalters, Daumer had published a number of works, all of a distinctly anti-theological tendency, of which the more important are: Philosophie, Religion, und Altertum (Nuremberg, 1833); Z\u00fcge zu einer neuen Philosophie der Religion und Religionsgeschichte (Nuremberg, 1835); Der Feuer- und Molochdienst der Hebr\u00e4er (Brunswick, 1842); Die Geheimnisse des christlichen Altertums (Hamburg, 1847). Shortly after 1850 Daumer left Nuremberg and settled at Frankfurt, where a great change soon came over him. In 1858 at Mainz he publicly embraced the Catholic faith and thenceforth became its zealous defender. Among the works written after his conversion are: Meine Konversion (Mainz, 1859); Aus der Mansarde (1860\u201362); Das Christentum und sein Urheber (Mainz, 1864); Das Wunder, seine Bedeutung, Wahrheit und Notwendigkeit (Ratisbon, 1874). The last mentioned work is directed expressly against the opinions of David Strauss.\nOne of the most important parts of Daumer's work is his poetry. His Hafis (Hamburg, 1846; a second collection, 1852) contain graceful but very free imitations of the songs of the famous Persian poet. Some of them have become widely known through the musical settings of Brahms, such as the Liebeslieder and Neue Liebeslieder Waltzes. Other composers, including Elise Schmezer, have also set Daumer\u2019s texts to music. This collection, as well as Mahomed und sein Werk (Hamburg, 1848), is distinctly directed against the hypocrisy and asceticism which at that time Daumer believed to be inseparable from orthodox Christianity. Among other poems may be mentioned: Glorie der heiligen Jungfrau Maria (Nuremberg, 1841); Frauenbilder und Huldigungen (Leipzig, 1853); Marianische Legenden und Gedichte (Munster, 1859) and Sch\u00f6ne Seelen (Mainz, 1862).\nDaumer was also known as host and teacher of the mysterious foundling Kaspar Hauser in 1828-30 and wrote several books about the case.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "106_143", "question": "What was Ammianus Marcellinus's occupation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_31307", "text": "Ammianus was born in the East Mediterranean, possibly in Syria or Phoenicia, around 330, into a noble family of Greek origin. Since he calls himself Graecus (lit. Greek), he was most likely born in a Greek-speaking area of the empire. His native language is unknown but he likely knew Greek as well as Latin. The surviving books of his history cover the years 353 to 378.Ammianus served as an officer in the army of the emperors Constantius II and Julian. He served in Gaul (Julian) and in the east (twice for Constantius, once under Julian). He professes to have been \"a former soldier and a Greek\" (miles quondam et graecus), and his enrollment among the elite protectores domestici (household guards) shows that he was of middle class or higher birth. Consensus is that Ammianus probably came from a curial family, but it is also possible that he was the son of a comes Orientis of the same family name. He entered the army at an early age, when Constantius II was emperor of the East, and was sent to serve under Ursicinus, governor of Nisibis in Mesopotamia, and magister militum. Ammianus campaigned in the East twice under Ursicinus.\n\nHe travelled with Ursicinus to Italy in an expedition against Silvanus, an officer who had proclaimed himself emperor in Gaul. Ursicinus ended the threat by having Silvanus assassinated, then stayed in the region to help install Julian as Caesar of Gaul, Spain and Britain. Ammianus probably met Julian for the first time while serving on Ursicinus' staff in Gaul.\nIn 359, Constantius sent Ursicinus back to the east to help in the defence against a Persian invasion led by king Shapur II himself. Ammianus returned with his commander to the East and again served Ursicinus as a staff officer. Ursicinus, although he was the more experienced commander, was placed under the command of Sabinianus, the Magister Peditum of the east. The two did not get along, resulting in a lack of cooperation between the Limitanei (border regiments) of Mesopotamia and Osrhoene under Ursicinus' command and the comitatus (field army) of Sabinianus. While on a mission near Nisibis, Ammianus spotted a Persian patrol which was about to try and capture Ursicinus, and warned his commander in time. In an attempt to locate the Persian Royal Army, Ursicinus sent Ammianus to Jovinianus, the semi-independent governor of Corduene, and a friend of Ursicinus. Ammianus successfully located the Persian main body and reported his findings to Ursicinus.After his mission in Corduene, Ammianus left the headquarters at Amida in the retinue of Ursinicus, who was on a mission to make sure the bridges across the Euphrates were demolished. They were attacked by the Persian vanguard, who had made a night march in an attempt to catch the Romans at Amida unprepared. After a protracted cavalry battle, the Romans were scattered; Ursicinus evaded capture and fled to Melitene, while Ammianus made a difficult journey back to Amida with a wounded comrade. The Persians besieged and eventually sacked Amida, and Ammianus barely escaped with his life.When Ursicinus was dismissed from his military post by Constantius, Ammianus too seems to have retired from the military; however, reevaluation of his participation in Julian's Persian campaign has led modern scholarship to suggest that he continued his service but did not for some reason include the period in his history.\nHe accompanied Julian, for whom he expresses enthusiastic admiration, in his campaigns against the Alamanni and the Sassanids.\nAfter Julian's death, Ammianus accompanied the retreat of the new emperor, Jovian, as far as Antioch.\nHe was residing in Antioch in 372 when a certain Theodorus was thought to have been identified the successor to the emperor Valens by divination.\nSpeaking as an alleged eyewitness, Marcellinus recounts how Theodorus and several others were made to confess their deceit through the use of torture, and cruelly punished.\n\nHe eventually settled in Rome and began the Res gestae. The precise year of his death is unknown, but scholarly consensus places it somewhere between 392 and 400 at the latest.Modern scholarship generally describes Ammianus as a pagan who was tolerant of Christianity. Marcellinus writes of Christianity as being a \"plain and simple\" religion that demands only what is just and mild, and when he condemns the actions of Christians, he does not do so on the basis of their Christianity as such. His lifetime was marked by lengthy outbreaks of sectarian and dogmatic strife within the new state-backed faith, often with violent consequences (especially the Arian controversy) and these conflicts sometimes appeared unworthy to him, though it was territory where he could not risk going very far in criticism, due to the growing and volatile political connections between the church and imperial power.\nAmmianus was not blind to the faults of Christians or of pagans and was especially critical of them; he commented that \"no wild beasts are so hostile to men as Christian sects in general are to one another\" and he condemns the emperor Julian for excessive attachment to (pagan) sacrifice, and for his edict effectively barring Christians from teaching posts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He began his piano training aged about 10, at the Moscow Conservatory under Konstantin Igumnov. In 1924, he returned to Poland and continued his studies, first at the Chopin Higher Academy, and then at the Warsaw Conservatory under Aleksander Micha\u0142owski and afterwards under Juliusz Wertheim and Zbigniew Drzewiecki. Even as a student, he showed extraordinary powers, and a front-rank career was anticipated for him.\nAfter graduation, he moved to Krak\u00f3w as professor of piano at the Music Society Conservatory there, of which he became Director in 1929\u20131931. By now, he was giving orchestral concerts in Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w, and in 1932, at Drzewiecki's urging, he entered the II International Chopin Piano Competition and won the third prize - having tied with Abram Lufer, and he won at the coin flipping. In the following year, after a short period of preparation living in Vienna, he entered the second International Music Competition there and obtained first prize. (It was on this occasion that Alfred Cortot, a member of the jury, walked out because the prize had been awarded to Kon and not to Dinu Lipatti, who took second prize.) Kon at once received many invitations to give concerts.\nHowever, he suffered from a form of existential depression and committed suicide in Warsaw in June 1936. He was afflicted with a hereditary mental illness and attended a sanatorium at regular intervals. The need to continue his career caused him to cut short a period of treatment, and it was in this way that the fatal melancholy overtook him.According to Professor Drzewiecki, Kon was the greatest pianistic genius that he ever heard; Mme Margerita Trombini-Kazuro described his playing as of great nobility and spontaneity.

He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Te\u00f3dulo.After relocating to Galicia, the Franco family was involved in the Spanish Navy, and over the span of two centuries produced naval officers for six uninterrupted generations (including several admirals), down to Franco's father Nicol\u00e1s Franco Salgado-Ara\u00fajo (22 November 1855 \u2013 22 February 1942).His mother, Mar\u00eda del Pilar Bahamonde y Pardo de Andrade (15 October 1865 \u2013 28 February 1934), was from an upper-middle-class Roman Catholic family. Her father, Ladislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port of El Ferrol. Franco's parents married in 1890 in the Church of San Francisco in El Ferrol. The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, Nicol\u00e1s and Ram\u00f3n, and his two sisters, Mar\u00eda del Pilar and Mar\u00eda de la Paz. His brother Nicol\u00e1s was a naval officer and diplomat who married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil. Ram\u00f3n was an internationally known aviator and a Freemason, originally with leftist political leanings. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.Franco's father was a naval officer who reached the rank of vice admiral (intendente general). When Franco was fourteen, his father moved to Madrid following a reassignment and ultimately abandoned his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse by his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life. Years after becoming dictator, under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, Franco wrote a brief novel called Raza, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His family attended Disneyland during its opening week in July 1955, and Lucas would remain enthusiastic about the park. He was interested in comics and science fiction, including television programs such as the Flash Gordon serials. Long before Lucas began making films, he yearned to be a racecar driver, and he spent most of his high school years racing on the underground circuit at fairgrounds and hanging out at garages. On June 12, 1962, a few days before his high school graduation, Lucas was driving his souped-up Autobianchi Bianchina when another driver broadsided him, flipping his car several times before it crashed into a tree; Lucas's seatbelt had snapped, ejecting him and thereby saving his life. However, his lungs were bruised from severe hemorrhaging and he required emergency medical treatment. This incident caused him to lose interest in racing as a career, but also inspired him to pursue his other interests.Lucas's father owned a stationery store, and had wanted George to work for him when he turned 18. Lucas had been planning to go to art school, but his father said he wouldn't pay for it. Lucas declared upon leaving home that he would be a millionaire by the age of 30. He attended Modesto Junior College, where he studied anthropology, sociology, and literature, amongst other subjects. He also began shooting with an 8 mm camera, including filming car races. At this time, Lucas became interested in Canyon Cinema: screenings of underground, avant-garde 16 mm filmmakers like Jordan Belson, Stan Brakhage and Bruce Conner. Lucas and childhood friend John Plummer also saw classic European films of the time, including Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's Jules et Jim and Federico Fellini's 8\u00bd. \"That's when George really started exploring,\" Plummer said. Through his interest in autocross racing, Lucas met renowned cinematographer Haskell Wexler, another race enthusiast. Wexler, later to work with Lucas on several occasions, was impressed by Lucas's talent. \"George had a very good eye, and he thought visually,\" he recalled.At Plummer's recommendation, Lucas then transferred to the University of Southern California (USC) School of Cinematic Arts. USC was one of the earliest universities to have a school devoted to motion picture film. During the years at USC, Lucas shared a dorm room with Randal Kleiser. Along with classmates such as Walter Murch, Hal Barwood, John Milius and Matthew Robbins (screenwriter), they became a clique of film students known as The Dirty Dozen. He also became good friends with fellow acclaimed student filmmaker and future Indiana Jones collaborator, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese. Lucas was deeply influenced by the Filmic Expression course taught at the school by filmmaker Lester Novros which concentrated on the non-narrative elements of Film Form like color, light, movement, space, and time. Another inspiration was the Serbian montagist (and dean of the USC Film Department) Slavko Vorkapi\u0107, a film theoretician who made stunning montage sequences for Hollywood studio features at MGM, RKO, and Paramount. Vorkapich taught the autonomous nature of the cinematic art form, emphasizing the kinetic energy inherent in motion pictures.\nAfter graduating with a bachelor of fine arts in film in 1967, he tried joining the United States Air Force as an officer, but he was immediately turned down because of his numerous speeding tickets. He was later drafted by the United States Army for military service in Vietnam, but he was exempted from service after medical tests showed he had diabetes, the disease that killed his paternal grandfather.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The present-day mosque, located on the south wall of the compound, was originally built by the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r.\u2009685\u2013705) or his successor al-Walid I (r.\u2009705\u2013715) (or both) as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the Dome of the Rock, a commemorative Islamic monument. After being destroyed in an earthquake in 746, the mosque was rebuilt in 758 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. It was further expanded upon in 780 by the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi, after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome. However, it was again destroyed during the 1033 Jordan Rift Valley earthquake. The mosque was rebuilt by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (r. 1021\u20131036), who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics; the current structure preserves the 11th-century outline.\nDuring the periodic renovations undertaken, the ruling Islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, fa\u00e7ade, minarets, and minbar and interior structure. Upon its capture by the Crusaders in 1099, the mosque was used as a palace; it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the Knights Templar. After the area was conquered by Saladin in 1187, the structure's function as a mosque was restored. More renovations, repairs, and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the Ayyubids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council of British Palestine, and during the Jordanian occupation of the West Bank. Since the beginning of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Four of his films were placed in the top six of Cinematheque Ontario's Best of the '90s poll. He has gained recognition from film theorists, critics, as well as peers such as Jean-Luc Godard, Nanni Moretti, and Chris Marker. Akira Kurosawa said of Kiarostami's films: \"Words cannot describe my feelings about them ... When Satyajit Ray passed on, I was very depressed. But after seeing Kiarostami's films, I thanked God for giving us just the right person to take his place.\"\nCritically acclaimed directors such as Martin Scorsese have commented that \"Kiarostami represents the highest level of artistry in the cinema.\" The Austrian director Michael Haneke had admired the work of Abbas Kiarostami as among the best of any living director. In 2006, The Guardian's panel of critics ranked Kiarostami as the best contemporary non-American film director.Critics such as Jonathan Rosenbaum have argued that \"there's no getting around the fact that the movies of Abbas Kiarostami divide audiences\u2014in this country, in his native Iran, and everywhere else they're shown.\" Rosenbaum argues that disagreements and controversy over Kiarostami's movies have arisen from his style of film-making because what in Hollywood would count as essential narrative information is frequently missing from Kiarostami's films. Camera placement, likewise, often defies standard audience expectations: in the closing sequences of Life and Nothing More and Through the Olive Trees, the audience is forced to imagine the dialogue and circumstances of important scenes. In Homework and Close-Up, parts of the soundtrack are masked or silenced. Critics have argued that the subtlety of Kiarostami's cinematic expression is largely resistant to critical analysis.\nWhile Kiarostami has won significant acclaim in Europe for several of his films, the Iranian government has refused to permit the screening of his films, to which he responded \"The government has decided not to show any of my films for the past 10 years... I think they don't understand my films and so prevent them being shown just in case there is a message they don't want to get out\".In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Kiarostami was refused a visa to attend the New York Film Festival. The festival director, Richard Pe\u00f1a, who had invited him said, \"It's a terrible sign of what's happening in my country today that no one seems to realize or care about the kind of negative signal this sends out to the entire Muslim world\". The Finnish film director Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki boycotted the festival in protest. Kiarostami had been invited by the New York Film Festival, as well as Ohio University and Harvard University.In 2005, London Film School organized a workshop as well as the festival of Kiarostami's work, titled \"Abbas Kiarostami: Visions of the Artist\". Ben Gibson, Director of the London Film School, said, \"Very few people have the creative and intellectual clarity to invent cinema from its most basic elements, from the ground up. We are very lucky to have the chance to see a master like Kiarostami thinking on his feet.\" He was later made Honorary Associate.\nIn 2007, the Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 co-organized a festival of the Kiarostami's work titled Abbas Kiarostami: Image Maker.Kiarostami and his cinematic style have been the subject of several books and three films, Opening Day of Close-Up (1996), directed by Nanni Moretti, Abbas Kiarostami: The Art of Living (2003), directed by Pat Collins and Fergus Daly, and Abbas Kiarostami: A Report (2014), directed by Bahman Maghsoudlou.\nKiarostami was a member of the advisory board of World Cinema Foundation.

His acting talent was eventually discovered; and he adopted the nomen \"Maccius\" (from Maccus, a clownish stock character in Atellan Farce) and agnomen \"Plautus\" (\"trampled flat\", usually in reference to \"flat-footed\" but sometimes intending \"flat-eared\" like the ears of a hound).

On his return trip from Tarentum, whose onomastic founder has a similar story, avaricious sailors plotted to kill Arion and steal the rich prizes he carried home. Arion was given the choice of suicide with a proper burial on land, or being thrown in the sea to perish. He asked for permission to sing a last song to win time.\n\nPlaying his kithara, Arion sang a praise to Apollo, the god of poetry, and his song attracted a number of dolphins around the ship.  Some argue that the dolphins were sent by Apollo to rescue Arion. At the end of the song, Arion threw himself into the sea rather than be killed, but one of the dolphins saved his life and carried him to safety at the sanctuary of Poseidon at Cape Tainaron. When he reached land, being eager for his journey, he failed to return the dolphin to the sea and it perished there. He told his misfortunes to Periander, the Tyrant of Corinth, who ordered the dolphin to be buried, and monument raised to it. Shortly after, word came to Periander that the ship on which Arion had sailed had been brought to Corinth by a storm. He ordered the crew to be led before him, and inquired about Arion, but they replied that he had died and that they had buried him. The tyrant replied: \"Tomorrow you will swear to that at the Dolphin's monument.\" Because of this he ordered them to be kept under guard, and instructed Arion to hide in the dolphin's monument the next morning, attired as he had been when he had thrown himself into the sea. When the tyrant brought the ship's crew to the dolphin's monument and ordered them to swear by the departed spirit of the dolphin that Arion was dead, Arion came out of the monument. In amazement, wondering by what divinity he had been saved, the ship's crew was silent. The tyrant ordered them to be crucified at the dolphin's monument. Apollo, because of Arion's skill with the kithara, placed him and the dolphin among the stars. This dolphin was catasterised as the constellation Delphinus, by the blessing of Apollo.\n\nThe story as Herodotus tells it was taken up in other literature. Lucian of Samosata wittily imagined the dialogue between Poseidon and the very dolphin who bore Arion.Augustine of Hippo asserted that pagans \"believed in what they read in their own books\" and took Arion to be a historical individual. \"There is no historicity in this tale\", according to Eunice Burr Stebbins, Arion and the dolphins are given as an example of \"a folkloristic motif especially associated with Apollo\" by Irad Malkin. Erasmus instanced Arion as one of the traditional poet's topics that sound like historia rather than fabulae, though he misremembered that Augustine had taken the Arion story to be historical.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to philosopher Paul Weiss, Peirce was \"the most original and versatile of America's philosophers and America's greatest logician\". Bertrand Russell wrote \"he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century and certainly the greatest American thinker ever\". \nEducated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for thirty years, Peirce meanwhile made major contributions to logic, such as theories of relations and quantification. C. I. Lewis wrote, \"The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer\u2014at least in the nineteenth century.\" For Peirce, logic also encompassed much of what is now called epistemology and the philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics or study of signs, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th-century Western philosophy. Peirce's study of signs also included a tripartite theory of predication.  \nAdditionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulating mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. He was one of the founders of statistics. As early as 1886, he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. The same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.For metaphysics, Peirce was an \"objective idealist\" in the tradition of German philosopher Immanuel Kant as well as a scholastic realist about universals. He also held a commitment to the ideas of continuity and chance as real features of the universe, views he labeled synechism and tychism respectively. Peirce believed an epistemic fallibilism and anti-skepticism went along with these views.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs, and James preferred operatic arias. They lived with Daisy's parents at 2129 Ida Place (now Ward Place) NW, in D.C.'s West End neighborhood. Duke's father was born in Lincolnton, North Carolina, on April 15, 1879, and in 1886, moved to D.C. with his parents. Daisy Kennedy was born in Washington, D.C., on January 4, 1879, the daughter of two former American slaves. James Ellington made blueprints for the United States Navy.\nWhen Ellington was a child, his family showed racial pride and support in their home, as did many other families. African Americans in D.C. worked to protect their children from the era's Jim Crow laws.At age seven, Ellington began taking piano lessons from Marietta Clinkscales. Daisy surrounded her son with dignified women to reinforce his manners and teach him elegance. His childhood friends noticed that his casual, offhand manner and dapper dress gave him the bearing of a young nobleman, so they began calling him \"Duke\". Ellington credited his friend Edgar McEntee for the nickname: \"I think he felt that in order for me to be eligible for his constant companionship, I should have a title. So he called me Duke.\"Though Ellington took piano lessons, he was more interested in baseball. \"President [Theodore] Roosevelt would come on his horse sometimes, and \"stop and watch us play\", he recalled. Ellington went to Armstrong Technical High School in Washington, D.C. His first job was selling peanuts at Washington Senators baseball games.\nEllington started sneaking into Frank Holiday's Poolroom at age fourteen. Hearing the music of the poolroom pianists ignited Ellington's love for the instrument, and he began to take his piano studies seriously. Among the many piano players he listened to were Doc Perry, Lester Dishman, Louis Brown, Turner Layton, Gertie Wells, Clarence Bowser, Sticky Mack, Blind Johnny, Cliff Jackson, Claude Hopkins, Phil Wurd, Caroline Thornton, Luckey Roberts, Eubie Blake, Joe Rochester, and Harvey Brooks.In the summer of 1914, while working as a soda jerk at the Poodle Dog Caf\u00e9, Ellington wrote his first composition, \"Soda Fountain Rag\" (also known as the \"Poodle Dog Rag\"). He created the piece by ear, as he had not yet learned to read and write music. \"I would play the 'Soda Fountain Rag' as a one-step, two-step, waltz, tango, and fox trot\", Ellington recalled. \"Listeners never knew it was the same piece. I was established as having my own repertoire.\" In his autobiography, Music is my Mistress (1973), Ellington wrote that he missed more lessons than he attended, feeling at the time that piano was not his talent.\nEllington continued listening to, watching, and imitating ragtime pianists, not only in Washington, D.C. but also in Philadelphia and Atlantic City, where he vacationed with his mother during the summer. He would sometimes hear strange music played by those who could not afford much sheet music, so for variations, they played the sheets upside down. Henry Lee Grant, a Dunbar High School music teacher, gave him private lessons in harmony. With the additional guidance of Washington pianist and band leader Oliver \"Doc\" Perry, Ellington learned to read sheet music, project a professional style, and improve his technique. Ellington was also inspired by his first encounters with stride pianists James P. Johnson and Luckey Roberts. Later in New York, he took advice from Will Marion Cook, Fats Waller, and Sidney Bechet. He started to play gigs in caf\u00e9s and clubs in and around Washington, D.C. His attachment to music was so strong that in 1916 he turned down an art scholarship to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Three months before graduating, he dropped out of Armstrong Manual Training School, where he was studying commercial art.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "106_244", "question": "What was David Hume's occupation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_31672", "text": "Due to Hume's vast influence on contemporary philosophy, a large number of approaches in contemporary philosophy and cognitive science are today called \"Humean.\"The writings of Thomas Reid, a Scottish philosopher and contemporary of Hume, were often critical of Hume's scepticism. Reid formulated his common sense philosophy, in part, as a reaction against Hume's views.Hume influenced, and was influenced by, the Christian philosopher Joseph Butler. Hume was impressed by Butler's way of thinking about religion, and Butler may well have been influenced by Hume's writings.Attention to Hume's philosophical works grew after the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, in his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783), credited Hume with awakening him from his \"dogmatic slumber.\"According to Arthur Schopenhauer, \"there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of Hegel, Herbart and Schleiermacher taken together.\"\nA. J. Ayer, while introducing his classic exposition of logical positivism in 1936, claimed:The views which are put forward in this treatise derive from\u2026doctrines\u2026which are themselves the logical outcome of the empiricism of Berkeley and David Hume.Albert Einstein, in 1915, wrote that he was inspired by Hume's positivism when formulating his theory of special relativity.Hume's problem of induction was also of fundamental importance to the philosophy of Karl Popper. In his autobiography, Unended Quest, he wrote: \"Knowledge ... is objective; and it is hypothetical or conjectural. This way of looking at the problem made it possible for me to reformulate Hume's problem of induction.\" This insight resulted in Popper's major work The Logic of Scientific Discovery. In his Conjectures and Refutations, he wrote:\nI approached the problem of induction through Hume. Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified.\n\nHume's rationalism in religious subjects influenced, via German-Scottish theologian Johann Joachim Spalding, the German neology school and rational theology, and contributed to the transformation of German theology in the Age of Enlightenment. Hume pioneered a comparative history of religion, tried to explain various rites and traditions as being based on deception and challenged various aspects of rational and natural theology, such as the argument from design.Danish theologian and philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard adopted \"Hume's suggestion that the role of reason is not to make us wise but to reveal our ignorance,\" though taking it as a reason for the necessity of religious faith, or fideism. The \"fact that Christianity is contrary to reason\u2026is the necessary precondition for true faith.\" Political theorist Isaiah Berlin, who has also pointed out the similarities between the arguments of Hume and Kierkegaard against rational theology, has written about Hume's influence on what Berlin calls the counter-Enlightenment and on German anti-rationalism. Berlin has also once said of Hume that \"no man has influenced the history of philosophy to a deeper or more disturbing degree.\"In 2003, philosopher Jerry Fodor described Hume's Treatise as \"the founding document of cognitive science.\"Hume engaged with contemporary intellectuals including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, James Boswell, and Adam Smith (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his economics and political philosophy).\nMorris and Brown (2019) write that Hume is \"generally regarded as one of the most important philosophers to write in English.\"In September 2020, the David Hume Tower, a University of Edinburgh building, was renamed to 40 George Square; this was following a campaign led by students of the university to rename it, in objection to Hume's writings related to race.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A statue in Neyland in Pembrokeshire in Wales was stolen in August 2010. The topmast of the Great Eastern is used as a flagpole at the entrance to Anfield, Liverpool Football Club's ground. Contemporary locations bear Brunel's name, such as Brunel University in London, shopping centres in Swindon and also Bletchley, Milton Keynes, and a collection of streets in Exeter: Isambard Terrace, Kingdom Mews, and Brunel Close. A road, car park, and school in his home city of Portsmouth are also named in his honour, along with one of the city's largest public houses. There is an engineering lab building at the University of Plymouth named in his honour.A public poll conducted by the BBC in 2001 to select the 100 Greatest Britons, Brunel was placed second, behind Winston Churchill. Brunel's life and works have been depicted in numerous books, films and television programs. The 2003 book and BBC TV series Seven Wonders of the Industrial World included a dramatisation of the building of the Great Eastern.\nMany of Brunel's bridges are still in use. Brunel's first engineering project, the Thames Tunnel, is now part of the London Overground network. The Brunel Engine House at Rotherhithe, which once housed the steam engines that powered the tunnel pumps, now houses the Brunel Museum dedicated to the work and lives of Henry Marc and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Many of Brunel's original papers and designs are now held in the Brunel Institute alongside the SS Great Britain in Bristol, and are freely available for researchers and visitors.Brunel is credited with turning the town of Swindon into one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe during the 19th century. Brunel's choice to locate the Great Western Railway locomotive sheds there caused a need for housing for the workers, which in turn gave Brunel the impetus to build hospitals, churches and housing estates in what is known today as the 'Railway Village'. According to some sources, Brunel's addition of a Mechanics Institute for recreation and hospitals and clinics for his workers gave Aneurin Bevan the basis for the creation of the National Health Service.\nGWR Castle Class steam locomotive no. 5069 was named Isambard Kingdom Brunel, after the engineer; and BR Western Region class 47 diesel locomotive no. D1662 (later 47484) was also named Isambard Kingdom Brunel. GWR's successor Great Western Railway has named both its old InterCity 125 power car 43003 and new InterCity Electric Train 800004 as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.The Royal Mint struck two \u00a32 coins in 2006 to \"celebrate the 200th anniversary of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his achievements\". The first depicts Brunel with a section of the Royal Albert Bridge and the second shows the roof of Paddington Station. In the same year the Post Office issued a set of six wide commemorative stamps (SG 2607-12) showing the Royal Albert Bridge, the Box Tunnel, Paddington Station, the Great Eastern, the Clifton Suspension Bridge, and the Maidenhead Bridge.The words \"I.K. BRUNEL ENGINEER 1859\" were fixed to either end of the Royal Albert Bridge to commemorate his death in 1859, the year the bridge opened. The words were later partly obscured by maintenance access ladders but were revealed again by Network Rail in 2006 to honour his bicentenary.Brunel was the subject of Great, a 1975 animated film directed by Bob Godfrey. It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 48th Academy Awards in March 1976.At the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, Brunel was portrayed by Kenneth Branagh in a segment showing the Industrial Revolution.Brunel is a central character in Howard Rodman's novel The Great Eastern, published in 2019 by Melville House Publishing.", "hasanswer": false}]}

That fell through as he had allegedly a prior deal for another game under the auspices of the Sega Genesis platform. Boon and Tobias eventually decided to create a character named Johnny Cage, who is modelled after Van Damme, primarily from Van Damme's appearance and outfit in the martial arts film Bloodsport. In the German version of the Donkey Kong 64 website, DK's greatest hero is Jean-Claude Van Kong.American professional wrestler Robert Alexander Szatkowski was given his ring name \"Rob Van Dam\" in 1992 by Ron Slinker, a promoter in Florida, possibly because of his martial arts experience and his resemblance to Van Damme.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was the youngest person elected Privatdozent in the university's history. He began writing nearly one major mathematics paper per month. In 1929, he briefly became a Privatdozent at the University of Hamburg, where the prospects of becoming a tenured professor were better, then in October of that year moved to Princeton University as a visiting lecturer in mathematical physics.Von Neumann was baptized a Catholic in 1930. Shortly afterward, he married Marietta K\u00f6vesi, who had studied economics at Budapest University. Von Neumann and Marietta had a daughter, Marina, born in 1935; she would become a professor. The couple divorced on November 2, 1937. On November 17, 1938, von Neumann married Klara Dan.In 1933 Von Neumann accepted a tenured professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study in New Jersey, when that institution's plan to appoint Hermann Weyl appeared to have failed. His mother, brothers and in-laws followed von Neumann to the United States in 1939. Von Neumann anglicized his name to John, keeping the German-aristocratic surname von Neumann. Von Neumann became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1937, and immediately tried to become a lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Officers Reserve Corps. He passed the exams but was rejected because of his age.Klara and John von Neumann were socially active within the local academic community. His white clapboard house on Westcott Road was one of Princeton's largest private residences. He always wore formal suits. He enjoyed Yiddish and \"off-color\" humor. In Princeton, he received complaints for playing extremely loud German march music; Von Neumann did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments. Per Churchill Eisenhart, von Neumann could attend parties until the early hours of the morning and then deliver a lecture at 8:30.He was known for always being happy to provide others of all ability levels with scientific and mathematical advice. Wigner wrote that he perhaps supervised more work (in a casual sense) than any other modern mathematician. His daughter wrote that he was very concerned with his legacy in two aspects: her life and the durability of his intellectual contributions to the world.Many considered him an excellent chairman of committees, deferring rather easily on personal or organizational matters but pressing on technical ones. Herbert York described the many \"Von Neumann Committees\" that he participated in as \"remarkable in style as well as output\". The way the committees von Neumann chaired worked directly and intimately with the necessary military or corporate entities became a blueprint for all Air Force long-range missile programs. Many people who had known von Neumann were puzzled by his relationship to the military and to power structures in general. Stanis\u0142aw Ulam suspected that he had a hidden admiration for people or organizations that could influence the thoughts and decision making of others.He also maintained his knowledge of languages learnt in his youth. He knew Hungarian, French, German and English fluently, and maintained a conversational level of Italian, Yiddish, Latin and Ancient Greek. His Spanish was less perfect. He had a passion for and encyclopedic knowledge of ancient history, and he enjoyed reading Ancient Greek historians in the original Greek. Ulam suspected they may have shaped his views on how future events could play out and how human nature and society worked in general.Von Neumann's closest friend in the United States was the mathematician Stanis\u0142aw Ulam. Von Neumann believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively; he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved and know the answer upon waking up. Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more aural. Ulam recalled, \"Quite independently of his liking for abstract wit, he had a strong appreciation (one might say almost a hunger) for the more earthy type of comedy and humor\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Some of this animosity appears to have come from Clampett's perceived \"golden boy\" status at the studio (Clampett's mother was said to be a close friend of cartoon producer Leon Schlesinger), which allowed him to ignore studio rules that everyone else was expected to follow. In addition, Mel Blanc, the voice actor who worked with Clampett at the same studio for ten years, also accused Clampett of being an \"egotist who took credit for everything.\"Beginning with a magazine article in 1946, shortly after he left the studio, Clampett repeatedly referred to himself as \"the creator\" of Bugs Bunny, often adding the side-note that he used Clark Gable's carrot-eating scene in It Happened One Night as inspiration for his \"creation\". (Clampett can be observed making this claim in Bugs Bunny: Superstar.) The other two directorial fathers Bugs is claimed to have had are Tex Avery, who directed A Wild Hare, his first official short; and Robert McKimson, who drew the definitive Bugs Bunny model sheet. Depending on the source, Bugs' primary creator could be either Jones or Freleng. Some argue that, based on a viewing of the early Bugs cartoons of the late 1930s and early 1940s, the character was not \"created\" by one director, but evolved in personality, voice, and design over several years through the collective efforts of Clampett, Avery, Jones, Freleng, McKimson, Mel Blanc, Cal Dalton, Ben Hardaway and Bob Givens. In Bugs Bunny: Superstar, Clampett also takes credit for drawing the model sheet for the first Porky Pig cartoon, I Haven't Got a Hat (1935), even though it was actually drawn by Friz Freleng.Animation historian Milton Gray details the long and bitter rivalry between Clampett and Jones in his essay \"Bob Clampett Remembered\". Gray, a personal friend of Clampett, calls the controversy \"a deliberate and vicious smear campaign by one of Bob's rivals in the cartoon business\". He reveals that Jones was angry at Clampett for making some generalizations in his 1970 interview with Funnyworld that gave Clampett too much credit, including taking sole credit for not only Bugs and Daffy but also Jones's Sniffles character and Freleng's Yosemite Sam. He writes that Jones began making additional accusations against Clampett, such as that Clampett would \"go around the studio at night, looking at other directors' storyboards for ideas he could steal for his own cartoons.\" Jones wrote a letter of accusations in 1975 and, according to Gray, distributed copies to every fan he met\u2014seemingly the genesis of the growing controversy. Gray asserts that Clampett was a \"kind, generous man [who was] deeply hurt and saddened by Jones's accusations. [\u2026] I feel that Bob Clampett deserves tremendous respect and gratitude for the wonderful work that he left us.\" Other Warner Bros. peers, such as musical coordinator Carl Stalling and animator Tex Avery, stood by Clampett during his talks on the animation industry in the 1960s and 1970s.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He signed humorous and imaginative sketches as \"Josh\" until 1863. Additionally, he used the pen name \"Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass\" for a series of humorous letters.He maintained that his primary pen name came from his years working on Mississippi riverboats, where two fathoms, a depth indicating water safe for the passage of boat, was a measure on the sounding line. Twain is an archaic term for \"two\", as in \"The veil of the temple was rent in twain.\" The riverboatman's cry was \"mark twain\" or, more fully, \"by the mark twain\", meaning \"according to the mark [on the line], [the depth is] two [fathoms]\"; that is, \"The water is 12 feet (3.7 m) deep and it is safe to pass.\"\nTwain said that his famous pen name was not entirely his invention. In Life on the Mississippi, he wrote:\n\nCaptain Isaiah Sellers was not of literary turn or capacity, but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river, and sign them \"MARK TWAIN\", and give them to the New Orleans Picayune. They related to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate and valuable; ... At the time that the telegraph brought the news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new journalist, and needed a nom de guerre; so I confiscated the ancient mariner's discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands \u2013 a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; how I have succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.\nTwain's story about his pen name has been questioned by some, with the suggestion that \"mark twain\" refers to a running bar tab that Twain would regularly incur while drinking at John Piper's saloon in Virginia City, Nevada. Samuel Clemens himself responded to this suggestion by saying, \"Mark Twain was the nom de plume of one Captain Isaiah Sellers, who used to write river news over it for the New Orleans Picayune. He died in 1863 and as he could no longer need that signature, I laid violent hands upon it without asking permission of the proprietor's remains. That is the history of the nom de plume I bear.\"\nIn his autobiography, Twain writes further of Captain Sellers' use of \"Mark Twain\": I was a cub pilot on the Mississippi River then, and one day I wrote a rude and crude satire which was leveled at Captain Isaiah Sellers, the oldest steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River, and the most respected, esteemed, and revered. For many years he had occasionally written brief paragraphs concerning the river and the changes which it had undergone under his observation during fifty years, and had signed these paragraphs \"Mark Twain\" and published them in the St. Louis and New Orleans journals. In my satire I made rude game of his reminiscences. It was a shabby poor performance, but I didn't know it, and the pilots didn't know it. The pilots thought it was brilliant. They were jealous of Sellers, because when the gray-heads among them pleased their vanity by detailing in the hearing of the younger craftsmen marvels which they had seen in the long ago on the river, Sellers was always likely to step in at the psychological moment and snuff them out with wonders of his own which made their small marvels look pale and sick. However, I have told all about this in \"Old Times on the Mississippi.\" The pilots handed my extravagant satire to a river reporter, and it was published in the New Orleans True Delta. That poor old Captain Sellers was deeply wounded. He had never been held up to ridicule before; he was sensitive, and he never got over the hurt which I had wantonly and stupidly inflicted upon his dignity. I was proud of my performance for a while, and considered it quite wonderful, but I have changed my opinion of it long ago. Sellers never published another paragraph nor ever used his nom de guerre again.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He was the first of two children of Jacob Leonard Kubrick (May 21, 1902 \u2013 October 19, 1985), known as Jack or Jacques, and his wife Sadie Gertrude Kubrick (n\u00e9e Perveler; October 28, 1903 \u2013 April 23, 1985), known as Gert. His sister Barbara Mary Kubrick was born in May 1934. Jack, whose parents and paternal grandparents were of Polish-Jewish and Romanian-Jewish origin, was a homeopathic doctor, graduating from the New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1927, the same year he married Kubrick's mother, who was the child of Austrian-Jewish immigrants. On December 27, 1899, Kubrick's great-grandfather Hersh Kubrick arrived at Ellis Island via Liverpool by ship at the age of 47, leaving behind his wife and two grown children (one of whom was Stanley's grandfather Elias) to start a new life with a younger woman. Elias followed in 1902. At Stanley's birth, the Kubricks lived in the Bronx. His parents married in a Jewish ceremony, but Kubrick was not raised religious and later professed an atheistic view of the universe. His father was a physician and, by the standards of the West Bronx, the family was fairly wealthy.Soon after his sister's birth, Kubrick began schooling in Public School 3 in the Bronx and moved to Public School 90 in June 1938. His IQ was discovered to be above average but his attendance was poor. He displayed an interest in literature from a young age and began reading Greek and Roman myths and the fables of the Grimm brothers, which \"instilled in him a lifelong affinity with Europe\". He spent most Saturdays during the summer watching the New York Yankees and later photographed two boys watching the game in an assignment for Look magazine to emulate his own childhood excitement with baseball. When Kubrick was 12, his father Jack taught him chess. The game remained a lifelong interest of Kubrick's, appearing in many of his films. Kubrick, who later became a member of the United States Chess Federation, explained that chess helped him develop \"patience and discipline\" in making decisions. When Kubrick was 13, his father bought him a Graflex camera, triggering a fascination with still photography. He befriended a neighbor, Marvin Traub, who shared his passion for photography. Traub had his own darkroom where he and the young Kubrick would spend many hours perusing photographs and watching the chemicals \"magically make images on photographic paper\". The two indulged in numerous photographic projects for which they roamed the streets looking for interesting subjects to capture and spent time in local cinemas studying films. Freelance photographer Weegee (Arthur Fellig) had a considerable influence on Kubrick's development as a photographer; Kubrick later hired Fellig as the special stills photographer for Dr. Strangelove (1964). As a teenager, Kubrick was also interested in jazz and briefly attempted a career as a drummer.Kubrick attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. He joined the school's photography club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine. He was a mediocre student, with a 67/D+ grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945 but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated any hope of higher education. Later in life Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve the excellence in school of which he knew Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the family library at home, while permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the 18th century, it was acquired by Sir Charles Pratt, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and later Lord Chancellor, who in 1765 was elevated to the peerage with the title Baron Camden, of Camden Place. In 1786 he was created Earl Camden, and in 1812 his son became Marquess Camden.

He was the oldest of four children, having two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich. Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Euler family moved from Basel to the town of Riehen, Switzerland, where his father became pastor in the local church and Leonhard spent most of his childhood.From a young age, Euler received schooling in mathematics from his father, who had taken courses from Jacob Bernoulli some years earlier at the University of Basel. Around the age of eight, Euler was sent to live at his maternal grandmother's house and enrolled in the Latin school in Basel. In addition, he received private tutoring from Johannes Burckhardt, a young theologian with a keen interest in mathematics.In 1720, at thirteen years of age, Euler enrolled at the University of Basel. Attending university at such a young age was not unusual at the time. The course on elementary mathematics was given by Johann Bernoulli, the younger brother of the deceased Jacob Bernoulli (who had taught Euler's father). Johann Bernoulli and Euler soon got to know each other better. Euler described Bernoulli in his autobiography:\n\"the famous professor Johann Bernoulli [...] made it a special pleasure for himself to help me along in the mathematical sciences. Private lessons, however, he refused because of his busy schedule. However, he gave me a far more salutary advice, which consisted in myself getting a hold of some of the more difficult mathematical books and working through them with great diligence, and should I encounter some objections or difficulties, he offered me free access to him every Saturday afternoon, and he was gracious enough to comment on the collected difficulties, which was done with such a desired advantage that, when he resolved one of my objections, ten others at once disappeared, which certainly is the best method of making happy progress in the mathematical sciences.\"It was during this time that Euler, backed by Bernoulli, obtained his father's consent to become a mathematician instead of a pastor.In 1723, Euler received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Isaac Newton. Afterwards, he enrolled in the theological faculty of the University of Basel.In 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the propagation of sound with the title De Sono with which he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a position at the University of Basel. In 1727, he entered the Paris Academy prize competition (offered annually and later biennially by the academy beginning in 1720) for the first time. The problem posed that year was to find the best way to place the masts on a ship. Pierre Bouguer, who became known as \"the father of naval architecture\", won and Euler took second place.

This place is too cold. Keeper smells. Boring, boring, boring.\" in the elephant enclosure.\nIn 2004, he placed the piece Banksus Militus Ratus into London's Natural History Museum.\nIn March 2005, he placed subverted artworks in the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan as well as the Brooklyn Museum in Brooklyn.\nIn May 2005 Banksy's version of a primitive cave painting depicting a human figure hunting wildlife while pushing a shopping trolley was hung in gallery 49 of the British Museum, London.\nIn August 2005, Banksy painted nine images on the Israeli West Bank barrier, including an image of a ladder going up and over the wall and an image of children digging a hole through the wall.\nIn October 2005, Banksy designed six station IDs for Nickelodeon.\nIn April 2006, Banksy created a sculpture based on a crumpled red phone box with a pickaxe in its side, apparently bleeding, and placed it in a side street in Soho, London. It was later removed by Westminster Council.\nIn June 2006, Banksy created Well Hung Lover, an image of a naked man hanging out of a bedroom window on a wall visible from Park Street in central Bristol. The image sparked \"a heated debate\", with the Bristol City Council leaving it up to the public to decide whether it should stay or go. After an internet discussion in which 97% of the 500 people surveyed supported the stencil, the city council decided it would be left on the building. The mural was later defaced with blue paint.\nIn August/September 2006, Banksy placed up to 500 copies of Paris Hilton's debut CD, Paris, in 48 different UK record stores with his own cover art and remixes by Danger Mouse. Music tracks were given titles such as \"Why Am I Famous?\", \"What Have I Done?\" and \"What Am I For?\". Several copies of the CD were purchased by the public before stores were able to remove them, some going on to be sold for as much as \u00a3750 on online auction websites such as eBay. The cover art depicted Hilton digitally altered to appear topless. Other pictures feature her with her chihuahua Tinkerbell's head replacing her own, and one of her stepping out of a luxury car, edited to include a group of homeless people, which included the caption \"90% of success is just showing up.\"\nIn September 2006, Banksy dressed an inflatable doll in the manner of a Guantanamo Bay detainment camp prisoner (orange jumpsuit, black hood, and handcuffs) and then placed the figure within the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California.\nHe makes stickers (the Neighbourhood Watch subvert) and was responsible for the cover art of Blur's 2003 album Think Tank.\nIn September 2007, Banksy covered a wall in Portobello Road with a French artist painting graffiti of Banksy's name.\nA guard/police officer with a balloon animal was painted in the Canadian city of Toronto in 2010, and has since been removed from its original location and preserved.\nIn July 2012, in the run up to the London 2012 Olympic games he created several pieces based upon this event. One included an image of an athlete throwing a missile instead of a javelin, evidently taking a poke at the surface to air missile sites positioned in the Stratford area to defend the games.\nIn April 2014, he created a piece in Cheltenham, near the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) headquarters, which depicts three men wearing sunglasses and using listening devices to \"snoop\" on a telephone box, evidently criticising the recent global surveillance disclosures of 2013. This was only confirmed by Banksy as his work later in June 2014. This piece 'disappeared' on 20 August 2016 during renovations to the building it was on, and may have been destroyed.\nIn June 2016, a 14 ft painting of a child with a stick chasing a burning tyre was found in the Bridge Farm Primary School in Bristol with a letter from Banksy thanking the school for naming one of its houses after him. BBC News reported that a spokesman for Banksy confirmed that the artwork was genuine. In the letter, Banksy wrote that if the members of the school did not like the painting, they should add their own elements.\nIn May 2017, Banksy claimed the authorship of a giant Brexit mural, painted on a house in Dover (Kent).\nBanksy's Dream Boat, originally made for the Dismaland exhibition, was donated to the NGO Help Refugees (now called Choose Love) to help raise funds for the charity. The artwork was displayed in Help Refugees' London Choose Love pop-up shop in the run-up to Christmas 2018, and members of the public could pay \u00a32.00 to enter a competition to guess the weight of the piece.

Although it is impossible to verify the truth of this statement, there is every reason to believe that Lully was in a hurry when writing this opera.  In effect, the opera reuses the interm\u00e8des from Moli\u00e8re's play.  Since these interm\u00e8des had met with such spectacular success seven years earlier, Lully must have felt that given his lack of time, he could at the very least attract a crowd with the promise of reviving the plainte italienne and the final divertissement.\nAll that was required was a synthesis of Moli\u00e8re's play (Moli\u00e8re had died in 1673) that could coherently string together the existent interm\u00e8des. Such a text would have to be one third the length of the original \u2014 that is, 600 rather than 1800 lines long \u2014 and composed in varied rimes and rhythms rather than the alexandrines in riming couplets used in spoken declamation. Lully's usual librettist, Philippe Quinault, was inconveniently in disgrace at court over his previous opera Isis, and so the task fell to Thomas Corneille, likely at the bidding of the same cabal that had sought to disgrace Quinault.\nWhether by choice or of necessity Corneille's text emerged not as a synthesis of the Moli\u00e8re but rather as a different plot for a profoundly different genre. Corneille's nephew, Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, is believed to have collaborated; it is impossible to know to what extent. No anecdote speaking of Psych\u00e9 mentions Fontenelle. Nevertheless the latter placed the libretto among his complete works without mention of his uncle.

One of the more dispassionate analyses of Lampi\u00e3o concluded that, if he was a hero, he was an anarchist hero who forged a prominent place for himself in a society and political environment where people put their own interests above all other considerations.In 1957 the songs associated with Lampi\u00e3o's bandits were recorded, as \"Cantigas de Lampi\u00e3o\".\nJoan Baez recorded a version of \"Mulher Rendeira\", renamed \"O Cangaceiro\", on her album Joan Baez/5 \u2013 released in October 1964.

It was Voltaire's largest ever work of literary criticism. Voltaire's proposal to the Acad\u00e9mie described Corneille as doing for the French language what Homer had done for Greek: showing the world that it could be a medium for great art. Voltaire was driven to defend classic French literature in the face of increasingly popular foreign influences such as William Shakespeare. This is reflected in the first edition of the Commentaires, published in 1764, which focused on Corneille's better works and had relatively muted criticisms. By the second edition, published ten years later, Voltaire had come to a more negative assessment of Corneille and a stronger view on the need for objective criticism. He added five hundred critical notes, covering more works and taking a more negative tone.\nCritics' opinions of Corneille were already highly polarised. Voltaire's intervention polarised the debate further and some critics saw his criticisms as pedantic and driven by envy. In the 19th century, the tide of opinion turned against Voltaire. Napoleon expressed a preference for Corneille over Voltaire, reviving the former's reputation as a dramatist while diminishing the latter's.In Episode 31 of the 1989 video lecture series, \u201cThe Western Tradition\u201d, UCLA Professor Eugen Weber offers further commentary on Mssr. Corneille's work:\n\"But remember that Corneille\u2019s plays were directed to an aristocracy that couldn\u2019t be touched by sermons, by moralizing, by sentimentalism. So he touched them by showing the greatness of self-discipline and self-denial, of not doing what you want, but what you should do. And note that Corneille didn\u2019t say, as a Christian would, that doing your duty makes you good, he said that doing your duty makes you great. When Corneille presented the struggle between passion and duty, it wasn\u2019t a new invention. What was new in Corneille was that he showed one legitimate passion opposed to another passion that was equally legitimate. It was important to elevate the debate from a contest between right and wrong to a contest between two rights. Because a gentleman who got into a fight could not admit that he was wrong, but if you started by stipulating that his motives were honorable, he would at least stop to consider your argument, which is what Corneille achieved by raising the debate to a higher plane. And the seventeenth-century people who loved his adventure stories felt vaguely that they were getting in them something they hadn\u2019t quite known before. And they were right. They hadn\u2019t known it before for the simple reason that it had gone out with the Greeks. Roman thought was too legalistic, Christian thought was too simplistic to tolerate the idea that there could be two rights, that there could be two sides to a conflict. This is a very sophisticated view, and it is only fit for very sophisticated minds. And the tiny minority of the seventeenth-century society that read Corneille, that saw Corneille\u2019s plays, was hardly very sophisticated, but it was beginning to try at least.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He did not have a middle name, but many accounts erroneously give him the middle name \"Alexander\"; this error probably arose because his son Cornelius McGillicuddy Jr. took Alexander as his confirmation name. As with many Irish immigrants whose names began with \"Mc\", the McGillicuddys were often referred to as \"Mack\", except for official and legal documents. His parents, Michael McGillicuddy and Mary McKillop, were both immigrants from Ireland. Michael was from Killarney in County Kerry, and Mary from the Catholic section of Belfast. Michael\u2019s father was named Cornelius McGillicuddy, and by tradition, the family named at least one son in each generation Cornelius. \"Connie\" is a common nickname for Cornelius, so Cornelius McGillicuddy was called \"Connie Mack\" from an early age. Connie Mack never legally changed his name; on the occasion of his second marriage at age 48, he signed the wedding register as \"Cornelius McGillicuddy\". His nickname on the baseball field was \"Slats\", for his height of 6 feet 2 inches and thin build.Mack's father became a wheelwright. During the American Civil War, he served with the 51st Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Michael McGillicuddy suffered from several ailments as the result of his military service; he was able to work only infrequently and drew a disability pension.Mack was educated in East Brookfield, and began working summers in local cotton mills at age 9 to help support his family. He quit school after completing the eighth grade at age 14, intending to work full-time to contribute to the family's support, as several of his siblings had done. He clerked at a store, worked on local farms, and worked on the production lines of the shoe factories in nearby towns.Mack was also a good athlete and frequently played baseball and some of its predecessor games with local players in East Brookfield. In 1879 his skills landed him a place on East Brookfield's town team, which played other town teams in the area. Though younger than his teammates by several years, Mack was the team's catcher and de facto captain.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Starting in the 1950s, he composed hundreds of pop songs, many in collaboration with lyricist Hal David. Bacharach's music is characterized by unusual chord progressions and time signature changes, influenced by his background in jazz, and uncommon selections of instruments for small orchestras. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output.\nOver 1,000 different artists have recorded Bacharach's songs. From 1961 to 1972, most of Bacharach and David's hits were written specifically for and performed by Dionne Warwick, but earlier associations (from 1957 to 1963) saw the composing duo work with Marty Robbins, Perry Como, Gene McDaniels, and Jerry Butler. Following the initial success of these collaborations, Bacharach wrote hits for singers such as Gene Pitney, Cilla Black, Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones, and B.J. Thomas.\nBacharach wrote seventy-three U.S. and fifty-two UK Top 40 hits. Those that topped the Billboard Hot 100 include \"This Guy's in Love with You\" (Herb Alpert, 1968), \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\" (Thomas, 1969), \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" (the Carpenters, 1970), \"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\" (Christopher Cross, 1981), \"That's What Friends Are For\" (Warwick, 1986), and \"On My Own\" (Carole Bayer Sager, 1986). His accolades include six Grammy Awards, three Academy Awards, and one Emmy Award.\nBacharach is described by writer William Farina as \"a composer whose venerable name can be linked with just about every other prominent musical artist of his era\"; in later years, his songs were newly appropriated for the soundtracks of major feature films, by which time \"tributes, compilations, and revivals were to be found everywhere\". A significant figure in easy listening, he influenced later musical movements such as chamber pop and Shibuya-kei. In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Bacharach and David at number 32 for their list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. In 2012, the duo received the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, the first time the honor has been given to a songwriting team.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "106_332", "question": "What was Giuseppe Guarneri's occupation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_32009", "text": "The most illustrious member of the house of Guarneri, Bartolomeo was the son of Giuseppe Giovanni Battista, thus the grandson of Andrea Guarneri, both noted violin makers themselves. Andrea learned his trade as an apprentice of Nicol\u00f2 Amati, to whom Stradivari was also apprenticed. Undoubtedly, Giuseppe learned the craft of violinmaking in his father's shop.\nGiuseppe Guarneri's style has been widely copied by luthiers since the 19th century. Guarneri's career is a great contrast to that of Stradivari, who was stylistically consistent, very careful about craftsmanship and finish, and evolved the design of his instruments in a deliberate way over seven decades. Guarneri's career was short, from the late 1720s until his death in 1744. Initially he was thought to be a man of restless creativity, judging by his constant experimentation with f-holes, arching, thicknesses of the top and back and other design details. However, what has become clear is that, like other members of his family, he was so commercially overshadowed by his illustrious and business-savvy neighbor, Antonio Stradivari, that he was unable to command prices commensurate with his rival, hence needed to make more instruments and work hastily. Indeed, two of the five violin makers of the Guarneri family, the two Pietros\u2014of different generations\u2014left Cremona, the first for Mantua, the second for Venice, apparently because business prospects in Cremona were so stunted by the presence of Stradivari. From the 1720s until about 1737, Guarneri's work is quick and accurate, although he was not overly concerned with quality of finish. However, from the late 1730s until his death, his work shows increasing haste and lack of patience with the time needed to achieve a high quality finish. Some of his late violins from circa 1742 to 1744 have scrolls that can be crudely carved, the purfling hastily inserted, the f-holes unsymmetrical and jagged.Nonetheless, many of these late violins, in spite of the seeming haste and carelessness of their construction, possess a glorious tone and have been much coveted by soloists. His output falls off rather dramatically in the late 1730s, and the eccentricity of the works following that period gave rise to the romantic notion that he had been imprisoned for killing a rival violin maker (actually it was one of the Lavazza brothers in Milan to whom this occurred), and even the unlikely fiction that he made violins in prison. Such stories were invented during the nineteenth century and were repeated by the biographers of the Guarneri family, the Hills, in their 1931 work; while the Hills did not take them at face-value (this is an understatement borderline misrepresentative  of what the Hills wrote p89 of The Violin-Makers of the Guarneri Family (1626\u20131762): Their Life and Work,  they treat those stories as \"gossip\" \"pretty legend\" by \"Cozio embroidered by Fetis\" \"superficial and inaccurate\" ) , it did feed into their idea that Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 must have been temperamental and mercurial, rather than simply overworked and commercially unsuccessful (p.91 of The Violin-Makers of the Guarneri Family (1626\u20131762): Their Life and Work  the Hills state that  IF you were to trust the stories gathered from the last  Bergonzi (not the one from Cozio) them you would have a reasonable explanation ). More recent data shows that business was so bad during the later period of his life that he had to relegate violin-making to the sideline and earn his living as an innkeeper (refuting the \"prison\" myth). (source missing !)   \n\nIt has also become known that some of the violins emanating from his shop and bearing his label were actually the work of his German wife, Katarina Rota, who apparently returned to Germany after her husband's death in 1744. While every other member of his family, the Stradivari family, Nicol\u00f2 Amati, and a peculiarly large number of makers, lived long lives\u2014Stradivari living and working to age 93\u2014Guarneri died at only 46. There is thus the possibility that the odd qualities of finish in his later instruments\u2014ironically, those most highly prized and expensive\u2014were due not only to stress and haste but also to encroaching illness. It is also worth noting that the tone of both Stradivari and Guarneri did not come into their own until late in the 18th century, that the high-built instruments of Amati and Stainer were the only ones prized during the 18th century. While it is true that players, then as now, preferred old instruments, Stradivari made one of the handsomest livings of all violin makers during his lifetime. It is also customary to conflate Stradivari and Guarneri in this regard, but even the Hills hinted that such was not the case in their styles, the Guarneri always bearing traces of Amati, and even Stainer, the latter Stradivari \"would have none of.\" Moreover, Guarneri's instruments were recognized by a world-class soloist three decades before Stradivari's were likewise championed; by the 1750s, Gaetano Pugnani is known to have acquired and preferred a Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 violin, but it is not until the 1780s that his pupil, Giovanni Battista Viotti, became an advocate of Stradivari instruments. Of course, Pugnani's advocacy is usually forgotten when Niccol\u00f2 Paganini became the most noted Giuseppe Guarneri player three generations later.\nAccomplished violinists such as\nSalvatore Accardo, \nSarah Chang, Nikki Chooi,\nTimothy Chooi,\nKyung-wha Chung, \nEugene Fodor,\nAugustin Hadelich, \nJascha Heifetz,\nYi-Jia Susanne Hou,\nJoseph Joachim, \nLeila Josefowicz, \nNigel Kennedy, \nLeonid Kogan, \nHenning Kraggerud, \nFritz Kreisler, \nGidon Kremer, \nYang Liu,\nKerson Leong,\nRobert McDuffie,Anne Akiko Meyers, \nMidori, \nElmar Oliveira, \nRuth Palmer, \nItzhak Perlman, \nRachel Barton Pine, \nMaud Powell, \nMichael Rabin,\nAaron Rosand,\nCharlie Siem, \nMarie Soldat, \nIsaac Stern, \nHenryk Szeryng,\nArve Tellefsen,\nRichard Tognetti, \nUto Ughi, \nHenri Vieuxtemps, \nTianwa Yang,\nEug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe,\nZvi Zeitlin,  \nand Pinchas Zukerman, have used Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 violins at one point in their career or even exclusively.\nVirtuoso Niccol\u00f2 Paganini's favorite violin, Il Cannone Guarnerius of 1743, and the Lord Wilton of 1742, once owned by Yehudi Menuhin, are del Ges\u00f9 instruments.

His elder brother was Pierre Renoir, a French stage and film actor, and his younger brother Claude Renoir (1901\u20131969) had a brief career in the film industry, mostly assisting on a few of Jean's films. Jean Renoir was also the uncle of Claude Renoir (1913\u20131993), the son of Pierre, a cinematographer who worked with Jean Renoir on several of his films.\nRenoir was largely raised by Gabrielle Renard, his nanny and his mother's cousin, with whom he developed a strong bond. Shortly before his birth, she had come to live with the Renoir family. She introduced the young boy to the Guignol puppet shows in Montmartre, which influenced his later film career. He wrote in his 1974 memoirs My Life and My Films, \"She taught me to see the face behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes. She taught me to detest the clich\u00e9.\" Gabrielle was also fascinated by the new early motion pictures, and when Renoir was only a few years old she took him to see his first film.\nAs a child, Renoir moved to the south of France with his family. He and the rest of the Renoir family were the subjects of many of his father's paintings. His father's financial success ensured that the young Renoir was educated at fashionable boarding schools, from which, as he later wrote, he frequently ran away.At the outbreak of World War I, Renoir was serving in the French cavalry. Later, after receiving a bullet in his leg, he served as a reconnaissance pilot. His leg injury left him with a permanent limp, but allowed him to develop his interest in the cinema, since he recuperated with his leg elevated while watching films, including the works of Charlie Chaplin, D.W.

{"id": "106_337", "question": "What was Taliesin's occupation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_32027", "text": "More detailed traditions of Taliesin's biography arose from about the 11th century, and in Historia Taliesin (\"The Tale of Taliesin\", surviving from the 16th century). In the mid-16th-century, Elis Gruffydd recorded a legendary account of Taliesin that resembles the story of the boyhood of the Irish hero Fionn mac Cumhail and the salmon of wisdom in some respects. The tale was also recorded in a slightly different version by John Jones of Gellilyfdy (c. 1607). This story agrees in many respects with fragmentary accounts in the Book of Taliesin.\nAccording to the Hanes Taliesin, he was originally known as Gwion Bach ap Gwreang. He was a servant of Cerridwen and was made to stir the Cauldron of Inspiration for one year to allow for Cerridwen to complete her potion of inspiration. The potion was initially intended for her son, Morfran, who although was considered frightfully ugly, she loved nonetheless, and felt that if he would not grow in beauty then he should have the gift of the Awen to compensate. Upon completion of this potion, three drops sprang out and landed upon Gwion Bach's thumb. Gwion then placed his thumb in his mouth to soothe his burns resulting in Gwion's enlightenment. Out of fear of what Cerridwen would do to him, Gwion fled and eventually transformed into a piece of grain before being consumed by Cerridwen. However, this resulted in Cerridwen becoming impregnated with the seed and upon giving birth, she could not bring herself to kill the baby Gwion. She instead cast him into the ocean in a large leather bag, where he was found by Elffin, who named him Taliesin.According to these texts Taliesin was the foster-son of Elffin ap Gwyddno, who gave him the name Taliesin, meaning \"radiant brow\", and who later became a king in Ceredigion, Wales. The legend states that he was then raised at his court in Aberdyfi and that at the age of 13, he visited King Maelgwn Gwynedd, Elffin's uncle, and correctly prophesied the manner and imminence of Maelgwn's death. A number of medieval poems attributed to Taliesin allude to the legend but these postdate the historical poet's floruit considerably.\nThe introduction to Gwyneth Lewis and Rowan Williams's translation of The Book of Taliesin suggests that later Welsh writers came to see Taliesin as a sort of shamanic figure. The poetry ascribed to him in this collection shows how he not only can channel other entities (such as the Awen) in these poems, but that the authors of these poems can in turn channel Taliesin himself in creating the poems that they ascribe to him. This creates a collectivist, rather than individualistic, sense of identity; no human is simply one human, humans are part of nature (rather than opposed to it), and all things in the cosmos can ultimately be seen to be connected through the creative spirit of the Awen. \nThe idea that he was a bard at the court of King Arthur dates back at least to the tale of Culhwch and Olwen, perhaps a product of the 11th century. It is elaborated upon in modern English poetry, such as Tennyson's Idylls of the King and Charles Williams' Taliessin Through Logres. But the historical Taliesin's career can be shown to have fallen in the last half of the 6th century, while historians who argue for Arthur's existence date his victory at Mons Badonicus in the years on either side of AD 500; the Annales Cambriae offer the date of c. 539 for his death or disappearance in the Battle of Camlann, only a few years earlier than the date of 542 found in the Historia Regum Britanniae. Taliesin also appears as a companion of Bran the Blessed in this era, by which time he was clearly perceived as a legendary figure who existed in many different times.\nA manuscript in the hand of 18th-century literary forger Iolo Morganwg claimed he was the son of Saint Henwg of Llanhennock; but this is contrary to other tradition. In it he is said to have been educated in the school of Catwg, at Llanfeithin, in Glamorgan, which the historian Gildas also attended. Captured as a youth by Irish pirates while fishing at sea, he is said to have escaped by using a wooden buckler for a boat; he landed at the fishing weir of Elffin, one of the sons of Urien (all medieval Welsh sources, however, make Elffin the son of Gwyddno Garanhir). Urien made him Elffin's instructor, and gave Taliesin an estate. But once introduced to the court of the warrior-chief Taliesin became his foremost bard, followed him in his wars, and wrote of his victories.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Often considered to be one of the greatest songwriters in history, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture over his 60-year career. He rose to prominence in the 1960s, when his songs \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. Initially modeling his style on Woody Guthrie's folk songs, Robert Johnson's blues, and what he called the \"architectural forms\" of Hank Williams's country songs, Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the folk music of the early 1960s, infusing it \"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry\". His lyrics incorporated political, social, and philosophical influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.Dylan was born and raised in St. Louis County, Minnesota. Following his self-titled debut album of traditional folk songs in 1962, he made his breakthrough with The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan the next year. The album features \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" which, like many of his early songs, adapted the tunes and phrasing of older folk songs. He released the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964.  In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy among folk purists when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most influential rock albums of the 1960s: Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited (both 1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966). When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to rock, the mix became more complex. His six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.In July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were later released as The Basement Tapes in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes on John Wesley Harding (1967), Nashville Skyline (1969) and New Morning (1970). In 1975, he released Blood on the Tracks, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released three albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's Time Out of Mind (1997) marked the beginning of a career renaissance. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since, most recently Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020). He also recorded a trilogy of  albums covering the Great American Songbook, especially songs sung by Frank Sinatra, and an album smoothing his early rock material into a mellower Americana sensibility, Shadow Kingdom (2023). Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the Never Ending Tour.Since 1994, Dylan has published nine books of paintings and drawings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 145 million records, making him one of the best-selling musicians ever. He has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize Board awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\" In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.\"", "hasanswer": true}]}

Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Fantastic Four #52 (July 1966) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, and he is depicted as the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, expertise in his nation's traditions, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies.\nBlack Panther is the first protagonist of African descent in mainstream American comics, having debuted years before early black superheroes such as Marvel Comics' the Falcon (1969), Luke Cage (1972), and Blade (1973) or DC Comics' John Stewart in the role of Green Lantern (1971). In one comic book storyline, the Black Panther mantle is handled by Kasper Cole, a multiracial New York City police officer. Beginning as an impersonator, Cole would later take on the moniker of White Tiger and become an ally to T'Challa. The role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda was also given to T'Challa's sister Shuri while he was in a coma for a short time.\nBlack Panther has made numerous appearances in various television shows, animated films, and video games. Chadwick Boseman portrayed T'Challa in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's films: Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), and posthumously voiced alternate versions of the character in the first season of the animated series What If...?

His influence extends across the entire range of contemporary philosophical topics, from metaphysical issues in epistemology and ontology, to political philosophy, the philosophy of history, philosophy of art, philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy.\nBorn in 1770 in Stuttgart, Holy Roman Empire, during the transitional period between the Enlightenment and the Romantic movement in the Germanic regions of Europe, Hegel lived through and was influenced by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. His fame rests chiefly upon The Phenomenology of Spirit, The Science of Logic, his teleological account of history, and his lectures at the University of Berlin on topics from his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences.\nThroughout his work, Hegel strove to address and correct the problematic dualisms of modern philosophy, Kantian and otherwise, typically by drawing upon the resources of ancient philosophy, particularly Aristotle. Hegel everywhere insists that reason and freedom are historical achievements, not natural givens. His dialectical-speculative procedure is grounded in the principle of immanence, that is, in assessing claims always according to their own internal criteria. Taking skepticism seriously, he contends that people cannot presume any truths that have not passed the test of experience; even the a priori categories of the Logic must attain their \"verification\" in the natural world and the historical accomplishments of humankind.\nGuided by the Delphic imperative to \"know thyself\", Hegel presents free self-determination as the essence of humankind \u2013 a conclusion from his 1806\u201307 Phenomenology that he claims is further verified by the systematic account of the interdependence of logic, nature, and spirit in his later Encyclopedia. He asserts that the Logic at once preserves and overcomes the dualisms of the material and the mental \u2013 that is, it accounts for both the continuity and difference marking the domains of nature and culture \u2013 as a metaphysically necessary and coherent \"identity of identity and non-identity\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

He attended the University of Vienna and the University of Basel, a scholarly center of Renaissance humanism. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in Glarus and later in Einsiedeln, where he was influenced by the writings of Erasmus.\nIn 1519, Zwingli became the Leutpriester (people's priest) of the Grossm\u00fcnster in Z\u00fcrich where he began to preach ideas on reform of the Catholic Church. In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the custom of fasting during Lent. In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of images in places of worship. Among his most notable contributions to the Reformation was his expository preaching, starting in 1519, through the Gospel of Matthew, before eventually using Biblical exegesis to go through the entire New Testament, a radical departure from the Catholic mass. In 1525, he introduced a new communion liturgy to replace the Mass. He also clashed with the Anabaptists, which resulted in their persecution. Historians have debated whether or not he turned Z\u00fcrich into a theocracy.The Reformation spread to other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several cantons resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war was averted at the last moment between the two sides. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and agreed on many points of doctrine, but they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.\nIn 1531, Zwingli's alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons. The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Z\u00fcrich was ill-prepared, and Zwingli died on the battlefield. His legacy lives on in the confessions, liturgy, and church orders of the Reformed churches of today.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "106_361", "question": "What is Vince Guaraldi's occupation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_32121", "text": "A book-length biography of Guaraldi was published in March 2012. Vince Guaraldi at the Piano, by author and Guaraldi archivist Derrick Bang, chronicles Guaraldi's career and role in the Northern California jazz scene, and also includes a complete discography and filmography, as well as an appendix of quotations from Guaraldi's former sidemen.Jazz musician David Benoit has often credited Guaraldi and the Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack for his interest in jazz. In 1985, Benoit recorded a cover of Guaraldi's \"Linus and Lucy\" for an album called This Side Up, which enjoyed considerable radio airplay and helped launch the smooth jazz genre. He released \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\" on the album Waiting for Spring in 1989.New Age pianist George Winston released a Guaraldi tribute album in 1996 titled Linus and Lucy: The Music of Vince Guaraldi. Winston performed many Peanuts songs that had not been released by Guaraldi. \"I love his melodies and his chord progressions\", Winston said of Guaraldi. \"He has a really personal way of doing voicings. His music is part of our culture and we know it even if we don\u2019t know Vince. He had three bags: the Latin, the Peanuts, and the impressionistic 'Cast Your Fate to the Wind' stuff. And those three bags are all his.\" The album was very successful, leading Winston to record a follow-up, titled Love Will Come: The Music of Vince Guaraldi, Volume 2, released in early 2010. A third volume, entitled Count the Ways: The Music of Vince Guaraldi, Volume 3, remains unreleased.Mendelson reflected on Guaraldi's contribution to the Peanuts franchise when Winston released his two tribute albums, saying \"Several generations have now grown up with Vince Guaraldi's music. If people hear just one or two bass notes of the intro to 'Linus and Lucy', they cheer. The Peanuts programs and Vince's music were such a wonderful marriage. It's a shame it got cut off so soon, but people like George are perpetuating it, for which we are very appreciative.\"In 2003, Guaraldi's son David began working to secure the necessary licenses to distribute some of his father's previously unreleased material. The first release, The Charlie Brown Suite & Other Favorites, featured an archived 1969 live performance of the seven-part \"Charlie Brown Suite\". Other releases include Oaxaca (2004), North Beach (2006), Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials, Volumes 1 (2007) and 2 (2008), Live on the Air (2008) and An Afternoon with the Vince Guaraldi Quartet (2011).In 2010, a two-hour documentary entitled The Anatomy of Vince Guaraldi was screened at a variety of jazz and film festivals. The documentary highlighted newly discovered and restored footage of Guaraldi's appearances and recording sessions and featured new performances and insights from Winston, Dave Brubeck, Dick Gregory, Jon Hendricks, Leonard Maltin, Paul Krassner and surviving Guaraldi sidemen Eddie Duran, Dean Reilly, and Jerry Granelli. The documentary was co-produced by Toby Gleason (son of Ralph J. Gleason) and filmmaker Andrew Thomas. The Anatomy of Vince Guaraldi was the recipient of five \"Best Documentary\" awards, and was a special presentation at the Library of Congress and Monterey Jazz Festival. Gleason commented, \"let's just agree that Vince Guaraldi re-invented the sound of the modern American Christmas.\"In the original liner notes for Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown, Ralph J. Gleason praised Guaraldi's Peanuts contributions, noting, \"The hardest task an artist faces is not just to achieve self-expression; that almost comes by definition, even if it's difficult to hone that self-expression into something good enough to be art.\" Gleason continued: \"It is another kind of thing altogether to look at, hear, feel and experience somebody else's artistic expression and then make something of your own which shows empathy, which relates to the other but which still has your own individual artistic stamp. That is what Vince Guaraldi achieved with his scores for Charlie Brown. He took his inspiration from the creations of Charles Schulz and made music that reflects that inspiration, is empathetic with the image and is still solidly and unmistakably Vince Guaraldi.\"In his review of The Definitive Vince Guaraldi (2009), All About Jazz critic David Rickert credited Guaraldi for introducing many to the world of jazz music \"before we even knew what it was. [Guaraldi]'s soundtracks for the Peanuts television specials were a novel idea in cartoon scoring, yet seemed to perfectly fit the deceptively sophisticated adventures of Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang. His originals were some of the best jazz to come from the West Coast scene and a tribute to what can happen when a great muse hits a gifted composer.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

His brother Miguel de Jasso (later known as Miguel de Javier) became Lord of Xavier and Idoc\u00edn at the death of his parents (a direct ancestor of the Counts of Javier). Basque and Romance were his two mother tongues.\nIn 1512, Ferdinand, King of Aragon and regent of Castile, invaded Navarre, initiating a war that lasted over 18 years. Three years later, Francis's father died when Francis was only nine years old. In 1516, Francis's brothers participated in a failed Navarrese-French attempt to expel the Spanish invaders from the kingdom. The Spanish Governor, Cardinal Cisneros, confiscated the family lands, demolished the outer wall, the gates, and two towers of the family castle, and filled in the moat. In addition, the height of the keep was reduced by half. Only the family residence inside the castle was left. In 1522, one of Francis's brothers participated with 200 Navarrese nobles in dogged but failed resistance against the Castilian Count of Miranda in Amaiur, Baztan, the last Navarrese territorial position south of the Pyrenees.\nIn 1525, Francis went to study in Paris at the Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe, University of Paris, where he spent the next eleven years. In the early days he acquired some reputation as an athlete and a high-jumper.In 1529, Francis shared lodgings with his friend Pierre Favre. A new student, Ignatius of Loyola, came to room with them. At 38, Ignatius was much older than Pierre and Francis, who were both 23 at the time. Ignatius convinced Pierre to become a priest, but was unable to convince Francis, who had aspirations of worldly advancement. At first, Francis regarded the new lodger as a joke and was sarcastic about his efforts to convert students.

According to most biographies Ignatius is said to have posed the question: \"What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\" However, according to James Broderick such method is not characteristic of Ignatius and there is no evidence that he employed it at all.In 1530, Francis received the degree of Master of Arts, and afterwards taught Aristotelian philosophy at Beauvais College, University of Paris.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, from scattered references to M\u0101dhava found in diverse manuscripts, historians of Kerala school have pieced together informations about the mathematician. In a manuscript preserved in the Oriental Institute, Baroda, Madhava has been referred to as M\u0101dhavan v\u0113\u1e47v\u0101r\u014dh\u0101d\u012bn\u0101m kartt\u0101 ... M\u0101dhavan Ila\u00f1\u00f1ippa\u1e37\u1e37i Empr\u0101n. It has been noted that the epithet 'Empr\u0101n' refers to the  Empr\u0101ntiri community, to which Madhava might have belonged to.The term \"Ila\u00f1\u00f1ippa\u1e37\u1e37i\" has been identified as a reference to the residence of M\u0101dhava. This is corroborated by M\u0101dhava himself. In his short work on the moon's positions titled Ve\u1e47v\u0101roha, M\u0101dhava says that he was born in a house named baku\u1e37\u0101dhi\u1e63\u1e6dhita . . . vih\u0101ra. This is clearly Sanskrit for Ila\u00f1\u00f1ippa\u1e37\u1e37i. Ila\u00f1\u00f1i is the Malayalam name of the evergreen tree  Mimusops elengi and the Sanskrit name for the same is Baku\u1e37a. Palli is a term for village. The Sanskrit house name baku\u1e37\u0101dhi\u1e63\u1e6dhita . . . vih\u0101ra has also been interpreted as a reference to the Malayalam house name Ira\u00f1\u00f1i ninna ppa\u1e37\u1e37i and some historians have tried to identify it with one of two currently existing houses with names Iri\u00f1\u00f1anava\u1e37\u1e37i and Iri\u00f1\u00f1\u0101rapa\u1e37\u1e37i both of which are located near Irinjalakuda town in central Kerala. This identification is far fetched because both names have neither phonetic similarity nor semantic equivalence to the word \"Ila\u00f1\u00f1ippa\u1e37\u1e37i\".Most of the writers of astronomical and mathematical works who lived after Madhava's period have referred to Madhava as \"Sangamagrama Madhava\" and as such it is important that the real import of the word \"Sangamagrama\" be made clear. The general view among many scholars is that Sangamagrama is the town of Irinjalakuda some 70 kilometers south of the Nila river and about 70 kilometers south of Cochin. It seems that there is not much concrete ground for this belief except perhaps the fact that the presiding deity of an early medieval temple in the town, the Koodalmanikyam Temple, is worshiped as Sangameswara meaning the Lord of the Samgama and so Samgamagrama can be interpreted as the village of Samgameswara. But there are several places in Karnataka with samgama or its equivalent k\u016b\u1e0dala in their names and with a temple dedicated to Samgam\u1e17svara, the lord of the confluence. (Kudalasangama in Bagalkot district is one such place with a celebrated temple dedicated to the Lord of the Samgama.)There is a small town on the southern banks of the Nila river, around 10 kilometers upstream from Tirunavaya, called K\u016b\u1e0dall\u016br. The exact literal Sanskrit translation of this place name is Samgamagram: k\u016b\u1e6dal in Malayalam means a confluence (which in Sanskrit is samgama) and \u016br means a village (which in Sanskrit is grama). Also the place is at the confluence of the Nila river and its most important tributary, namely, the Kunti river. (There is no confluence of rivers near Irinjalakuada.) Incidentally there is still existing a Nambudiri (Malayali Brahmin) family by name K\u016btall\u016br Mana a few kilometers away from the Kudallur village. The family has its origins in Kudallur village itself. For many generations this family hosted a great Gurukulam specialising in Vedanga. That the only available manuscript of Sphu\u1e6dacandr\u0101pti, a book authored by Madhava, was obtained from the manuscript collection of K\u016btall\u016br Mana might strengthen the conjecture that Madhava might have had some association with K\u016btall\u016br Mana. Thus the most plausible possibility is that the forefathers of Madhava migrated from the Tulu land or thereabouts to settle in Kudallur village, which is situated on the southern banks of the Nila river not far from Tirunnavaya, a generation or two before his birth and lived in a house known as Ila\u00f1\u00f1ippa\u1e37\u1e37i whose present identity is unknown.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His political and religious teachings were well known in Magna Graecia and influenced the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and, through them, the West in general. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend. Modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to Croton in southern Italy, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle. This lifestyle entailed a number of dietary prohibitions, traditionally said to have included aspects of vegetarianism.The teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is metempsychosis, or the \"transmigration of souls\", which holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body. He may have also devised the doctrine of musica universalis, which holds that the planets move according to mathematical equations and thus resonate to produce an inaudible symphony of music. Scholars debate whether Pythagoras developed the numerological and musical teachings attributed to him, or if those teachings were developed by his later followers, particularly Philolaus of Croton. Following Croton's decisive victory over Sybaris in around 510 BC, Pythagoras's followers came into conflict with supporters of democracy, and Pythagorean meeting houses were burned. Pythagoras may have been killed during this persecution, or he may have escaped to Metapontum and died there.\nIn antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries, including the Pythagorean theorem, Pythagorean tuning, the five regular solids, the Theory of Proportions, the sphericity of the Earth, and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher (\"lover of wisdom\") and that he was the first to divide the globe into five climatic zones. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or natural philosophy.\nPythagoras influenced Plato, whose dialogues, especially his Timaeus, exhibit Pythagorean teachings. Pythagorean ideas on mathematical perfection also impacted ancient Greek art. His teachings underwent a major revival in the first century BC among Middle Platonists, coinciding with the rise of Neopythagoreanism. Pythagoras continued to be regarded as a great philosopher throughout the Middle Ages and his philosophy had a major impact on scientists such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton. Pythagorean symbolism was used throughout early modern European esotericism, and his teachings as portrayed in Ovid's Metamorphoses influenced the modern vegetarian movement.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as \"a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality\" and called on \"God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums.\" Spears addressed the outcry, commenting: \"What's the big deal? I have strong morals. ... I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time.\" Shortly prior, Spears had announced publicly she would remain abstinent until marriage.An early criticism of Spears dismissed her as a \"manufactured pop star, the product of a Swedish songwriting factory that had no real hand in either her music or her persona\", which Vox editor Constance Grady assesses as being perpetuated from the fact that Spears debuted in the late 1990s, when music was dominated by rockism, that prizes \"so-called authenticity and grittiness of rock above all else\". Spears' \"slick, breezy pop was an affront to rockist sensibilities, and claiming that Spears was fake was an easy way to dismiss her.\" Ron Levy for Rolling Stone noted that \"I have to tell you, if the record company could have created more than one Britney Spears, they would have done it, and they tried!\"Billboard opined that, by the time Spears released her sophomore album Oops!... I Did It Again, \"There was a shift occurring in both the music and her public image: She was sharper, sexier and singing about more grown-up fare, setting the stage for 2001's Britney, which shed her innocent skin and ushered her into adulthood.\" Britney's lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and its music video were also credited for distancing her from her previous \"wholesome bubblegum star\" image. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic remarked, \"If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman.\" Erlewine likened Spears to fellow singer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated \"maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs\". Brittany Spanos of LA Weekly stated that Spears \"set the bar for the 'adulthood' transition teen pop stars often struggle with\".Spears' erratic behavior and personal problems during 2006\u20132008 were highly publicized and affected both her career and public image. Erlewine reflected on this period of her life, stating that \"each new disaster [was] stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image\". In a 2008 article, Rolling Stone's Vanessa Grigoriadis described her much-publicized personal issues as \"the most public downfall of any star in history\". Spears later received favorable media attention; Billboard wrote that her appearance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards \"was a picture of professionalism and poise\" after her \"disastrous\" performance the previous year, while Business Insider ran an article on how she had \"lost control of her life ... and then made an incredible career comeback\". In 2017, Spears said: \"I think I had to give myself more breaks through my career and take responsibility for my mental health. ... I wrote back then, that I was lost and didn't know what to do with myself. I was trying to please everyone around me because that's who I am deep inside. There are moments where I look back and think: 'What the hell was I thinking?'\"In September 2002, Spears was placed at number eight on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list.

She said: \"Your stories are what inspire me, bring me joy, and make me and my sons strive to be better people.\" Manuel Betancourt of Vice wrote about the \"queer adoration\", especially of gay men, on Spears, and said that \"Where other gay icons exude self-possession, Spears' fragile resilience has made her an even more fascinating role model, closer to Judy Garland than to Lady Gaga ... she's a glittering mirror ball, a fractured reflection of those men on the dance floor back onto themselves.\" HuffPost's Ben Appel attributed Spears' status as a gay icon to \"her oh-so-innocent/\"not that innocent\" Monroe-like sensuality, her sweet, almost saccharine nature, her beyond basic but addictive pop songs, her dance moves, her phoenix-out-of-the-fire comeback from a series of mental health crises, and her unmistakable tenderness.

Bush and the Iraq War, saying that \"we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes ... and be faithful in what happens\". Michael Moore included the footage of Spears' answer in his \"anti-Bush\" documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, which, according to The Washington Times's James Frazier, presented her \"as an example of a naive American blindly trusting a dishonest commander in chief\" and fueled the \"urban legend\" of a \"conservative\" Spears. Frazier also said that \"the few positions she has taken can hardly be considered conservative\", such as supporting same-sex marriage. In 2016, Spears posted pictures of a meeting with Hillary Clinton on social media. She described Clinton as \"an inspiration and [a] beautiful voice for women around the world\".In December 2017, Spears publicly showed support for the DREAM Act in the wake of the announcement that Donald Trump would end the DACA policy, which previously granted undocumented immigrants who came to the country as minors a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation.

Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid stated: \"There are barely any words to describe my grief over the loss of Chris Cornell...His impact as a singer, songwriter and guitarist will be felt for generations to come.\"\nPearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said of Cornell: I've always said that Chris was the greatest songwriter to ever come out of Seattle. Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to at different points in our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that's part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there's not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do a lot of different things with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness.\nFollowing his death, the sales and streams of Cornell's discography grew by more than 550% from the week prior to his death. On platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora, his songs were streamed 32.5 million times during the week in which he died. The charting week prior to that, his tracks were played 5 million times. That same week, 38,000 copies of Cornell albums were sold, which represented a 1,700% gain in purchases; the week before his death, only 2,000 units were sold.On August 10, 2020, Nile Rodgers and Merck Mercuriadis's company Hipgnosis Songs Fund acquired 100% of Cornell's catalog of song rights (241 songs), including the Soundgarden catalog.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As a forerunner of the Age of Reason, Spinoza significantly influenced modern biblical criticism, 17th-century Rationalism, and contemporary conceptions of the self and the universe, establishing himself as one of the most important and radical philosophers of the early modern period. He was influenced by Stoicism, Maimonides, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, and a variety of heterodox Christian thinkers of his day.Spinoza was born in Amsterdam to a marrano family that had left the Iberian Peninsula for a more tolerant Amsterdam. He had a traditional education for a Jewish boy, learning Hebrew and studying the sacred texts. He was part of the wealthy Portuguese Jewish community, where his merchant immigrant father was a prominent member. As a young man, Spinoza was permanently expelled from the Jewish community for defying rabbinic authorities and disputing Jewish beliefs. After his expulsion in 1656, he did not affiliate with any religion, instead focusing on philosophical study. He had a dedicated clandestine circle of supporters, a philosophical sect, who met to discuss the writings he shared with them in his lifetime, and, immediately following his death, rescued his unpublished writings for posterity.Spinoza challenged the divine origin of the Hebrew Bible, the nature of God, and the earthly power wielded by religious authorities, Jewish and Christian alike. He was frequently called an atheist by contemporaries, although nowhere in his work does Spinoza argue against the existence of God. This can be explained by the fact that, unlike contemporary 21st-century scholars, \u201cwhen seventeenth-century readers accused Spinoza of atheism, they usually meant that he challenged doctrinal orthodoxy, particularly on moral issues, and not that he denied God\u2019s existence.\" His theological studies were inseparable from his thinking on politics; he is grouped with Hobbes, John Locke, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Immanuel Kant, who \"helped establish the genre of political writing called secular theology.\"Spinoza's philosophy encompasses nearly every area of philosophical discourse, including metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, ethics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science. With an enduring reputation as one of the most original and influential thinkers of the seventeenth century, Rebecca Goldstein dubbed him \"the renegade Jew who gave us modernity.\"", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "106_391", "question": "What is the occupation of Ted Bundy?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_32253", "text": "Shortly after the conclusion of the Leach trial and the beginning of the long appeals process that followed, Bundy initiated a series of interviews with Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth. Speaking mostly in third person to avoid \"the stigma of confession\", he began for the first time to divulge details of his crimes and thought processes. Bundy recounted his career as a thief, confirming Kloepfer's long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned. \"The big payoff for me,\" he said, \"was actually possessing whatever it was I had stolen. I really enjoyed having something ... that I had wanted and gone out and taken.\" Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well. Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to \"totally possess\" his victims. At first, he killed his victims \"as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [being] caught\"; but later, murder became part of the \"adventure\". \"The ultimate possession was, in fact, the taking of the life\", he said. \"And then ... the physical possession of the remains.\"Bundy also confided in Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. Hagmaier was struck by the \"deep, almost mystical satisfaction\" that Bundy took in murder. \"He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence\", Hagmaier related. \"It becomes possession. They are part of you ... [the victim] becomes a part of you, and you [two] are forever one ... and the grounds where you kill them or leave them become sacred to you, and you will always be drawn back to them.\" Bundy told Hagmaier that he considered himself to be an \"amateur\", an \"impulsive\" killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his \"prime\" or \"predator\" phase at about the time of Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974\u2014although he never explicitly admitted having done so.\nIn July 1984, prison guards found two hacksaw blades hidden in Bundy's cell. A steel bar in one of the cell's windows had been sawed completely through at the top and bottom and glued back into place with a homemade soap-based adhesive. Several months later, guards found an unauthorized mirror, and Bundy was moved to a different cell. Shortly thereafter, he was charged with a disciplinary infraction for unauthorized correspondence with another high-profile criminal, John Hinckley Jr.In October 1984, Bundy contacted Keppel and offered to share his self-proclaimed expertise in serial killer psychology in the ongoing hunt in Washington for the \"Green River Killer\", later identified as Gary Ridgway. Keppel and Green River Task Force Detective Dave Reichert interviewed Bundy, but Ridgway remained at large for a further seventeen years. Keppel published a detailed documentation of the Green River interviews, and later collaborated with Michaud on another examination of the interview material.In early 1986, an execution date (March 4) was set on the Chi Omega convictions; the U.S. Supreme Court issued a brief stay, but the execution was quickly rescheduled. In April, shortly after the new date (July 2) was announced, Bundy finally confessed to Hagmaier and Nelson what they believed was the full range of his depredations, including details of what he did to some of his victims after their deaths. He told them that he revisited Taylor Mountain, Issaquah, and other secondary crime scenes, often several times, to lie with his victims and perform sexual acts with their bodies until putrefaction forced him to stop. In some cases, he drove for several hours each way and remained the entire night. In Utah, he applied makeup to Smith's lifeless face, and repeatedly washed Aime's hair. \"If you've got time,\" he told Hagmaier, \"they can be anything you want them to be.\" He decapitated approximately twelve of his victims with a hacksaw, and kept at least one group of severed heads\u2014probably the four later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball and Healy)\u2014in his apartment for a period of time before disposing of them.Less than fifteen hours before the scheduled July 2 execution, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals stayed it indefinitely and remanded the Chi Omega case for review on multiple technicalities\u2014including Bundy's mental competency to stand trial and an erroneous instruction by the trial judge during the penalty phase requiring the jury to break a 6\u20136 tie between life imprisonment and the death penalty\u2014which, ultimately, were never resolved. A new date (November 18) was then set to carry out the Leach sentence; the Eleventh Circuit Court issued a stay on November 17. In mid-1988, the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Bundy, and in December the Supreme Court denied a motion to review the ruling over the dissents of Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. Within hours of that final denial, a firm execution date of January 24, 1989, was announced. Bundy's journey through the appeals courts had been unusually rapid for a capital murder case: \"Contrary to popular belief, the courts moved Bundy as fast as they could ... Even the prosecutors acknowledged that Bundy's lawyers never employed delaying tactics. Though people everywhere seethed at the apparent delay in executing the archdemon, Ted Bundy was actually on the fast track.\"With all appeal avenues exhausted and no further motivation to deny his crimes, Bundy agreed to speak frankly with investigators. He confessed to Keppel that he had committed all eight of the Washington and Oregon homicides for which he was the prime suspect. He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify if indeed he ever knew their identities. He said he left a fifth corpse\u2014Manson's\u2014on Taylor Mountain, but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace. \"He described the Issaquah crime scene [where the bones of Ott, Naslund, and Hawkins were found], and it was almost like he was just there\", Keppel said. \"Like he was seeing everything. He was infatuated with the idea because he spent so much time there. He is just totally consumed with murder all the time.\" Nelson's impressions were similar: \"It was the absolute misogyny of his crimes that stunned me,\" she wrote, \"his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments.\"Bundy confessed to detectives from Idaho, Utah, and Colorado that he had committed numerous additional homicides, including several that were unknown to the police. He explained that when he was in Utah he could bring his victims back to his apartment, \"where he could reenact scenarios depicted on the covers of detective magazines.\" A new ulterior strategy quickly became apparent: he withheld many details, hoping to parlay the incomplete information into yet another stay of execution. \"There are other buried remains in Colorado\", he admitted, but refused to elaborate. The new strategy\u2014immediately dubbed \"Ted's bones-for-time scheme\"\u2014served only to deepen the resolve of authorities to see Bundy executed on schedule, and yielded little new detailed information. In cases where he did give details, nothing was found. Colorado Detective Matt Lindvall interpreted this as a conflict between his desire to postpone his execution by divulging information and his need to remain in \"total possession\u2014the only person who knew his victims' true resting places.\"When it became clear that no further stays would be forthcoming from the courts, Bundy supporters began lobbying for the only remaining option, executive clemency. Diana Weiner, a young Florida attorney and Bundy's last purported love interest, asked the families of several Colorado and Utah victims to petition Florida Governor Bob Martinez for a postponement to give Bundy time to reveal more information. All refused. \"The families already believed that the victims were dead and that Ted had killed them\", wrote Nelson. \"They didn't need his confession.\" Martinez made it clear that he would not agree to further delays in any case. \"We are not going to have the system manipulated\", he told reporters. \"For him to be negotiating for his life over the bodies of victims is despicable.\"Boone had championed Bundy's innocence throughout all of his trials and felt \"deeply betrayed\" by his admission that he was, in fact, guilty. She moved back to Washington with her daughter and refused to accept his phone call on the morning of his execution. \"She was hurt by his relationship with Diana [Weiner],\" Nelson wrote, \"and devastated by his sudden wholesale confessions in his last days.\" Hagmaier was present during Bundy's final interviews with investigators. On the eve of his execution, he talked of suicide. \"He did not want to give the state the satisfaction of watching him die\", Hagmaier said.Bundy was executed in the Raiford electric chair at 7:16 a.m. EST on Tuesday, January 24, 1989. His last words were directed at his attorney Jim Coleman and Methodist minister Fred Lawrence: \"Jim and Fred, I'd like you to give my love to my family and friends.\" Hundreds of revelers sang, danced and set off fireworks in a pasture across from the prison as the execution was carried out, then cheered as the white hearse containing Bundy's corpse departed the prison. He was cremated in Gainesville, and his ashes scattered at an undisclosed location in the Cascade Range of Washington State, in accordance with his will.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When Moses starts to approach, God tells Moses to take off his sandals first due to the place being a sacred space.The voice from the bush, which later self-discloses as Yahweh, reveals himself as \"the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob\" and thus Moses hides his face.\nSome Old Testament scholars regard the account of the burning bush as being spliced together from the Yahwist and Elohist texts, with the angel of Yahweh and the removal of sandals being part of the Yahwist version, and the Elohist's parallels to these being God and the turning away of Moses's face, respectively.The text portrays Yahweh as telling Moses that he is sending him to Pharaoh to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, an action that Yahweh decided upon as a result of noticing that the Israelites were being oppressed by the Egyptians. Yahweh tells Moses to tell the elders of the Israelites that Yahweh would lead them into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, a region generally referred to as a whole by the term Canaan; this is described as being a land of \"milk and honey\".Moses asks \"When I come to the Israelites and say to them, \u2018The God of your fathers has sent me to you,\u2019 and they ask me, \u2018What is His name?\u2019 what shall I say to them?\u201d (Ex 3:13) The voice of God from the bush reveals that he is Yahweh. The text derives Yahweh (\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4\u200e) from the Hebrew word \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 ([ha\u02c8ja]) in the phrase \u05d0\u05b6\u05d4\u05b0\u05d9\u05b6\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b2\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05e8 \u05d0\u05b6\u05d4\u05b0\u05d9\u05b6\u05d4 \"I Am that I Am\".\nAccording to the narrative, Yahweh instructs Moses to confront the Egyptians and Israelites and briefs the prophet on what is to take place. Yahweh then performs various demonstrative miracles in order to bolster Moses's credibility. Among other things, his staff was transmuted into a snake, Moses's hand was temporarily afflicted with \"snowy tzaraath\", and water was transmuted into blood. In the text, Yahweh instructs Moses to take a staff in his hands to perform miracles with it, as if it is a staff given to him rather than his own; some textual scholars propose that this latter instruction is the Elohist's version of the more detailed earlier description, where Moses uses his staff, which they attribute to the Yahwist.Despite the signs, Moses is described as being very reluctant to take on the role, arguing that he lacked eloquence and that someone else should be sent instead; in the text, Yahweh reacts by angrily rebuking Moses for presuming to lecture the one who made the mouth on who was qualified to speak and not to speak. Yet Yahweh concedes and allows Aaron to be sent to assist Moses since Aaron is eloquent and already on his way to meet Moses.

The difference between a denomination and a denominational family is sometimes unclear to outsiders. Some denominational families can be considered major branches. Groups that are members of a branch, while sharing historical ties and similar doctrines, are not necessarily in communion with one another.\nThere were some movements considered heresies by the early Church which do not exist today and are not generally referred to as denominations. Examples include the Gnostics (who had believed in an esoteric dualism called gnosis), the Ebionites (who denied the divinity of Jesus), and the Arians (who subordinated the Son to the Father by denying the pre-existence of Christ, thus placing Jesus as a created being), Bogumilism and Bosnian Church.

In 1978, the Toei Company created a theatrical spin-off of their Spider-Man television series, with Shinji Tod\u014d reprising his role as Takuya Yamashiro / Spider-Man. None of these films had a theatrical release in the United States.\nBy 1999, Sony Pictures Entertainment had acquired the motion picture rights to the character for cinema and TV, creating two Spider-Man animated TV series, and two film series comprising their own continuities: the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy of films (2002\u20132007) starring Tobey Maguire as the character, and the Marc Webb Amazing Spider-Man films (2012\u20132014) starring Andrew Garfield in the role.\nIn February 2015, Disney, Marvel Studios, and Sony made a deal to share the Spider-Man film rights, leading to a new iteration of Spider-Man being introduced and integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Al-Tabari (310/923) provides the typical accounts for Islamic traditions regarding Isaiah. He is listed among the prophets in the book of salawat Dalail al-Khayrat. He is further mentioned and accepted as a prophet by other Islamic scholars such as ibn Kathir, Abu Ishaq al-Tha'labi and al-Kisa'i and also modern scholars such as Muhammad Asad and Abdullah Yusuf Ali.According to Muslim scholars, Isaiah prophesied the coming of Jesus and Muhammad, although the reference to Muhammad is disputed by other religious scholars. Isaiah's narrative in Islamic literature can be divided into three sections. The first establishes Isaiah as a prophet of Judea during the reign of Hezekiah; the second relates Isaiah's actions during the siege of Jerusalem in 597 BC by Sennacherib; and the third warns the nation of coming doom. Paralleling the Hebrew Bible, Islamic tradition states that Hezekiah was king in Jerusalem during Isaiah's time. Hezekiah heard and obeyed Isaiah's advice, but could not quell the turbulence in Israel. This tradition maintains that Hezekiah was a righteous man and that the turbulence worsened after him. After the death of the king, Isaiah told the people not to forsake God, and warned Israel to cease from its persistent sin and disobedience. Muslim tradition maintains that the unrighteous of Judea in their anger sought to kill Isaiah.In a death that resembles that attributed to Isaiah in Lives of the Prophets, Muslim exegesis recounts that Isaiah was martyred by Israelites by being sawn in two.In the courts of al-Ma'mun, the seventh Abbasid caliph, Ali al-Ridha, the great-grandson of Muhammad and prominent scholar of his era, was questioned by the  Exilarch to prove through the Torah that both Jesus and Muhammad were prophets.

One of them was on a donkey and the other was on a camel. Who is the rider of the donkey, and who is the rider of the camel?'\" The Exilarch was unable to answer with certainty. Al-Ridha goes on to state that \"As for the rider of the donkey, he is 'Isa (Jesus); and as for the rider of the camel, he is Muhammad, may Allah bless him and his family.

Digambaras maintain that no difference exists between the teachings of Parshvanatha and Mahavira. According to the \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbaras, Mahavira expanded the scope of Parshvanatha's first four restraints with his ideas on ahimsa (non-violence) and added the fifth monastic vow (celibacy) to the practice of asceticism. Parshvanatha did not require celibacy, and allowed monks to wear simple outer garments. \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara texts such as section 2.15 of the Acharanga Sutra say that Mahavira's parents were followers of Parshvanatha, linking Mahavira to a preexisting theology as a reformer of Jain mendicant tradition.\nAccording to the \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara tradition, Parshvanatha and the ascetic community he founded exercised a fourfold restraint; Mahavira stipulated five great vows for his ascetic initiation. This difference and its reason have often been discussed in \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara texts.The Uttardhyayana Sutra (a \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara text) describes Ke\u015bin D\u0101lbhya as a follower of Parshvanatha and Indrabhuti Gautama as a disciple of Mahavira and discusses which doctrine is true: the fourfold restraint or the five great vows. Gautama says that there are outward differences, and these differences are \"because the moral and intellectual capabilities of the followers of the ford-makers have differed\".According to Wendy Doniger, Parshvanatha allowed monks to wear clothes; Mahavira recommended nude asceticism, a practice which has been a significant difference between the Digambara and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara traditions.According to the \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara texts, Parshvanatha's four restraints were ahimsa, aparigraha (non-possession), asteya (non-stealing) and satya (non-lying). Ancient Buddhist texts (such as the Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta) which mention Jain ideas and Mahavira cite the four restraints, rather than the five vows of later Jain texts. This has led scholars such as Hermann Jacobi to say that when Mahavira and the Buddha met, the Buddhists knew only about the four restraints of the Parshvanatha tradition. Further scholarship suggests a more complex situation, because some of the earliest Jain literature (such as section 1.8.1 of the Acharanga Sutra) connects Mahavira with three restraints: non-violence, non-lying, and non-possession. The \"less than five vows\" view of \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara texts is not accepted by the Digambaras, a tradition whose canonical texts have been lost and who do not accept \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara texts as canonical. Digambaras have a sizable literature, however, which explains their disagreement with \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara interpretations. Prafulla Modi rejects the theory of differences between Parshvanatha's and Mahavira's teachings. Champat Rai Jain writes that \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara texts insist on celibacy for their monks (the fifth vow in Mahavira's teachings), and there must not have been a difference between the teachings of Parshvanatha and Mahavira.Padmanabh Jaini writes that the Digambaras interpret \"fourfold\" as referring \"not to four specific vows\", but to \"four modalities\" (which were adapted by Mahavira into five vows). Western and some Indian scholarship \"has been essentially \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara scholarship\", and has largely ignored Digambara literature related to the controversy about Parshvanatha's and Mahavira's teachings. Paul Dundas writes that medieval Jain literature, such as that by the 9th-century Silanka, suggests that the practices of \"not using another's property without their explicit permission\" and celibacy were interpreted as part of non-possession.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Akhenaten\u2014alongside Cleopatra and Alexander the Great\u2014is among the most often popularized and fictionalized ancient historical figures.On page, Amarna novels most often take one of two forms. They are either a Bildungsroman, focusing on Akhenaten's psychological and moral growth as it relates to establishing Atenism and Akhetaten, as well as his struggles against the Theban Amun cult. Alternatively, his literary depictions focus on the aftermath of his reign and religion. A dividing line also exists between depictions of Akhenaten from before the 1920s and since, when more and more archeological discoveries started to provide artists with material evidence about his life and times. Thus, before the 1920s, Akhenaten had appeared as \"a ghost, a spectral figure\" in art, while since he has become realistic, \"material and tangible\". Examples of the former include the romance novels In the Tombs of the Kings (1910) by Lilian Bagnall\u2014the first appearance by Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti in fiction\u2014and A Wife Out of Egypt (1913) and There Was a King in Egypt (1918) by Norma Lorimer. Examples of the latter include Akhnaton King of Egypt (1924) by Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Joseph and His Brothers (1933\u20131943) by Thomas Mann, Akhnaton (1973) by Agatha Christie, and Akhenaten, Dweller in Truth (1985) by Naguib Mahfouz. Akhenaten also appears in The Egyptian (1945) by Mika Waltari, which was adapted into the movie The Egyptian (1953). In this movie, Akhenaten, portrayed by Michael Wilding, appears to represent Jesus Christ and his followers proto-Christians.A sexualized image of Akhenaten, building on early Western interest in the pharaoh's androgynous depictions, perceived potential homosexuality, and identification with Oedipal storytelling, also influenced modern works of art. The two most notable portrayals are Akenaten (1975), an unfilmed screenplay by Derek Jarman, and Akhnaten (1984), an opera by Philip Glass. Both were influenced by the unproven and scientifically unsupported theories of Immanuel Velikovsky, who equated Oedipus with Akhenaten, although Glass specifically denies his personal belief in Velikovsky's Oedipus theory, or caring about its historical validity, instead being drawn to its potential theatricality.In the 21st century, Akhenaten appeared as an antagonist in comic books and video games. For example, he is the major antagonist in limited comic-book series Marvel: The End (2003). In this series, Akhenaten is abducted by an alien order in the 14th century BC and reappears on modern Earth seeking to restore his kingdom. He is opposed by essentially all of the other superheroes and supervillains in the Marvel comic book universe and is eventually defeated by Thanos. Additionally, Akhenaten appears as the enemy in the Assassin's Creed Origins The Curse of the Pharaohs downloadable content (2017), and must be defeated to remove his curse on Thebes. His afterlife takes the form of 'Aten', a location that draws heavily on the architecture of the city of Amarna.American death metal band Nile depicted Akhenaten's judgement, punishment, and erasure from history at the hands of the pantheon that he replaced with Aten, in the song \"Cast Down the Heretic\", from their 2005 album Annihilation of the Wicked. He was also featured on the cover artwork of their 2009 album, Those Whom the Gods Detest.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and mentoring hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship. Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\".Wright was a pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture and also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his vision for urban planning in the United States. He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other commercial projects. Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware) were integrated into these structures. He wrote several books and numerous articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as \"the greatest American architect of all time\". In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.\nRaised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, and then with Louis Sullivan at Adler & Sullivan.  Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 and established a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: leaving his first wife Catherine \"Kitty\" Tobin for Mamah Cheney  in 1909; the murder of Mamah and her children and others at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914; his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel (m. 1923\u20131927); and his courtship and marriage with Olgivanna Lazovi\u0107 (m. 1928\u20131959).", "hasanswer": true}]}

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation\".Chopin was born in \u017belazowa Wola and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Aurore Dupin (known by her pen name George Sand). A brief and unhappy visit to Mallorca with Sand in 1838\u201339 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39.\nAll of Chopin's compositions feature the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, some chamber music, and 19 songs set to Polish lyrics. His piano pieces are technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin's major piano works include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, the instrumental ballade (which Chopin created as an instrumental genre), \u00e9tudes, impromptus, scherzi, preludes, and sonatas, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish folk music, the classical tradition of Mozart and Schubert, and the atmosphere of the Paris salons, of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, harmony, and musical form, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.\nChopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest celebrities, his indirect association with political insurrection, his high-profile love life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying historical fidelity. Among his many memorials is the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, which was created by the Parliament of Poland to research and promote his life and works. It hosts the International Chopin Piano Competition, a prestigious competition devoted entirely to his works.", "hasanswer": true}]}

In Xuxa Kid, Xuxa would become a 10-year-old girl, similar to what would happen years later in Xuxa em Sonho de Menina (2007). In the story, the young version of the presenter would have the duo Sandy and Junior as their friends. The recordings were planned for September and would be released in December.\nHowever, Globo Filmes decided to veto the participation of the pair because there were already plans to launch a film with the brothers as protagonists, a fact that only came to fruition in 2003. Because of this decision, the story of the film had to be completely changed and the launch of a new film was delayed until March 2001.After the project was canceled, Xuxa was persuaded by her team to make a new film, with a new script, that would rekindle her teen audience, as well as the previous one, and that the idea for a movie for the children's audience would be for next year. His manager then had the idea of making a film that could put musical attractions, just like in the previous one, to attract the adolescent public, that accompanied Xuxa in its TV series Planeta Xuxa. \"In some cases it was possible to sew the musical appearance in the plot, but many entries were due to the invitation made by Marlene in the middle of filming,\" says screenwriter Vivian Perl. Diler Andrade defines the insertions of musical numbers (in a non-musical film) as a \"strategic marriage\" between the cinematographic and phonographic industry. \"We need to repeat the feat of the music industry, which holds 80% of the market, against 20% of foreign artists. Vivian Perl says that Xuxa manager Marlene Mattos put the musical number on the film after conducting research on the most popular groups. The recordings began in September 2000.According to the presenter, the film recounts a little of the story she lived when she spent three months in the United States early in her modeling career. \"It is very difficult to face the lack of your country. We miss everything and have an hour that feels like coming back,\" he said. But it was not only this aspect that Xuxa wanted to show with the film. According to her the intention was to show the glamor that exists in the profession, but at the same time, get very close to reality by showing the difficulties of the career. \"I wanted to gather some of the glamorous life that everyone wants with the difficulties that exist to achieve that dream,\" he said. According to the presenter, being a model, actress and soccer player is the dream of most children. The deduction came from a research in which the production took as a base to realize the film.Xuxa said that the film is not necessarily for the children's audience, but for the family, The team's great pride, according to Xuxa, was to make a film \"that brings an important message to children\". \"We did a research and found that boys want to be football players and girls, models, models and singers. I think it's important that they know that it takes a lot of head not to fall on the bad side of the profession, that has drugs, prostitution.\"The film does not escape the standard of the cinematographic productions of Xuxa, There are no missing musical numbers - which, many times, arise without connection with the plot - and very, merchandising. the groups Harmonia do Samba, As Meninas, Os Travessos, KLB, SNZ and \u00c9 o Tchan: and the singers Deborah Blando and Mauricio Manieri participated in the film. With little script and excesses, the film has excessive merchandising of brands of companies, or recording artists. In the interview, Xuxa, moved, thanks the artists who participated in the movie \"without charging money\", just for the good will to be in the film. The film also has unusual appearances by presenter Ot\u00e1vio Mesquita, singer Leonardo and model Gianne Albertoni. Also present are S\u00edlvia Pfeifer, Claudia Rodrigues and veteran Claudio Corr\u00eaa e Castro. According to Vivian Perl, who wrote the story in partnership with Elizeu Ewald, the musical number serves to \"illustrate a moment of introspection\" of the protagonist.The actors Thiago Lacerda, Marcello Antony and Reynaldo Gianecchini were invited to interpret Ricardo the romantic pair of Xuxa in the film, but neither one of them could accept, and the pepel ended up being interpreted by Luigi Baricelli. The scene of the kiss between Nick and Ray of Light was repeated dozens of times. The interpretation was so intense that at that time some tabloids even published that there was no technical kiss and that Xuxa and Luigi Baricelli would have a love relationship.

Shneur Zalman's other works include a collection of writings on Hasidic thought, and the Shulchan Aruch HaRav, a revised version of the code of Halakha, both of which are studied regularly by followers of Chabad. Shneur Zalman's successors went by last names such as \"Schneuri\" and \"Schneersohn\" (later \"Schneerson\"), signifying their descent from the movement's founder. He is commonly referred to as the \"Old Rebbe\" (Yiddish: \u05d0\u05b7\u05dc\u05d8\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9, romanized: Alter Rebbe or Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05f4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d6\u05e7\u05df, romanized: Admur Hazoken).\nRabbi Dovber Schneuri (1773\u20131827), son of Rabbi Shneur Zalman, led the Chabad movement in the town of Lyubavichi (Lubavitch). His leadership was initially disputed by Rabbi Aaron Halevi of Stroselye, however, Rabbi Dovber was generally recognized as his father's rightful successor, and the movement's leader. Rabbi Dovber published a number of his writings on Hasidic thought, greatly expanding his father's work. He also published some of his father's writings. Many of Rabbi Dovber's works have been subsequently republished by the Chabad movement. He is commonly referred to as the Mitteler Rebbe (Yiddish: \u05de\u05d9\u05d8\u05e2\u05dc\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 'Middle Rabbi', Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05f4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e6\u05e2\u05d9, romanized: Admur Ha'emtzoei).\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (1789\u20131866), a grandson of Rabbi Shneur Zalman and son-in-law of Rabbi Dovber. Following his attempt to persuade the Chabad movement to accept his brother-in-law or uncle as rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel assumed the title of rebbe of Chabad, also leading the movement from the town of Lyubavichi (Lubavitch). He published a number of his works on both Hasidic thought and Jewish law. Rabbi Menachem Mendel also published some of the works of his grandfather, Rabbi Shneur Zalman. He is commonly referred to as the Tzemach Tzedek after the title of his responsa.\nRabbi Shmuel Schneersohn (1834\u20131882), was the seventh and youngest son of Rabbi Menachem Mendel. He assumed the title of rebbe in town of Lyubavichi (Lubavitch), while several of his brothers assumed the title of rebbe in other towns, forming Chabad groups of their own which existed for several decades. Years after his death, his teachings were published by the Chabad movement. He is commonly referred to as the Maharash, an acronym for Moreinu HaRav Shmuel ('our teacher, Rabbi Shmuel').\nRabbi Shalom Dovber Schneersohn (1860\u20131920), Shmuel's second son, succeeded his father as rebbe. Rabbi Shalom Dovber waited some time before officially accepting the title of rebbe, as not to offend his elder brother, Zalman Aaron. He established a yeshiva called Tomchei Temimim. During World War I, he moved to Rostov-on-Don. Many of his writings were published after his death, and are studied regularly in Chabad yeshivas. He is commonly referred to as the Rashab, an acronym for Rabbi Shalom Ber.\nRabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (1880\u20131950), the only son of Sholom Dovber, succeeded his father as rebbe of Chabad. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak was exiled from Russia, following an attempt by the Bolshevik government to have him executed. He led the movement from Warsaw, Poland, until the start of World War II. After fleeing the Nazis, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak lived in Brooklyn, New York until his death. He established much of Chabad's current organizational structure, founding several of its central organizations as well as other Chabad institutions, both local and international. He published a number of his writings, as well as the works of his predecessors. He is commonly referred to as the Rayatz or the Frierdiker Rebbe ('Previous Rebbe').\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902\u20131994), son-in-law of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak, and a great-grandson of the third Rebbe of Lubavitch, assumed the title of rebbe one year after his father-in-law's death. Rabbi Menachem Mendel greatly expanded Chabad's global network, establishing hundreds of new Chabad centers across the globe. He published many of his own works as well as the works of his predecessors. His teachings are studied regularly by followers of Chabad. He is commonly referred to as \"the Lubavitcher Rebbe\", or simply \"the Rebbe\". Even after his death, many continue to revere him as the leader of the Chabad movement.", "hasanswer": false}]}

With a diverse body of work spanning more than six decades, he is considered to be one of the most prolific and influential composers of his era, and his piano works continue to be widely performed and recorded.Liszt gained renown during the 1830s for his skill as a pianist. Regarded as one of the greatest pianists of the time, he toured Europe during the 1830s and 1840s, often playing for charity. In these years, Liszt developed a reputation for his powerful performances as well as his physical attractiveness. In a phenomenon dubbed \"Lisztomania\", he rose to a degree of stardom and popularity among the public not experienced by the virtuosos who preceded him.\nDuring this period and into his later life, Liszt was a friend, musical promoter and benefactor to many composers of his time, including Hector Berlioz, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Robert Schumann, Clara Schumann and Richard Wagner, among others. Alongside Wagner, Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the New German School, a progressive group of composers involved in the \"War of the Romantics\" who developed ideas of programmatic music and harmonic experimentation.\nLiszt taught piano performance to hundreds of students throughout his life, many of whom went on to become notable performers. He left behind an extensive and diverse body of work that influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated 20th-century ideas and trends. Among Liszt's musical contributions were the concept of the symphonic poem, innovations in thematic transformation and impressionism in music, and the invention of the masterclass as a method of teaching performance. In a radical departure from his earlier compositional styles, many of Liszt's later works also feature experiments in atonality, foreshadowing developments in 20th-century classical music.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Ptolemy's decision to defend the Nile against Perdiccas ended in fiasco for Perdiccas, with the loss of 2,000 men. This failure was a fatal blow to Perdiccas' reputation, and he was murdered in his tent by two of his subordinates. Ptolemy immediately crossed the Nile, to provide supplies to what had the day before been an enemy army. Ptolemy was offered the regency in place of Perdiccas, but he declined. Ptolemy was consistent in his policy of securing a power base, while never succumbing to the temptation of risking all to succeed Alexander.In the long wars that followed between the different Diadochi, Ptolemy's first goal was to hold Egypt securely, and his second was to secure control in the outlying areas: Cyrenaica and Cyprus, as well as Syria, including the province of Judea. His first occupation of Syria was in 318, and he established at the same time a protectorate over the petty kings of Cyprus. When Antigonus I, master of Asia in 315, showed expansionist ambitions, Ptolemy joined the coalition against him, and on the outbreak of war, evacuated Syria. In Cyprus, he fought the partisans of Antigonus, and re-conquered the island (313). A revolt in Cyrene was crushed the same year.In 312, Ptolemy and Seleucus, the fugitive satrap of Babylonia, both invaded Syria, and defeated Demetrius I, the son of Antigonus, in the Battle of Gaza. Again he occupied Syria, and again\u2014after only a few months, when Demetrius had won a battle over his general, and Antigonus entered Syria in force\u2014he evacuated it. In 311, a peace was concluded between the combatants. Soon after this, the surviving 13-year-old king, Alexander IV, was murdered in Macedonia on the orders of Cassander, leaving the satrap of Egypt absolutely his own master.The peace did not last long, and in 309 Ptolemy personally commanded a fleet which detached the coastal towns of Lycia and Caria from Antigonus, then crossed into Greece, where he took possession of Corinth, Sicyon and Megara (308 BC). In 306, a great fleet under Demetrius attacked Cyprus, and Ptolemy's brother Menelaus was defeated and captured in another decisive Battle of Salamis. Ptolemy's complete loss of Cyprus followed.The satraps Antigonus and Demetrius now each assumed the title of king; Ptolemy, as well as Cassander, Lysimachus and Seleucus I Nicator, responded by doing the same. In the winter of 306 BC, Antigonus tried to follow up his victory in Cyprus by invading Egypt; but Ptolemy was strongest there, and successfully held the frontier against him. Ptolemy led no further overseas expeditions against Antigonus. However, he did send great assistance to Rhodes when it was besieged by Demetrius (305/304). The Rhodians granted divine honors to Ptolemy as a result of the lifting of the siege.When the coalition against Antigonus was renewed in 302, Ptolemy joined it, and invaded Syria a third time, while Antigonus was engaged with Lysimachus in Asia Minor. On hearing a report that Antigonus had won a decisive victory there, he once again evacuated Syria. But when the news came that Antigonus had been defeated and slain by Lysimachus and Seleucus at the Battle of Ipsus in 301, he occupied Syria a fourth time.The other members of the coalition had assigned all Syria to Seleucus, after what they regarded as Ptolemy's desertion, and for the next hundred years, the question of the ownership of southern Syria (i.e., Judea) produced recurring warfare between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic dynasties. Henceforth, Ptolemy seems to have involved himself as little as possible in the rivalries between Asia Minor and Greece; he lost what he held in Greece, but reconquered Cyprus in 295/294. Cyrenaica, after a series of rebellions, was finally subjugated in about 300 and placed under his stepson Magas.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Domingo's father was half Aragonese and half Catalan, while his mother was a Basque from Gipuzkoa. His father began as a violinist performing for opera and zarzuela orchestras. He soon also took on baritone roles in zarzuelas. Even though he damaged his voice by performing while suffering from a cold, he continued singing into the 1970s. Domingo's mother was an established soprano who made her stage debut at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona. She met her husband at age 21 while performing in Federico Moreno Torroba's Sor Navarra. Domingo later recalled that experts encouraged his father to sing Wagnerian heldentenor roles, while the Liceu offered his mother a contract to sing opera. In 1946 Moreno Torroba and Domingo's parents formed a zarzuela company and toured in Latin America. His parents later stayed permanently in Mexico and established their own zarzuela troupe, the Domingo-Embil Company.

They were based at Bullock Creek in the Wombat Ranges, where they made money sluicing gold and distilling whisky, and were supplied with provisions and information by sympathisers including Ned's cousin Tom Lloyd.The police had received information that the Kelly gang were in the Wombat Ranges at the head of the King River and, on 25 October 1878, two mounted police parties were dispatched to search for them. One party, consisting of Sergeant Michael Kennedy and constables Michael Scanlan (sometimes spelled Scanlon), Thomas Lonigan and Thomas McIntyre camped overnight in an abandoned mining site at Stringybark Creek, about twenty-five miles north of Mansfield. They were unaware that they were only 1.5 miles from the Kelly gang's hideout and that Ned had observed their tracks.On the following morning, Kennedy and Scanlan went scouting while McIntyre and Lonigan remained at the camp. At about 5 p.m. the four members of the Kelly gang emerged from the bush and ordered the two policemen in the camp to bail up and raise their arms. According to McIntyre, each member of the gang was armed with a rifle, but according to Ned they only had two guns. McIntyre was unarmed at the time and raised his arms. According to McIntyre, Lonigan made a motion to draw his revolver and ran for the cover of a tree a few yards away. Ned immediately shot Lonigan, killing him. According to Ned, Lonigan had ducked behind a fallen tree and Ned shot him as he raised his head to fire.\nThe Kelly gang questioned McIntyre and armed themselves with the policemen's shotgun and revolvers. At about 5.30 p.m., Kennedy and Scanlan returned on horseback and the Kelly gang hid themselves. According to McIntyre, he walked towards Kennedy but before he could speak to him, the Kelly gang ordered the police to bail up. Kennedy tried to unclip his gun holster and shots were fired by the gang. McIntyre advised Kennedy to surrender as he was surrounded. Meanwhile, Scanlan dismounted and was shot while trying to unsling his rifle. McIntyre stated that Scanlan didn't have time to fire a shot. According to Ned, Scanlan fired and Ned shot him as he tried to fire again. Scanlan died soon after.Kennedy had dismounted and, according to McIntyre, tried to surrender without firing a shot, but the gang continued firing at him. According to Kelly, Kennedy hid behind a tree and started firing. Kennedy retreated into the bush. Ned and Dan pursued him for almost a mile, exchanging gunfire with the sergant, before Ned shot him in the right side. According to Ned, Kennedy then turned around to face him and Ned shot him in the chest with his shotgun, not realising that Kennedy had dropped his revolver and was turning to surrender.In the exchange of gunfire, McIntyre, who was still unarmed, mounted Kennedy's horse and was able to escape. He reached Mansfield police station the following day and a search party quickly found the bodies of Lonigan and Scanlan. Kennedy's body was found two days later. The bodies had been looted of watches, rings, and other personal items. Post-mortem examinations showed that Lonigan had been shot three times: through the arm, the leg and the right eye, the latter being the cause of death. Scanlan had four bullet wounds. Kennedy had at least two bullet wounds, one a shotgun wound through the chest fired from very close range.McIntyre's initial accounts of the shootout were given at Mansfield on 27 October and at the inquest into the deaths of Lonigan and Scanlan on 29 October. Kelly's initial accounts of the killings were given in his Cameron Letter of December 1878 and Jerilderie Letter of February 1879. These, and later accounts by McIntyre and Kelly, varied in their details. Jones, Morrissey and others have questioned the credibility of some aspects of both versions of events.In the Jerilderie letter, Kelly claimed that he had been told that a number of police officers had boasted that they would shoot him without giving him a chance to surrender. He also claimed that the weapons (especially the two rifles) and amount of ammunition the police party carried indicated their intention of killing him rather than arresting him. He claimed that these circumstances, and the failure of the police to surrender when ordered to, justified him killing them in self-defence. McIntyre stated that he told Kelly that the intention of the police party was to arrest him and that they were not excessively armed in the circumstances. He stated that it was the Kelly gang who confronted the police with their weapons drawn and that they did not give the police a realistic chance to surrender.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "106_459", "question": "What is Jack Kerouac's occupation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_32529", "text": "Kerouac and his literary works had a major impact on the popular rock music of the 1960s. Artists including Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Patti Smith, Tom Waits, The Grateful Dead, and The Doors all credit Kerouac as a significant influence on their music and lifestyles. This is especially so with members of the band The Doors, Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek, who quote Jack Kerouac and his novel On the Road as one of the band's greatest influences. In his book Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors, Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, wrote \"I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written On the Road, The Doors would never have existed.\" \nThe alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs wrote a song bearing his name, \"Hey Jack Kerouac\" on their 1987 album In My Tribe. Hip-hop group the Beastie Boys mention Kerouac in their 1989 song, \"3-Minute Rule\", from the album Paul's Boutique. The 2000 Barenaked Ladies song, \"Baby Seat\", from the album Maroon, references Kerouac.\nAs the critic Juan Arabia has written in relation to Kerouac's work and rock 'n' roll: In order to vindicate the cultural, ideological and aesthetic advancement in Kerouac's work and its relevance\u2013and the genesis of rock \u2018n' roll\u2013one must first understand the origins of jazz and its offshoots.\nThe first forms of jazz were formed in New Orleans from a melange of blues, work songs, marches, work songs, African and European music. Bop\u2013the form of jazz that most influenced Kerouac\u2013was created by African-American musicians in New York basements between 1941 and 1945.\nBop arose as a reaction to the perception of musical theft perpetrated by white entertainers (e.g., Benny Goodman and his swing band) in an attempt to reclaim the cultural property of the black community which had informed every popular music genre.\nThere has always been an exchange of ideas and musical forms between black and white communities. For example, Elvis sings gospel and blues and white country songs and some black rock n' roll artists sing in a manner similar to Elvis or borrow elements from European music or folk. Rock n' roll borrows elements from blues, country-western, boogie, and jazz.\n\nThis is the scenario that surrounds the d\u00e9nouement of Kerouac's work. It's in 1948 that he finishes his first novel, The Town and the City; very soon after came the birth\u2013and its explosion of popularity in the 1950s\u2013of rock \u2018n' roll.\nIn 1974, the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics was opened in his honor by Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman at Naropa University, a private Buddhist university in Boulder, Colorado. The school offers a BA in Writing and Literature, MFAs in Writing & Poetics and Creative Writing, and a summer writing program.From 1978 to 1992, Joy Walsh published 28 issues of a magazine devoted to Kerouac, Moody Street Irregulars.\n\nKerouac's French-Canadian origins inspired a 1987 National Film Board of Canada docudrama, Jack Kerouac's Road: A Franco-American Odyssey, directed by Acadian poet Herm\u00e9n\u00e9gilde Chiasson. Other tributes in French Canada include the 1972 biography by novelist Victor-L\u00e9vy Beaulieu Jack K\u00e9rouac (essai-poulet), translated as Jack Kerouac: a chicken-essay, the second in a series of works by Beaulieu on his literary forefathers, and two songs that came out within months of each other in 1987 and 1988: \"Sur la route\" by Pierre Flynn, and \"L'ange vagabond\" by Richard S\u00e9guin.\nIn the mid-1980s, Kerouac Park was placed in downtown Lowell, Massachusetts.A street, rue Jack-Kerouac, is named after him in Quebec City, as well as in the hamlet of Kerouac, Lanmeur, Brittany. An annual Kerouac festival was established in Lanmeur in 2010. In the 1980s, the city of San Francisco named a one-way street, Jack Kerouac Alley, in his honor in Chinatown.\nThe character Hank in David Cronenberg's 1991 film Naked Lunch is based on Kerouac.In 1997, the house on Clouser Avenue where The Dharma Bums was written was purchased by a newly formed non-profit group, The Jack Kerouac Writers in Residence Project of Orlando, Inc. This group provides opportunities for aspiring writers to live in the same house in which Kerouac was inspired, with room and board covered for three months. In 1998, the Chicago Tribune published a story by journalist Oscar J. Corral that described a simmering legal dispute between Kerouac's family and the executor of daughter Jan Kerouac's estate, Gerald Nicosia. The article, citing legal documents, showed that Kerouac's estate, worth $91 at the time of his death, was worth $10 million in 1998.\nIn 2005, Kerouac was mentioned in the single \"Nolwenn Ohwo!\" by French pop singer-songwriter Nolwenn Leroy, released on her album Histoires Naturelles.In 2007, Kerouac was posthumously awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Massachusetts Lowell.In 2009, the movie One Fast Move or I'm Gone \u2013 Kerouac's Big Sur was released. It chronicles the time in Kerouac's life that led to his novel Big Sur, with actors, writers, artists, and close friends giving their insight into the book. The movie also describes the people and places on which Kerouac based his characters and settings, including the cabin in Bixby Canyon. An album released to accompany the movie, \"One Fast Move or I'm Gone\", features Benjamin Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) and Jay Farrar (Son Volt) performing songs based on Kerouac's Big Sur.\nIn 2010, during the first weekend of October, the 25th anniversary of the literary festival \"Lowell Celebrates Kerouac\" was held in Kerouac's birthplace of Lowell, Massachusetts. It featured walking tours, literary seminars, and musical performances focused on Kerouac's work and that of the Beat Generation.\nIn the 2010s, there was a surge in films based on the Beat Generation. Kerouac has been depicted in the films Howl and Kill Your Darlings. A feature film version of On the Road was released internationally in 2012, and was directed by Walter Salles and produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Independent filmmaker Michael Polish directed Big Sur, based on the novel, with Jean-Marc Barr cast as Kerouac. The film was released in 2013.A species of Indian platygastrid wasp that is phoretic (hitch-hiking) on grasshoppers is named after him as Mantibaria kerouaci.In October 2015, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honor.The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps based their 2022 production Rearview Mirror off of Kerouac's travels across America and his novel On the Road.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His parents worked on a sovkhoz\u2014Aleksey Ivanovich Gagarin as a carpenter and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina as a dairy farmer. Yuri was the third of four children. His older brother Valentin was born in 1924, and by the time Yuri was born he was already helping with the cattle on the farm. His sister Zoya, born in 1927, helped take care of \"Yura\" and their youngest brother Boris, born in 1936.Like millions of Soviet citizens, his family suffered during the German occupation during World War II. During the German advance on Moscow, retreating Red Army soldiers seized the collective farm's livestock. The Nazis captured Klushino on 18 October 1941. On their first day in the village, they burned down the school, ending Yuri's first year of education. The Germans also burned down 27 houses in the village and forced the residents including the Gagarins to work the farms to feed the occupying soldiers. Those who refused were beaten or sent to the concentration camp set up at Gzhatsk.A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin residence. On the land behind their house, the family was allowed to build a mud hut measuring approximately 3 by 3 metres (10 by 10 ft), where they spent 21 months until the end of the occupation. During this period, Yuri became a saboteur, especially after one of the German soldiers, called \"the Devil\" by the children, tried to hang his younger brother Boris on an apple tree using the boy's scarf. In retaliation, Yuri sabotaged the soldier's work; he poured soil into the tank batteries gathered to be recharged and randomly mixed the different chemical supplies intended for the task. In early 1943, his two older siblings were deported by the Germans to Poland for slave labour. They escaped and were found by Soviet soldiers who conscripted them into helping with the war effort. They did not return home until after the war, in 1945.The rest of the Gagarin family believed the two older children were dead, and Yuri became ill with \"grief and hunger\"; he was also beaten for refusing to work for the German forces and spent the remainder of the war at a hospital as a patient and later as an orderly. His mother was hospitalized during the same period, after a German soldier gashed her leg with a scythe. When the Germans were routed out of Klushino on 9 March 1944, Yuri helped the Red Army find mines buried in the roads by the fleeing German army.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The first of these was a 64-chapter novel titled Wu Zetian sida qi\u2019an \u6b66\u5219\u5929\u56db\u5927\u5947\u6848 (Wu Zetian's Four Great Cases), also known as Di gong\u2019an \u72c4\u516c\u6848 (The Cases Solved by Judge Di), written by a pseudonymous author in 1890. \nDuring his office in China, Robert van Gulik translated the first 30 chapters of the Chinese novel Di gong\u2019an into English, and published it on his own in Tokyo in 1949 under the title Dee Goong An: Three Murder Cases Solved by Judge Dee.He later wrote a series of detective novels featuring Judge Dee (\u201cDee\u201d is the English adaptation of the Chinese pinyin \u201cDi\u201d) as the main protagonist. These, in turn, were the basis of a 1969 TV series in the UK starring Michael Goodliffe.\nKhigh Dhiegh appeared as the Judge Dee version of the character in the 1974 ABC TV movie Judge Dee and the Monastery Murders, based on Robert Van Gulik's novel The Haunted Monastery.  It was directed by Jeremy Paul Kagan and the teleplay was written by Nicholas Meyer.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lenormand published 19 new novels using Judge Dee as detective from 2004 to present (\u00e9ditions Fayard, Paris).\nVan Gulik's series of detective novels was not translated into Chinese until the 1980s, when Professor Zhao Yiheng \u8d75\u6bc5\u8861, during his studies at the Institute of Foreign Languages of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Zhongguo shehui kexueyuan waiwen yanjiusuo \u4e2d\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u5916\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6240), \u201cre-discovered\u201d it in the National Library of Beijing. Professor Zhao was completely fascinated by van Gulik's series, and thought that Chinese people must read such lovely novels that re-invented Chinese history and Chinese society. In 1981, he wrote an article entitled The Western Di gong\u2019an that win universal acclaim (Kuaizhi renkou de xiyang Digong\u2019an \u810d\u7099\u4eba\u53e3\u7684\u897f\u6d0b\u72c4\u516c\u6848) to introduce to the Chinese reader van Gulik's series, and published it in Zhonghua dushubao (\u4e2d\u534e\u8bfb\u4e66\u62a5) and later, on Renmin Ribao (\u4eba\u6c11\u65e5\u62a5). These articles immediately aroused great interest in China. Magazines, newspapers, and publishing houses wrote to Zhao Yiheng to pray for him to translate van Gulik's stories, but Zhao was too busy and asked his friend Chen Laiyuan (\u9648\u6765\u5143). After that, Cheng Laiyuan, his wife, and two of his friends worked hard from the spring of 1981 until the summer of 1986, and finally all van Gulik's stories were published in China under the title Di Renjie solves cases at the court of the Great Tang (Da Tang Di gong\u2019an \u5927\u5510\u72c4\u516c\u6848). \nIn 1986, Chen Laiyuan and his colleagues also collaborated on the adaptation for Chinese television of a serial drama titled The Legend of the Detective Di Renjie (Di Renjie duan\u2019an chuanqi \u72c4\u4ec1\u6770\u65ad\u6848\u4f20\u5947), the first Chinese television drama based on Judge Dee. It was a twenty-five-episode detective drama adapted from Van Gulik's Judge Dee mysteries. Each of van Gulik's stories were adapted into one, two, or three episodes, although some simplifications were made due to the small screen requirements.\nIn 1996, another television drama titled The Legend Di Renjie and Wu Zetian (Di Renjie yu Wu Zetian Chuanqi \u72c4\u4ec1\u6770\u4e0e\u6b66\u5219\u5929\u4f20\u5947, 1996) appeared in Chinese television. Here, Di Renjie's representation resonates strongly with the old-age literary tradition of \u201cpure officials\u201d that had enjoyed enduring popularity in the past. Unlike the drama of 1986, this time, great attention was paid to historical details and to the construction of the characters based on historical figures. Here, Di Renjie is no longer a Western detective in the shoes of a Chinese official, he no longer lives in the \u201ceternal China\u201d described by van Gulik, but he reactivates the cultural icon of \u201cpure official\u201d who fights corruption and crimes. (see: L. Benedetti, Further definition of Di Renjie's identity(ies) in Chinese history, literature, and media, \u00abFrontiers of History in China\u00bb, 2017, 12(4), pp. 599\u2013620.)\nIn 2004, CCTV-8 aired a television series based on detective stories related to Di Renjie, under the title Amazing Detective Di Renjie (\u795e\u63a2\u72c4\u4ec1\u6770), starring Liang Guanhua as the titular protagonist. It was followed by three sequels: Amazing Detective Di Renjie 2 (2006), Amazing Detective Di Renjie 3 (2008), and Mad Detective Di Renjie (2010). Some characters in the television series are fictionalised versions of historical figures, including Wu Zetian and Di Renjie himself. The plot of each season is further divided into two or three parts, each covering one case. The story usually follows a pattern of a seemingly small case gradually leading to Di Renjie uncovering a sinister plot that threatens the Chinese empire.\nKent Cheng portrayed Di Renjie in the 2009 Hong Kong television series The Greatness of a Hero, produced by TVB.\nAndy Lau played Di Renjie in the 2010 film Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame directed by Tsui Hark. Mark Chao took over the role in Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013) and Detective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings (2018), both also directed by Tsui Hark.

His mother, Anna Regina Reuter (1697\u20131737), was born in K\u00f6nigsberg to a father from Nuremberg. Her surname is sometimes erroneously given as Porter. Kant's father, Johann Georg Kant (1682\u20131746), was a German harness-maker from Memel, at the time Prussia's most northeastern city (now Klaip\u0117da, Lithuania).

He was the fourth of nine children (six of whom reached adulthood).The Kant household stressed the pietist values of religious devotion, humility, and a literal interpretation of the Bible. The young Immanuel's education was strict, punitive and disciplinary, and focused on Latin and religious instruction over mathematics and science.In his later years, Kant lived a strictly ordered life.

In the economic uncertainty following World War I, the Youngs moved to the industrial Belfast where Alexander found work as a stable hand for a local bakery. Until the age of 14, Young attended the Cooke Church School off the Ravenhill Road. Even at this early stage, Young's natural talent for humour was evident. His mother would often tell him, \"Stop impersonating the visitors. Because after you do, I find it impossible to take them seriously.\"During his youth, Young's mother would frequently take him to the theatres around Belfast. At the age of six, Young went with his mother to see a show starring Jimmy O'Dea. O'Dea would be a massive influence on Young who, like Young, was a highly skilled comic and female impersonator. He would also be influenced by many visiting English music hall acts.\nAt the age of 14, Young left school and found work as a rent collector for a local estate agent.  Young collected rent from some of the toughest districts in Belfast. Young visited homes in the Falls Road, Shankill Road and Crumlin Road areas of the town. It was during these visits he would find the inspiration for many of his future comedy characters.After two years, Young tired of collecting rent and volunteered for the Savoy Players, an English company based at the Grand Opera House during World War II. Young performed the odd jobs backstage for the company but soon wanted to appear on stage. He joined the Youth Hostel Association Drama Group in 1943 and, in the first year, he won the award for best actor for his performance in A Story For Today by Jack Loudan.Due in part to the praise for his performance in A Story For Today, Young was offered a role in the Ulster Group Theatre's production of Joseph Tomelty's Right Again, Barnum. Young appeared in further Group Theatre productions and productions for other companies in Belfast but, in 1944, Young left Northern Ireland to seek greater success in England.\nHe found work in a repertory company based at the Stockport Hippodrome near Manchester, appearing in over a hundred productions across different genres. He soon left the company and joined the West End production of Se\u00e1n O'Casey's Red Roses for Me. The play ran for seven months and was a great success. Following this, Young got to work with his hero Jimmy O'Dea in his production of Phil the Flutter's Ball. However, following an accident with a member of the audience, Young was let go from the show.\nYoung then joined a show that was being arranged by ENSA and was due to tour the Middle East.  While on the tour, Young was to meet Jack Hudson who would become a major part of his personal and professional life until his death.\nAt the end of the tour, Young started to feel home sick for Northern Ireland and he, along with Hudson, returned to Belfast. They moved into a flat on the Newtownards Road above a butcher's shop. Young returned to the Ulster Group Theatre, while Hudson became a manager of a local ballroom.\nSuccess was not forthcoming and, for a time, Young and Hudson considered emigrating to Australia. Young's luck was to change, however, when he was cast in Joseph Tomelty's BBC Radio Ulster series The McCooeys.  Tomelty devised a character called Derek, loosely based on the character Young played in Right Again, Barnum. Derek was the camp window cleaner of the title characters. Derek appeared in only five episodes of the series but was a massive hit with the public and made Young a household name.Young soon began to receive lucrative offers to make appearances that were the equivalent of several months' work at the Group. Driven by this success, Young and Hudson formed James Young Productions and were soon making appearances across the country. The shows featured Young and Hudson in sketches, interspersed with musical and dance numbers.\nIn 1951, Young was offered his own BBC Radio series. The Young Idea was another success and spawned several series in the following years. The series continued to raise Young's profile and, in 1954, he realised his dream of appearing in his own show at the Grand Opera House.\nYoung established a lucrative pattern of spring and autumn shows in the Empire Theatre, Belfast, summer shows in Bangor, a radio series and shows in London. However, the Empire's owners decided to sell the venue and it eventually became a Littlewoods store.Following the withdrawal of Sam Thompson's play Over The Bridge from Ulster Group Theatre, Young was invited to bring his unique comedy talents to the venue. Young asked one of his popular sketch writers Sam Cree to adapt Glenn Melvyn's The Love Match for an Ulster audience. The play premiered on 8 March 1960, and ran for ten weeks. The play was a success and Young and Hudson were invited to become joint managing directors of the Group Theatre in the autumn of 1960.\nAround this time, Young and Hudson's relationship moved from a personal to a more business based arrangement. However, the two would remain firm friends and colleagues for the rest of Young's life.\nThe Group Theatre became Young's theatrical home for the next decade and he would premiere hit play after hit play. Young would function as director and star of these plays, which he would alternate with a string of successful one man shows. Recordings of these one man shows would form the basis for a series of comic records released by Emerald Records. He was listed in the Guinness Book of Records for having the longest running one man show ever and it was also claimed that he sold more albums in Northern Ireland than The Beatles.Young also toured his one-man shows in Canada and America playing in the Wilshire Ebell Theatre.\nIn 1972, Young was at the height of his career and BBC Northern Ireland offered him the chance to appear in his own television series. The first episode of the show, Saturday Night, aired on 14 October 1972.\nIn 1974, Young telephoned Hudson to inform him that there had been mysterious enquiries into his date of birth.

{"id": "106_478", "question": "What is Cicero's occupation?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_32601", "text": "In 60 BC, Julius Caesar invited Cicero to be the fourth member of his existing partnership with Pompey and Marcus Licinius Crassus, an assembly that would eventually be called the First Triumvirate. Cicero refused the invitation because he suspected it would undermine the Republic, and was strongly opposed to anything unconsitutional that limited the powers of the consuls, and replaced them with non-elected officials.\nDuring Caesar's consulship of 59 BC, the triumvirate had achieved many of their goals of land reform, publicani debt forgiveness, ratification of Pompeian conquests, etc. With Caesar leaving for his provinces, they wished to maintain their hold on politics. They engineered the adoption of patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher into a plebeian family and had him elected as one of the ten tribunes of the plebs for 58 BC. Clodius used the triumvirate's backing to push through legislation that benefited them. He introduced several laws (the leges Clodiae) that made him popular with the people, strengthening his power base, then he turned on Cicero. Clodius passed a law which made it illegal to offer \"fire and water\"  (i.e shelter or food) to anyone who executed a Roman citizen without a trial.  \nCicero, having executed members of the Catiline conspiracy four years previously without formal trial, was clearly the intended target. Furthermore, many believed that Clodius acted in concert with the triumvirate who feared that Cicero would seek to abolish many of Caesar's accomplishments while consul the year before. Cicero argued that the senatus consultum ultimum indemnified him from punishment, and he attempted to gain the support of the senators and consuls, especially of Pompey.Cicero grew out his hair, dressed in mourning and toured the streets. Clodius' gangs dogged him, hurling abuse, stones and even excrement. Hortensius, trying to rally to his old rival's support, was almost lynched. The Senate and the consuls were cowed. Caesar, who was still encamped near Rome, was apologetic but said he could do nothing when Cicero brought himself to grovel in the proconsul's tent. Everyone seemed to have abandoned Cicero.After Clodius passed a law to deny to Cicero fire and water (i.e. shelter) within four hundred miles of Rome, Cicero went into exile. He arrived at Thessalonica, on 23 May 58 BC. In his absence, Clodius, who lived next door to Cicero on the Palatine, arranged for Cicero's house to be confiscated by the state, and was even able to purchase a part of the property in order to extend his own house. After demolishing Cicero's house, Clodius had the land consecrated and symbolically erected a temple of Liberty (aedes Libertatis) on the vacant land.Cicero's exile caused him to fall into depression. He wrote to Atticus: \"Your pleas have prevented me from committing suicide. But what is there to live for? Don't blame me for complaining. My afflictions surpass any you ever heard of earlier\". After the intervention of recently elected tribune Titus Annius Milo, acting on the behalf of Pompey who wanted Cicero as a client, the Senate voted in favor of recalling Cicero from exile. Clodius cast the single vote against the decree. Cicero returned to Italy on 5 August 57 BC, landing at Brundisium. He was greeted by a cheering crowd, and, to his delight, his beloved daughter Tullia. In his Oratio De Domo Sua Ad Pontifices, Cicero convinced the College of Pontiffs \nto rule that the consecration of his land was invalid, thereby allowing him to regain his property and rebuild his house on the Palatine.Cicero tried to re-enter politics as an independent operator, but his attempts to attack portions of Caesar's legislation were unsuccessful and encouraged Caesar to re-solidify his political alliance with Pompey and Crassus. The conference at Luca in 56 BC left the three-man alliance in domination of the republic's politics; this forced Cicero to recant and support the triumvirate out of fear from being entirely excluded from public life. After the conference Cicero lavishly praised Caesar's achievements, got the Senate to vote a thanksgiving for Caesar's victories and grant money to pay his troops. He also delivered a speech 'On the consular provinces' (Latin: de provinciis consularibus) which checked an attempt by Caesar's enemies to strip him of his provinces in Gaul. After this, a cowed Cicero concentrated on his literary works. It is uncertain whether he was directly involved in politics for the following few years.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Despite his short life, Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre, including more than 600 secular vocal works (mainly lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music, and a large body of piano and chamber music. His major works include the art songs \"Erlk\u00f6nig\", \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\", \"Ave Maria\"; the Trout Quintet, the unfinished Symphony No. 8 in B minor, the \"Great\" Symphony No. 9 in C major, the String Quartet No. 14 Death and the Maiden, a String Quintet, the two sets of  Impromptus for solo piano, the three last piano sonatas, the Fantasia in F minor for piano four hands, the opera Fierrabras, the incidental music to the play Rosamunde, and the song cycles Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin, Winterreise and Schwanengesang. \nBorn in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert showed uncommon gifts for music from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his elder brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813 and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher. Despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was admitted to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis.\nAppreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased greatly in the decades following his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers in the history of Western classical music and his work continues to be admired and widely performed.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He was a principal figure in the development of the system of Christian theology later called Calvinism, including its doctrines of predestination and of God's absolute sovereignty in the salvation of the human soul from death and eternal damnation. Calvinist doctrines were influenced by and elaborated upon the Augustinian and other Christian traditions. Various Congregational, Reformed and Presbyterian churches, which look to Calvin as the chief expositor of their beliefs, have spread throughout the world.\nCalvin was a tireless polemicist and apologetic writer who generated much controversy. He also exchanged cordial and supportive letters with many reformers, including Philipp Melanchthon and Heinrich Bullinger. In addition to his seminal Institutes of the Christian Religion, Calvin wrote commentaries on most books of the Bible, confessional documents, and various other theological treatises.\nCalvin was originally trained as a humanist lawyer. He broke from the Roman Catholic Church around 1530. After religious tensions erupted in widespread deadly violence against Protestant Christians in France, Calvin fled to Basel, Switzerland, where in 1536 he published the first edition of the Institutes. In that same year, Calvin was recruited by Frenchman William Farel to join the Reformation in Geneva, where he regularly preached sermons throughout the week. However, the governing council of the city resisted the implementation of their ideas, and both men were expelled. At the invitation of Martin Bucer, Calvin proceeded to Strasbourg, where he became the minister of a church of French refugees. He continued to support the reform movement in Geneva, and in 1541 he was invited back to lead the church of the city.\nFollowing his return, Calvin introduced new forms of church government and liturgy, despite opposition from several powerful families in the city who tried to curb his authority. During this period, Michael Servetus, a Spaniard regarded by both Roman Catholics and Protestants as having a heretical view of the Trinity, arrived in Geneva. He was denounced by Calvin and burned at the stake for heresy by the city council. Following an influx of supportive refugees and new elections to the city council, Calvin's opponents were forced out.

Schinder and Schwartz credit Bowie and Marc Bolan as the founders of the glam rock genre. He also inspired the innovators of the punk rock movement; Buckley wrote that \"Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation\". RCA promoted his status during the campaign for \"Heroes\" with the slogan, \"There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie\". His work with Tin Machine, though critically maligned, was later acknowledged as featuring grunge and alternative rock before those styles became popular. He was dubbed the \"chameleon of rock\" due to his constant reinvention.Perone credited Bowie with having \"brought sophistication to rock music\", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was \"an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions\".Broadcaster John Peel contrasted Bowie with his progressive rock contemporaries, arguing that Bowie was \"an interesting kind of fringe figure... on the outskirts of things\". Peel said he \"liked the idea of him reinventing himself... the one distinguishing feature about early-70s progressive rock was that it didn't progress. Before Bowie came along, people didn't want too much change\"; then Bowie \"subverted the whole notion of what it was to be a rock star\". Buckley called Bowie \"both star and icon. The vast body of work he has produced ... has created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture. ... His influence has been unique in popular culture\u2014he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\"Through continual reinvention, his influence broadened and extended. Biographer Thomas Forget added, \"Because he has succeeded in so many different styles of music, it is almost impossible to find a popular artist today that has not been influenced by David Bowie.\" In 2000, Bowie was voted by other music stars as the \"most influential artist of all time\" in a poll by NME. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that Bowie was confirmed by 1980 to be \"the most important and influential artist since the Beatles\". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that Bowie had \"one of the supreme careers in popular music, art and culture of the 20th century\" and \"he was too inventive, too mercurial, too strange for all but his most devoted fans to keep up with\". The BBC's Mark Easton argued that Bowie provided fuel for \"the creative powerhouse that Britain has become\" by challenging future generations \"to aim high, to be ambitious and provocative, to take risks\". Easton concluded that Bowie had \"changed the way the world sees Britain. And the way Britain sees itself\". In 2006, Bowie was voted the fourth greatest living British icon in a poll held by the BBC's Culture Show. Annie Zaleski of Alternative Press wrote, \"Every band or solo artist who's decided to rip up their playbook and start again owes a debt to Bowie\".Numerous figures from the music industry whose careers Bowie had influenced paid tribute to him following his death; panegyrics on Twitter (tweets about him peaked at 20,000 a minute an hour after the announcement of his death) also came from outside the entertainment industry and pop culture, such as those from the Vatican, namely Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, who quoted \"Space Oddity\", and the German Federal Foreign Office, which thanked Bowie for his part in the fall of the Berlin Wall and referenced \"'Heroes'\".On 7 January 2017, the BBC broadcast the 90-minute documentary David Bowie: The Last Five Years.

{"id": "106_504", "question": "What is Gil Evans known for?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_32704", "text": "Between 1941 and 1948, Evans worked as an arranger for the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. Even then, early in his career, his arrangements were such  a challenge to musicians that bassist Bill Crow recalled that bandleader Thornhill would bring out Evans's arrangements \"when he wanted to punish the band.\" Evans' modest basement apartment behind a New York City Chinese laundry soon became a meeting place for musicians looking to develop new musical styles outside of the dominant bebop style of the day. Those present included the leading bebop performer, Charlie Parker, as well as Gerry Mulligan and John Carisi. \nIn 1948, Evans, with Miles Davis, Mulligan, and others, collaborated on a band book for a nonet. These ensembles, larger than the trio-to-quintet combos, but smaller than big bands which were on the brink of economic unviability, allowed arrangers to have a larger palette of colors by using French horns and tuba. Claude Thornhill had employed hornist John Graas in 1942, and composer-arranger Bob Graettinger had scored for horns and tubas with the Stan Kenton orchestra, but the \"Kenton sound\" was in the context of a dense orchestral wall of sound that Evans avoided. The Miles Davis-led group was booked for a week at the Royal Roost as an intermission group on the bill with the Count Basie Orchestra. Capitol Records recorded 12 numbers by the nonet at three sessions in 1949 and 1950. These recordings were reissued on a 1957 Miles Davis LP titled Birth of the Cool.Later, while Davis was under contract with Columbia Records, producer George Avakian suggested that Davis could work with any of several arrangers. Davis immediately chose Evans. The three albums that resulted from the collaboration are Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1958), and Sketches of Spain (1960). Another collaboration from this period, Quiet Nights (1962) was issued later, against the wishes of Davis, who broke with his then-producer Teo Macero for a time as a result. Although these four records were marketed primarily under Davis's name (and credited to Miles Davis with Orchestra Under the Direction of Gil Evans), Evans's contribution was as important as Davis's. Their work coupled Evans's classic big band jazz stylings and arrangements with Davis's solo playing. Evans also contributed behind the scenes to Davis' classic quintet albums of the 1960s.\nThe demands of the score for Porgy and Bess were legendary, from the very first note for the lead trumpet. The limited time allotted for rehearsals revealed that the ability to read such a challenging score was not consistent among jazz musicians, and there are many audible errors. Yet the recording is now regarded by many as one of the greatest reinterpretations of Gershwin's music in any musical style, because Evans and Davis were each devoted to going outside the \"mainstream\" of commercial expectations for jazz musicians. Evans was a great influence on Davis's interest in \"non-jazz\" music, especially orchestral music. Unfortunately, Evans's orchestral scores from the Porgy and Bess sessions were later found to be incomplete (or simply lost), and Quincy Jones and Gil Goldstein attempted to reconstruct these for Miles Davis's final 1991 concerts at Montreux, recorded as Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux. Davis had relented after years of refusing to revisit this material, but he was clearly ill, recovering from pneumonia, and trumpeter Wallace Roney, who was mentored by Davis, covered many of the challenging passages. Davis died before the release of the album.\nFrom 1957 onwards, Evans recorded albums under his own name. Tubist Bill Barber and trumpeter Louis Mucci from Thornhill's band were both stalwarts in Evans's early ensembles, with Mucci finding a spot on nearly every pre-1980s Evans recording. Among the featured soloists on these records were Lee Konitz, Jimmy Cleveland, Steve Lacy, Johnny Coles and Cannonball Adderley. In 1965, he arranged the big band tracks on Kenny Burrell's Guitar Forms album.\nEvans was influenced by Spanish composers Manuel de Falla and Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo, and by other Latin and Brazilian music, as well as by German expatriate Kurt Weill. His arrangements of pieces already well known to some listeners from their original cabaret, concert hall or Broadway stage arrangements, revealed aspects of the music in a wholly original way. Sometimes in an unexpected contrast to the original atmosphere of the piece, and sometimes taking a dark ballad such as Weill's \"Barbara Song\" into an even darker place. \nThe personnel list for The Individualism of Gil Evans (1964), not only features Bill Barber and hornists James Buffington and Julius Watkins (along with two others), but each section features the cream of the younger (some more classically trained) musicians who were making their names in jazz. The presence of four of the most acclaimed young bassists (Richard Davis, Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, and Ben Tucker) along with veteran Milt Hinton would ordinarily indicate that each is used individually for separate tracks, but Evans's scores usually required at least two bassists on any given track, some playing arco (with the bow) and some pizzicato (plucking with fingers, the standard jazz method). These arrangements frequently featured greatly slowed-down tempos with polyrhythmic percussion and no prevailing \"beat\". To his by-now standard French horns and tuba, Evans's scores added alto and bass flutes, double reeds, and harp; orchestral instruments not associated with \"swing\" bands, providing a larger palette of orchestral colors, and allowing him to attain the ethereal quality heard in his arrangements during his Thornhill days. He frequently wrote a part for the tenor violin of Harry Lookofsky. Yet, this album featured an orchestral arrangement of \"Spoonful\" by bluesman Willie Dixon, an early indication of Evans's breadth and a hint of things to come.\nIn 1966, he recorded an album with Brazilian singer Astrud Gilberto, Look to the Rainbow. He was discouraged by the commercial direction Verve Records was taking with the Gilberto sessions, and he went into a period of hiatus.\nDuring this period while he was somewhat depressed about the commercial and logistical difficulties of his previous scoring requirements, his wife suggested that he listen to the guitarist Jimi Hendrix. Evans developed a particular interest in the work of the rock guitarist. Evans gradually built another orchestra in the 1970s, with none of the coloration instruments from his past arrangements. Working in the free jazz and jazz-rock idioms, he gained a new generation of admirers. These ensembles, rarely more than fifteen and frequently smaller, allowed him to make more contributions on keyboards, and with the development of truly portable synthesizers, he began using these to provide additional color. Hendrix's 1970 death precluded a scheduled meeting with Evans to discuss having Hendrix collaborate with a big band led by Evans.\nIn 1974, he released an album of his, and other band members', arrangements of music by Hendrix with guitarists John Abercrombie and Ryo Kawasaki. From then on Evans's ensembles featured electric instruments, i.e. guitars, basses, and synthesizers including a collaboration with bassist Jaco Pastorius Gil Evans & Jaco Pastorius \u2013 Live Under The Sky Tokyo '84. In contrast to his intricate scores for large ensembles, which required precision orchestral playing accompanying a single soloist, his later arrangements would feature more unison playing by the entire ensemble, such as on Hendrix's \"Little Wing\", with improvisational touches added throughout by the musicians. Live recordings demonstrate that some entire pieces were collaborative efforts, and Evans can be heard giving cues from the keyboard (behind the band) to guide the band. Before the 1970s, his keyboard playing was generally sparse on recordings but after the 1970s he took a more active role in the rhythm section of the band.\nWhere Flamingos Fly (recorded 1971, released 1981) demonstrated his ability to contract the most accomplished musicians, with veterans Coles, Harry Lookofsky, Richard Davis and Jimmy Knepper (who played the solo on the \"Where Flamingos Fly\" track on 1961's Out of the Cool) alongside young multi-instrumentalist Howard Johnson, synthesizer player Don Preston (at that time still a member of The Mothers of Invention), and Billy Harper.\nIn April 1983, the Gil Evans Orchestra was booked into the Sweet Basil Jazz Club (Greenwich Village, New York) by jazz producer and Sweet Basil owner Horst Liepolt. This turned out to be a regular Monday night engagement for Evans for nearly five years and also resulted in the release of a number of successful albums by Gil Evans and the Monday Night Orchestra. Evans's ensemble featured many of the top-call musicians in New York, many of whom were also in the NBC Saturday Night Live Band and there were many conflicts, so their \"deputies\" for the night might be other world-class musicians. Yet Evans was also known to let newcomers \"sit in\" occasionally. The band also performed arrangements by band members, current and past. Stalwarts in this ensemble were Lew Soloff, Alan Rubin, Marvin Peterson, Tom \"Bones\" Malone, George Adams, David Sanborn, Pete Levin, Hiram Bullock, Mark Egan, drummer Kenwood Dennard, saxophonist Bill Evans (no relation), and Gil Goldstein. \nIn 1987, Evans recorded a live album with Sting: Last Session - Live At Perugia Jazz Festival July 11, 1987, featuring the Monday Night Orchestra musicians, guest star Branford Marsalis and big band arrangements of songs by and with The Police and Jimi Hendrix. In the same spirit of introducing new talent in his bands, he collaborated with Maria Schneider with her as an apprentice arranger on this and other final projects. His final project was Nov. 3 & 26, 1987, his arrangements for the Laurent Cugny Big Band in Paris, on the recording \"Golden Hair\" on Emarcy/Polygram.\nIn 1996, Columbia Studio Recordings released a box set which besides the masterpieces, featured outtakes and rarities of Miles Davis and Gil Evans.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He has been described as the \"father of science fiction\" for his novel Somnium.Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a seminary school in Graz, where he became an associate of Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. Later he became an assistant to the astronomer Tycho Brahe in Prague, and eventually the imperial mathematician to Emperor Rudolf II and his two successors Matthias and Ferdinand II. He also taught mathematics in Linz, and was an adviser to General Wallenstein.\nAdditionally, he did fundamental work in the field of optics, being named the father of modern optics, in particular for his Astronomiae pars optica. He also invented an improved version of the refracting telescope, the Keplerian telescope, which became the foundation of the modern refracting telescope, while also improving on the telescope design  by Galileo Galilei, who mentioned Kepler's discoveries in his work.\nKepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between astronomy and astrology, but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of mathematics within the liberal arts) and physics (a branch of natural philosophy). Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason. Kepler described his new astronomy as \"celestial physics\", as \"an excursion into Aristotle's Metaphysics\", and as \"a supplement to Aristotle's On the Heavens\", transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It's a fight between two disturbed people\", adding, \"The Joker is such a great character because there's a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because you're not bound by the laws of society\".Burton saw Bruce Wayne as the bearer of a double identity, exposing one while hiding the reality from the world. Burton biographer Ken Hanke wrote that Bruce Wayne, struggling with his alter-ego as Batman, is depicted as an antihero. Hanke felt that Batman has to push the boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals, such as the Joker. Kim Newman theorized that \"Burton and the writers saw Batman and the Joker as a dramatic antithesis, and the film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent\".Batman conveys trademarks found in 1930s pulp magazines, notably the design of Gotham City stylized with Art Deco design. Richard Corliss, writing for Time, observed that Gotham's design was a reference to films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) and Metropolis (1927). \"Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio backlot\", he continued, \"is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of German Expressionism and fascist architecture, staring down at the citizens.\" Hanke further addressed the notions of Batman being a period piece, in that \"The citizens, cops, people and the black-and-white television looks like it takes place in 1939\"; but later said: \"Had the filmmakers made Vicki Vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress, this could have made Batman as a homage and tribute to classic film noir.\" Portions of the climax pay homage to Vertigo (1958).", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to Jewish tradition, Jeremiah authored the book that bears his name, the Books of Kings and the Book of Lamentations, with the assistance and under the editorship of Baruch ben Neriah, his scribe and disciple.\nAccording to the narrative of the Book of Jeremiah, the prophet emerged as a significant figure in ancient Judah during the late 7th and early 6th centuries BCE. Born into a priestly lineage, Jeremiah reluctantly accepted his call to prophethood, embarking on a tumultuous, over five-decade-long ministry. His life was marked by opposition, imprisonment, and personal struggles. Central to Jeremiah's message were prophecies of impending divine judgment, forewarning of the nation's idolatry, social injustices, and moral decay. According to the Bible, he prophesied the siege of Jerusalem and Babylonian exile as consequences for disobedience. Jeremiah's teachings encompassed lamentations, oracles, and symbolic acts, emphasising the urgency of repentance and the restoration of a covenant relationship with God.\nJeremiah is an important figure in both Judaism and Christianity. His words are read in synagogues as part of the Haftara and he is quoted in the New Testament.

In Judaism and Christianity, Ezekiel is believed to have already been active as a prophet in the Kingdom of Judah, where he prophesized the destruction of Judah's capital city Jerusalem, but also the restoration of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel in the aftermath. Following the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, which destroyed Solomon's Temple and brought an end to the Jewish\u2013Babylonian War in 587 BCE, Ezekiel continued his activity as a prophet during the Babylonian captivity.\nIt is believed that he died around 570 BCE; Ezekiel's Tomb is the most important Jewish religious site in Mesopotamia.

In the two decades after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive, and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by various guided tours of the murder sites and other locations pertaining to the case. For many years, the Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street (which had been frequented by at least one of the canonical Ripper victims) was the focus of such tours.In the immediate aftermath of the murders and later, \"Jack the Ripper became the children's bogey man.\" Depictions were often phantasmic or monstrous. In the 1920s and 1930s, he was depicted in film dressed in everyday clothes as a man with a hidden secret, preying on his unsuspecting victims; atmosphere and evil were suggested through lighting effects and shadowplay. By the 1960s, the Ripper had become \"the symbol of a predatory aristocracy\", and was more often portrayed in a top hat dressed as a gentleman. The Establishment as a whole became the villain, with the Ripper acting as a manifestation of upper-class exploitation. The image of the Ripper merged with or borrowed symbols from horror stories, such as Dracula's cloak or Victor Frankenstein's organ harvest. The fictional world of the Ripper can fuse with multiple genres, ranging from Sherlock Holmes to Japanese erotic horror.Jack the Ripper features in hundreds of works of fiction and works which straddle the boundaries between fact and fiction, including the Ripper letters and a hoax diary: The Diary of Jack the Ripper. The Ripper appears in novels, short stories, poems, comic books, games, songs, plays, operas, television programmes, and films. More than 100 non-fiction works deal exclusively with the Jack the Ripper murders, making this case one of the most written-about in the true-crime genre. The term \"ripperology\" was coined by Colin Wilson in the 1970s to describe the study of the case by professionals and amateurs. The periodicals Ripperana, Ripperologist, and Ripper Notes publish their research.In 2006, a BBC History magazine poll selected Jack the Ripper as the worst Briton in history.In 2015, the Jack the Ripper Museum opened in east London. It attracted criticism from both Tower Hamlets mayor John Biggs and protestors.

His father, Mohamad Iskandar, was from Penang of Malay and Indian descent. Mahathir's paternal grandfather had come from Kerala, British India and married a Malay woman. He is the only prime minister that was not born into the aristocracy or a prominent religious or political family other than Ismail Sabri Yaakob.Mohamad Iskandar was the principal of an English-medium secondary school, whose lower-middle-class status meant his daughters were unable to enrol in a secondary school. Wan Tempawan had only distant relations to members of Kedah's royalty. Both had been married previously. Mahathir was born with six half-siblings and two full-siblings. His childhood home, with a single shared bedroom and no electricity supply, was later converted to a tourist attraction and opened to the public.Mahathir began his education at Seberang Perak Malay Boys School in 1930. Mahathir was a hard-working student. Discipline imposed by his father motivated him to study, and he showed little interest in sports.

He was born into a notable religious Arabized Nubian family tracing their lineage from the Prophet of Islam Muhammad through the lineage of his grandson Hassan. When Mohammed Ahmed was still a child, his family moved to the town of Karari, north of Omdurman. There his father, Ahmad bin Abdullah, managed to find enough supplies of wood for his work in boat-building, but died shortly after they arrived. After the death of his father, his brothers Mohammed and Hamed, who continued to trade and built boats. Then the family moved to live in Khartoum for a short time, where their mother, Zainab bint Nasr, died and was buried. \nWhile his siblings joined his father's trade, Muhammad Ahmad showed a proclivity for religious study. He studied first under Sheikh al-Amin al-Suwaylih in the Gezira region south of Khartoum, and subsequently under Sheikh Muhammad al-Dikayr 'Abdallah Khujali near the town of Berber in northern Sudan.Determined to live a life of asceticism, mysticism and worship, in 1861 he sought out Sheikh Muhammad Sharif Nur al-Dai'm, the grandson of the founder of the Samaniyya Sufi sect in Sudan. Muhammad Ahmad stayed with Sheikh Muhammad Sharif for seven years, during which time he was recognized for his piety and asceticism. Near the end of this period, he was awarded the title of Sheikh, and began to travel around the country on religious missions. He was permitted to give tariqa and Uh\u016bd to new followers.In 1870, his family moved again in search for timber, returning to Aba Island. There, Muhammad Ahmad built a mosque and started to teach the Quran. He soon gained a notable reputation among the local population as an excellent speaker and mystic. The broad thrust of his teaching followed that of other reformers: his Islam was one devoted to the words of Muhammad and based on a return to the virtues of strict devotion, prayer, and simplicity as laid down in the Quran.In 1872, Muhammad Ahmad invited Sheikh Sharif to move to al-Aradayb, an area on the White Nile neighboring Aba Island. Despite initially amicable relations, in 1878 the two religious leaders had a dispute motivated by Sheikh Sharif's resentment of his former student's growing popularity. As a result, Sheikh Sharif expelled his former student from the Samaniyya Order and, despite numerous attempts at reconciliation by Muhammad Ahmad, his mentor refused to make peace.After recognizing that the split with Sheikh Sharif was irreconcilable, Muhammad Ahmad approached another respected leader of the Samaniyya Order named Sheikh al-Qurashi wad al-Zayn. Muhammad Ahmad resumed his life of piety and religious devotion at Aba Island. During this period, he also traveled to the province of Kordofan, west of Khartoum, where he visited with the notables of the capital, El-Obeid. They were enmeshed in a power struggle between two rival claimants to the governorship of the province.On 25 July 1878, Sheikh al-Qurashi died and his followers recognized Muhammad Ahmad as their new leader. Around this time, Muhammad Ahmad first met Abdallahi bin Muhammad al-Ta'aishi, who was to become his chief deputy and successor in the years to come.", "hasanswer": false}]}
