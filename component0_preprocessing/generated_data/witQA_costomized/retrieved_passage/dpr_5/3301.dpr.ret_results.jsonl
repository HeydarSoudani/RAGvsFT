A separate block of feature films (and occasionally, other entertainment programs) also airs overnights on Monday through Wednesdays from 3:30 to 5:00 a.m., Thursdays and Fridays from 3:00 to 5:00 a.m., and weekends from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time.

The current judging panel consists of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke, making Horwood the only judge to remain with the programme since its inception.

Its base programming feed provides various types of general entertainment programming weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m., Saturdays from 8:00 to 11:00 a.m. (the first three hours of which are occupied by the children's programming block, MiTelemundo, which features programs compliant with FCC educational programming requirements), and Sundays from 11:00 to 1:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. A separate block of feature films (and occasionally, other entertainment programs) also airs overnights on Monday through Wednesdays from 3:30 to 5:00 a.m., Thursdays and Fridays from 3:00 to 5:00 a.m., and weekends from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. All remaining time periods are filled with infomercials.\nWhile Telemundo's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates largely rely on Telemundo's master schedule to fill their broadcast day, many of its stations also produce their own local programming (which may pre-empt certain programs within the base network schedule), usually in the form of newscasts and public affairs programs (production of local infotainment programming, and leasing of brokered programs such as direct response and religious content, is at the station's discretion). Many Telemundo stations usually air limited local news programming, which are commonly reserved for early and late evening timeslots on Monday through Friday nights; some Telemundo stations may also air newscasts on weekday mornings (these are mainly limited to the network's O&Os in larger markets) or on weekend evenings.\nThe majority of Telemundo's programming consists of first-run telenovelas and series, many of which are produced by the network itself through its Telemundo Studios unit; however, some shows broadcasts by the network are produced by outside companies (including Caracol Television and Promofilm). Telemundo's schedule does not incorporate situation comedies, although some comedy series have aired on the network in the past, particularly during the 1990s and early 2000s. Variety shows, a common format in Spanish language television in the U.S. and other countries, have had a limited presence on Telemundo's lineup in recent years; with La Voz Kids being the only such show appearing on the network as of July 2013. Two additional variety series debuted in 2015: Si Se Puede, an adaptation of the Armoza Formats celebrity talent competition franchise I Can Do That, and \u00a1Qu\u00e9 Noche! con Angelica y Raul (\"What a Night! with Angelica and Raul\"), a family-oriented series using the traditional Saturday evening variety program model that was created to fill part of the void opened up by the cancellation of Univision's Sabado Gigante.From 2010 to 2013, Telemundo utilized an off-time scheduling format for its prime time programming (similar to the \"Turner Time\" format used by TBS from 1981 to 2000), in which programs that aired weeknights from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) started on a three-minute delay \u2013 resulting from intentional overruns of the network's 7:00 p.m. program (Caso Cerrado: Edi\u0107ion Estelar (\"Case Closed: Special Edition\")) into the 8:00 p.m. timeslot. As a result, until this format was discontinued, conventional \"top-and-bottom\" start times were not restored until the evening's final prime time program aired at 10:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific), allowing late local newscasts seen on some Telemundo stations to start at 11:00 p.m. (or 10:00 p.m. in the Central and Mountain Time Zones).\nDaytime programming on weekdays features a mix of consisting of repeats of past Telemundo-produced telenovelas and acquired serials (which are re-edited as extended 90-minute and two-hour episodes) during the late morning and early afternoon hours, while newsmagazine, reality and court series (such as Caso Cerrado (\"Case Closed\") and Suelta La Sopa (\"Tell Me What You Know\")) making up its afternoon programming. The network also regularly airs Spanish-dubbed English-language films (primarily those produced by American film studios such as Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment) that make up much of the network's weekend afternoon and prime time lineup, as well as films natively produced in Spanish (imported from various Latin American countries) that it usually airs daily during the overnight hours; the network also airs films in place of regularly scheduled programming on select national holidays (such as Thanksgiving and Christmas).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "3301_39781", "text": "Educational programming began to be broadcast by Rede Globo on 16 January 1978 when the secondary-school oriented Telecurso 2o Grau started broadcasting; it was initially created by Rede Globo in conjunction with the Padre Anchieta Foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Padre Anchieta) and the Roberto Marinho Foundation. Unlike almost all other programs shown by Rede Globo, the program was presented commercial-free for its entire run due to its educational nature, although promos for the network's shows and public service announcements were still shown in between segments of the program. In 1981, Telecurso was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes with the launch of Telecurso 1o Grau, which concentrated on educational lessons for elementary school children.\nIn 1986, the Roberto Marinho Foundation retitled the original program as Novo Telecurso 2o Grau and a new partnership was obtained with Bradesco; the courses featured were authorized to become a valid form of educative material in schools around Brazil, as well as in certain companies. On 2 January 1995, the entire educational programming block was rebranded as Telecurso 2000 and expanded to 45 minutes with the launch of Telecurso 2000 Profissionalizante (which focused on vocational subjects).\nOn 31 March 2008, the program was reformatted as Novo Telecurso, which removed outdated segments of geography and history that were no longer being used and replaced them with philosophy, visual arts, music, theatre, sociology, and Spanish language topics that were aimed at secondary students who have not completed their education. In 2009, a new partnership was attained with SENAI-SP for the vocational segments of the program.On 28 November 2014, Telecurso aired for the last time on Rede Globo.
