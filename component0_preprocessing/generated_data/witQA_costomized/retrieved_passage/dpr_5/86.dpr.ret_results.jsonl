Its lyrics are about obsession with a love interest. Music critics praised the song's production and Minogue's vocals and labelled it a highlight of Fever.\nThe song reached number one on the charts in 40 countries worldwide. It peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart for four weeks and was certified three-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also topped the Australian Singles Chart and received a three-times Platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association.

The session for \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" began with Davis generating a 125 bpm drum loop using the computer program Cubase. Dennis improvised with the line \"I just can't get you out of my head\", which later became the song's lyric. After three and a half hours, Davis and Dennis had recorded the demo for \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" and the vocals were recorded the same day; the pair said the recording process was \"very natural and fluid\", and did not rely on heavy instrumentation.Prior to pitching the song to Kylie Minogue, Davis and Dennis unsuccessfully offered it to S Club 7 and Sophie Ellis-Bextor. Davis then met with Minogue's A&R executive Jamie Nelson, who was impressed by the song's upbeat production and thought it would appeal to clubgoers. Nelson booked the song for Minogue to record. Although Davis thought the recording session would later be cancelled, Minogue wanted to record the song after hearing 20 seconds of the demo. The song was recorded at Davis's home studio in Surrey, England. The music, except the guitar part, was programmed using a Korg Triton workstation via a MIDI interface. Tim Orford was the mix engineer for the song. In a 2011 interview Dennis stated, \"even though Kylie wasn't the first artist to be offered the song, I don't believe anyone else would have done the incredible job she did with it\".In 2001, Minogue embarked on the On a Night Like This tour to promote her seventh studio album Light Years (2000). She premiered \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" on stage during the tour. It was later chosen as the lead single from Minogue's eighth studio album Fever and Parlophone Records released it on 8 September 2001 in Australia and on 17 September in the United Kingdom and other European countries. On 22 October 2001, a CD single was launched in New Zealand.

Everett True of The Guardian wrote the song continued Kylie's transition from the girl-next-door to \"flirtatious, sophisticated persona\" that started with the release of \"Spinning Around\" in 2000. True said the success of \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" was one of the motivating factors behind \"manufactured\" pop music gaining \"new postmodern respectability\" and marked a \"clear shift in attitude towards pop music among the 'serious' rock critic fraternity\".Publications like The Guardian and Rolling Stone recognise \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" as Minogue's signature song.

According to Davis, it \"breaks a few rules as it starts with a chorus and in comes the 'la's'\". Minogue chants a \"la la la\" hook that is often noted as the song's most appealing part by music critics. According to BBC Radio 2, the song's composition is \"deceptively simple, but its veins run with the whole history of electronic music\". The writer described the song's bassline as \"pulsing\" and influenced by the music of English rock band New Order and German electronic music band Kraftwerk.\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" is about an obsession with an unknown person, who according to The Guardian's Dorian Lansky could be \"a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn't know [the song's narrator] exists\". Writing for the same newspaper, Everett True identified a \"darker element\" in the simple lyrics and said this sentiment is echoed in Minogue's restrained vocals. True also said while Minogue's earlier work presented an optimistic romantic future, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" focuses on an unhealthy and potentially destructive obsession. He noted in her earlier songs, Minogue played \"the wide-eyed ing\u00e9nue with alacrity\" but that in this track, she is aware of the harmful nature of her infatuation, which True called a \"desire that is wholly dependent on her own self-control\".In 2012, Minogue re-recorded \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" for her orchestral compilation album The Abbey Road Sessions.

The first performance was given (in a French translation by Paul Millet) at the Casino Municipal in Nice on 1 April 1913. Paris and Madrid performances followed, later in 1913 and in 1914 respectively.  Claude Debussy played a major role in influencing Falla to transform it from the number opera it was at its Nice premiere to an opera with a more continuous musical texture and more mature orchestration.

(Fritz Kreisler in 1926 arranged for violin and piano the dance from this pairing under the spurious title Danse espagnole.)

Martin stated the lyrics of \"Violet Hill\" were a commentary on Fox News. Other songs, such as the double track \"Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love\" and \"Yes\", are about love and desire.\nRevolutionary themes are also an important part of the album and its promotion. Coldplay used customised French revolutionary costumes throughout the Viva la Vida Tour and in the videos produced for the album's singles. In an interview for the Latin American TV channel Boomerang in 2010, Martin said that a big inspiration for the record was Victor Hugo's book Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2014which can be noted by the French revolution themes on \"Viva la Vida\", for example.The work of the Beatles is apparently an inspiration throughout the album, starting with orchestration on the title track. The song \"Violet Hill\", with its distorted guitar riffs and bluesy undertones, references the Beatles' album Abbey Road (1969), being named after a street near Abbey Road and borrowing its rhythm from the Beatles. At the 2009 Grammy Awards, when accepting the award for Song of the Year, Will Champion joked: \"I'd like to say, first of all, thank you and sorry to Sir Paul McCartney for blatantly recycling the Sgt. Pepper outfits.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The rhythmic structure of the phrases is based on Satie's original, usually on the vocal line, occasionally on the orchestral parts. The pitches were determined using chance operations with the I Ching, through the following questions:\n\nWhich of the seven modes, if we take as modes the seven scales beginning on white notes and remaining on white notes, which of those am I using?\nWhich of the twelve possible chromatic transpositions am I using?\nFor this phrase for which this transposition of this mode will apply, which note am I using of the seven to imitate the note that Satie wrote?Cage observed phrase and note repeats present in Satie's melodies, adding them to his imitation.\nThe use of modes was unusual in that Cage used chromatic transpositions; the composer called Cheap Imitation a chromatic modal piece.The violin version, completed in 1977, was a collaboration with Paul Zukofsky. This transcription is transposed a major third higher than the original (otherwise several notes would be out of range of the instrument) and is identical to it, except for a few passages.Cage would subsequently write several more pieces based on other composers' works, similarly using chance procedures to alter the originals. These include several solos from Song Books (1970), \"harmonies\" from Apartment House 1776 (1976), Some of \"The Harmony of Maine\" (1978) and Hymns and Variations (1979).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_49887", "text": "Like numerous other works by Cage, Cheap Imitation was a result of his collaboration with Merce Cunningham's dance company. However, in this case the original choreography relied not on Cage's music, but on a piano arrangement of Erik Satie's symphonic drama Socrate. In 1947 Cunningham choreographed a dance based on the first movement of Satie's work, and Cage provided a two-piano transcription of the music (since Cunningham's dances were usually accompanied by piano only). In 1968 it was decided to expand the choreography by two movements, based on the remaining two movements of the Satie work. Cage, who was at the time working on HPSCHD, a large multimedia work, requested help of an acquaintance from the University of Illinois, Arthur Maddox, and together they completed a two-piano arrangement of the remaining two movements. The new choreography was to be premiered in early 1970.\nHowever, in December 1969 Cage received news from Satie's publisher, \u00c9ditions Max Eschig, that he had been refused the rights to perform the piece, although Eschig hadn't even requested to see the transcription. Because the choreography was based on the rhythms and structure of Socrate, Cage could not simply compose a new piece of music. He decided to imitate Satie's work in a piano solo. Cage titled the result Cheap Imitation, and Cunningham responded in kind, naming the choreography Second Hand.Cheap Imitation became the last work Cage performed in public as a pianist: arthritis prevented him from doing any more performances. Nevertheless, even though his hands were painfully swollen, he still played it during the 1970s. Cage grew more and more fascinated with the piece, producing transcriptions for orchestra of a minimum of 24 performers and a maximum of 95 (1972) and for solo violin (1977) at the request of the violinist Paul Zukofsky (who in 1989\u201390 also assisted Cage in completing the Freeman Etudes, which had been started in 1977\u201380). The orchestral versions, however, were not performed until much later, because the musicians refused to rehearse and would subsequently discover the piece was too difficult for them.Cheap Imitation became something of a departure for Cage, because it was his first \"proper\" composition, in the old sense of the word, since 1962. Furthermore, the open declaration of Cage's own feelings (about Satie's work) was something very unusual for his work, which was, since the late 1940s, almost entirely impersonal. Cage himself was well aware of the contradiction between the rest of his works and Cheap Imitation: \n\nIn the rest of my work, I'm in harmony with myself ... But Cheap Imitation clearly takes me away from all that. So if my ideas sink into confusion, I owe that confusion to love. ... Obviously, Cheap Imitation lies outside of what may seem necessary in my work in general, and that's disturbing.

It was published by Microsoft Game Studios in 2007 in Japan and 2008 in western territories. The story follows Kaim, one of a select group of \"immortals\" who have lost their memories: while confronting threats generated by the world's approaching magical industrial revolution, he must also face the pain brought by his returning memories. The gameplay features many staples of the genre, such as navigation using a world map, random encounters, and a turn-based battle system.\nFirst discussions surrounding Lost Odyssey began in 2003, with development beginning the following year as an internal Microsoft project. After running into difficulties, Feelplus was established as a dedicated studio to work on the game. The story was written by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Japanese author Kiyoshi Shigematsu: Sakaguchi wanted to create a story focusing on evoking human emotions, and kept the gameplay within genre traditions so he could experiment with the story. The game went through a difficult development, with problems stemming from the chosen engine technology and the arrangement of development teams. The music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, a veteran composer for the Final Fantasy series.\nFirst hinted at in 2005, the game was officially revealed shortly before that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo. At the time it was released, it was Microsoft's largest console game, spanning four dual-layer DVDs. Upon its debut in Japan, it sold favourably, eventually selling nearly 110,000 units by April 2010. It also received strong sales overseas.

In Xuxa Kid, Xuxa would become a 10-year-old girl, similar to what would happen years later in Xuxa em Sonho de Menina (2007). In the story, the young version of the presenter would have the duo Sandy and Junior as their friends. The recordings were planned for September and would be released in December.\nHowever, Globo Filmes decided to veto the participation of the pair because there were already plans to launch a film with the brothers as protagonists, a fact that only came to fruition in 2003. Because of this decision, the story of the film had to be completely changed and the launch of a new film was delayed until March 2001.After the project was canceled, Xuxa was persuaded by her team to make a new film, with a new script, that would rekindle her teen audience, as well as the previous one, and that the idea for a movie for the children's audience would be for next year. His manager then had the idea of making a film that could put musical attractions, just like in the previous one, to attract the adolescent public, that accompanied Xuxa in its TV series Planeta Xuxa. \"In some cases it was possible to sew the musical appearance in the plot, but many entries were due to the invitation made by Marlene in the middle of filming,\" says screenwriter Vivian Perl. Diler Andrade defines the insertions of musical numbers (in a non-musical film) as a \"strategic marriage\" between the cinematographic and phonographic industry. \"We need to repeat the feat of the music industry, which holds 80% of the market, against 20% of foreign artists. Vivian Perl says that Xuxa manager Marlene Mattos put the musical number on the film after conducting research on the most popular groups. The recordings began in September 2000.According to the presenter, the film recounts a little of the story she lived when she spent three months in the United States early in her modeling career. \"It is very difficult to face the lack of your country. We miss everything and have an hour that feels like coming back,\" he said. But it was not only this aspect that Xuxa wanted to show with the film. According to her the intention was to show the glamor that exists in the profession, but at the same time, get very close to reality by showing the difficulties of the career. \"I wanted to gather some of the glamorous life that everyone wants with the difficulties that exist to achieve that dream,\" he said. According to the presenter, being a model, actress and soccer player is the dream of most children. The deduction came from a research in which the production took as a base to realize the film.Xuxa said that the film is not necessarily for the children's audience, but for the family, The team's great pride, according to Xuxa, was to make a film \"that brings an important message to children\". \"We did a research and found that boys want to be football players and girls, models, models and singers. I think it's important that they know that it takes a lot of head not to fall on the bad side of the profession, that has drugs, prostitution.\"The film does not escape the standard of the cinematographic productions of Xuxa, There are no missing musical numbers - which, many times, arise without connection with the plot - and very, merchandising. the groups Harmonia do Samba, As Meninas, Os Travessos, KLB, SNZ and \u00c9 o Tchan: and the singers Deborah Blando and Mauricio Manieri participated in the film. With little script and excesses, the film has excessive merchandising of brands of companies, or recording artists. In the interview, Xuxa, moved, thanks the artists who participated in the movie \"without charging money\", just for the good will to be in the film. The film also has unusual appearances by presenter Ot\u00e1vio Mesquita, singer Leonardo and model Gianne Albertoni. Also present are S\u00edlvia Pfeifer, Claudia Rodrigues and veteran Claudio Corr\u00eaa e Castro. According to Vivian Perl, who wrote the story in partnership with Elizeu Ewald, the musical number serves to \"illustrate a moment of introspection\" of the protagonist.The actors Thiago Lacerda, Marcello Antony and Reynaldo Gianecchini were invited to interpret Ricardo the romantic pair of Xuxa in the film, but neither one of them could accept, and the pepel ended up being interpreted by Luigi Baricelli. The scene of the kiss between Nick and Ray of Light was repeated dozens of times. The interpretation was so intense that at that time some tabloids even published that there was no technical kiss and that Xuxa and Luigi Baricelli would have a love relationship.

At the marriage of Riitta Sibelius, a niece of the composer, in 1929, Andante festivo was performed by two string quartets, perhaps with modifications.Sibelius listened often to the radio in the 1930s. He thought about composing for the radio in a different way, to accommodate the distortions created by the loudspeakers of the time. When Olin Downes, a critic of The New York Times, asked him to \"conduct a piece of music as Finland's greeting to the world in a radio broadcast to celebrate the New York World Exhibition\", he tried the concept by adapting the former string quartet. Full-throated and hymnic, this piece is a smooth, continuous stream of similar melodic phrases that flow into and out of each other. Sibelius was a violinist and knew how to compose for strings. A \"seamless repeated melody\" is played by the strings and answered in the last four bars by the timpani, in an almost religious statement in a world before a Second World War.The version for strings and timpani was first performed in a broadcast on 1 January 1939 by the Radio Orchestra conducted by the composer, as the only recorded example of the composer interpreting one of his own works.

It was first presented at the Salle Le Peletier by the Paris Opera Ballet on 1 April 1846 and was retained in the repertory of the Op\u00e9ra until 1851.In 1847, Paquita was staged for the first time in Russia for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg by Marius Petipa and Pierre-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malavergne, being the first work ever staged by Petipa in Russia. In 1881, Petipa produced a revival of the ballet for which he added new pieces specially composed by Ludwig Minkus. This included the Paquita pas de trois for the first act and the Paquita grand pas classique and the Mazurka des enfants for the last act. Petipa's version of Paquita was retained in the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre until 1926.Petipa's 1881 additions for Paquita survived long after the full-length ballet left the stage. Today these pieces, particularly the Grand pas classique, are major cornerstones of the traditional classical ballet repertory and have been staged by ballet companies throughout the world.Petipa's choreography for the Imperial Ballet's production of Paquita was notated in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation around 1902. The notations were made while Petipa himself taught and rehearsed the great Anna Pavlova for her d\u00e9but in the title r\u00f4le. Today, this notation is part of the Sergeyev Collection, a cache of notations and other materials that document many of the works in the Imperial Ballet's repertory during the twilight of the Russian Empire.In 2001, director Brigitte Lef\u00e8vre asked French choreographer Pierre Lacotte to produce a revival of the full-length two act Paquita for the Paris Opera Ballet. Although Lacotte re-choreographed all of the ballet himself, he restored Joseph Mazilier's original mime sequences and mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, as well as Petipa's 1881 additions. Paquita was performed again by the Paris Opera in 2007.In 2014, the Stepanov notation expert Doug Fullington and Russian choreographer Alexei Ratmansky mounted a reconstruction of Petipa's final revival of Paquita for the Bayerisches Staatsballett.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "57_33010", "text": "The film's original score was composed by Ryan Shore.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50216", "text": "In Marius Petipa and Ludwig Minkus's original staging of the Paquita grand pas classique in 1881, only one variation was included for the leading ballerina Ekaterina Vazem, being a polonaise arranged for solo violin.\nAnna Pavlova included the Grand Pas classique in her company's repertory.Rudolf Nureyev staged the piece in 1964 for the Royal Academy of Dancing, and at La Scala in 1970.

The band broke up in March 2004 after frontman Valfar died of hypothermia after becoming caught in a blizzard on his way to his family's cabin in Norway. Following his death, the remaining band members went on to form a number of new bands including Vreid, Mistur, and Cor Scorpii.\nMost of the band's early albums featured lyrics written in frontman Valfar's native dialect, Sognam\u00e5l. The band had an \"intense affinity for traditional music and Norwegian texts, drawing much of its lyrical content from local sagas, using traditional folk tunes in its music, and singing in an archaic rural dialect.\" With the coining of the term, the genre \"Sognametal\" as established by Windir has inspired many bands from the small region of Sogn og Fjordane, most of whom are ex-members of Windir or friends of them. These bands include: Vreid, Cor Scorpii, Mistur, Sigtyr and Feigd.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Goeyvaert's and Stockhausen's analysis and performance of the second movement of the Sonata in Theodor W. Adorno's composition seminar had considerable significance for those young composers eager to develop serial thinking. The influence of the Sonata is also evident in Stockhausen's early serial compositions, particularly Kreuzspiel, which Stockhausen began composing on his way home from Darmstadt and finished on 4 November 1951. Adorno, however, did not appreciate the qualities of the work's second movement, because he could not find any motivic coherence in it.

Bach's technique of the fugue is \"amalgamated\" with elements of the Viennese Classical and Preclassical periods, and of the early Romantic (Schubert).The Quoniam quotes from Joseph Haydn's Missa Sancti Bernardi von Offida. As in Bruckner's later great masses, the setting of the words Et resurrexit is preceded by the \"old-fashioned rhetorical gesture\" of a \"rising chromatic figure in stile agitato representing the trembling of the earth\". This rising chromatic figure is repeated before the Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum. Several passages of the Missa solemnis, particularly the Qui tollis of the Gloria and the central part of the Credo, prefigure Bruckner's next Mass No. 1 in D minor.

It was here that McCartney wrote \"Can't Buy Me Love\". The song was written under the pressure of the success achieved by \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", which had just reached number one in America. When producer George Martin first heard \"Can't Buy Me Love\", he felt that the song needed changing: \"I thought that we really needed a tag for the song's ending, and a tag for the beginning; a kind of intro. So I took the first two lines of the chorus and changed the ending, and said 'Let's just have these lines, and by altering the second phrase we can get back into the verse pretty quickly.'\" And they said: \"That's not a bad idea, we'll do it that way\". The song's verse is a twelve-bar blues in structure, a formula that the Beatles seldom applied to their own material.When pressed by American journalists in 1966 to reveal the song's \"true\" meaning, McCartney stated: \"I think you can put any interpretation you want on anything, but when someone suggests that 'Can't Buy Me Love' is about a prostitute, I draw the line.\" He went on to say: \"The idea behind it was that all these material possessions are all very well, but they won't buy me what I really want.\" However, he was to comment later: \"It should have been 'Can Buy Me Love'\" when reflecting on the perks that money and fame had brought him.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50272", "text": "\"Can't Buy Me Love\" was recorded on 29 January 1964 at EMI's Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris, France, where the Beatles were performing 18 days of concerts at the Olympia Theatre. At this time, EMI's West Germany branch, Odeon, insisted that the Beatles would not sell records in any significant numbers in Germany unless they were actually sung in the German language and the Beatles reluctantly agreed to re-record the vocals to \"She Loves You\" and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" prior to them being released in Germany. George Martin travelled to Paris with a newly mastered rhythm track for what was to be \"Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand\". \"Sie Liebt Dich\" required the Beatles to record a new rhythm track as the original two-track recording had been scrapped. EMI sent a translator to be present for this recording session which had been hurriedly arranged to tie in with the Beatles' Paris commitments. This was accomplished well within the allotted studio time, allowing the Beatles an opportunity to record the backing track, with a guide vocal, to the recently composed \"Can't Buy Me Love\". At this stage the song included background vocal harmonies, but after listening to the first take, the band concluded that the song did not need them. Therefore, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" became the first single the Beatles released without their characteristic background harmonies.\nMcCartney's final vocal was overdubbed at EMI Studios, Abbey Road, London, on 25 February. Also re-recorded on this day at EMI Studios was George Harrison's modified guitar solo, although his original solo can still just be heard in the background. Harrison said: \"What happened was, we recorded first in Paris and re-recorded in England. Obviously they'd tried to overdub it, but in those days they only had two tracks, so you can hear the version we put on in London, and in the background you can hear a quieter one.\" Helen Shapiro, a friend of the Beatles and present at this overdub session, says that Ringo Starr also added extra cymbals \"over the top\" and that \"apparently this was something he did quite often on their records\". \"Can't Buy Me Love\" is also the only English-language track that the Beatles recorded in a studio outside the UK, although the instrumentation of the band's 1968 B-side \"The Inner Light\" was recorded in India by Harrison and some Indian classical musicians.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Prince Kote, Levan's nephew, returns from a long journey and joins the festivities as everyone greets him joyously.   Prince Levan's matchmaker, Babusi, also promises to find a wife for Kote and then approaches the impoverished Levan to tell him that she has already found a wife for him, Keto, the beautiful daughter of the wealthy merchant Makar Tkuilkotriashvili.  Prince Levan is enjoying the party so much that he pays no attention.\nAs the guests move to the garden, Kote stops his uncle and asks for a word.  Kote tells Levan that he is in love and wants to marry, but that he fears his love's father will not approve.  Levan happily tells Kote that he too is planning to marry and believes that Tkuilkotriashviliwill not refuse him because of him impoverished state. Kote is overwhelmed to hear the name of Keto's father, and Levan becomes worried, but Kote quickly calms him down, and the Prince joins his guests in the garden.\nBarbale, another matchmaker, enters.  Kote rushes to her to tell her about his problem.  Barbale, calms him down, telling him to listen only to her and everything will be alright.  The now hopeful Kote leaves, bidding Barbale goodbye.  As Levan, Maro, and Babusi enter, Barbale approaches them, saying that she has already arranged Levan's marriage.  Everyone is surprised as now two matchmakers have arranged Levan's marriage.  A quarrel between the two breaks out.  Levan, trying to make peace, suggest settling the dispute by throwing lots.  Babusi wins.  The angry Barbale is ordered to leave.  She leaves, but is resolved to be the final winner.\nAct 2\nMakar is at home, sitting at a table and dreaming of money.  His mood is good as his daughter will shortly marry Prince Levan.  Soon Levan will arrive to meet his daughter, and Makar tells Keto to dress in her new clothes.  Keto asks her father not to marry her to Levan.  Makar orders her to be quiet and get ready.  Makar leaves, followed by the saddened Keto.\nKote arrives, wanting to see Keto.  She and Barbale soon appear, and Kote fears that an angry Makar may surprise them.  Barbale calms him down; if Makar comes, they will tell him that Kote is there to tune the piano.  Keto's cousins, Sacko and Sicko, enter in a happy mood singing a merry song about wine and food.  When Sicko congratulates her on her upcoming marriage to Prince Levan, she tells him she will not marry him as she loves another--Prince Kote, who is here now.  She points to him.\nAmidst the cousin's astonishment, Barbale produces a letter to Makar that she has allegedly found on Keto's table, saying that she is going to kill herself because she does not wish to marry a man she doesn't love.  She blames her father and her cousins who helped him.  Worried about this, Sacko and Sicko start to leave, but Barbale stops them as she needs their help.  Makar enters.  He is expecting Prince Levan and is nervous.  He asked everyone to prepare for the visit and leaves.\nBarbale shares her plan with the cousins.  She will dress in bridal clothes and present herself to the Prince in a most unseemly fashion, who will mistake her for Keto.  But Makar must be away from the house for this to work, so the cousins will forge a letter from the magistrate summoning him immediately.  The three of them, Barbale, Sicko, and Sacko quickly write the letter.\nSuddenly, they hear the noise of arriving guests who then enter, along with Makar.  Levan arrives shortly thereafter,  Makar is given the letter.  After reading the letter, he apologizes to the guests and leaves.  Barbale, dressed as a caricature of a bride, enters.  Her looks are unbecoming and her behavior is indelicate.  Disgusted, the guests leave, and an upset Levan draws his sword.  Everything is chaos as Makar returns followed by Babusi.  Seeing the enraged prince with a drawn sword, they turn and run away.\nAct 3\nMakar asks his nephews how was it possible that the prince did not like Keto.  Sacko blames Babusi, and Makar has done the right thing in summoning Barbale, who will solve the problem.  Barbale enters greeting Makar politely.  Even though Makar has repeatedly insulted her, she is willing--for a certain amount of money--to help him.  The wedding is scheduled for one hour hence.   Makar quickly give her half the money and signs a letter agreeing to his daughter's marriage to Prince .........  In his astonishment, he forget the first name, and Barbale provides \"Kote.\"  When Keto enters, Makar tells her to follow Barbale and to do whatever Barbale tell her to do.  Barbale sends Keto to the church where Kote awaits.\nSuddenly, Babusi enters accusing Barbale of thwarting the arrangement.  Makar is told that he has written in the wrong name.  They rush to the church, but it is too late.  Keto and Kote are already married.  The newlyweds enter and reflect that now no one will be able to take away their happiness.  Makar enters with Levan intent on showing him how beautiful his daughter really is.  The guests gather round.\nSacko ask Makar to bless the couple.  He is about to start a quarrel, but Levan calms him down.  He is truly happy for his nephew and gives him half his property.  \"Which property?\"  Makar asks.  \"The property you have the lien on,\"  Levan replies.  Everyone congratulates the couple, and Barbale is proud of her victory.  She already has another prospective bride lined up for Levan.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This narrative is believed to be in part autobiographical; musicologist Richard Taruskin characterized it as the voice of \"a neurotically self-absorbed, broken-down aristocrat.\" Scholars have speculated that this pessimism may have arisen from the poor reception of Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov, the death of Mussorgsky's friends Viktor Gartmann and Nadezhda Opochinina in 1873-74, tensions in Mussorgsky's relationship with Golenishchev-Kutuzov, and/or the class tensions of the decade. \nSunless was described by scholar Simon Perry as \"aesthetically and stylistically anomalous\" among Mussorgsky's work, makes use of symmetrical or \u201csynthetic\u201d chromaticism.The song cycle, like Boris Godunov, met a scathing reception, and Mussorgsky did not mention it in his autobiography.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "136_37795", "text": "All songs were written by Van Morrison, except where noted.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "162_68944", "text": "From M.E. to Myself (simplified Chinese: \u548c\u81ea\u5df1\u5bf9\u8bdd; traditional Chinese: \u548c\u81ea\u5df1\u5c0d\u8a71) is the twelfth studio album by Singaporean singer JJ Lin, released on 25 December 2015 by Warner Music Taiwan.The album earned Lin two Golden Melody Awards for Best Mandarin Male Singer and Best Composer for \"Twilight\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "162_68829", "text": "All lyrics are written by Roger Waters.\n\nNote\n\nSince the 2011 remasters, and the Discovery box set, \"Speak to Me\" and \"Breathe (In the Air)\" are indexed as individual tracks.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The opera was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1639\u20131640 carnival season. The story, taken from the second half of Homer's Odyssey, tells how constancy and virtue are ultimately rewarded, treachery and deception overcome. After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to his kingdom where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope. With the assistance of the gods, his son Telemaco and a staunch friend Eumete, Ulisse vanquishes the suitors and recovers his kingdom.\nIl ritorno is the first of three full-length works which Monteverdi wrote for the burgeoning Venetian opera industry during the last five years of his life. After its initial successful run in Venice the opera was performed in Bologna before returning to Venice for the 1640\u201341 season. Thereafter, except for a possible performance at the Imperial court in Vienna late in the 17th century, there were no further revivals until the 20th century. The music became known in modern times through the 19th-century discovery of an incomplete manuscript score which in many respects is inconsistent with the surviving versions of the libretto. After its publication in 1922 the score's authenticity was widely questioned, and performances of the opera remained rare during the next 30 years. By the 1950s the work was generally accepted as Monteverdi's, and after revivals in Vienna and Glyndebourne in the early 1970s it became increasingly popular. It has since been performed in opera houses all over the world, and has been recorded many times.\nTogether with Monteverdi's other Venetian stage works, Il ritorno is classified as one of the first modern operas. Its music, while showing the influence of earlier works, also demonstrates Monteverdi's development as a composer of opera, through his use of fashionable forms such as arioso, duet and ensemble alongside the older-style recitative. By using a variety of musical styles, Monteverdi is able to express the feelings and emotions of a great range of characters, divine and human, through their music.

Elijah is modelled on the oratorios of these two Baroque masters; however, in its lyricism and use of orchestral and choral colour the style clearly reflects Mendelssohn's own skill as an early Romantic composer.The work is scored for eight vocal soloists (two each of bass, tenor, alto, soprano), full symphony orchestra including 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, ophicleide, timpani, organ and strings and a large chorus usually singing in four, but occasionally eight parts. The title role was sung at the premiere by the Austrian bass Josef Staudigl.Mendelssohn had discussed an oratorio based on Elijah in the late 1830s with his friend Karl Klingemann, who had provided him with the libretto for his comic operetta Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde, which resulted in a partial text that Klingemann was unable to finish. Mendelssohn then turned to Julius Schubring, the librettist for his earlier oratorio St. Paul, who quickly abandoned Klingemann's work and produced his own text that combined the story of Elijah as told in the Book of Kings with psalms. In 1845, the Birmingham Festival commissioned an oratorio from Mendelssohn, who worked with Schubring to put the text in final form and in 1845 and 1846 composed his oratorio to the German and English texts in parallel, taking care to change musical phrases to suit the rhythms and stresses of the translation by William Bartholomew, a chemist who was also an experienced amateur poet and composer.The oratorio was first performed on 26 August 1846 at Birmingham Town Hall in its English version, conducted by the composer, and it was immediately acclaimed a classic of the genre. As The Times critic wrote: 'Never was there a more complete triumph  \u2013 never a more thorough and speedy recognition of a great work of art'. Notwithstanding the work's triumph, Mendelssohn revised his oratorio wholesale before another group of performances in London in April 1847  \u2013 one (23 April) in the presence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The German version was first performed on the composer's birthday, 3 February 1848, in Leipzig, a few months after Mendelssohn's death, under the baton of the composer Niels Gade.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50588", "text": "Elijah was popular at its premiere and has been frequently performed, particularly in English-speaking countries, ever since. It is a particular favourite of amateur choral societies. Its melodrama, easy appeal and stirring choruses have provided the basis for countless successful performances. Prince Albert inscribed a libretto for the oratorio Elijah in 1847: \"To the noble artist who, surrounded by the Baal-worship of false art, has been able, like a second Elijah, through genius and study, to remain true to the service of true art.\" A number of critics later treated the work harshly, however, emphasizing its conventional outlook and undaring musical style. Bernard Shaw wrote in 1892:\nI sat out the performance on Wednesday to the last note, an act of professional devotion which was no part of my plan for the evening ... You have only to think of Parsifal, of the Ninth Symphony, of Die Zauberfl\u00f6te, of the inspired moments of Bach and Handel, to see the great gulf that lies between the true religious sentiment and our delight in Mendelssohn's exquisite prettiness.Similarly, after Boston's Handel and Haydn Society presented the work for the first time in February 1848, its success resulted in eight more performances that spring. In the mid-1920s, however, H.T. Parker, the city's principal music critic, described how members of the audience gazed upward at a recent performance: \"How many of those eyes were there in rapture, or were counting the four dead lights in the central sunburst of the ceiling?.... Elijah is hopelessly, awfully, irremediably mid-Victorian.However, with the widespread re-evaluation of Mendelssohn\u2019s work in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, these critical opinions have largely changed. In his definitive biography of the composer, the musicologist R. Larry Todd wrote that \u201cthe oratorio was the crowning achievement of Felix\u2019s career\u201d. And in 2005 critic and musicologist Michael Steinberg described Elijah as \u201cthrilling to sing\u201d and noted that it \u201cincludes some of Mendelssohn\u2019s finest music\u201d.Mendelssohn wrote the soprano part in Elijah for the 'Swedish Nightingale', Jenny Lind, although she was unavailable to sing the Birmingham premiere. In her place, the part was created by Maria Caterina Rosalbina Caradori-Allan. Lind was devastated by the composer's premature death in 1847.  She did not feel able to sing the part for a year afterwards. She resumed singing the piece at Exeter Hall in London in late 1848, raising \u00a31,000 to fund a scholarship in his name.  After Arthur Sullivan became the first recipient of the Mendelssohn Scholarship, she encouraged him in his career.Charles Salaman adapted \"He that Shall Endure to the End\" from Elijah as a setting for Psalm 93 (Adonai Malakh), sung on most Friday nights at the sabbath-eve service of the London Spanish & Portuguese Jewish community.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50319", "text": "In Alium is a 1968 work by British composer John Tavener.

Frank Loesser, who had spent most of his career as a lyricist for movie musicals, was hired as composer and lyricist. George S. Kaufman was hired as director. When the first version of the show's book, or dialogue, written by Jo Swerling was deemed unusable, Feuer and Martin asked radio comedy writer Abe Burrows to rewrite it.Loesser had already written much of the score to correspond with the first version of the book.

Levene's lack of singing ability is the reason the lead role of Nathan Detroit only has one song, the duet \"Sue Me\".\nComposer and lyricist Frank Loesser specifically wrote \"Sue Me\" for Sam Levene, and structured the song so he and Vivian Blaine never sang their showstopping duet together. The son of a cantor, Sam Levene was fluent in Yiddish: \"Alright, already, I'm just a no-goodnick; alright, already, it\u2019s true, so nu?

It was first performed as a two-act \"op\u00e9ra bouffon\" at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes-Parisiens, Paris, on 21 October 1858, and was extensively revised and expanded in a four-act \"op\u00e9ra f\u00e9erie\" version, presented at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9, Paris, on 7 February 1874.\nThe opera is a lampoon of the ancient legend of Orpheus and Eurydice. In this version Orpheus is not the son of Apollo but a rustic violin teacher. He is glad to be rid of his wife, Eurydice, when she is abducted by the god of the underworld, Pluto. Orpheus has to be bullied by Public Opinion into trying to rescue Eurydice. The reprehensible conduct of the gods of Olympus in the opera was widely seen as a veiled satire of the court and government of Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Some critics expressed outrage at the librettists' disrespect for classic mythology and the composer's parody of Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice; others praised the piece highly.\nOrph\u00e9e aux enfers was Offenbach's first full-length opera. The original 1858 production became a box-office success, and ran well into the following year, rescuing Offenbach and his Bouffes company from financial difficulty. The 1874 revival broke records at the Ga\u00eet\u00e9's box-office. The work was frequently staged in France and internationally during the composer's lifetime and throughout the 20th century. It is one of his most often performed operas, and continues to be revived in the 21st century.\nIn the last decade of the 19th century the Paris cabarets the Moulin Rouge and Folies Berg\u00e8re adopted the music of the \"Galop infernal\" from the culminating scene of the opera to accompany the can-can, and ever since then the tune has been popularly associated with the dance.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50629", "text": "Between 1855 and 1858 Offenbach presented more than two dozen one-act operettas, first at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Lacaze, and then at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Choiseul. The theatrical licensing laws then permitted him only four singers in any piece, and with such small casts, full-length works were out of the question. In 1858 the licensing restrictions were relaxed, and Offenbach was free to go ahead with a two-act work that had been in his mind for some time. Two years earlier he had told his friend the writer Hector Cr\u00e9mieux that when he was musical director of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in the early 1850s he swore revenge for the boredom he suffered from the posturings of mythical heroes and gods of Olympus in the plays presented there. Cremieux and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy sketched out a libretto for him lampooning such characters. By 1858, when Offenbach was finally allowed a large enough cast to do the theme justice, Hal\u00e9vy was preoccupied with his work as a senior civil servant, and the final libretto was credited to Cr\u00e9mieux alone. Most of the roles were written with popular members of the Bouffes company in mind, including D\u00e9sir\u00e9, L\u00e9once, Lise Tautin, and Henri Tayau as an Orph\u00e9e who could actually play Orpheus's violin.\nThe first performance took place at the Salle Choiseul on 21 October 1858. At first the piece did reasonably well at the box-office but was not the tremendous success Offenbach had hoped for. He insisted on lavish stagings for his operas: expenses were apt to outrun receipts, and he was in need of a substantial money-spinner. Business received an inadvertent boost from the critic Jules Janin of the Journal des d\u00e9bats. He had praised earlier productions at the Bouffes-Parisiens but was roused to vehement indignation at what he maintained was a blasphemous, lascivious outrage \u2013 \"a profanation of holy and glorious antiquity\". His attack, and the irreverent public ripostes by Cr\u00e9mieux and Offenbach, made headlines and provoked huge interest in the piece among the Parisian public, who flocked to see it. In his 1980 study of Offenbach, Alexander Faris writes, \"Orph\u00e9e became not only a triumph, but a cult.\" It ran for 228 performances, at a time when a run of 100 nights was considered a success. Albert Lasalle, in his history of the Bouffes-Parisiens (1860), wrote that the piece closed in June 1859 \u2013 although it was still performing strongly at the box-office \u2013 \"because the actors, who could not tire the public, were themselves exhausted\".In 1874 Offenbach substantially expanded the piece, doubling the length of the score and turning the intimate op\u00e9ra bouffon of 1858 into a four-act op\u00e9ra f\u00e9erie extravaganza, with substantial ballet sequences. This version opened at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9 on 7 February 1874, ran for 290 performances, and broke box-office records for that theatre.

{"id": "86_211", "question": "What composer wrote the Christmas Oratorio?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_50640", "text": "The Christmas Oratorio (German: Weihnachtsoratorium), BWV 248, is an oratorio by Johann Sebastian Bach intended for performance in church during the Christmas season. It is in six parts, each part a cantata intended for performance in a church service on a feast day of the Christmas period. It was written for the Christmas season of 1734 and incorporates music from earlier compositions, including three secular cantatas written during 1733 and 1734 and a largely lost church cantata, BWV 248a. The date is confirmed in Bach's autograph manuscript. The next complete public performance was not until 17 December 1857 by the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin under Eduard Grell. The Christmas Oratorio is a particularly sophisticated example of parody music. The author of the text is unknown, although a likely collaborator was Christian Friedrich Henrici (Picander).\nThe work belongs to a group of three oratorios written in 1734 and 1735 for major feasts, the other two works being the Ascension Oratorio (BWV 11) and the Easter Oratorio (BWV 249). All three of these oratorios to some degree parody earlier compositions. The Christmas Oratorio is by far the longest and most complex work of the three.The first part (for Christmas Day) describes the Birth of Jesus, the second (for 26 December) the annunciation to the shepherds, the third (for 27 December) the adoration of the shepherds, the fourth (for New Year's Day) the circumcision and naming of Jesus, the fifth (for the first Sunday after New Year) the journey of the Magi, and the sixth (for Epiphany) the adoration of the Magi.\nThe running time for the entire oratorio is around three hours. In concert performance, it is often presented split into two parts.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50642", "text": "The ease with which the new text fits the existing music is one of the indications of how successful a parody the Christmas Oratorio is of its sources. Musicologist Alfred D\u00fcrr and others, such as Christoph Wolff have suggested that Bach's sometime collaborator Picander (the pen name of Christian Friedrich Henrici) wrote the new text, working closely with Bach to ensure a perfect fit with the re-used music. It may have even been the case that the Christmas Oratorio was already planned when Bach wrote the secular cantatas BWV 213, 214 and 215, given that the original works were written fairly close to the oratorio and the seamless way with which the new words fit the existing music.Nevertheless, on two occasions Bach abandoned the original plan and was compelled to write new music for the Christmas Oratorio. The alto aria in Part III, \"Schlie\u00dfe, mein Herze\" was originally to have been set to the music for the aria \"Durch die von Eifer entflammten Waffen\" from BWV 215. On this occasion, however, the parody technique proved to be unsuccessful and Bach composed the aria afresh. Instead, he used the model from BWV 215 for the bass aria \"Erleucht' auch meine finstre Sinnen\" in Part V. Similarly, the opening chorus to Part V, \"Ehre sei dir Gott!\" was almost certainly intended to be set to the music of the chorus \"Lust der V\u00f6lker, Lust der Deinen\" from BWV 213, given the close correspondence between the texts of the two pieces. The third major new piece of writing (with the notable exception of the recitatives), the sublime pastoral Sinfonia which opens Part II, was composed from scratch for the new work.\nIn addition to the new compositions listed above, special mention must go to the recitatives, which knit together the oratorio into a coherent whole. In particular, Bach made particularly effective use of recitative when combining it with chorales in no. 7 of part I (\"Er ist auf Erden kommen arm\") and even more ingeniously in the recitatives nos. 38 and 40 which frame the \"Echo Aria\" (\"Fl\u00f6\u00dft, mein Heiland\"), no. 39 in part IV.\nUntil 1999 the only complete English version of the Christmas Oratorio was that prepared in 1874 by John Troutbeck for the music publisher Novello.

Franz Schubert commented that, \"This is not music\"In spite of this, the opera has since had several champions. Victor Hugo in Les Mis\u00e9rables calls the huntsman's chorus in act 3 \"perhaps the most beautiful piece of music ever composed\". During his term as director of the Vienna State Opera, Gustav Mahler mounted a new production of Euryanthe in 1903. Despite amendments in the libretto by Mahler himself (who described von Ch\u00e9zy as a \"poetess with a full heart and an empty head\") and a few changes in the score there were only five performances. Mahler realised the weaknesses of the libretto and the absurdities of the plot; in particular, in the third act, the ludicrously implausible meeting of all the characters in the middle of a rocky waste, a scene which he always alluded to as 'the merry folk reunited'. Leo Slezak played Adolar, Leopold Demuth played Lysiart.The composer and musicologist Donald Francis Tovey regarded Euryanthe as musically superior to Wagner's better-known opera Lohengrin (whose plot and music echo Euryanthe in several respects, especially with regard to the use of Leitmotiv technique) and made a new performing version, while Arturo Toscanini conducted the La Scala premiere in 1902.

Floyd adapted the story from the Apocryphal tale of Susannah and the Elders, though the latter story has a more positive ending. The story focuses on 18-year-old Susannah Polk, an innocent girl who is targeted as a sinner in the small mountain town of New Hope Valley, in the Southern American state of Tennessee.\nThe opera was awarded the New York Music Critics Circle Award for Best New Opera in 1956 and was chosen to represent American music and culture at the World's Fair at Brussels in 1958, with a production (by Frank Corsaro) that featured Phyllis Curtin and Norman Treigle. It received its Metropolitan Opera premiere in 1999, with Ren\u00e9e Fleming singing the title role, Jerry Hadley singing Sam and Samuel Ramey singing Blitch. Ramey also recorded the complete opera with Cheryl Studer as Susannah and Jerry Hadley as Sam.  Other well-known sopranos who have portrayed the heroine have included Lee Venora, Joy Clements, Faith Esham, Maralin Niska, Nancy Shade, Diana Soviero, Karan Armstrong, Kelly Kaduce and Phyllis Treigle (opposite Michael Devlin as Blitch).\nSusannah is one of the most performed American operas, second to Porgy and Bess, and celebrated its 50th anniversary with a performance on the very stage where it premiered February 24, 1955, in Ruby Diamond Auditorium at Florida State University. At the first performance, Carlisle Floyd was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Florida State.\nIt has been speculated that the opera was inspired by McCarthyism, and threat of institutional Hollywood communist invasion of America during the early 1950s. The opera also contains many feminist themes that had not been widely explored in popular culture at the time of the opera's writing. Floyd said this opera was meant to be different from a traditional opera.The music is largely characterized by Appalachian folk melodies. Also included are some Protestant hymns and some traditional classical music. A particularly prominent part of the opera is Susannah's soaring and melancholy aria in Act II, \"The Trees on the Mountain\", which is similar to Appalachian folk tunes but in fact Floyd's own composition.

The evening follows a reunion of the Weismann Girls who performed during the interwar period. Several of the former showgirls perform their old numbers, often accompanied by the ghosts of their younger selves. The score offers a pastiche of 1920s and 1930s musical styles, evoking a nostalgic tone.\nThe original Broadway production, directed by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett, with choreography by Bennett, opened April 4, 1971. The musical was nominated for 11 Tony Awards and won seven. The original production, among the most costly on Broadway, ran for over 500 performances but ultimately lost its entire investment.

At its very start, ghosts of Follies showgirls stalk the stage, mythic giants in winged, feathered, black and white opulence. Similarly, ghosts of the Twenties shows slip through the evening as the characters try desperately to regain their youth through re-creations of their performances and inane theatre sentiments of their past.\"Joanne Gordon, author and chair and artistic director, Theatre, at California State University, Long Beach, wrote \"Follies is in part an affectionate look at the American musical theatre between the two World Wars and provides Sondheim with an opportunity to use the traditional conventions of the genre to reveal the hollowness and falsity of his characters' dreams and illusions.

Adams's first opera, it was inspired by U.S. president Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to the People's Republic of China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.\nTo create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.\nFollowing the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded at least five times. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company.

This musical style originated in the United States in the 1960s and is characterized by stasis and repetition in place of the melodic development associated with conventional music.  Although Adams is associated with minimalism, the composer's biographer, Sarah Cahill, asserts that of the composers classed as minimalists, Adams is \"by far the most anchored in Western classical tradition\".Timothy Johnson contends that Nixon in China goes beyond minimalism in important ways.  Adams had been inspired, in developing his art, by minimalist composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley, and this is reflected in the work by repetitive rhythmic patterns.  However, the opera's complex harmonic structures are very different from the simpler ones in, for example, Glass's Einstein on the Beach, which Adams terms \"mindlessly repetitive\"; Johnson nevertheless considers the Glass opera an influence on Nixon in China. As Glass's techniques did not allow Adams to accomplish what he wanted, he employed a system of constantly shifting metric organizational schemes to supplement the repeated rhythms in the opera.  The music is marked by metrical dissonance, which occurs both for musical reasons and in response to the text of the opera.The New York Times critic Allan Kozinn writes that with Nixon in China, Adams had produced a score that is both \"minimalist and eclectic ... In the orchestral interludes one hears references, both passing and lingering, to everything from Wagner to Gershwin and Philip Glass.\"  In reviewing the first recording of the work, Gramophone's critic discusses the mixture of styles and concludes that \"minimalist the score emphatically is not\". Other commentators have evoked \"neo-classical Stravinsky\", and concocted the term \"Mahler-meets-minimalism\", in attempts to pinpoint the opera's idiom.The opera is scored for an orchestra without bassoons, French horns, and tuba, but augmented by saxophones, pianos, and electronic synthesizer. The percussion section incorporates numerous special effects, including a wood block, sandpaper blocks, slapsticks and sleigh bells. The work opens with an orchestral prelude of repetitive ascending phrases, after which a chorus of the Chinese military sings solemn couplets against a subdued instrumental background. This, writes Tommasini, creates \"a hypnotic, quietly intense backdrop, pierced by fractured, brassy chords like some cosmic chorale\", in a manner reminiscent of Philip Glass.  Tommasini contrasts this with the arrival of Nixon and his entourage, when the orchestra erupts with \"big band bursts, rockish riffs and shards of fanfares: a heavy din of momentous pomp\".Gramophone's critic compares the sharply written exchanges between Nixon, Mao and Chou En-lai with the seemingly aimless wandering of the melodic lines in the more reflective sections of the work, concluding that the music best serves the libretto in passages of rapid dialogue. Tommasini observes that Nixon's own vocal lines reflect the real-life president's personal awkwardness and social unease.The differences in perspective between East and West are set forth early in the first act, and underscored musically:  while the Chinese of the chorus see the countryside as fields ready for harvest, the fruits of their labor and full of potential, the Nixons describe what they saw from the windows of the Spirit of '76 as a barren landscape.  This gap is reflected in the music:  the chorus for the workers is marked by what Johnson terms \"a wide-ranging palette of harmonic colors\", the Western perspective is shown by the \"quick, descending, dismissive cadential gesture\" which follows Nixon's description of his travels.The second act opens with warm and reflective music culminating in Pat Nixon's tender aria \"This is prophetic\". The main focus of the act, however, is the Chinese revolutionary opera-ballet, The Red Detachment of Women, \"a riot of clashing styles\" according to Tommasini, reminiscent of agitprop theatre with added elements of Strauss waltzes, blasts of jazz and 1930s Stravinsky. The internal opera is followed by a monologue, \"I am the wife of Mao Tse-tung\" in which Chiang Ch'ing, Mao's wife, rails against counterrevolutionary elements in full coloratura soprano mode that culminates in a high D, appropriate for a character who in real life was a former actress given to self-dramatization. Critic Thomas May notes that, in the third act, her \"pose as a power-hungry Queen of the Night gives way to wistful regret\". In this final, \"surreal\" act the concluding thoughts of Chou En-lai are described by Tommasini as \"deeply affecting\". The act incorporates a brief foxtrot episode, choreographed by Morris, illustrating Pat Nixon's memories of her youth in the 1930s.Critic Robert Stein identifies Adams's particular strengths in his orchestral writing as \"motoring, brassy figures and sweetly reflective string and woodwind harmonies\", a view echoed by Gregory Carpenter in the liner notes to the 2009 Naxos recording of the opera. Carpenter pinpoints Adams's \"uncanny talent for recognising the dramatic possibilities of continually repeating melodies, harmonies and rhythms\", and his ability to change the mix of these elements to reflect the onstage action. The feel of the Nixon era is recreated through popular music references; Sellars has observed that some of the music associated with Nixon is derived from the big band sound of the late 1930s, when the Nixons fell in love. Other commentators have noted Adams's limitations as a melodist, and his reliance for long stretches on what critic Donal Henahan has described as \"a prosaically chanted recitative style\". However, Robert Hugill, reviewing the 2006 English National Opera revival, found that the sometimes tedious \"endless arpeggios\" are often followed by gripping music which immediately re-engages the listener's interest. This verdict contrasts with that of Davis after the original Houston performance; Davis commented that Adams's inexperience as an opera writer was evident in often \"turgid instrumentation\", and that at points where \"the music must be the crucial and defining element ... Adams fails to do the job\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "106_31065", "text": "Charles Mitchell \"Dolo\" Coker (November 16, 1927 \u2013 April 13, 1983) was a jazz pianist and composer who recorded four albums for Xanadu Records and extensively as a sideman, for artists like Sonny Stitt, Gene Ammons, Lou Donaldson, Art Pepper, Philly Joe Jones, and Dexter Gordon.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Ethel Merman sang the song in the original Broadway production and Broadway lore holds that George Gershwin, after seeing her opening reviews, warned her never to take a singing lesson.\nThe piece was originally penned in the key of D\u266d major. The song melody uses four notes of the five-note pentatonic scale, first rising, then falling. A rhythmic interest in the song is that the tune keeps behind the main pulse, with the three \"I got...\" phrases syncopated, appearing one beat behind in the first bar, while the fourth phase \"Who could...\" rushes in to the song.

Its chord progression (although often reduced to a standard 32-bar structure for the sake of improvised solos) is known as the \"rhythm changes\" and is the foundation for many other popular jazz tunes.

Barber was inspired by Virgil's didactic poem Georgics. In the quartet, the Adagio follows a violently contrasting first movement (Molto allegro e appassionato) and is succeeded by a third movement that opens with a brief reprise of the music from the first movement (marked Molto allegro (come prima) \u2013 Presto).In January 1938, Barber sent an orchestrated version of the Adagio for Strings to Arturo Toscanini. The conductor returned the score without comment, which annoyed Barber. Toscanini sent word through Menotti that he was planning to perform the piece and had returned it simply because he had already memorized it. It was reported that Toscanini did not look at the music again until the day before the premiere. On November 5, 1938, a selected audience was invited to Studio 8H in Rockefeller Center to watch Toscanini conduct the first performance; it was broadcast on radio and also recorded. Initially, the critical reception was mixed.

NPR Music said that \"with a tense melodic line and taut harmonies, the composition is considered by many to be the most popular of all 20th-century orchestral works.\" Thomas Larson remarked that the piece \"evokes a deep sadness in those who hear it\". Many recordings of the piece have a duration of about eight minutes. According to music theorist Matthew BaileyShea, the Adagio \"features a deliberately archaic sound, with Renaissance-like polyphony and simple tertian harmonies\" underlying a \"chant-like melody\". The work is in \"the key of B\u266d minor (with some modal inflections)\".The Adagio is an example of arch form and builds on a melody that first ascends and then descends in stepwise fashion. Barber subtly manipulates the pulse throughout the work by varying the primary 42 time signature with isolated measures of 52, 62, and 32. After four climactic chords and a long pause, the piece presents the opening theme again and fades away on an unresolved dominant chord.\nMusic critic Olin Downes wrote that the piece is very simple at climaxes but reasoned that the simple chords create significance for the piece.

First performed in 1692, The Fairy-Queen was composed three years before Purcell's death at the age of 35. Following his death, the score was lost and only rediscovered early in the twentieth century.\nPurcell did not set any of Shakespeare's text to music; instead he composed music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques are related to the play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear no relationship to the play. Recent scholarship has shown that the opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.Growing interest in Baroque music and the rise of the countertenor contributed to the work's re-entry into the repertoire.

{"id": "86_244", "question": "Who composed Gianni Schicchi?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_50814", "text": "Gianni Schicchi (Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8d\u0292anni \u02c8skikki]) is a comic opera in one act by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Giovacchino Forzano, composed in 1917\u201318. The libretto is based on an incident mentioned in Dante's Divine Comedy. The work is the third and final part of Puccini's Il trittico (The Triptych) \u2013 three one-act operas with contrasting themes, originally written to be presented together. Although it continues to be performed with one or both of the other trittico operas, Gianni Schicchi is now more frequently staged either alone or with short operas by other composers. The aria \"O mio babbino caro\" is one of Puccini's best known, and one of the most popular arias in opera.\nPuccini had long considered writing a set of one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced with a lack of suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, completes the triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, and it has been praised for its inventiveness and imagination.\nWhen Il trittico premiered at New York's Metropolitan Opera in December 1918, Gianni Schicchi became an immediate hit, while the other two operas were received with less enthusiasm. This pattern was broadly repeated at the Rome and London premieres and led to commercial pressures to abandon the less successful elements. Although on artistic grounds Puccini opposed performing the three operas except as the original triptych, by 1920 he had given his reluctant consent to separate performances. Gianni Schicchi has subsequently become the most-performed part of Il trittico and has been widely recorded.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50815", "text": "Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti was a 13th-century Italian knight, a Florentine historical figure mentioned by Dante in the Inferno, Canto XXX. In that canto, Dante visits the Circle of Impersonators and sees a man savagely attacking another: he is told that the attacker is Schicchi, condemned to Hell for impersonating Buoso Donati and making Donati's will highly favorable to Schicchi.The plot used in the opera derives from an 1866 edition of The Divine Comedy by philologist Pietro Fanfani, which contained an appendix with a commentary attributed to an anonymous Florentine of the 14th century. In this version, Buoso wishes to make a will, but is put off doing so by his son, Simone. Once it is too late, Simone fears that Buoso, before his illness, may have made a will unfavourable to him. Simone calls on Schicchi for advice, and Schicchi has the idea of impersonating Buoso and making a new will. Simone promises Schicchi he will be well rewarded, but Schicchi takes no chances, \"leaving\" a considerable sum and Buoso's mule to himself (though most goes to Simone), and makes the bequests conditional on Simone's distributing the estate within fifteen days, otherwise everything will go to charity.Both Schicchi and Buoso Donati were historical characters. Dante's verses, and the opera, are based on an actual incident that took place in 13th century Florence. Dante had several reasons for his harsh treatment of Schicchi: Dante's wife, Gemma, was of the Donati family; the poet himself was of pure Florentine descent. He despised members of the peasant class such as Schicchi. Dante's class prejudice displays itself in several episodes in the Inferno: in one, three noble Florentines, who have died and gone to Hell, ask Dante for news of their home city. A disgusted Dante tells them that the city is now dominated by the nouveau riche.According to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano borrowed heavily from the commedia dell'arte tradition in Gianni Schicchi. Schicchi himself recalls the roguish Harlequin, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles Columbina. Simone is drawn from Pantaloon, while the poverty-stricken Betto recalls the buffoonish valet Zanni. Doctor Spinelloccio recalls the classic doctor from the commedia dell'arte, Balanzone, even to his Bolognese origin.

Mozart began the work while he was finishing Die Zauberfl\u00f6te, the last of his principal operas. La clemenza di Tito  premiered on 6 September 1791 at the Estates Theatre in Prague.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50826", "text": "Many recordings have been made, including the following:", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50825", "text": "Place and time: Ancient Rome, in the year 79.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50822", "text": "In 1791, the last year of his life, Mozart was already well advanced in writing Die Zauberfl\u00f6te by July when he was asked to compose an opera seria. The commission came from the impresario Domenico Guardasoni, who lived in Prague and who had been charged by the Estates of Bohemia with providing a new work to celebrate the coronation of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, as King of Bohemia. The coronation had been planned by the Estates in order to ratify a political agreement between Leopold and the nobility of Bohemia (it had rescinded efforts of Leopold's brother Joseph II to initiate a program to free the serfs of Bohemia and increase the tax burden of aristocratic landholders). Leopold desired to pacify the Bohemian nobility in order to forestall revolt and strengthen his empire in the face of political challenges engendered by the French Revolution. The ceremony was to take place on 6 September; Guardasoni had been approached about the opera in June. No opera of Mozart was more clearly pressed into the service of a political agenda than La clemenza di Tito, in this case to promote the reactionary political and social policies of an aristocratic elite. No evidence exists to evaluate Mozart's attitude toward this, or even whether he was aware of the internal political conflicts raging in the kingdom of Bohemia in 1791.In a contract dated 8 July, Guardasoni promised that he would engage a castrato \"of leading quality\" (this seems to have mattered more than who wrote the opera); that he would \"have the libretto caused to be written...and to be set to music by a distinguished maestro\". The time was tight and Guardasoni had a get-out clause: if he failed to secure a new text, he would resort to La clemenza di Tito, a libretto written more than half a century earlier by Pietro Metastasio (1698\u20131782).\nMetastasio's libretto had already been set by nearly 40 composers; the story is based on the life of Roman Emperor Titus, from some brief hints in The Lives of the Caesars by the Roman writer Suetonius, and was elaborated by Metastasio in 1734 for the Italian composer Antonio Caldara. Among later settings were Gluck's in 1752 and Josef Myslive\u010dek's version in 1774. Mozart was definitely familiar with the libretto before composition; in 1770, he saw a production with his father of Michelangelo Valentini's setting in Cremona. There would be three further settings after 1791. Mozart was not Guardasoni's first choice. Instead, he approached Antonio Salieri, the most distinguished composer of Italian opera in Vienna and head of the music establishment at the imperial court. But Salieri was too busy, and he declined the commission, although he did attend the coronation.\nThe libretto was edited into a more useful state by the court poet Caterino Mazzol\u00e0. Unusually, in Mozart's personal catalogue of compositions, Mazzol\u00e0 is credited for his revision with the note that the libretto had been \"reworked into a true opera\". Mazzol\u00e0 conflated the original three act libretto into two acts, and none of the original Metastasio arias are from the original middle act. Mazzol\u00e0 replaced a lot of the dialogue with ensembles and wrote a new act one finale, cobbled from lines in the original libretto, which presents the uprising, whereas Metastasio merely describes it.\nGuardasoni's experience of Mozart's work on Don Giovanni convinced him that the younger composer was more than capable of working on the tightest deadline. Mozart readily accepted the commission given his fee would be twice the price of a similar opera commissioned in Vienna. Mozart's earliest biographer Niemetschek alleged that the opera was completed in just 18 days, and in such haste that the secco recitatives were supplied by another composer, probably Franz Xaver S\u00fcssmayr, believed to have been Mozart's pupil. Although no other documentation exists to confirm S\u00fcssmayr's participation, none of the secco recitatives are in Mozart's autograph, and it is known that S\u00fcssmayr traveled with Mozart to Prague a week before the premiere to help with rehearsals, proofreading, and copying. It has been suggested by scholars of Mozart that he had been working on the opera much longer, perhaps since 1789; however, all such theories have now been thoroughly refuted in the English-language musicological literature. The opera may not have been written in just 18 days, but it certainly ranks with Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri, Il barbiere di Siviglia and La Cenerentola as one of the operas written in the shortest amount of time that is still frequently performed today.\nIt is not known what Leopold thought of the opera written in his honor. Reports that his wife Maria Luisa of Spain dismissed it as una porcheria tedesca (literally in Italian \"German swinishness\", but most idiomatically translated \"A German mess\") do not pre-date 1871, in a collection of literary vignettes by Alfred Meissner about the history of Prague purportedly based on recollections of the author's grandfather, who was present for the coronation ceremonies.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50824", "text": "The opera is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (1 also basset clarinet and basset horn), 2 bassoons, 2 French horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings.

Gluck seemed at ease in facing French traditions head-on when he composed Armide. Lully and Quinault were the very founders of serious opera in France and Armide was generally recognized as their masterpiece, so it was a bold move on Gluck's part to write new music to Quinault's words. A similar attempt to write a new opera to the libretto of Th\u00e9s\u00e9e by Jean-Joseph de Mondonville in 1765 had ended in disaster, with audiences demanding it be replaced by Lully's original.  By utilizing Armide, Gluck challenged the long-standing and apparently inviolable ideals of French practice, and in the process he revealed these values capable of renewal through \"modern\" compositional sensitivities. Critical response and resultant polemic resulted in one of those grand imbroglios common to French intellectual life. Gluck struck a nerve in French sensitivities, and whereas Armide was not one of his more popular works, it remained a critical touchstone in the French operatic tradition and was warmly praised by Berlioz in his Memoirs. Gluck also set a minor fashion for resetting Lully/Quinault operas: Gluck's rival Piccinni followed his example with Roland in 1778 and Atys in 1780; in the same year, Philidor produced a new Pers\u00e9e; and Gossec offered his version of Th\u00e9s\u00e9e in 1782. Gluck himself is said to have been working on an opera based on Roland, but he abandoned it when he heard Piccinni had taken on the same libretto.\n\nArmide remained on the repertoire of the Parisian Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de Musique throughout the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, with revivals held in 1805, 1811, 1818, 1819 and 1825.

It was to be an LP of twelve tracks assembled from modular fragments, the same editing process used for their \"Good Vibrations\" single. Instead, after a year of recording, the album was shelved and the group released a downscaled version, Smiley Smile, in September 1967. Over the next four decades, few of the original Smile tracks were officially released, and the project came to be regarded as the most legendary unreleased album in popular music history.The album was produced and almost entirely composed by Brian Wilson with guest lyricist and assistant arranger Van Dyke Parks, both of whom conceived the project as a riposte to the British sensibilities that had dominated popular music of the era. Wilson touted Smile as a \"teenage symphony to God\" to surpass Pet Sounds. It was a concept album that was planned to feature word paintings, tape manipulation, more elaborate vocal arrangements, experiments with musical acoustics, themes of youth and innocence, and comedic interludes, with influences drawn from mysticism, pre-rock and roll pop, doo-wop, jazz, ragtime, musique concr\u00e8te, classical, American history, poetry, spirituality, and cartoons. Over 50 hours of tape was recorded, ranging from musical and spoken word to sound effects and role-playing. The lead single would have been \"Heroes and Villains\", about the early history of California, or \"Vega-Tables\", a tongue-in-cheek promotion of organic food.\nNumerous issues, including legal entanglements with Capitol Records, Wilson's uncompromising perfectionism and mental instabilities, as well as Parks' withdrawal from the project in early 1967, prevented the album's completion. Most of the tracks were produced between August and December 1966, but few were ever finished, and the album's structure was never finalized. Afraid of the public's reaction to his work, Wilson blocked attempts to release Smile in the subsequent years. After the group issued a truncated version of \"Heroes and Villains\", they reworked some of the material into new songs, such as \"Cool, Cool Water\", and completed only three more tracks, \"Our Prayer\", \"Cabinessence\" and \"Surf's Up\". A mythology grew around the project, and its unfulfilled potential inspired many artists, especially those in indie rock, post-punk, electronic, and chamber pop genres.\n\nSmile had been estimated to be \"50% done\" by mid-1967. Since the 1980s, extensive session recordings have circulated widely on bootlegs, allowing fans to assemble hypothetical versions of a finished album, adding to its legacy as an interactive project. Responding to this, Capitol included a loose reconstruction of the album on the 1993 box set Good Vibrations. In 2004, Wilson, Parks, and Darian Sahanaja arranged a version of Smile for concert performances, billed as Brian Wilson Presents Smile, which Wilson then adapted into a solo album. He stated that this version differed substantially from his original vision. The 2011 compilation The Smile Sessions was the first official package devoted to the original Beach Boys' recordings and included an approximation of the completed album. It received universal acclaim and won Best Historical Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards in 2013.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Lloyd Webber stated, \"I don't regard this as a sequel\u2014it's a stand-alone piece.\" He later clarified, \"Clearly, it is a sequel, but I really do not believe that you have to have seen Phantom of the Opera to understand Love Never Dies.\" Glenn Slater subsequently explained that Lloyd Webber \"didn\u2019t view it as a sequel as much as 'a second story with these characters'\". The musical is set in 1907, which Lloyd Webber states is \"ten years roughly after the end of the original Phantom\", although the events of the original actually took place in 1881.In the show, Christine Daa\u00e9 is invited by Oscar Hammerstein I for her American debut, until an anonymous impresario contracts her to perform at Phantasma, a new attraction on Coney Island. With her husband Raoul and son Gustave in tow, she journeys to Brooklyn, unaware that it is actually the Phantom who has arranged her appearance in the popular beach resort.Although Lloyd Webber began working on Love Never Dies in 1990, it was not until 2007 that he began writing the music.

However, the show closed for four days in November 2010 for substantial re-writes, which were overseen by Lloyd Webber, and it re-opened with new direction from Bill Kenwright. Set and costume designs were by Bob Crowley. The original London production received mostly negative reviews. A subsequent Australian production starring Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne, featuring an entirely new design team and heavy revisions was generally better received, although the show finally closed with heavy discounting to tickets. A planned Broadway production, which was to have opened simultaneously with the West End run, was cancelled, the amount of negative press having deterred potential backers.

The success of these earlier works was so great that Die tote Stadt was subject to a fierce competition among German theatres for the right to the world premiere. In the end, an unusual double premiere was arranged and the opera opened simultaneously at the Stadttheater Hamburg and Cologne (Glockengasse). In Cologne, the conductor was Otto Klemperer, and his wife Johanna Geisler sang Marietta. In Hamburg, Korngold himself was in the theatre, and the conductor was Egon Pollak. The opera's theme of overcoming the loss of a loved one resonated with contemporary audiences of the 1920s who had just come through the trauma and grief of World War I, and this undoubtedly fuelled the work's popularity.\nDie tote Stadt was one of the greatest hits of the 1920s. Within two years of its premiere it had circled the globe, including several performances at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The Berlin premi\u00e8re was on 12 April 1924 with Lotte Lehmann as Marietta/Marie and Richard Tauber as Paul, conducted by George Szell.\nBut the work was banned by the Nazi r\u00e9gime because of Korngold's Jewish ancestry and after World War II it fell into obscurity. The key postwar revivals of the piece were at the Vienna Volksoper (1967) and the New York City Opera (1975). In recent years, however, the work has enjoyed notable revivals, among others at the Theater Bonn, the Royal Opera House, the San Francisco Opera and at the Vienna State Opera.The French premiere of the opera took place in a concert performance in 1982 at the Paris Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.

Larson suggested setting the play \"amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, drag queens and punk\" in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, which happened to be down the street from his Greenwich Village apartment. He also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that \"rent\" also means torn apart). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make Rent his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for Rent; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera \"to bring musical theater to the MTV generation\". Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for \"original concept & additional lyrics\".Jonathan Larson focused on composing Rent in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the Moondance Diner to support himself. Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of Rent's script. When Rent had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of Rent featured songs that never made it into the final version, such as:\n\n\"You're a Fool\"\n\"Do a Little Business\", the predecessor of \"You'll See\", featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins and Angel\n\"Female to Female A & B\", featuring Maureen and Joanne\n\"He's a Fool\"\n\"He Says\"\n\"Right Brain, Left Brain\", later rewritten as \"One Song Glory\", featuring Roger\n\"You'll Get Over It\", the predecessor of \"Tango: Maureen\", featuring Mark and Maureen\n\"Real Estate\", a number wherein Benny tries to convince Mark to become a real estate agent and drop his filmmaking\n\"Open Road\", the predecessor of \"What You Own\", with a backing track similar to this in \"Your Eyes\"This workshop version of Rent starred Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi. Larson continued to work on Rent, gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.On January 24, 1996, after the musical's final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson had his first (and only) newspaper interview; music critic Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times \u2013 been attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera \u2013 requested the interview. Larson would not live to see Rent's success; he died from an undiagnosed aortic dissection (believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome) early the next morning, January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of Rent became a sing-through of the musical in Larson's memory.The show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theatre Workshop.  Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, Rent moved to Broadway's then-under-renovation Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street and opened on April 29, 1996.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50925", "text": "Larson's inspiration for Rent's content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera La Boh\u00e8me, the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before Rent's premiere. La Boh\u00e8me was also about the lives of poor young artists. Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in Rent; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of Rent's characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in Rent represents the character of Alcindoro in Boh\u00e8me, but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only Rent character whose predecessor in La Boh\u00e8me is a different sex.\n\nOther examples of parallels between Larson's and Puccini's work include Larson's song \"Light My Candle\", which draws melodic content directly from \"Che gelida manina\"; \"Quando me'n vo'\" (\"Musetta's Waltz\"), a melody taken directly from Puccini's opera; and \"Goodbye Love\", a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini's and Larson's work. \"Quando me'n vo'\" is paralleled in the first verse of \"Take Me or Leave Me\", when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, \"Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song...\"  Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, \"...that  doesn't remind us of 'Musetta's Waltz'.\" This part of \"Musetta's Waltz\" is also later used in \"Your Eyes\", a song Roger writes.\nRent is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in \"Rent\"]) made their way into the musical . Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson's own girlfriend left him for a woman.  The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson's friends, cinematographer and producer Jonathan Burkhart and documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein.\nPlaywright Sarah Schulman alleged that Rent bore striking similarities to her novel People in Trouble.The line, \"I'm more of a man than you'll ever be... and more of a woman than you'll ever get!\", attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at her funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films Mannequin (1987) and Mannequin Two: On the Move (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women's clothing. This line was originally in the film Car Wash (1976), delivered by Antonio Fargas as a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser named Lindy.\nThe earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off Oedipus in her performance piece instead of Hey Diddle Diddle; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a jazz philosopher, while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like \"Real Estate\", which was later cut.\nMany actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. Life Caf\u00e9, where the \"La Vie Boh\u00e8me\" numbers are set, was an actual restaurant (closed 2013) on 10th Street and Avenue B in the East Village of New York City. The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village riot in 1988 that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in Tompkins Square Park.\"Will I?\", a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or had died from AIDS.The scene and song \"Life Support\" were also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the \"forget regret\" refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this \"credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?\" Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, \"Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?\" Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, \"Then why choose fear?\" Gordon says, \"I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The title is commonly shortened to Rienzi. Written between July 1838 and November 1840, it was first performed at the K\u00f6nigliches Hoftheater Dresden, on 20 October 1842, and was the composer's first success.\nThe opera is set in Rome and is based on the life of Cola di Rienzo (1313\u20131354), a late medieval Italian populist figure who succeeds in outwitting and then defeating the nobles and their followers and in raising the power of the people. Magnanimous at first, he is forced by events to crush the nobles' rebellion against the people's power, but popular opinion changes and even the Church, which had urged him to assert himself, turns against him. In the end the populace burns the Capitol, in which Rienzi and a few adherents have made a last stand.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50970", "text": "Rienzi is Wagner's third completed opera, and is mostly written in a grand opera style. In his 1860 essay \"Music of the Future,\" Wagner called it \"a work full of youthful fire\" which was inspired by \"the heroic opera of Spontini\" and the Parisian grand opera of Daniel Auber, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Fromental Hal\u00e9vy. Rienzi's depictions of the mob, the liberal ethos associated with the hero and the political intervention of a reactionary clergy recall Spontini's La vestale (1807), Hal\u00e9vy's La Juive (1835), and Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots (1836). Each act ends with an extended finale ensemble and is replete with solos, duets, trios and crowd scenes. There is also an extended ballet in act 2 according to the accepted Grand Opera format. Hans von B\u00fclow was later to joke that \"Rienzi is Meyerbeer's best opera\".Wagner began to draft the opera in Riga in 1837, after reading Lytton's novel (although John Deathridge has argued that Wagner's work also bears the influence of Mary Russell Mitford's 1828 \"highly successful English play\" Rienzi). During a 1839 visit to the bathing resort town of Boulogne, Wagner approached Meyerbeer with a partial draft of Rienzi, and the elder composer responded with encouragement. Meyerbeer also introduced Wagner to Ignaz Moscheles, who was also staying at Boulogne; as Ernest Newman comments, this was \"Wagner's first meeting with real international musical celebrities\". When the opera was completed in 1840, Wagner hoped for it to be premiered at the Berlin Royal Opera or the Paris Op\u00e9ra.Several circumstances, including his lack of influence, prevented this. Moreover, Wagner's wife Minna, in a letter of 28 October 1840 to Wagner's friend Apel, who had likely first made the suggestion that Wagner compose Rienzi, mentions a plan to perform the overture to Rienzi \"a fortnight hence\", but contains a clear indication that her husband had just been committed to a debtors' prison. The full score of Rienzi was completed on 19 November 1840.\nIn 1841 Wagner moved to Meudon, just outside Paris, where the debt laws could be more easily evaded, whilst awaiting developments for Rienzi, having already written to King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, requesting that he order a production of the work in Dresden.\n\nWith the support of Meyerbeer, a staging of Rienzi was arranged in Dresden; Meyerbeer wrote to the Director of the Opera in Dresden, Baron von L\u00fcttichau, that he found the opera \"rich in fantasy and of great dramatic effect\". This, with the proposed staging of Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder in Berlin, also supported by Meyerbeer, persuaded Wagner to return to Germany in April 1842. During rehearsals the performers were highly enthusiastic; the tenor Tichatschek, in the title role, was so impressed with a passage from act 3 (later deleted because of the opera's length), that \"at each rehearsal, each of the soloists contributed a silver groschen to [a] fund that Tichatschek had started ... No one suspected that what was an amiable joke for them was the means of buying [Wagner] an extra morsel of sorely-needed food.\"The premiere of Rienzi took place on 20 October 1842 in the new Dresden Opera House, designed by the architect Gottfried Semper and opened the previous year. Semper and Wagner were later to become friends in Dresden, a connection which eventually led to Semper providing designs which became a basis of Wagner's Festspielhaus in Bayreuth.\nThe first performance of Rienzi was well received in Dresden despite running over six hours (including intermissions). One legend is that, fearful of the audience departing, Wagner stopped the clock above the stage. In his later memoirs, Mein Leben, Wagner recalled:\n\nNo subsequent experience has given me feelings even remotely similar to those I had on this day of the first performance of Rienzi. The only too well-founded anxiety as to their success has so dominated my feelings at all subsequent first performances of my works that I could never really enjoy them or take much notice of the way the audience was behaving.[...] The initial success of Rienzi was no doubt assured beforehand. But the uproarious way in which the public declared its partiality for me was extraordinary ... The public had been forcibly predisposed to accept it, because everyone connected with the theatre had been spreading such favourable reports ... that the entire population was looking forward to what was heralded as a miracle ... In trying to recall my condition that evening, I can remember it only as possessing all the features of a dream.\nSubsequently, Wagner experimented with giving the opera over two evenings (at the suggestion of von L\u00fcttichau), and making cuts to enable a more reasonable performance in a single evening.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51372", "text": "Lucrezia Borgia is a melodramatic opera in a prologue and two acts by Gaetano Donizetti.

Wally, short for Walburga, is a girl with some heroic attributes. The story is based on an episode in the life of Tyrolean painter Anna Stainer-Knittel, whom von Hillern met. She got her epithet \"Geier\" (vulture, the local name for eagle) from having gutted a bearded vulture's nest going down a rope; this dangerous task, aimed at protecting the sheep in the Alpine village, was typically performed by a man.\nVon Hillern's piece was originally serialized in Deutsche Rundschau and was reproduced in English as \"A German Peasant Romance\" in the Cornhill Magazine in 1875.\nThe opera is best known for its aria \"Ebben? Ne andr\u00f2 lontana\" (\"Well, then? I'll go far away,\" act 1, sung when Wally decides to leave her home forever).

It focuses on an archetypal Disney princess-to-be named Giselle\nexiled from her animated world into the live-action world of New York City.\nThe film is both a homage to and a self-parody of Disney's animated features, making numerous references to past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, traditional animation, and computer-generated imagery. It also marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had written songs for previous Disney films, wrote and produced the songs of Enchanted, and Menken also composed the film's score. The animated sequences were produced at James Baxter Animation in Pasadena, while filming of the live-action segments took place around New York City.\nEnchanted premiered at the London Film Festival on October 20, 2007, and went into its wide release in the United States on November 21. It was critically well-received, established Adams as a leading lady, and earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office. It won three Saturn Awards, Best Fantasy Film, Best Actress for Adams and Best Music for Menken. Enchanted also received two nominations at the 65th Golden Globe Awards and three Best Original Song nominations at the 80th Academy Awards.

It was not published during his lifetime, only being discovered (by Ludwig Nohl) 40 years after his death, and may be termed either a  Bagatelle or an Albumblatt. The identity of \"Elise\" is unknown; researchers have suggested Therese Malfatti, Elisabeth R\u00f6ckel, or Elise Barensfeld.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50987", "text": "The score was not published until 1867, forty years after the composer's death in 1827. The discoverer of the piece, Ludwig Nohl, affirmed that the original autograph manuscript, now lost, had the title: \"F\u00fcr Elise am 27 April [1810] zur Erinnerung von L. v. Bthvn\" (\"For Elise on April 27 in memory by L. v. Bthvn\"). The music was published as part of Nohl's Neue Briefe Beethovens (New letters by Beethoven) on pages 28 to 33, printed in Stuttgart by Johann Friedrich Cotta.The version of \"F\u00fcr Elise\" heard today is an earlier version that was transcribed by Ludwig Nohl. There is a later revised version from 1822, with drastic changes to the accompaniment which was transcribed from a manuscript by the Beethoven scholar Barry Cooper. The most notable difference is in the first theme, the left-hand arpeggios are delayed by a 16th note. There are a few extra bars in the transitional section into the B section; and finally, the rising A minor arpeggio figure is moved later into the piece. The tempo marking Poco moto is believed to have been on the manuscript that Ludwig Nohl transcribed (now lost). The later version includes the marking Molto grazioso. It is believed that Beethoven intended to add the piece to a cycle of bagatelles.Whatever the validity of Nohl's edition, an editorial peculiarity contained in it involves whether the second right-hand note in bar 7, that is, the first note of the three-note upbeat figure that characterizes the main melody, is an E4 or a D4. Nohl's score gives E4 in bar 7, but D4 thereafter in all parallel passages. Many editions change all the figures to beginning with E4 until the final bars, where D4 is used and resolved by adding a C to the final A octave. However, the use of the note D4 in bar 7 can be traced back to a draft Beethoven wrote for the piece that is today housed in the Beethoven-Haus Bonn. Another point in favor of the D4 is that the ascending seventh of the motive in this form is repeated in sequence in bars 9 to 11 that begin the second section of the principal theme.The pianist and musicologist Luca Chiantore argued in his thesis and his 2010 book Beethoven al piano (new Italian edition: Beethoven al pianoforte, 2014) that Beethoven might not have been the person who gave the piece the form that we know today. Chiantore suggested that the original signed manuscript, upon which Ludwig Nohl claimed to base his transcription, may never have existed.

There was also an orchestral arrangement of the march by Carl Davis and David Cullen for the album Carl Conducts...Classical Festival Favourites. Orchestral versions are typically transposed one-half step lower than the original band version, to put the march in a key that is more familiar to string players.\nThe tune is widely used by soccer fans, with the trio/grandioso section sung with the words \"Here We Go\". The supporters of Spanish side Valencia CF used to sing it with the words \"Xe que b\u00f3!\" which means something like \"Oh! How good\" in Valencian, and those words have become a symbol for the team. Another version uses the word cheerio repeatedly, normally sung to players or coaches when they have been sent off or occasionally when an underdog has ended its opponent's cup campaign. Finally, certain clubs such as Forest Green or Sunderland use the chant just using the club name; this only works if the name has three syllables. A nickname can instead be used for the chant, such as Gateshead fans chanting \"Tynesiders\".\nIn the 1933 film Duck Soup, Harpo Marx, playing Pinky, a spy infiltrating a house in the middle of the night, attempts to open what he believes to be a safe, but turns out to be a large radio, which loudly begins playing \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" when he turns the knob.

It was also played during the January 5, 2015 episode of WWE Raw from Corpus Christi, Texas, also involving Cena, during the main event segment called John Cena Appreciation Night, where The Authority (Triple H and Stephanie McMahon) thanked Cena for (kayfabe) re-hiring them following the previous year's Survivor Series event's main event match, only to slander him and then (kayfabe) fire his teammates from that night, Dolph Ziggler, Ryback and Erick Rowan. The Big Show, who was also Cena's teammate during the aforementioned match, was not fired since he turned his back on Cena during the match and then joined The Authority.

The earliest version appeared in 1516, although the poem was not published in its complete form until 1532. Orlando furioso is a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's unfinished romance Orlando innamorato (Orlando in Love, published posthumously in 1495). In its historical setting and characters, it shares some features with the Old French Chanson de Roland of the eleventh century, which tells of the death of Roland. The story is also a chivalric romance which stemmed from a tradition beginning in the late Middle Ages and continuing in popularity in the 16th century and well into the 17th.\nOrlando is the Christian knight known in French (and subsequently English) as Roland. The story takes place against the background of the war between Charlemagne's Christian paladins and the Saracen army that has invaded Europe and is attempting to overthrow the Christian empire. The poem is about war and love and the romantic ideal of chivalry. It mixes realism and fantasy, humor and tragedy. The stage is the entire world, plus a trip to the Moon. The large cast of characters features Christians and Saracens, soldiers and sorcerers, and fantastic creatures including a gigantic sea monster called the Orc and a flying horse called the hippogriff.

Orlando furioso is a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's unfinished romance Orlando innamorato (Orlando in Love, published posthumously in 1495). In its historical setting and characters, it shares some features with the Old French Chanson de Roland of the eleventh century, which tells of the death of Roland. The story is also a chivalric romance which stemmed from a tradition beginning in the late Middle Ages and continuing in popularity in the 16th century and well into the 17th.\nOrlando is the Christian knight known in French (and subsequently English) as Roland. The story takes place against the background of the war between Charlemagne's Christian paladins and the Saracen army that has invaded Europe and is attempting to overthrow the Christian empire. The poem is about war and love and the romantic ideal of chivalry. It mixes realism and fantasy, humor and tragedy. The stage is the entire world, plus a trip to the Moon.

Serse's success has continued. According to Winton Dean, Serse is Handel's most popular opera with modern audiences after Giulio Cesare. The very features which 18th-century listeners found so disconcerting \u2013 the shortness of the arias and the admixture of comedy \u2013 may account for its appeal to the 20th and the 21st centuries.Serse was produced for the stage at the La Scala Theater in Milan, Italy in January 1962. The production was conducted by Piero Bellugi, and an all-star cast featuring Mirella Freni, Rolando Panerai, Fiorenza Cossotto, Irene Companez, Leonardo Monreale, Franco Calabrese, and Luigi Alva in the title role. Because Handel operas were still in a relatively early stage of their return to the stage, musicians had not yet thought to ornament the da capo sections (repetition of the A section) of the arias and thus, they were not ornamented. A complete recording was made in 1979. A particularly highly acclaimed production, sung in English, was staged by the English National Opera in 1985, to mark the 300th anniversary of the composer's birth.

Together with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko (1867), it is one of the first tone poems by a Russian composer.Although Mussorgsky was proud of his youthful effort, his mentor, Mily Balakirev, refused to perform it. To salvage what he considered worthy material, Mussorgsky attempted to insert his Bald Mountain music, recast for vocal soloists, chorus, and orchestra, into two subsequent projects\u2014the collaborative opera-ballet Mlada (1872), and the opera The Fair at Sorochyntsi (1880). However, Night on Bald Mountain was never performed in any form during Mussorgsky's lifetime.In 1886, five years after Mussorgsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov published an arrangement of the work, described as a \"fantasy for orchestra.\" Some musical scholars consider this version to be an original composition of Rimsky-Korsakov, albeit one based on Mussorgsky's last version of the music, for The Fair at Sorochyntsi:\n\nI need hardly remind the reader that the orchestral piece universally known as 'Mussorgsky's Night on the Bare Mountain' is an orchestral composition by Rimsky-Korsakov based on the later version of the Bare Mountain music which Mussorgsky prepared for Sorochintsy Fair.\nIt is through Rimsky-Korsakov's version that Night on Bald Mountain achieved lasting fame. Premiering in Saint Petersburg in 1886, the work became a concert favourite. Half a century later, the work obtained perhaps its greatest exposure through the Walt Disney animated film Fantasia (1940), featuring an arrangement by Leopold Stokowski, based on Rimsky-Korsakov's version.

It was written and produced by Madonna, Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid, with additional writing from MoZella and Toby Gad. Originally intended for a Valentine's Day 2015 release, the song was rush-released as the lead single from the album on December 20, 2014, by Interscope Records, after demos recorded for the album leaked on to the internet. An EDM, diva house, disco and electropop track on which Madonna experimented with different musical genres, \"Living for Love\" contains instrumentation from percussion and piano by singer Alicia Keys, along with a gospel choir. Madonna composed the track as a break-up song, however she wanted to deviate and make the lyrics as uplifting in nature, talking about counteracting negative thoughts with positive responses.\n\"Living for Love\" received positive reviews from critics, who praised its rhythm and lyrics, comparing it to her earlier works. They also considered the song a step-up from her last two lead singles. In the United States, it failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100, but became Madonna's 44th number-one hit on the Dance Club Songs chart, tying her with country singer George Strait as the act with most number-one singles on any Billboard chart. Although United Kingdom's BBC Radio 1 decided not to play it, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 26, becoming Madonna's 71st top-forty single, extending her record as the female artist with the most top-forty UK singles. \"Living for Love\" reached the top-twenty of the charts in Finland, Hungary, Israel, Japan and Lebanon, but was commercially unsuccessful in other nations.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by the French duo Julien Choquart and Camille Hirigoyen, together known as J.A.C.K., and was released in February 2015. The storyline incorporates mythological elements and shows Madonna as a matador, fighting her dancers dressed like minotaurs in a red circular stage. It had numerous costume changes, and was critically appreciated for its empowering theme and transcending gender roles. Madonna first performed the song in a similar matador theme at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards; it became the most-watched moment of the night.

Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets \"Like a Prayer\", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed towards the end of the song.

The result of this critical stranglehold on the black musical was that ... black authors and composers prepared shows within extremely narrow constraints.\" Nevertheless, scholar James Haskins stated that Shuffle Along \"started a whole new era for blacks on Broadway, as well as a whole new era for blacks in all creative fields.\" Loften Mitchell, author of Black Drama: The Story of the American Negro in the Theatre, credited Shuffle Along with launching the Harlem Renaissance, as did Langston Hughes.President Harry Truman chose the show's song \"I'm Just Wild About Harry\" for his campaign anthem.The story in Shuffle Along also presented a romance between two Black characters that was presented as equal to that of a white romance in other Broadway shows. \"Negroes had never been permitted romance before on the stage\" and there was real fear that people would respond harshly (Blake 152). The song \u201cLove Will Find A Way\u201d portrayed the love between these two characters and was well received by audiences despite the initial concerns. This was a huge step in Black entertainment, that \u201csong was really the first of its kind\u201d but was widely accepted (Blake 152). Shuffle Along was able to break away from the status quo for Black stage productions of its time.Previous Black drama that was popular in America during the early 1900s had impacts on most African American shows. Many Negro stereotypes had been developed by white directors that had \u201cparodied from carefully selected aspects of real African American Life\u201d (Hay 16). These stereotypes were enjoyed by white audiences and became expected when going to a show with an African American character. This mix of \u201creality and make-believe was that in each case the latter quality reinforced the former\u201d creating absurdly comedic black characters and situations (Hay 17). Shuffle Along was not immune to these influences. At the end of the show the community apprehends the two corrupt political candidates who were stealing from their own grocery to fund their campaign against each other throughout the story. Unfortunately, \u201cthe tomfoolery overshadows the election of a reform candidate\u201d and the audience forgets the \u201ctheme of crime does not pay\u201d (Hay 20).", "hasanswer": false}]}

She reveals to him also that his country is in danger, attacked and besieged by the Saracens, and grants him a magic sword with which he will be capable of defeating the enemy. It will serve him well as long as he remains faithful to her.\nRoland then goes to help the besieged Blois and wins the battle with the leader of the Saracens. In reward, he is granted by the king of France the hand of his royal daughter. But Roland refuses to accept that offer, not disclosing the reason.  When he finally confesses his nightly tryst to the Bishop of Blois, the bishop and a group of monks intervene on Esclarmonde's arrival, performing an exorcism and in a crucial moment manage to tear off her veil and thus reveal her identity. Feeling betrayed, Esclarmonde, in her bravura aria O Roland, tu m'as trahie, et me voil\u00e0... Regarde-les ces yeux, rebukes Roland for his faithlessness. The confrontation scene proceeds with Roland trying at the last moment to use his sword to defend her from the monks. Suddenly, the magic sword shatters to pieces, and Esclarmonde, surrounding herself with a ring of fire and demons, curses Roland and disappears.\nThe ex-emperor, Phorcas, upon hearing of Esclarmonde's disobedience, summons her to him and insists she renounce Roland. He threatens to remove her magic powers and to execute Roland.  Reluctantly, she submits and when Roland is brought before her she implores him to forget her.  A tournament takes place to award the victor with Esclarmonde's hand in marriage.  When the winner, clad all in black, is asked his name, he replies \"despair\", and refuses the hand of Esclarmonde.

The work was written between 1872 and 1880 in St. Petersburg, Russia. The composer wrote the libretto based on historical sources.  The opera was almost finished in piano score when the composer died in 1881, but the orchestration was almost entirely lacking.\nLike Mussorgsky's earlier Boris Godunov, Khovanshchina deals with an episode in Russian history, first brought to the composer's attention by his friend the critic Vladimir Stasov. It concerns the rebellion of Prince Ivan Khovansky, the Old Believers, and the Muscovite Streltsy against the regent Sofia Alekseyevna and the two young Tsars Peter the Great and Ivan V, who were attempting to institute Westernizing reforms in Russia. Khovansky had helped to foment the Moscow Uprising of 1682, which resulted in Sofia becoming regent on behalf of her younger brother Ivan and half-brother Peter, who were crowned joint Tsars. In the fall of 1682 Prince Ivan Khovansky turned against Sofia. Supported by the Old Believers and the Streltsy, Khovansky \u2013 who supposedly wanted to install himself as the new regent \u2013 demanded the reversal of Patriarch Nikon's reforms. Sofia and her court were forced to flee Moscow. Eventually, Sofia managed to suppress the so-called Khovanshchina (Khovansky affair) with the help of the diplomat Fyodor Shaklovity, who succeeded Khovansky as leader of the Muscovite Streltsy. With the rebellion crushed, the Old Believers committed mass suicide (in the opera, at least).\nNikolai Rimsky-Korsakov completed, revised, and orchestrated Khovanshchina in 1881\u20131882. In 1958 Dmitri Shostakovich was commissioned to revise and reorchestrate the opera for a film version released the following year. It is the Shostakovich version which is now usually performed. In 1913 Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel made their own arrangement at Sergei Diaghilev's request. When Feodor Chaliapin refused to sing the part of Dosifey in any other orchestration than Rimsky-Korsakov's, Diaghilev's company employed a mixture of orchestrations which did not prove successful. The Stravinsky-Ravel orchestration was forgotten, except for Stravinsky's finale, which is still sometimes used.\nAlthough the background of the opera comprises the Moscow Uprising of 1682 and the Khovansky affair a few months later, its main themes are the struggle between progressive and reactionary political factions during the minority of Tsar Peter the Great and the passing of old Muscovy before Peter's westernizing reforms.

In addition to this, there could be choral interludes, ballet and scenic effects which took advantage of the entire range of possibilities available at the Paris Opera.\nBecause of the story of an impossible love between a Christian man and a Jewish woman, the work has been seen by some as a plea for religious tolerance, in much the same spirit as Nathan the Wise, which premiered in 1779, Giacomo Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots which premiered in 1836, a year after La Juive, as well as the 1819 novel Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott which deals with the same theme. At the time of composition, the July Monarchy had liberalised religious practices in France. Meyerbeer and Fromental Hal\u00e9vy were both Jewish, and storylines dealing with topics of tolerance were common in their operas. Reviews of the initial performances show that journalists of the period responded to the liberalism and to the perceived anti-clericalism of Scribe's text rather than to any specifically Jewish theme.Some believe that the libretto of La Juive was designed to provoke audiences to reassess the status of Jews in French society.

It is sometimes referred to as a \"ragtime opera\", though Joplin did not refer to it as such and it encompasses a wide range of musical styles. The music of Treemonisha includes an overture and prelude, along with various recitatives, choruses, small ensemble pieces, a ballet, and a few arias.The opera was largely unknown before its first complete performance in 1972. Joplin was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1976 for Treemonisha. The performance was called a \"semimiracle\" by music historian Gilbert Chase, who said Treemonisha \"bestowed its creative vitality and moral message upon many thousands of delighted listeners and viewers\" when it was recreated. The musical style of the opera is the popular romantic one of the early 20th century. It has been described as \"charming and piquant and ... deeply moving\", with elements of black folk songs and dances, including a kind of pre-blues music, spirituals, and a call-and-response style scene featuring a preacher and congregation.The opera celebrates African-American music and culture while stressing that education is the salvation of African Americans.

In addition the themes of superstition and mysticism, which are evident in Treemonisha, are common in the operatic tradition. Certain aspects of the plot are similar to devices in the work of the German composer Richard Wagner (of which Joplin was aware); a sacred tree under which Treemonisha is found recalls the tree from which Siegmund takes his enchanted sword in Die Walk\u00fcre. The recounting of the heroine's origins echos aspects of the opera Siegfried. African-American folk tales also influence the story; for instance, the wasp nest incident is similar to the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch.Treemonisha is not a ragtime opera. Joplin used the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly, to convey \"racial character\"; but he composed more music that reflected that of his childhood at the end of the 19th century. The opera has been seen as a valuable record of such rural Southern black music from the 1870s\u20131890s, re-created by a \"skilled and sensitive participant\".Joplin was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize in music in 1976 for Treemonisha.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51244", "text": "Joplin's ambition was for Treemonisha to be both a serious opera in the European tradition and an entertaining piece of music. He drew on the ragtime idiom only in the dance episodes.Historians have speculated that Joplin's second wife, Freddie Alexander, may have inspired the opera. Like the title character, she was educated, well-read, and known to be a proponent of women's rights and African-American culture. Joplin set the work in September 1884, the month and year of Alexander's birth, which contributes to that theory.Joplin biographer Edward A. Berlin has said that Treemonisha may have expressed other aspects of Joplin's life. Berlin said that the opera was \"a tribute to [Freddie, his second wife] the woman he loved, a woman other biographers never even mentioned.\" He also notes that in the opera, the title character receives her education in a white woman's home. Berlin and other music historians, along with Joplin's widow, have noted similarities between this element of the opera's story and Joplin's own childhood music and other lessons with Julius Weiss. Treemonisha, the protagonist of the opera, is a black teenager who was educated by a white woman, \"just as Joplin received his education from a white music teacher\". Historian Larry Wolz agrees, noting that the \"influence of mid-nineteenth-century German operatic style\" is quite obvious in Treemonisha, which he attributes to Joplin learning from Weiss.Berlin notes that Lottie Joplin (the composer's third wife) saw a connection between the character Treemonisha's wish to lead her people out of ignorance, and a similar desire in the composer. Lottie Joplin also describes Treemonisha as a spirit who would speak to him while Scott Joplin played the piano, and she would \"shape\" the composition. \"She'd tell him secrets. She'd tell him the past and the future,\" said Lottie Joplin. Treemonisha was an entity present while the piece was being created and was part of the process.At the time of the opera's publication in 1911, the American Musician and Art Journal praised it as \"an entirely new form of operatic art\". Later critics have also praised the opera as occupying a special place in American history, with its heroine \"a startlingly early voice for modern civil rights causes, notably the importance of education and knowledge to African American advancement.\" Curtis's conclusion is similar: \"In the end, Treemonisha offered a celebration of literacy, learning, hard work, and community solidarity as the best formula for advancing the race.\" Berlin describes it as a \"fine opera, certainly more interesting than most operas then being written in the United States\".

Treemonisha is abducted and is about to be thrown into a wasps' nest when her friend Remus rescues her. The community realizes the value of education and the liability of their ignorance before choosing her as their teacher and leader.The opera opens with Zodzetrick, a conjurer, attempting to sell a bag of luck to Monisha (\"The Bag of Luck\"). However, her husband, Ned, wards him off. As Zodzetrick slinks away, Treemonisha and Remus hear the folks singing and excitedly prepare for the day (\"The Corn Huskers\"). Treemonisha then asks if they would like a ring play before they worked. They accept, and Andy leads the folks in a song and dance (\"We're Goin' Around\"). When the folks have finished dancing, Treemonisha notices that the women wear wreaths on their heads, and she herself tries to acquire one from a tree (\"The Wreath\"). However, Monisha stops her in her tracks, and tells her of how this certain tree is sacred. Monisha performs an aria, talking of Treemonisha's discovery under the tree (\"The Sacred Tree\"). Treemonisha is distraught to learn Monisha and Ned aren't her true parents and laments over it (\"Surprised\"). Monisha then tells of how Treemonisha was brought up and educated (\"Treemonisha's Bringing Up\"). Parson Alltalk then arrives in a wagon, talking to the neighborhood and confirming their belief in superstition. Whilst he distracts the folks, the conjurers kidnap Treemonisha (\"Good Advice\"). Once Alltalk leaves, the neighborhood realizes Treemonisha is gone (\"Confusion\").

It originated during a period when, following the completion of their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in April 1967, the Beatles typically embraced randomness and simplicity as part of the creative process.According to Taylor's recollection, he was visiting McCartney at his home in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the instrument and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: \"And so it went \u2013 black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye.\" Taylor later reflected: \"I've no memory at all of the tune ... I wonder whether Paul really made up [the melody to] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already.\"Talking in the 1990s to his official biographer, Barry Miles, McCartney said that the lyrics address duality, reflecting his astrological sign of Gemini.

Lindsey Buckingham reworked the song by recycling the intro of an earlier song from a duet with Nicks, \"Lola (My Love)\", originally released on their self-titled 1973 album. During the verses, Buckingham instructed Fleetwood to play a straight quarter note pattern on the kick drum. The Dobro, a type of resonator guitar, supplied the verse riff. Stevie Nicks had written the lyrics separately and thought they would be a good match; she and Christine McVie did some reworking to create the first section of the tune.

It is clear that the first movement of Concerto No. 1 (BWV 1046) was based on an introduction to Bach's 1713 cantata Was mir behagt, and the second and last may have been as well. It also seems likely that Concerto No. 5 was the last to be written; it features a prominent harpsichord part, which is presumed to be for a new instrument ordered for Prince Leopold from the instrument-maker Michael Mietke and paid for by Bach in Berlin in 1719. Speculation regarding the composition dates of the other concertos varies, taking into account the styles of the pieces as well as the instrumentation Bach would have had available during his years prior to the date of the compiled manuscript.In 1721, Bach compiled the six concertos, writing them almost entirely in his own hand instead of leaving the work to a copyist. He presented the collection to Christian Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, under the title Six Concerts Avec plusieurs instruments (Six Concertos for several instruments) with a dedication dated 24 March. Translated from the original French, the first sentence of Bach's dedication reads:\n\nAs I had the good fortune a few years ago to be heard by Your Royal Highness, at Your Highness's commands, and as I noticed then that Your Highness took some pleasure in the little talents which Heaven has given me for Music, and as in taking Leave of Your Royal Highness, Your Highness deigned to honour me with the command to send Your Highness some pieces of my Composition: I have in accordance with Your Highness's most gracious orders taken the liberty of rendering my most humble duty to Your Royal Highness with the present Concertos, which I have adapted to several instruments; begging Your Highness most humbly not to judge their imperfection with the rigour of that discriminating and sensitive taste, which everyone knows Him to have for musical works, but rather to take into benign Consideration the profound respect and the most humble obedience which I thus attempt to show Him.\nIt is likely that the performance this excerpt mentions happened during the trip Bach took to Berlin in 1719, to pay for the new Mietke harpsichord.Bach's titular reference to scoring the concertos for \"several instruments\" has drawn commentary. Christoph Wolff treats it as an understatement, observing that Bach used the \"widest imaginable spectrum of orchestral instruments. The modest title does not begin to suggest the degree of innovation exhibited in the daring combinations ...  Every one of the six concertos set a precedent in its scoring, and every one was to remain without parallel.\" Boyd (1993) interprets it as an indication that the concertos are written in a Venetian style, \"with its greater opportunities for soloistic display ... 'Concerti a quattro', 'Concerti a cinque' etc.\", and also perhaps that Bach was indicating the number of different instruments, or that the sound was intended to evoke a larger orchestra even with only one player to a part. Heinrich Besseler has noted that the overall forces required (leaving aside the first concerto, which was rewritten for a special occasion) tallies exactly with the 17 players Bach had at his disposal in K\u00f6then, although Wolff contradicts this: \"contrary to conventional wisdom, the collection does not reflect specific structure of ensembles available either to the margrave of Brandenburg or to the prince of Anhalt-C\u00f6then.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Liszt clearly places these compositions in line with the Romantic literature of his time, prefacing most pieces with a literary passage from writers such as Schiller, Byron or Senancour, and, in an introduction to the entire work, writing: Having recently travelled to many new countries, through different settings and places consecrated by history and poetry; having felt that the phenomena of nature and their attendant sights did not pass before my eyes as pointless images but stirred deep emotions in my soul, and that between us a vague but immediate relationship had established itself, an undefined but real rapport, an inexplicable but undeniable communication, I have tried to portray in music a few of my strongest sensations and most lively impressions.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51376", "text": "There have been numerous recordings made of the suites, in both complete and incomplete form.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "1038_55191", "text": "Antoine Bo\u00ebsset, Antoine Boesset or Anthoine de Boesset (1586 \u2013 8 December 1643), sieur de Villedieu, was the superintendent of music at the Ancien R\u00e9gime French court and a composer of secular music, particularly airs de cour.

Set in the 1470s during a time of war between the Turks and Venetians, the work was commissioned by the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. Della Valle based his libretto on his earlier play Anna Erizo. The name of the title character, Maometto II, refers to the real-life Ottoman Sultan and conqueror of Constantinople Mehmed II, who lived from 1432 to 1481.\nRegarded \"in some ways [as his] most ambitious opera\" and as \"the best of Rossini's Neapolitan operas\", Maometto II failed to find an audience in Naples and, \"to help ensure [its] success in Venice and Paris, he smoothed out the most audacious elements of the score\".

The lyric came from three song ideas that Lennon had been working on, the first of which was inspired by hearing a police siren at his home in Weybridge; Lennon wrote the lines \"Mis-ter cit-y police-man\" to the rhythm and melody of the siren. The second idea was a short rhyme about Lennon sitting amidst his garden, while the third was a nonsense phrase about sitting on a corn flake. Unable to finish the three different songs, he combined them into one. The lyric also included the phrase \"Lucy in the sky\", a reference to the Beatles' earlier song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\nThe walrus refers to Lewis Carroll's poem \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\" (from the book Through the Looking-Glass). Lennon later expressed dismay upon belatedly realising that the walrus was a villain in the poem.The final piece of the song came together during a visit from Pete Shotton, Lennon's friend and former fellow member of the Quarrymen, when Lennon asked him about a playground nursery rhyme they sang as children. Shotton recalled the rhyme as follows:\n\nLennon borrowed a couple of images from the first two lines. Shotton was also responsible for suggesting that Lennon change the phrase \"waiting for the man to come\" to \"waiting for the van to come\". The Beatles' official biographer, Hunter Davies, was present while the song was being written and wrote an account in his 1968 book The Beatles. According to this biography, Lennon remarked to Shotton, \"Let the fuckers work that one out.\" While the band were studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968, George Harrison told journalist Lewis Lapham that one of the lines in \"I Am the Walrus\" incorporated the personal mantra he had received from their meditation teacher, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. According to Pattie Boyd, Harrison's wife at the time, the words \"semolina pilchard\" refer to Sergeant Pilcher of the London Drug Squad, who waged a campaign against British rock stars and underground figures during the late 1960s.Lennon claimed he wrote the first two lines on separate acid trips; he explained much of the song to Playboy in 1980:\nThe first line was written on one acid trip one weekend. The second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend, and it was filled in after I met Yoko ... I'd seen Allen Ginsberg and some other people who liked Dylan and Jesus going on about Hare Krishna. It was Ginsberg, in particular, I was referring to. The words 'Element'ry penguin' meant that it's na\u00efve to just go around chanting Hare Krishna or putting all your faith in one idol. In those days I was writing obscurely, \u00e0 la Dylan.

The text was compiled from the King James Bible and the Coverdale Psalter by Charles Jennens. It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere a year later. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music.\nHandel's reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens's text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ. The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others, and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds, the only \"scene\" taken from the Gospels. In Part II, Handel concentrates on the Passion of Jesus and ends with the Hallelujah chorus. In Part III he covers Paul's teachings on the resurrection of the dead and Christ's glorification in heaven.\nHandel wrote Messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces, with optional alternate settings for many of the individual numbers. In the years after his death, the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale, with giant orchestras and choirs. In other efforts to update it, its orchestration was revised and amplified, such as Mozart's Der Messias. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to Handel's original intentions, although \"big Messiah\" productions continue to be mounted.

It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, Falstaff did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer's canon.

It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder, and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias.\nPuccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.\nMusically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot\u2014musicologist Joseph Kerman famously called it a \"shabby little shocker\"\u2014the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas.

The conductor, Carlo Sabajno, had been the Gramophone Company's house conductor since 1904; he had made early complete recordings of several operas, including Verdi's La traviata and Rigoletto, before tackling Tosca with a largely unknown cast, featuring the Italian soprano Lya Remondini in the title role. The next year, in 1919, Sabajno recorded Tosca again, this time with more well-known singers, including Valentina Bartolomasi and Attilio Salvaneschi as Tosca and Cavaradossi. Ten years later, in 1929, Sabajno returned to the opera for the third time, recording it, by the electrical process, with the orchestra and chorus of the Teatro alla Scala and with stars Carmen Melis and Apollo Granforte in the roles of Tosca and Scarpia. In 1938 HMV secured the services of the renowned tenor Beniamino Gigli, together with the soprano Maria Caniglia as Tosca and conductor Oliviero De Fabritiis, for a \"practically complete\" recording that extended over 14 double-sided shellac discs.In the post-war period, following the invention of long-playing records, Tosca recordings were dominated by Maria Callas. In 1953, with conductor Victor de Sabata and the La Scala forces, she made the recording for EMI which for decades has been considered the best of all the recorded performances of the opera. She recorded the role again for EMI in stereo in 1964. A number of Callas's live stage performances of Tosca were also preserved. The earliest were two performances in Mexico City, in 1950 and 1952, and the last was in London in 1965. The first stereo recording of the opera was made in 1957 by RCA Victor. Erich Leinsdorf conducted the Rome Opera House orchestra and chorus with Zinka Milanov as Tosca, Jussi Bj\u00f6rling as Cavaradossi and Leonard Warren as Scarpia.

Despite some dissatisfaction expressed by Ricordi concerning the final act, the score remained relatively unchanged in the 1909 edition. An unamended edition was published by Dover Press in 1991.The 1909 score contains a number of minor changes from the autograph score. Some are changes of phrase: Cavaradossi's reply to the sacristan when he asks if the painter is doing penance is changed from \"Pranzai\" (\"I have eaten.\") to \"Fame non ho\" (\"I am not hungry.\"), which William Ashbrook states, in his study of Puccini's operas, accentuates the class distinction between the two. When Tosca comforts Cavaradossi after the torture scene, she now tells him, \"Ma il giusto Iddio lo punir\u00e1\" (\"But a just God will punish him\"  [Scarpia]); formerly she stated, \"Ma il sozzo sbirro lo pagher\u00e0\" (\"But the filthy cop will pay for it.\"). Other changes are in the music; when Tosca demands the price for Cavaradossi's freedom (\"Il prezzo!\"), her music is changed to eliminate an octave leap, allowing her more opportunity to express her contempt and loathing of Scarpia in a passage which is now near the middle of the soprano vocal range. A remnant of a \"Latin Hymn\" sung by Tosca and Cavaradossi in act 3 survived into the first published score and libretto, but is not in later versions. According to Ashbrook, the most surprising change is where, after Tosca discovers the truth about the \"mock\" execution and exclaims \"Finire cos\u00ec? Finire cos\u00ec?\" (\"To end like this? To end like this?\"), she was to sing a five-bar fragment to the melody of \"E lucevan le stelle\". Ashbrook applauds Puccini for deleting the section from a point in the work where delay is almost unendurable as events rush to their conclusion, but points out that the orchestra's recalling \"E lucevan le stelle\" in the final notes would seem less incongruous if it was meant to underscore Tosca's and Cavaradossi's love for each other, rather than being simply a melody which Tosca never hears.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was composed between 1857 and 1859 and premiered at the K\u00f6nigliches Hoftheater und Nationaltheater in Munich on 10 June 1865 with Hans von B\u00fclow conducting. Wagner referred to the work not as an opera, but called it \"eine Handlung\" (literally a drama, a plot, or an action).\nWagner's composition of Tristan und Isolde was inspired by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer (particularly The World as Will and Representation), as well as by Wagner's affair with Mathilde Wesendonck. Widely acknowledged as a pinnacle of the operatic repertoire, Tristan was notable for Wagner's unprecedented use of chromaticism, tonal ambiguity, orchestral colour, and harmonic suspension.\nThe opera was enormously influential among Western classical composers and provided direct inspiration to composers such as Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Benjamin Britten. Other composers such as Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner's musical legacy. Many see Tristan as a milestone on the move away from common practice harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century. Both Wagner's libretto style and music were also profoundly influential on the symbolist poets of the late 19th century and early 20th century.The autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51643", "text": "Tristan und Isolde has a long recorded history and most of the major Wagner conductors since the end of the First World War have had their interpretations captured on disc. The limitations of recording technology meant that until the 1930s it was difficult to record the entire opera, however recordings of excerpts or single acts exist going back to 1901, when excerpts of Tristan were captured on the Mapleson Cylinders recorded during performances at the Metropolitan Opera.In the years before World War II, Kirsten Flagstad and Lauritz Melchior were considered to be the prime interpreters of the lead roles, and mono recordings exist of this pair in a number of live performances led by conductors such as Thomas Beecham, Fritz Reiner, Artur Bodanzky and Erich Leinsdorf. Flagstad recorded the part commercially only near the end of her career in 1952, under Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler for EMI, producing a set which is considered a classic recording.Following the war, another classic recording is the 1952 performance at the Bayreuth Festival with Martha M\u00f6dl and Ram\u00f3n Vinay under Herbert von Karajan, which is noted for its strong, vivid characterizations and is now available as a live recording. In the 1960s, the soprano Birgit Nilsson was considered the major Isolde interpreter, and she was often partnered with the Tristan of Wolfgang Windgassen. Their performance at Bayreuth in 1966 under the baton of Karl B\u00f6hm was captured by Deutsche Grammophon \u2013 a performance often hailed as one of the best Tristan recordings.Karajan did not record the opera officially until 1971\u201372. Karajan's selection of a lighter soprano voice (Helga Dernesch) as Isolde, paired with an extremely intense Jon Vickers and the unusual balance between orchestra and singers favoured by Karajan was controversial. In the 1980s recordings by conductors such as Carlos Kleiber, Reginald Goodall, and Leonard Bernstein were mostly considered to be important for the interpretation of the conductor, rather than that of the lead performers. The set by Kleiber is notable as Isolde was sung by the famous Mozartian soprano Margaret Price, who never sang the role of Isolde on stage. The same is true for Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, who sang the role of Tristan to critical acclaim in the 2005 EMI release under the baton of Antonio Pappano despite never having sung the role on stage. In the last ten years acclaimed sets include a studio recording with the Berlin Philharmonic by Daniel Barenboim and a live set from the Vienna Staatsoper led by Christian Thielemann.\nThere are several DVD productions of the opera including G\u00f6tz Friedrich's production at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin featuring the seasoned Wagnerians Ren\u00e9 Kollo and Dame Gwyneth Jones in the title roles. Deutsche Grammophon released a DVD of a Metropolitan Opera performance featuring Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner, conducted by James Levine, in a production staged by Dieter Dorn and a DVD of the 1993 Bayreuth Festival production with conductor Daniel Barenboim and featuring Waltraud Meier as Isolde and Siegfried Jerusalem as Tristan, staged by Heiner M\u00fcller. More recently Barenboim's production at La Scala, Milan, in the production by Patrice Ch\u00e9reau has also been issued on DVD.

He left his wife, Minna, in Dresden, and fled to Z\u00fcrich. There, in 1852, he met the wealthy silk trader Otto Wesendonck. Wesendonck became a supporter of Wagner and bankrolled the composer for several years. Wesendonck's wife, Mathilde, became enamoured of the composer. Though Wagner was working on his epic Der Ring des Nibelungen, he found himself intrigued by the legend of Tristan and Isolde.\nThe re-discovery of medieval Germanic poetry, including Gottfried von Strassburg's version of Tristan, the Nibelungenlied and Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, left a large impact on the German Romantic movements during the mid-19th century. The story of Tristan and Isolde is a quintessential romance of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Several versions of the story exist, the earliest dating to the middle of the 12th century. Gottfried's version, part of the \"courtly\" branch of the legend, had a huge influence on later German literature.According to his autobiography, Mein Leben, Wagner decided to dramatise the Tristan legend after his friend, Karl Ritter, attempted to do so, writing that:\n\nHe had, in fact, made a point of giving prominence to the lighter phases of the romance, whereas it was its all-pervading tragedy that impressed me so deeply that I felt convinced it should stand out in bold relief, regardless of minor details.\nThis influence, together with his discovery of the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer in October 1854, led Wagner to find himself in a \"serious mood created by Schopenhauer, which was trying to find ecstatic expression. It was some such mood that inspired the conception of a Tristan und Isolde.\"\nWagner wrote of his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and Tristan in a letter to Franz Liszt (16 December 1854): Never in my life having enjoyed the true happiness of love I shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter repletion. I have devised in my mind a Tristan und Isolde, the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the 'black flag' that waves at the end I shall cover myself over \u2013 to die.\nBy the end of 1854, Wagner had sketched out all three acts of an opera on the Tristan theme, based on Gottfried von Strassburg's telling of the story. While the earliest extant sketches date from December 1856, it was not until August 1857 that Wagner began devoting his attention entirely to the opera, putting aside the composition of Siegfried to do so. On 20 August he began the prose sketch for the opera, and the libretto (or poem, as Wagner preferred to call it) was completed by 18 September. Wagner, at this time, had moved into a cottage built in the grounds of Wesendonck's villa, where, during his work on Tristan und Isolde, he became passionately involved with Mathilde Wesendonck. Whether or not this relationship was platonic remains uncertain. One evening in September of that year, Wagner read the finished poem of \"Tristan\" to an audience including his wife, Minna, his current muse, Mathilde, and his future mistress (and later wife), Cosima von B\u00fclow.\nBy October 1857, Wagner had begun the composition sketch of the first act. During November, however, he set five of Mathilde's poems to music known today as the Wesendonck Lieder. This was an unusual move by Wagner, who almost never set to music poetic texts other than his own. Wagner described two of the songs \u2013 \"Im Treibhaus\" and \"Tr\u00e4ume\" \u2013 as \"Studies for Tristan und Isolde\": \"Tr\u00e4ume\" uses a motif that forms the love duet in Act II of Tristan, while \"Im Treibhaus\" introduces a theme that later became the prelude to Act III. But Wagner resolved to write Tristan only after he had secured a publishing deal with the Leipzig-based firm Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel, in January 1858. From this point on, Wagner finished each act and sent it off for engraving before he started on the next \u2013 a remarkable feat given the unprecedented length and complexity of the score.In April 1858 Wagner's wife Minna intercepted a note from Wagner to Mathilde and, despite Wagner's protests that she was putting a \"vulgar interpretation\" on the note, she accused first Wagner and then Mathilde of unfaithfulness. After enduring much misery, Wagner persuaded Minna, who had a heart condition, to rest at a spa while Otto Wesendonck took Mathilde to Italy. It was during the absence of the two women that Wagner began the composition sketch of the second act of Tristan. However, Minna's return in July 1858 did not clear the air, and on 17 August, Wagner was forced to leave both Minna and Mathilde and move to Venice.\n\nWagner would later describe his last days in Zurich as \"a veritable Hell\". Minna wrote to Mathilde before departing for Dresden: I must tell you with a bleeding heart that you have succeeded in separating my husband from me after nearly twenty-two years of marriage. May this noble deed contribute to your peace of mind, to your happiness.\nWagner finished the second act of Tristan during his eight-month exile in Venice, where he lived in the Palazzo Giustinian. In March 1859, fearing extradition to Saxony, where he was still considered a fugitive, Wagner moved to Lucerne where he composed the last act, completing it in August 1859.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51640", "text": "Tristan und Isolde is scored for the following instruments:\n\n3 flutes (one doubles piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons\n4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, bass tuba\ntimpani, cymbals, triangle\nharp\n1st and 2nd violins, violas, violoncellos, and double basses (Die Streichinstrumente sind vorz\u00fcglich gut und stark zu besetzen.

The Liebestod can be performed either in a purely orchestral version, or with a soprano singing Isolde's vision of Tristan resurrected.\nHowever, the very first time the prelude and its opening \"Tristan chord\" was heard publicly was on 12 March 1859, when it was performed at the Sophieninselsaal in Prague, in a charity concert in aid of poor medical students, conducted by Hans von B\u00fclow, who provided his own concert ending for the occasion. Wagner had authorised such an ending, but did not like what B\u00fclow had done with it and later wrote his own. Wagner then included the prelude in his own three concerts at the Paris Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien in January\u2013February 1860.Wagner called the prelude the \"Liebestod\" (Love-death) while Isolde's final aria \"Mild und leise\" he called the \"Verkl\u00e4rung\" (Transfiguration). In 1867 his father-in-law Franz Liszt made a piano transcription of \"Mild und leise\", which he called \"Liebestod\" (S.447); he prefaced his score with a four-bar motto from the love duet from Act II, which in the opera is sung to the words \"sehnend verlangter Liebestod\". Liszt's transcription became well known throughout Europe well before Wagner's opera reached most places, and it is Liszt's title for the final scene that persists. The transcription was revised in 1875.Wagner wrote a concert ending for the Act II Love Duet for a planned 1862 concert performance that did not eventuate. The music was lost until 1950, then passed into private hands, before coming to the attention of Daniel Barenboim, who passed it on to Sir Antonio Pappano. The first recording of the Love Duet with the concert ending was made in 2000, with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Deborah Voigt and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House under Pappano.Another composer to rework material from Tristan was Emmanuel Chabrier in his humorous Souvenirs de Munich \u2013 quadrilles on themes from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. These were augmented and orchestrated by Markus Lehmann in 1988. Leopold Stokowski made a series of purely orchestral \"Symphonic Syntheses\" of Wagner's operas during his time as conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, bringing to concert audiences of the 1920s and '30s music they might not otherwise have heard. He made a 'long version' of music from Tristan and Isolde which consisted mainly of the Act I prelude, the Liebesnacht from Act II and the Liebestod from Act III. A shorter version of music from the 2nd and 3rd acts was called \"Love Music from Tristan and Isolde\". He made recordings of both versions on 78s and again on LP.\nThe British composer Ronald Stevenson has made two arrangements based on the opera. The first is The Fugue on the Shepherd's Air from Tristan und Isolde from 1999.

In this version Orpheus is not the son of Apollo but a rustic violin teacher. He is glad to be rid of his wife, Eurydice, when she is abducted by the god of the underworld, Pluto. Orpheus has to be bullied by Public Opinion into trying to rescue Eurydice. The reprehensible conduct of the gods of Olympus in the opera was widely seen as a veiled satire of the court and government of Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Some critics expressed outrage at the librettists' disrespect for classic mythology and the composer's parody of Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice; others praised the piece highly.\nOrph\u00e9e aux enfers was Offenbach's first full-length opera.

It belongs to the genre of the azione teatrale, meaning an opera on a mythological subject with choruses and dancing. The piece was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 5 October 1762, in the presence of Empress Maria Theresa. Orfeo ed Euridice is the first of Gluck's \"reform\" operas, in which he attempted to replace the abstruse plots and overly complex music of opera seria with a \"noble simplicity\" in both the music and the drama.The opera is the most popular of Gluck's works, and was one of the most influential on subsequent German operas.

Portions of the score were originally written for an earlier, never-completed opera. Beethoven revised Fidelio three times; the work caused Beethoven so much vexation that he vowed never to compose another opera.\nThe distant origin of Fidelio dates from 1803, when the librettist and impresario Emanuel Schikaneder worked out a contract with Beethoven to write an opera. The contract included free lodging for Beethoven in the apartment complex that was part of Schikaneder's large suburban theater, the Theater an der Wien. Beethoven was to set a new libretto by Schikaneder, entitled Vestas Feuer; however, this libretto was not to Beethoven's liking. He spent about a month composing music for it, then abandoned it when the libretto for Fidelio came to his attention.\nThe time Beethoven spent on Vestas Feuer was not entirely wasted, as two important numbers from Fidelio, Pizarro's \"'Ha!

With its underlying struggle for liberty and justice mirroring contemporary political movements in Europe, such topics are typical of Beethoven's \"middle period\". Notable moments in the opera include the \"Prisoners' Chorus\" (O welche Lust\u2014\"O what a joy\"), an ode to freedom sung by a chorus of political prisoners, Florestan's vision of Leonore come as an angel to rescue him, and the scene in which the rescue finally takes place.

It belongs to the genre of the azione teatrale, meaning an opera on a mythological subject with choruses and dancing. The piece was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 5 October 1762, in the presence of Empress Maria Theresa. Orfeo ed Euridice is the first of Gluck's \"reform\" operas, in which he attempted to replace the abstruse plots and overly complex music of opera seria with a \"noble simplicity\" in both the music and the drama.The opera is the most popular of Gluck's works, and was one of the most influential on subsequent German operas. Variations on its plot\u2014the underground rescue mission in which the hero must control, or conceal, his emotions\u2014can be found in Mozart's The Magic Flute, Beethoven's Fidelio, and Wagner's Das Rheingold.\nThough originally set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to the genre of French opera, particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline. This reworking was given the title Orph\u00e9e et Eurydice, and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51669", "text": "The first lines of arias, choruses, etc., are given in Italian (1762 version) and French (1774 version).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51722", "text": "L'Orfeo (SV 318) (Italian pronunciation: [lor\u02c8f\u025b\u02d0o]), or La favola d'Orfeo [la \u02c8fa\u02d0vola dor\u02c8f\u025b\u02d0o], is a late Renaissance/early Baroque favola in musica, or opera, by Claudio Monteverdi, with a libretto by Alessandro Striggio. It is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus, and tells the story of his descent to Hades and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride Eurydice back to the living world. It was written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual Carnival at Mantua. While Jacopo Peri's Dafne is generally recognised as the first work in the opera genre, and the earliest surviving opera is Peri's Euridice, L'Orfeo is the earliest that is still regularly performed.\nBy the early 17th century the traditional intermedio\u2014a musical sequence between the acts of a straight play\u2014was evolving into the form of a complete musical drama or \"opera\". Monteverdi's L'Orfeo moved this process out of its experimental era and provided the first fully developed example of the new genre. After its initial performance the work was staged again in Mantua, and possibly in other Italian centres in the next few years. Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615. After the composer's death in 1643 the opera went unperformed for many years, and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances. At first these performances tended to be concert (unstaged) versions within institutes and music societies, but following the first modern dramatised performance in Paris, in 1911, the work began to be seen in theatres. After the Second World War many recordings were issued, and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses, although some leading venues resisted it. In 2007, the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world.\nIn his published score Monteverdi lists around 41 instruments to be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed at the point of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque, L'Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony.

The Italian-language libretto was adapted by Arrigo Boito from the play The Merry Wives of Windsor and scenes from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2, by William Shakespeare. The work premiered on 9 February 1893 at La Scala, Milan.\nVerdi wrote Falstaff, the last of his 26 operas, as he approached the age of 80. It was his second comedy, and his third work based on a Shakespeare play, following Macbeth and Otello. The plot revolves around the thwarted, sometimes farcical, efforts of the fat knight Sir John Falstaff to seduce two married women to gain access to their husbands' wealth.\nVerdi was concerned about working on a new opera at his advanced age, but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito's draft libretto. It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, Falstaff did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer's canon. After the initial performances in Italy, other European countries and the US, the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s into the next century. Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi's previous operas, a view that Toscanini strongly opposed. Conductors of the generation after Toscanini to champion the work included Herbert von Karajan, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein. The work is now part of the standard operatic repertory.\nVerdi made numerous changes to the music after the first performance, and editors have found difficulty in agreeing on a definitive score. The work was first recorded in 1932 and has subsequently received many studio and live recordings. Singers closely associated with the title role have included Victor Maurel (the first Falstaff), Mariano Stabile, Giuseppe Valdengo, Tito Gobbi, Geraint Evans, Bryn Terfel and Ambrogio Maestri.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51772", "text": "Time: The reign of Henry IV, 1399 to 1413Place: Windsor, England", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51774", "text": "There are two early recordings of Falstaff's short arietta \"Quand'ero paggio\". Pini Corsi, the original Ford, recorded it in 1904, and Maurel followed in 1907. The first recording of the complete opera was made by Italian Columbia in March and April 1932. It was conducted by Lorenzo Molajoli with the chorus and orchestra of La Scala, and a cast including Giacomo Rimini as Falstaff and Pia Tassinari as Alice. Some live stage performances were recorded in the 1930s, but the next studio recording was that conducted by Arturo Toscanini for the 1950 NBC radio broadcast released on disc by RCA Victor. The first stereophonic recording was conducted by Herbert von Karajan for EMI in 1956.Among the singers whose performances of the title role are on live or studio recordings, Italians include Renato Bruson, Tito Gobbi, Rolando Panerai, Ruggero Raimondi, Mariano Stabile, Giuseppe Taddei and Giuseppe Valdengo; Francophone singers include Gabriel Bacquier, Jean-Philippe Lafont and Jos\u00e9 van Dam; Germans include Walter Berry, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hans Hotter; and UK and US singers include Geraint Evans, Donald Gramm, Bryn Terfel, Leonard Warren and Willard White.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51773", "text": "Verdi scored Falstaff for three flutes (third doubling piccolo), two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, four trombones, timpani, percussion (triangle, cymbals, bass drum), harp, and strings. In addition, a guitar, natural horn, and bell are heard from offstage. Unlike most of Verdi's earlier operatic scores, Falstaff is through-composed. No list of numbers is printed in the published full score. The score differs from much of Verdi's earlier work by having no overture: there are seven bars for the orchestra before the first voice (Dr Caius) enters. The critic Rodney Milnes comments that \"enjoyment ... shines from every bar in its irresistible forward impulse, its effortless melody, its rhythmic vitality, and sureness of dramatic pace and construction.\" In The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Roger Parker writes that:\n\nthe listener is bombarded by a stunning diversity of rhythms, orchestral textures, melodic motifs and harmonic devices. Passages that in earlier times would have furnished material for an entire number here crowd in on each other, shouldering themselves unceremoniously to the fore in bewildering succession.\nThe opera was described by its creators as a commedia lirica. McDonald commented in 2009 that Falstaff is very different \u2013 a stylistic departure \u2013 from Verdi's earlier work. In McDonald's view most of the musical expression is in the dialogue, and there is only one traditional aria. The result is that \"such stylistic economy \u2013 more sophisticated, more challenging than he had employed before \u2013 is the keynote of the work.\" McDonald argues that consciously or unconsciously, Verdi was developing the idiom that would come to dominate the music of the 20th century: \"the lyricism is abbreviated, glanced at rather than indulged. Melodies bloom suddenly and then vanish, replaced by contrasting tempo or an unexpected phrase that introduces another character or idea\". In McDonald's view the orchestral writing acts as a sophisticated commentator on the action. It has influenced at least one of Verdi's operatic successors: in 1952 Imogen Holst, musical assistant to Benjamin Britten, wrote, after a performance of Falstaff, \"I realised for the first time how much Ben owes to [Verdi]. There are orchestral bits which are just as funny to listen to as the comic instrumental bits in A. Herring!\"The extent to which Falstaff is a \"Shakespearian\" opera has often been debated by critics. Although the action is taken from The Merry Wives of Windsor, some commentators feel that Boito and Verdi have transmuted Shakespeare's play into a wholly Italian work. The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf believed there was nothing English or Shakespearian about the comedy: \"it was all done through the music\". In 1961 Peter Heyworth wrote in The Observer, \"Because of Shakespeare we like to think of Falstaff as a work that has a certain Englishness. In fact the opera is no more English than Aida is Egyptian. Boito and Verdi between them transformed the fat knight into one of the archetypes of opera buffa.\" Verdi himself, however, felt that the Falstaff of the opera is not a conventional Italian buffo character, but portrays Shakespeare's fuller, more ambiguous Falstaff of the Henry IV plays: \"My Falstaff is not merely the hero of The Merry Wives of Windsor, who is simply a buffoon, and allows himself to be tricked by the women, but also the Falstaff of the two parts of Henry IV. Boito has written the libretto in accordance.\" A contemporary critic argued that the text \"imitated with marvellous accuracy the metre and rhythm of Shakespeare's verse\", but Hepokoski notes Boito's use of traditional Italian metric conventions.Another recurrent question is how much, if at all, Verdi was influenced by Wagner's comic opera Die Meistersinger. At the time of the premiere this was a sensitive subject; many Italians were suspicious of or hostile to Wagner's music, and were protective in a nationalistic way of Verdi's reputation. Nevertheless, Verdi's new style was markedly different from that of his popular works of the 1850s and 1860s, and it seemed to some to have Wagnerian echoes. In 1999 the critic Andrew Porter wrote, \"That Falstaff was Verdi's and Boito's answer to Wagner's Meistersinger seems evident now. But the Italian Falstaff moves more quickly.\" Toscanini, who did more than anyone else to bring Falstaff into the regular operatic repertoire, commented:\n\nthe difference between Falstaff, which is the absolute masterpiece, and Die Meistersinger, which is an outstanding Wagnerian opera. Just think for a moment how many musical means \u2013 beautiful ones, certainly \u2013 Wagner must make use of to describe the Nuremberg night. And look how Verdi gets a similarly startling effect at a similar moment with three notes.\nVerdi scholars including Julian Budden have analysed the music in symphonic terms \u2013 the opening section \"a perfect little sonata movement\", the second act concluding with a variant of the classic slow concertante ensemble leading to a fast stretto, and the whole opera ending with \"the most academic of musical forms\", a fugue. Milnes suggests that this shows \"a wise old conservative's warning about the excesses of the verismo school of Italian opera\" already on the rise by the 1890s. Among the solo numbers woven into the continuous score are Falstaff's \"honour\" monologue, which concludes the first scene, and his reminiscent arietta (\"Quand'ero paggio\") about himself as a young page. The young lovers, Nannetta and Fenton, are given a lyrical and playful duet (\"Labbra di foco\") in act 1; in act 3, Fenton's impassioned love song, \"Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola\" briefly becomes a duet when Nannetta joins him. She then has the last substantial solo section of the score, the \"fairy\" aria, \"Sul fil d'un soffio etesio\", described by Parker as \"yet another aria suffused with the soft orchestral colours that characterize this scene\".The score is seen by the critic Richard Osborne as rich in self-parody, with sinister themes from Rigoletto and Un ballo in maschera transmuted into comedy. For Osborne the nocturnal music of act 3 draws on the examples of Weber, Berlioz and Mendelssohn, creating a mood akin to that of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Osborne views the whole opera as an ensemble piece, and he comments that grand soliloquy in the old Verdian style is reserved for Ford's \"jealousy\" aria in act 2, which is almost tragic in style but comic in effect, making Ford \"a figure to be laughed at.\" Osborne concludes his analysis, \"Falstaff is comedy's musical apogee: the finest opera, inspired by the finest dramatist, by the finest opera composer the world has known\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

After seeing Mascagni's success, Leoncavallo decided to write an opera in response: one act composed in the verismo style.\nLeoncavallo based the story of Pagliacci on an incident from his childhood: the 1865 murder of a Leoncavallo family servant, Gaetano Scavello, killed by Gaetano D'Alessandro, with brother Luigi acting as accomplice. The incident stemmed from a series of perceived romantic entanglements involving Scavello, Luigi D'Alessandro, and a village girl with whom both men were infatuated. Leoncavallo's father, a judge, presided as magistrate over the criminal investigation.Leoncavallo originally titled his story Il pagliaccio (The Clown). The baritone Victor Maurel, who was cast as the first Tonio, requested that Leoncavallo change the title from the singular Il pagliaccio to the plural I Pagliacci, to broaden dramatic interest from Canio alone to include Tonio (his own role).The French author Catulle Mend\u00e8s sued Leoncavallo for plagiarism after learning of the plot of Leoncavallo's libretto from an 1894 French translation. Mend\u00e8s thought it resembled his 1887 play La Femme de Tabarin, which was structured as a play-within-the-play and featured a clown murdering his wife. Leoncavallo pleaded ignorance of Mend\u00e8s's play. Later, there were counter-accusations that Mend\u00e8s's play resembled Don Manuel Tamayo y Baus's Un Drama Nuevo (1867). Mend\u00e8s dropped his lawsuit. Scholar Matteo Sansone has suggested that Leoncavallo had ample opportunity to be exposed to new French art and musical works while living in Paris from 1882 to 1888, including potentially Mend\u00e8s's play, another version of La femme de Tabarin by Paul Ferrier, and Tabarin, an opera composed by \u00c9mile Pessard that was based on Ferrier's play.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The composer began work on the theme in 1867, just two years after completing his first (and as then yet unperformed) opera, Le timbre d'argent. Saint-Sa\u00ebns had approached Ferdinand Lemaire, the husband of one of his wife's cousins, about writing a libretto for the oratorio but Lemaire convinced the composer that the story was better suited to an opera.\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns later wrote: A young relative of mine had married a charming young man who wrote verse on the side. I realized that he was gifted and had in fact real talent. I asked him to work with me on an oratorio on a biblical subject. 'An oratorio!', he said, 'no, let's make it an opera!', and he began to dig through the Bible while I outlined the plan of the work, even sketching scenes, and leaving him only the versification to do. For some reason I began the music with act 2, and I played it at home to a select audience who could make nothing of it at all.\nAfter Lemaire finished the libretto, Saint-Sa\u00ebns began actively composing act 2 of the opera, producing an aria for Dalila, a duet for Samson and Dalila, and some musical pieces for the chorus (some of which were later assigned to act 1) during 1867\u20131869. From the very beginning, the work was conceived as a grand duet between Samson and Dalila set off against the approaching tempest. Although the orchestration was not yet complete, act 2 was presented in a private performance in 1870 just prior to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War with Saint-Sa\u00ebns playing the orchestral parts, which were largely improvised, on the piano. Composer Augusta Holm\u00e8s (Dalila), painter Henri Regnault (Samson), and Romain Bussine (High Priest) rendered their roles from part books.\nIn spite of many precedents, the French public reacted negatively to Saint-Sa\u00ebns's intention of putting a Biblical subject on the stage. The alarm on the part of the public caused him to abandon working further on the opera for the next two years.\nIn the summer of 1872, not too long after the premiere of Saint-Sa\u00ebns's second opera La princesse jaune, the composer went to Weimar to see the first revival of Wagner's Das Rheingold under the baton of Franz Liszt, the former musical director of the Weimar court orchestra and opera. Liszt was highly interested in producing new works by talented composers and persuaded Saint-Sa\u00ebns to finish Samson and Delilah, even offering to produce the completed work at the grand-ducal opera house in Weimar. Encouraged, Saint-Sa\u00ebns began composing act 1 in late 1872 and worked on it sporadically for the next few years. He wrote a large amount of act 1 and completed it during a trip to Algiers in 1874. Upon returning to France in 1875, Saint-Sa\u00ebns presented act 1 in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in a similar format as the 1870 performance of act 2. The work was harshly received by music critics and failed to gain the public's interest. That year acclaimed mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, for whom Saint-Sa\u00ebns wrote the role of Dalila, organized and performed in a private performance of act 2 at a friend's home in Croissy, with the composer at the piano. Viardot was a great admirer of the work and she hoped that this private performance would encourage Halanzier, the director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra who was in attendance, to mount a full production. Although Saint-Sa\u00ebns completed the score in 1876, no opera houses in France displayed any desire to stage Samson et Dalila.

Saint-Sa\u00ebns and his librettist most likely made this choice so the story would concentrate on Dalila. Samson, therefore, is presented as an inspiring leader rather than the almost supernatural hero of the Bible. It is his vulnerable, tender heart and his susceptibility to the protestations of love from a dissembling woman that is the focus of the plot.

It was Monteverdi's last opera, with a libretto by Giovanni Francesco Busenello, and was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1643 carnival season. One of the first operas to use historical events and people, it describes how Poppaea, mistress of the Roman emperor Nero, is able to achieve her ambition and be crowned empress. The opera was revived in Naples in 1651, but was then neglected until the rediscovery of the score in 1888, after which it became the subject of scholarly attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s, the opera has been performed and recorded many times.\nThe original manuscript of the score does not exist; two surviving copies from the 1650s show significant differences from each other, and each differs to some extent from the libretto. How much of the music is actually Monteverdi's, and how much the product of others, is a matter of dispute. None of the existing versions of the libretto, printed or manuscript, can be definitively tied to the first performance at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo, the precise date of which is unknown. Details of the original cast are few and largely speculative, and there is no record of the opera's initial public reception. Despite these uncertainties, the work is generally accepted as part of the Monteverdi operatic canon, his last and perhaps his greatest work.\nIn a departure from traditional literary morality, it is the adulterous liaison of Poppea and Nerone which wins the day, although this triumph is demonstrated by history to have been transitory and hollow. In Busenello's version of the story all the major characters are morally compromised. Written when the genre of opera was only a few decades old, the music for L'incoronazione di Poppea has been praised for its originality, its melody, and for its reflection of the human attributes of its characters.

{"id": "86_429", "question": "Who is the composer of Rhapsody in Blue?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_51835", "text": "Rhapsody in Blue is a 1924 musical composition written by George Gershwin for solo piano and jazz band, which combines elements of classical music with jazz-influenced effects. Commissioned by bandleader Paul Whiteman, the work premiered in a concert titled \"An Experiment in Modern Music\" on February 12, 1924, in Aeolian Hall, New York City. Whiteman's band performed the rhapsody with Gershwin playing the piano. Whiteman's arranger Ferde Grof\u00e9 orchestrated the rhapsody several times including the 1924 original scoring, the 1926 pit orchestra scoring, and the 1942 symphonic scoring.\nThe rhapsody is one of Gershwin's most recognizable creations and a key composition that defined the Jazz Age. Gershwin's piece inaugurated a new era in America's musical history, established his reputation as an eminent composer and became one of the most popular of all concert works. In the American Heritage magazine, Frederic D. Schwarz posits that the famous opening clarinet glissando has become as instantly recognizable to concert audiences as the opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51838", "text": "As a jazz concerto, Rhapsody in Blue is written for solo piano with orchestra. A rhapsody differs from a concerto in that it features one extended movement instead of separate movements. Rhapsodies often incorporate passages of an improvisational nature\u2014although written out in a score\u2014and are irregular in form, with heightened contrasts and emotional exuberance. The music ranges from intensely rhythmic piano solos to slow, broad, and richly orchestrated sections. Consequently, the Rhapsody \"may be looked upon as a fantasia, with no strict fidelity to form.\"The opening of Rhapsody in Blue is written as a clarinet trill followed by a legato, 17 notes in a diatonic scale. During a rehearsal, Whiteman's virtuoso clarinetist, Ross Gorman, rendered the upper portion of the scale as a captivating and trombone-like glissando. Gershwin heard it and insisted that it be repeated in the performance. The effect is produced using the tongue and throat muscles to change the resonance of the oral cavity, thus controlling the continuously rising pitch. Many clarinet players gradually open the left-hand tone holes on their instrument during the passage from the last concert F to the top concert B\u266d as well. This effect has now become standard performance practice for the work.Rhapsody in Blue features both rhythmic invention and melodic inspiration, and demonstrates Gershwin's ability to write a piece with large-scale harmonic and melodic structure. The piece is characterized by strong motivic inter-relatedness. Much of the motivic material is introduced in the first 14 measures. Musicologist David Schiff has identified five major themes plus a sixth \"tag\". Two themes appear in the first 14 measures, and the tag shows up in measure 19. Two of the remaining three themes are rhythmically related to the first theme in measure 2, which is sometimes called the \"Glissando theme\"\u2014after the opening glissando in the clarinet solo\u2014or the \"Ritornello theme\". The remaining theme is the \"Train theme\", which is the first to appear at rehearsal 9 after the opening material. All of these themes rely on the blues scale, which includes lowered sevenths and a mixture of major and minor thirds. Each theme appears both in orchestrated form and as a piano solo. There are considerable differences in the style of presentation of each theme.\n\nThe harmonic structure of the rhapsody is more difficult to analyze. The piece begins and ends in B\u266d major, but it modulates towards the sub-dominant direction and abruptly returns to B\u266d major at the end. The opening modulates \"downward\" through the keys B\u266d, E\u266d, A\u266d, D\u266d, G\u266d, B, E, and finally to A major. Modulation through the circle of fifths in the reverse direction inverts classical tonal relationships, but does not abandon them. The entire middle section resides primarily in C major, with forays into G major (the dominant relation). Such modulations occur freely, although not always with harmonic direction. Gershwin frequently uses a recursive harmonic progression of minor thirds to give the illusion of motion when in fact a passage does not change key from beginning to end. Modulation by thirds is a common feature of Tin Pan Alley music.\nThe influences of jazz and other contemporary styles are present in Rhapsody in Blue. Ragtime rhythms are abundant, as is the Cuban \"clave\" rhythm, which doubles as a dance rhythm in the Charleston jazz dance. Gershwin's own intentions were to correct the belief that jazz had to be played strictly in time so that one could dance to it. The rhapsody's tempos vary widely, and there is an almost extreme use of rubato in many places throughout. The clearest influence of jazz is the use of blue notes, and the exploration of their half-step relationship plays a key role in the rhapsody. The use of so-called \"vernacular\" instruments, such as accordion, banjo, and saxophones in the orchestra, contribute to its jazz or popular style, and the latter two of these instruments have remained part of Grof\u00e9's \"standard\" orchestra scoring.Gershwin incorporated different piano styles into his work. He used the techniques of stride piano, novelty piano, comic piano, and the song-plugger piano style. Stride piano's rhythmic and improvisational style is evident in the \"agitato e misterioso\" section, which begins four bars after rehearsal 33, as well as in other sections, many of which include the orchestra. Novelty piano can be heard at rehearsal 9 with the revelation of the Train theme. The hesitations and light-hearted style of comic piano, a vaudeville approach to piano made well known by Chico Marx, are evident at rehearsal 22.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51046", "text": "The piece is scored for piano and orchestra:", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50623", "text": "Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in C-sharp minor, S.244/2, is the second in a set of 19 Hungarian Rhapsodies by composer Franz Liszt, published in 1851, and is by far the most famous of the set.\nIn both the original piano solo form and in the orchestrated version this composition has enjoyed widespread use in animated cartoons.

Though three of the concerti are wholly original, the first, \"Spring\", borrows patterns from a sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi's contemporaneous opera Il Giustino. The inspiration for the concertos is not the countryside around Mantua, as initially supposed, where Vivaldi was living at the time, since according to Karl Heller they could have been written as early as 1716\u20131717, while Vivaldi was engaged with the court of Mantua only in 1718.\nThey were a revolution in musical conception: Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), a shepherd and his barking dog, buzzing flies, storms, drunken dancers, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, and warm winter fires.\nUnusually for the period, Vivaldi published the concerti with accompanying sonnets (possibly written by the composer himself) that elucidated what it was in the spirit of each season that his music was intended to evoke.

Ferber researched these American showboats for months prior to her stay on the Floating Palace Theatre.  Jerome Kern was impressed by the novel and, hoping to adapt it as a musical, asked the critic Alexander Woollcott to introduce him to Ferber in October 1926. Woollcott introduced them that evening during the intermission of Kern's latest musical, Criss Cross.Ferber was at first shocked that anyone would want to adapt Show Boat as a musical. After being assured by Kern that he did not want to adapt it as the typical frivolous \"girlie\" show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator, Oscar Hammerstein II, the rights to set her novel to music.

The Reconstruction era had ended a decade earlier, and white-dominated Southern legislatures have imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow rules. The boat's owner, Cap'n Andy Hawks, introduces his actors to the crowd on the levee.  A fistfight breaks out between Steve Baker, the leading man of the troupe, and Pete, a rough engineer who had been making passes at Steve's wife, the leading lady Julie La Verne. Steve knocks Pete down, and Pete swears revenge, suggesting he knows a dark secret about Julie. Cap'n Andy pretends to the shocked crowd that the fight was a preview of one of the melodramas to be performed. The troupe exits with the showboat band, and the crowd follows.\nA handsome riverboat gambler, Gaylord Ravenal, appears on the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia (\"Nolie\") Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap'n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (Parthy Ann). Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal (\"Make Believe\"). She seeks advice from Joe, a black dock worker aboard the boat, who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie, the ship's cook. He replies that he has \"seen a lot like [Ravenal] on the river.\" As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice. He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of \"Ol' Man River\", who does not seem to care what the world's troubles are, but \"jes' keeps rollin' along\".\nMagnolia finds Julie inside and announces that she is in love. Julie cautions her that this stranger could be just a \"no-account river feller\". Magnolia says that if she found out he was \"no-account\", she would stop loving him. Julie warns her that it is not that easy to stop loving someone, explaining that she will always love Steve and singing a few lines of \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\". Queenie overhears \u2013 she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard \"colored folks\" sing it. Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time, and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song, Julie obliges.\nDuring the rehearsal for that evening, Julie and Steve learn that the town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists the show cannot proceed because Julie is a mulatto who has been passing as white and local law prohibits mixed marriages. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has \"black blood\" in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.\nRavenal returns and asks for passage on the boat. Andy hires him as the new leading man and assigns his daughter Magnolia as the new leading lady, over her mother's objections. As Magnolia and Ravenal begin to rehearse their roles and in the process, kiss for the first time (infuriating Parthy), Joe reprises the last few lines of \"Ol' Man River\".\nWeeks later, Magnolia and Ravenal have been a hit with the crowds and have fallen in love. As the levee workers hum \"Ol' Man River\" in the background, he proposes to Magnolia, and she accepts. The couple joyously sings \"You Are Love\". They make plans to marry the next day while Parthy, who disapproves, is out of town. Parthy has discovered that Ravenal once killed a man and arrives with the sheriff to interrupt the wedding festivities. The group learns that Ravenal was acquitted of murder. Cap'n Andy calls Parthy \"narrow-minded\" and defends Ravenal by announcing that he also once killed a man. Parthy faints, but the ceremony proceeds.\n\nAct IISix years have passed, and it is 1893. Ravenal and Magnolia have moved to Chicago, where they make a precarious living from Ravenal's gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life (\"Why Do I Love You?\") By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Ravenal abandons Magnolia and Kim, but first visits his daughter at the convent where she goes to school to say goodbye before leaving her forever (\"Make Believe\" (reprise)). Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they are doing a New Year's show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after being abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song \"Bill.\" She appears to be thinking of Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing room, she hears Magnolia singing \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice.\nOn New Year's Eve, Andy and Parthy go to Chicago for a surprise visit to their daughter Magnolia. Andy goes to the Trocadero without his wife, and sees Magnolia overcome with emotion and nearly booed off stage. Andy rallies the crowd by starting a sing-along of the standard, \"After the Ball\". Magnolia becomes a great musical star.\nMore than 20 years pass, and it is 1927. An aged Joe on the Cotton Blossom sings a reprise of \"Ol' Man River\". Cap'n Andy has a chance meeting with Ravenal and arranges his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the Cotton Blossom with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, Charleston version of \"Why Do I Love You?\" Ravenal sings a reprise of \"You Are Love\" to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple walks up the boat's gangplank, Joe and the cast sing the last verse of \"Ol' Man River\".\n\nPlot variants in 1951 filmThe 1951 MGM film changed the final scenes of the story, as well as many small details. It reconciles Ravenal and Magnolia a few years after they separate, rather than 23 years later. When Ravenal leaves Magnolia in Chicago, he does not know that she is pregnant. Through a chance meeting with Julie, he learns that Magnolia and his daughter are living on the Cotton Blossom. He goes to where the boat is docked and sees Kim playing. He talks to her and breaks down in tears. Magnolia sends Kim aboard. She and Ravenal embrace, and she leads him onto the show boat. Parthy is as happy as Captain Andy to see the reunion. Joe and the chorus sing \"Ol' Man River\", and the paddlewheel starts turning in tempo with the music, as the ship heads down river. Julie watches from a distance and blows them a gentle kiss as the Cotton Blossom recedes.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51905", "text": "1928 \u2013 original London cast album, with the show's original orchestrations.

The Marriage of Figaro came in first out of the 20 operas featured, with the magazine describing the work as being \"one of the supreme masterpieces of operatic comedy, whose rich sense of humanity shines out of Mozart\u2019s miraculous score\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51934", "text": "In 1868, Giulio Ricordi suggested the idea of revisions to Boccanegra; the idea was again broached ten years later, early in 1879, but was shrugged off by Verdi with a note saying that the 1857 score, which had been sent to the composer for review, would remain untouched \"just as you sent it to me\". Persisting with further attempts to convince the composer, Ricordi had also broached the idea of a collaboration with Arrigo Boito for a new opera based on Shakespeare's Othello. Musicologist Roger Parker speculates that Verdi's final agreement to revise Boccanegra was based on a desire to \"test the possibility\" of working with Boito before possibly embarking on the larger project.Once Verdi began to re-look at his earlier work, objections \u2013 and new ideas \u2013 began to emerge: \"the score is not possible as it stands\" and \"I shall have to redo all the second act [1857: act 2, which became act 1 in the 1881 revision] and give it more contrast and variety, more life\" are examples of his reasoning, which he laid out in a letter to Ricordi in November 1880.  His principal concern was how to make changes to the 1857, act 2. \"I have said in general it needs something to give life and variety to the drama's excessive gloom\", he writes and he continues by recalling:\n\ntwo magnificent letters of Petrarch's, one addressed to [the historical] Boccanegra, the other to the [then-]Doge of Venice, warning them not to start a fratricidal war, and reminding them that both were sons of the same mother, Italy, and so on.  This idea of an Italian fatherland at this time was quite sublime!In spite of the complexity of many of Boito's proposed ideas, along with his alternative scenarios, which are expressed in a long letter to Verdi (most of which the composer regarded as excessive), the Council Chamber scene emerged as the focus of the new collaboration. Although he had confidence in the young librettist's abilities (\"[The scene] written by you could not possibly be dull\"), Verdi did caution Boito that he appeared to be \"aiming at a perfection impossible here.  I [Verdi] aim lower and am more optimistic than you and I don't despair\", in essence, expressing an unwillingness to re-write the opera as completely as Boito had proposed. It would have been far more work than the composer wished to be involved in at the time.\nThe pair spent the latter part of 1880 and into January 1881 with back-and-forth additions and revisions (the composer in Genoa, the librettist in Milan and meeting only once), all of which are heavily documented in the Verdi-Boito correspondence, the Carteggio Verdi-Boito, and significantly quoted in Budden.  All this was the build-up to performances in Milan the following March, although the composer was constantly concerned about the suitability of the singers engaged there for that season, and he threatened to withdraw the opera on more than one occasion.The result was the contrast, which Parker describes, between the original 1857 act 2 finale, \"set in a large square in Genoa, [as] a conventional four-movement concertante finale, a grand ceremonial scene\" whereas, in the 1881 revision, \"[Verdi] injected into the heart of the work an episode of enormous vividness and power, enriching the character of Boccanegra in such a way that his subsequent death scene gains considerably in impressiveness\". And, as Budden puts it, \"Simone (sic) rises to spiritual greatness.

Bor\u00eds Godun\u00f3v ) is an opera by Modest Mussorgsky (1839\u20131881). The work was composed between 1868 and 1873 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. It is Mussorgsky's only completed opera and is considered his masterpiece. Its subjects are the Russian ruler Boris Godunov, who reigned as Tsar (1598 to 1605) during the Time of Troubles, and his nemesis, the False Dmitriy (reigned 1605 to 1606). The Russian-language libretto was written by the composer, and is based on the 1825 drama Boris Godunov by Aleksandr Pushkin, and, in the Revised Version of 1872, on Nikolay Karamzin's History of the Russian State.\nAmong major operas, Boris Godunov shares with Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlos (1867) the distinction of having an extremely complex creative history, as well as a great wealth of alternative material. The composer created two versions\u2014the Original Version of 1869, which was rejected for production by the Imperial Theatres, and the Revised Version of 1872, which received its first performance in 1874 in Saint Petersburg.\nBoris Godunov has often been subjected to cuts, recomposition, re-orchestration, transposition of scenes, or conflation of the original and revised versions.\nSeveral composers, chief among them Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov and Dmitri Shostakovich, have created new editions of the opera to \"correct\" perceived technical weaknesses in the composer's original scores. Although these versions held the stage for decades, Mussorgsky's individual harmonic style and orchestration are now valued for their originality, and revisions by other hands have fallen out of fashion.\nIn the 1980s, Boris Godunov was closer to the status of a repertory piece than any other Russian opera, even Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, and is the most recorded Russian opera.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51960", "text": "Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k: Opera, Dimitrij (1882)\nSergei Prokofiev: Incidental music, Boris Godunov (1936)", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "69_2899", "text": "Nikolai Semyonovich Rabinovich (Russian: \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0420\u0430\u0431\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447) (7 October 1908\u201326 July 1972) was a Soviet conductor and teacher.\n\nRabinovich studied under Nikolai Malko and graduated from the Leningrad Conservatory in 1931, becoming a professor in 1968.

The domestic product was regarded with skepticism and sometimes hostility. The playwright Tikhonov wrote in 1898:\n\n\"In those days, splendid performances of Russian operas were given, but the attendance was generally poor. ...to attend the Russian opera was not fashionable. At the first performance of The Maid of Pskov [in 1873] there was a good deal of protest. An energetic campaign was being waged against the 'music of the future'\u2013that is, that of the 'mighty handful'.\"\nAs the most daring and innovative member of the Mighty Handful, Mussorgsky frequently became the target of conservative critics and rival composers, and was often derided for his supposedly clumsy and crude musical idiom. After the premiere of Boris Godunov, influential critic Herman Laroche wrote:\n\n\"The general decorativeness and crudity of Mr. Mussorgsky's style, his passion for the brass and percussion instruments, may be considered to have been borrowed from Serov. But never did the crudest works of the model reach the naive coarseness we note in his imitator.\"\nReviews of the premiere performance of Boris Godunov were for the most part hostile. Some critics dismissed the work as \"chaotic\" and \"a cacophony\". Even his friends Mily Balakirev and C\u00e9sar Cui, leading members of the Mighty Handful, minimized his accomplishment. Unable to overlook Mussorgsky's \"trespasses against the conventional musical grammar of the time\", they failed to recognize the giant step forward in musical and dramatic expression that Boris Godunov represented. Cui betrayed Mussorgsky in a notoriously scathing review of the premiere performance:\n\n\"Mr. Mussorgsky is endowed with great and original talent, but Boris is an immature work, superb in parts, feeble in others. Its main defects are in the disjointed recitatives and the disarray of the musical ideas.... These defects are not due to a lack of creative power.... The real trouble is his immaturity, his incapacity for severe self-criticism, his self-satisfaction, and his hasty methods of composition...\"\nAlthough he found much to admire, particularly the Inn Scene and the Song of the Parrot, he reproved the composer for a poorly constructed libretto, finding the opera to exhibit a lack of cohesion between scenes. He claimed that Mussorgsky was so deficient in the ability to write instrumental music that he dispensed with composing a prelude, and that he had \"borrowed the cheap method of characterization by leitmotives from Wagner.\"Other composers were even more censorious. Pyotr Tchaikovsky wrote in a letter to his brother Modest:\n\n\"I have studied Boris Godunov and The Demon thoroughly. Mussorgsky's music I send to the devil; it is the most vulgar and vile parody on music...\"\nOf the critics who evaluated the new opera, only the 19-year-old critic Vladimir Baskin defended Mussorgsky's skill as a composer. Writing under the pen name \"Foma Pizzicato\", Baskin wrote,\n\n\"Dramatization in vocal music could go no farther. Mussorgsky has proved himself to be a philosopher-musician, capable of expressing with rare truth the mind and soul of his characters. He also has a thorough understanding of musical resources. He is a master of the orchestra; his working-out is fluent, his vocal and chorus parts are beautifully written.\"\nAlthough Boris Godunov is usually praised for its originality, dramatic choruses, sharply delineated characters, and for the powerful psychological portrayal of Tsar Boris, it has received an inordinate amount of criticism for technical shortcomings: weak or faulty harmony, part-writing, and orchestration. Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov said:\n\n\"I both adore and abhor Boris Godunov. I adore it for its originality, power, boldness, distinctiveness, and beauty; I abhor it for its lack of polish, the roughness of its harmonies, and, in some places, the sheer awkwardness of the music.\"\nThe perception that Boris needed correction due to Mussorgsky's poverty of technique prompted Rimsky-Korsakov to revise it after his death. His edition supplanted the composer's Revised Version of 1872 in Russia, and launched the work abroad, remaining the preferred edition for some 75 years (see Versions by Other Hands in this article for more details). For decades, critics and scholars pressing for the performance of Mussorgsky's own versions fought an often losing battle against the conservatism of conductors and singers, who, raised on the plush Rimsky-Korsakov edition, found it impossible to adapt to Mussorgsky's comparatively unrefined and bleak original scores.Recently, however, a new appreciation for the rugged individuality of Mussorgsky's style has resulted in increasing performances and recording of his original versions. Musicologist Gerald Abraham wrote:\n\n\"...in the perspective of a hundred years we can see that Musorgsky's score did not really need 'correction' and reorchestration, that in fact the untouched Boris is finer than the revised Boris.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "22_48558", "text": "The story of murder is presumed in Aleksandr Pushkin's play Boris Godunov, made into an opera by Modest Mussorgsky.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As sources, Shakespeare's plays provided Verdi with lifelong inspiration: some, such as an adaption of King Lear (as Re Lear) were never realized, but he wrote his two final operas using Othello as the basis for Otello (1887) and The Merry Wives of Windsor as the basis for Falstaff (1893).\nThe first version of Macbeth was completed during the time that Verdi described as his \"galley years,\" which ranged over 16 years and one that saw the composer produce 22 operas. By the standards of the subject matter of almost all Italian operas during the first fifty years of the 19th century, Macbeth was highly unusual.

It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a \"riot\" or \"near-riot\", though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later. Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.\nStravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. Le Sacre du printemps was the third such major project, after the acclaimed Firebird (1910) and Petrushka (1911). The concept behind The Rite of Spring, developed by Roerich from Stravinsky's outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, \"Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts\"; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by L\u00e9onide Massine replaced Nijinsky's original, which saw only eight performances. Massine's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world's leading choreographers, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinsky's original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles.\nStravinsky's score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny.

The orchestral suite composed in 1945 was played that year by many symphony orchestras; the suite is among Copland's best-known works, and the ballet remains essential in the Martha Graham Dance Company repertoire.\nGraham was known for creating the \"Graham technique\" of dance; in the 1930s, she began commissioning scores from various composers, often related to American history and culture. Around the same time, Copland incorporated relatable and accessible musical characteristics of the Americana style to increase his music's appeal to the general public; he first implemented this in earlier ballets like Billy the Kid and Rodeo. The initial scenario for Appalachian Spring devised by Graham was revised many times by both her and Copland; the title characters' names were changed numerous times and other characters from the early revisions were cut in the final production. Originally orchestrated for a thirteen-piece chamber orchestra, the score was arranged into various suites by Copland for different purposes; the original ballet featured eight episodes, three of which were cut in the well-known orchestral suite.\nThe ballet takes place in a small settlement in 19th-century Pennsylvania. There are four main characters: the Bride, the Husbandman, the Pioneer Woman, and the Revivalist; the last is accompanied by four Followers. Appalachian Spring follows the Bride and the Husbandman as they get married and celebrate with the community.

Bach most likely composed them during the period 1717\u20131723, when he served as Kapellmeister in K\u00f6then. The title given on the cover of the Anna Magdalena Bach manuscript was Suites \u00e0 Violoncello Solo senza Basso (Suites for cello solo without bass).\nAs usual in a Baroque musical suite, after the prelude which begins each suite, all the other movements are based around baroque dance types. The cello suites are structured in six movements each: prelude, allemande, courante, sarabande, two minuets or two bourr\u00e9es or two gavottes, and a final gigue. Gary S. Dalkin of MusicWeb International called Bach's cello suites \"among the most profound of all classical music works\" and Wilfrid Mellers described them in 1980 as \"Monophonic music wherein a man has created a dance of God\".Due to the works' technical demands, \u00e9tude-like nature, and difficulty in interpretation because of the non-annotated nature of the surviving copies and the many discrepancies between them, the cello suites were little known and rarely publicly performed in the modern era until they were recorded by Pablo Casals (1876\u20131973) in the early 20th century.

It was Pablo Casals who first began to popularize the suites, after discovering an edition by Friedrich Gr\u00fctzmacher (who was the first cellist to perform an entire Bach suite) in a thrift shop in Barcelona in 1889 when he was 13. Although Casals performed the suites publicly, it was not until 1936, when he was 60 years old, that he agreed to record them, beginning with Suites Nos. 2 and 3, at Abbey Road Studios in London.

The Count was often ill and had sleepless nights. At such times, Goldberg, who lived in his house, had to spend the night in an antechamber, so as to play for him during his insomnia. ... Once the Count mentioned in Bach's presence that he would like to have some clavier pieces for Goldberg, which should be of such a smooth and somewhat lively character that he might be a little cheered up by them in his sleepless nights. Bach thought himself best able to fulfill this wish by means of Variations, the writing of which he had until then considered an ungrateful task on account of the repeatedly similar harmonic foundation. But since at this time all his works were already models of art, such also these variations became under his hand. Yet he produced only a single work of this kind. Thereafter the Count always called them his variations. He never tired of them, and for a long time sleepless nights meant: \"Dear Goldberg, do play me one of my variations.\" Bach was perhaps never so rewarded for one of his works as for this. The Count presented him with a golden goblet filled with 100 Louis d'or. Nevertheless, even had the gift been a thousand times larger, their artistic value would not yet have been paid for.\nForkel wrote his biography in 1802, more than 60 years after the events related, and its accuracy has been questioned. The lack of dedication on the title page also makes the tale of the commission unlikely. Goldberg's age at the time of publication (14 years) has also been cited as grounds for doubting Forkel's tale, although it must be said that he was known to be an accomplished keyboardist and sight-reader. Williams (2001) contends that the Forkel story is entirely spurious.\nArnold Schering has suggested that the aria on which the variations are based was not written by Bach. More recent scholarly literature (such as the edition by Christoph Wolff) suggests that there is no basis for such doubts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Onegin is irritated with the guests who gossip about him and Tatyana, and with Lensky for persuading him to come. He decides to avenge himself by dancing and flirting with Olga. Olga is insensitive to her fianc\u00e9 and apparently attracted to Onegin. Earnest and inexperienced, Lensky is wounded to the core and challenges Onegin to fight a duel; Onegin reluctantly accepts, feeling compelled by social convention. During the duel, Onegin unwillingly kills Lensky. Afterwards, he quits his country estate, traveling abroad to deaden his feelings of remorse.\nTatyana visits Onegin's mansion, where she looks through his books and his notes in the margins, and begins to question whether Onegin's character is merely a collage of different literary heroes, and if there is, in fact, no \"real Onegin\". Tatyana, still brokenhearted by the loss of Onegin, is persuaded by her parents to live with her aunt in Moscow to find a suitor.\nSeveral years pass, and the scene shifts to St. Petersburg. Onegin has come to attend the most prominent balls and interact with the leaders of old Russian society. He sees the most beautiful woman, who captures the attention of all and is central to society's whirl, and he realizes that it is the same Tatyana whose love he had once spurned. Now she is married to an aged prince (a general). Upon seeing Tatyana again, he becomes obsessed with winning her affection, despite her being married. His attempts are rebuffed. He writes her several letters, but receives no reply. Eventually, Onegin manages to see Tatyana and offers her the opportunity to finally elope after they have become reacquainted. She recalls the days when they might have been happy, but concludes that that time has passed. Onegin repeats his love for her. Faltering for a moment, she admits that she still loves him, but she will not allow him to ruin her and declares her determination to remain faithful to her husband. She leaves him regretting his bitter destiny.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Butler (1847\u20131926).The 1946 Broadway production was a hit, and the musical had long runs in both New York (1,147 performances) and London, spawning revivals, a 1950 film version and television versions.

Producer Mike Todd turned the project down, so Fields approached a new producing team, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. After the success of their first musical collaboration, Oklahoma!, Rodgers and Hammerstein had decided to become producers of both their own theatrical ventures and those by other authors. They agreed to produce the musical and asked Jerome Kern to compose the music; Fields would write the lyrics, and she and her brother Herbert would write the book. Kern, who had been composing for movie musicals in Hollywood, returned to New York on November 2, 1945, to begin work on the score to Annie Get Your Gun, but three days later, he collapsed on the street due to a cerebral hemorrhage. Kern was hospitalized, and he died on November 11, 1945. The producers and Fields then asked Irving Berlin to write the musical's score; Fields agreed to step down as lyricist, knowing that Berlin preferred to write both music and lyrics to his songs. Berlin initially declined to write the score, worrying that he would be unable to write songs to fit specific scenes in \"a situation show\". Hammerstein persuaded him to study the script and try writing some songs based on it, and within days, Berlin returned with the songs \"Doin' What Comes Naturally\", \"You Can't Get a Man With a Gun\", and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\". Berlin's songs suited the story and Ethel Merman's abilities, and he readily composed the rest of the score to Annie Get Your Gun. The show's eventual hit song, \"There's No Business Like Show Business\", was almost left out of the show because Berlin mistakenly got the impression that Richard Rodgers did not like it. In imitation of the structure of Oklahoma! a secondary romance between two of the members of the Wild West Show was added to the musical during its development.According to some sources, the role of Annie was originally offered to Mary Martin, who turned it down. This is not true.  Dorothy Fields went to the hospital after Merman gave birth to her son to ask her if she would do the show.  The show was conceived for Merman, but when time came to send out the post-Broadway national tour and Merman was unwilling to do it, Martin jumped at the chance, going on the road for approximately two years and belting out the songs, which had the effect of lowering her voice from its normal lyric-coloratura range to mezzo-soprano-alto.\nFor the 1999 revival, Peter Stone revised the libretto, eliminating what were considered insensitive references to American Indians, including the songs \"Colonel Buffalo Bill\" and \"I'm An Indian Too\". Stone said, \"The big challenge is taking a book that was wonderfully crafted for its time and make it wonderfully crafted for our time... It was terribly insensitive...to Indians.... But it had to be dealt with in a way that was heartfelt and not obvious... In this case, it was with the permission of the heirs.

Although the date of its origin is unknown, scholars have suggested between 1704 and the 1750s. The piece opens with a toccata section followed by a fugue that ends in a coda, and is largely typical of the north German organ school of the Baroque era.\nLittle is known about its early existence until the piece was discovered in an undated manuscript produced by Johannes Ringk. It was first published in 1833 during the early Bach Revival period through the efforts of composer Felix Mendelssohn, who also performed the piece in 1840. It was not until the 20th century that its popularity rose above that of other organ compositions by Bach, as exemplified by its inclusion in Walt Disney's 1940 animated film Fantasia that featured Leopold Stokowski's orchestral transcription from 1927.\nThe piece has been subject to a wide, and often conflicting, variety of analyses. It is often described as a type of program music depicting a storm, while in the context of Fantasia, is promoted as non-representational or absolute music. Scholars such as Peter Williams and Rolf Dietrich Claus argued against its authenticity, while Christoph Wolff defended the attribution to Bach.

According to the description provided by the Berlin State Library, where the manuscript is kept, and similar bibliographic descriptions, e.g. in the RISM catalogue, Ringk created his copy between 1740 and 1760. As far as is known, Ringk produced his first copy of a Bach score in 1730 when he was 12. According to Dietrich Kilian, who edited BWV 565 for the New Bach Edition, Ringk made his copy of the Toccata and Fugue between 1730 and 1740. In his critical commentary for Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel's 21st-century revised edition of the score, Jean-Claude Zehnder narrows the time of origin of the manuscript down to around the middle of the first half of the 1730s, based on an analysis of the evolution of Ringk's handwriting. At the time Ringk was a student of Bach's former student Johann Peter Kellner at Gr\u00e4fenroda, and probably faithfully copied what his teacher put before him. There are some errors in the score such as note values not adding up to fill a measure correctly. Such defects show a carelessness deemed typical of Kellner, who left over 60 copies of works by Bach.The title page of Ringk's manuscript writes the title of the work in Italian as Toccata con Fuga, names Johann Sebastian Bach as the composer of the piece, and indicates its tonality as \"ex. d. #.\", which is usually seen as the key signature being D minor. However, in Ringk's manuscript the staves have no \u266d symbol at the key (which would be the usual way to write down a piece in D minor). In this sense, in Ringk's manuscript, the piece is written down in D Dorian mode. Another piece listed as Bach's was also known as Toccata and Fugue in D minor, and was equally entitled to the \"Dorian\" qualification. It was that piece, BWV 538, that received the \"Dorian\" nickname, that qualifier being effectively used to distinguish it from BWV 565. Most score editions of BWV 565 use the D minor key signature, unlike Ringk's manuscript.\n\nRingk's manuscript does not use a separate staff for the pedal part, which was common in the 18th century (notes to be played on the pedal were indicated by \"p.\" being written at the start of the sequence). Printed editions of the BWV 565 organ score invariably write the pedal line on a separate staff. In Ringk's manuscript the upper staff is written down using the soprano clef (as was common in the time when the manuscript originated), where printed editions use the treble clef.\n \nAll other extant manuscript copies of the score date from at least several decades later: some of these, written in the 19th century, are related with each other in that they have similar solutions to the defects in the Ringk manuscript. Whether these derive from an earlier manuscript independent from Ringk's (possibly in the C. P. E. Bach/Johann Friedrich Agricola/Johann Kirnberger circle) is debated by scholars. These near-identical 19th-century copies, the version Felix Mendelssohn knew, use the treble clef and a separate staff for the pedal. In general, the later copies show a less excessive use of fermatas in the opening measures and are more correct in making the note values fit the measures, but that may as well be from polishing a defective source as from deriving from a cleaner earlier source. In the later copies the work is named for instance \"Adagio\" and \"Fuga\" (for the respective parts of the work), or \"Toccata\" for the work as a whole.\n \nThe name \"Toccata\" is most probably a later addition, similar to the title of Toccata, Adagio and Fugue, BWV 564, because in the Baroque era such organ pieces would most commonly be called simply Prelude (Praeludium, etc.) or Prelude and Fugue. Ringk's copy abounds in Italian tempo markings, fermatas (a characteristic feature of Ringk's copies) and staccato dots, all very unusual features for pre-1740 German music.German organ schools are distinguished into north German (e.g. Dieterich Buxtehude) and south German (e.g. Johann Pachelbel). The composition has stylistic characteristics from both schools: the stylus phantasticus, and other north German characteristics are most apparent. However, the numerous recitative stretches are rarely found in the works of northern composers and may have been inspired by Johann Heinrich Buttstett, a pupil of Pachelbel, whose few surviving free works, particularly his Prelude and Capriccio in D minor, exhibit similar features. A passage in the fugue of BWV 565 is an exact copy of a phrase in one of Johann Pachelbel's D minor fantasias, and the first half of the subject is based on this Pachelbel passage as well.

La Cenerentola, which he completed in a period of three weeks, is considered to have some of his finest writing for solo voice and ensembles.

The work had its origins in March and April 1913, when Gustav Holst and his friend and benefactor Balfour Gardiner holidayed in Spain with the composer Arnold Bax and his brother, the author Clifford Bax. A discussion about astrology piqued Holst's interest in the subject. Clifford Bax later commented that Holst became \"a remarkably skilled interpreter of horoscopes\". Shortly after the holiday Holst wrote to a friend: \"I only study things that suggest music to me. That's why I worried at Sanskrit. Then recently the character of each planet suggested lots to me, and I have been studying astrology fairly closely\". He told Clifford Bax in 1926 that The Planets:\n\nImogen Holst, the composer's daughter, wrote that her father had difficulty with large-scale orchestral structures such as symphonies, and the idea of a suite with a separate character for each movement was an inspiration to him. Holst's biographer Michael Short and the musicologist Richard Greene both think it likely that another inspiration for the composer to write a suite for large orchestra was the example of Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra. That suite had been performed in London in 1912 and again in 1914; Holst was at one of the performances, and he is known to have owned a copy of the score.Holst described The Planets as \"a series of mood pictures\", acting as \"foils to one another\", with \"very little contrast in any one of them\". Short writes that some of the characteristics the composer attributed to the planets may have been suggested by Alan Leo's booklet What is a Horoscope?, which he was reading at the time. Holst took the title of two movements \u2013 \"Mercury, the Winged Messenger\" and \"Neptune, the Mystic\" \u2013 from Leo's books. But although astrology was Holst's starting point, he arranged the planets to suit his own plan:\n\nIn an early sketch for the suite Holst listed Mercury as \"no. 1\", which Greene suggests raises the possibility that the composer's first idea was simply to depict the planets in the obvious order, from nearest the sun to the farthest. \"However, opening with the more disturbing character of Mars allows a more dramatic and compelling working out of the musical material\".Holst had a heavy workload as head of music at St Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith, and director of music at Morley College, and had limited time for composing. Imogen Holst wrote, \"Weekends and holidays were the only times when he could really get on with his own work, which is why it took him over two years to finish The Planets\". She added that Holst's chronic neuritis in his right arm was troubling him considerably and he would have found it impossible to complete the 198 pages of the large full score without the help of two colleagues at St Paul's, Vally Lasker and Nora Day, whom he called his \"scribes\".The first movement to be written was Mars in mid-1914, followed by Venus and Jupiter in the latter part of the year, Saturn and Uranus in mid-1915, Neptune later in 1915 and Mercury in early 1916.

Most of Bach's church cantatas date from his first years as Thomaskantor and director of church music in Leipzig, a position which he took up in 1723.\nWorking for Leipzig's Thomaskirche and Nikolaikirche, it was part of Bach's job to perform a church cantata every Sunday and holiday, conducting soloists, the Thomanerchor and orchestra as part of the church service. In his first years in Leipzig, starting after Trinity of 1723, Bach regularly composed a new cantata every week, although some of these cantatas were adapted (at least in part) from work he had composed before his Leipzig era. Works from three annual cycles of cantatas for the liturgical calendar have survived. These relate to the readings prescribed by the Lutheran liturgy for the specific occasion. The last known cantata was composed in 1745.\nIn addition to the church cantatas composed for occasions of the liturgical year, Bach wrote sacred cantatas for functions like weddings or Ratswahl (the inauguration of a new town council). His secular cantatas, around 50 known works, less than half of which surviving with both text and music, were written for academic functions of the University of Leipzig, or anniversaries and entertainment among the nobility and in society, some of them Gl\u00fcckwunschkantaten (congratulatory cantatas) and Huldigungskantaten (homage cantatas).\nBach's cantatas usually require four soloists and a four-part choir, but he also wrote solo cantatas (i.e. for one soloist singer) and dialogue cantatas for two singers. The words of Bach's cantatas, almost always entirely in German, consist mostly of 18th-century poetry, Lutheran hymns and dicta. Hymns were mostly set to their Lutheran chorale tune.

He is known for his orchestral music such as the Brandenburg Concertos; solo instrumental works such as the cello suites and sonatas and partitas for solo violin; keyboard works such as the Goldberg Variations and The Well-Tempered Clavier; organ works such as the Schubler Chorales and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and choral works such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival, he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician, Johann Ambrosius, in Eisenach. After being orphaned at the age of 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph, after which he continued his musical education in L\u00fcneburg. From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and M\u00fchlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and K\u00f6then, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. From 1723, he was employed as Thomaskantor (cantor at St Thomas's) in Leipzig. There he composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city, and for its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726, he published some of his keyboard and organ music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus III of Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life, he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after a botched eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65.\nBach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic, and motivic organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He often adopted Lutheran hymns, not only in his larger vocal works, but for instance also in his four-part chorales and his sacred songs. He wrote extensively for organ and for other keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for instance for violin and for harpsichord, and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of his works employ contrapuntal techniques like canon and fugue.\nThroughout the 18th century, Bach was primarily valued as an organist, while his keyboard music, such as The Well-Tempered Clavier, was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century saw the publication of some major Bach biographies, and by the end of that century all of his known music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through periodicals (and later also websites) exclusively devoted to him, and other publications such as the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works) and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including the Air on the G String and \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\", and of recordings, such as three different box sets with complete performances of the composer's oeuvre marking the 250th anniversary of his death.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The composition was completed in 1749, the year before the composer's death, and was to a large extent based on earlier work, such as a Sanctus Bach had composed in 1724. Sections that were specifically composed to complete the Mass in the late 1740s include the \"Et incarnatus est\" part of the Credo.\nAs usual for its time, the composition is formatted as a Neapolitan mass, consisting of a succession of choral movements with a broad orchestral accompaniment, and sections in which a more limited group of instrumentalists accompanies one or more vocal soloists. Among the more unusual characteristics of the composition is its scale: a total performance time of around two hours, and a scoring consisting of two groups of SATB singers and an orchestra featuring an extended winds section, strings and continuo. Its key, B minor, is rather exceptional for a composition featuring natural trumpets in D, although far more of the work is in this key than B minor.Even more exceptional, for a Lutheran composer such as Bach, is that the composition is a Missa tota. In Bach's day, Masses composed for Lutheran services usually consisted only of a Kyrie and Gloria. Bach had composed five such Kyrie\u2013Gloria Masses before he completed his Mass in B minor: the Kyrie\u2013Gloria Masses, BWV 233\u2013236, in the late 1730s, and the Mass for the Dresden court, which would become Part I of his only Missa tota, in 1733. The Mass was likely never performed in its entirety during Bach's lifetime. Its earliest documented complete performance took place in 1859. With many dozens of recordings, it is among Bach's most popular vocal works.In 2015, Bach's personal handwritten manuscript of the mass held by the Berlin State Library was included in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register, a project to protect and preserve culturally significant documents and manuscripts.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50261", "text": "The Missa solemnis, WAB 29, is a solemn mass composed by Anton Bruckner in 1854 for the installation of Friedrich Mayer as abbot of St. Florian Monastery on 14 September 1854.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_52173", "text": "The Mass in B minor is widely regarded as one of the supreme achievements of classical music. Alberto Basso summarizes the work as follows: The Mass in B minor is the consecration of a whole life: started in 1733 for \"diplomatic\" reasons, it was finished in the very last years of Bach's life, when he had already gone blind. This monumental work is a synthesis of every stylistic and technical contribution the Cantor of Leipzig made to music. But it is also the most astounding spiritual encounter between the worlds of Catholic glorification and the Lutheran cult of the cross.\nScholars have suggested that the Mass in B minor belongs in the same category as The Art of Fugue, as a summation of Bach's deep lifelong involvement with musical tradition\u2014in this case, with choral settings and theology. Bach scholar Christoph Wolff describes the work as representing \"a summary of his writing for voice, not only in its variety of styles, compositional devices, and range of sonorities, but also in its high level of technical polish ... Bach's mighty setting preserved the musical and artistic creed of its creator for posterity.\"The Mass was described in the 19th century by the editor Hans Georg N\u00e4geli as \"The Announcement of the Greatest Musical Work of All Times and All People\" (\"Ank\u00fcndigung des gr\u00f6\u00dften musikalischen Kunstwerkes aller Zeiten und V\u00f6lker\").

Symbolum Nicenum\"; the third folder, containing the Sanctus, he called \"3. Sanctus\"; and the remainder, in a fourth folder he titled \"4. Osanna | Benedictus | Agnus Dei et | Dona nobis pacem\". John Butt writes, \"The format seems purposely designed so that each of the four sections could be used separately.\" On the other hand, the parts in the manuscript are numbered from 1 to 4, and Bach's usual closing formula (S.D.G = Soli Deo Gloria) is only found at the end of the Dona Nobis Pacem. Further, Butt writes, \"What is most remarkable about the overall shape of the Mass in B Minor is that Bach managed to shape a coherent sequence of movements from diverse material.\" Butt and George Stauffer detail the ways in which Bach gave overall musical unity to the work.\nThe first overall title given to the work was in the 1790 estate of the recently deceased C.P.E. Bach, who inherited the score. There, it is called \"Die Grosse Catholische Messe\" (the \"Great Catholic Mass\"). It is called that as well in the estate of his last heir in 1805, suggesting to Stauffer that \"the epithet reflects an oral tradition within the Bach family\". The first publication of the Kyrie and Gloria, in 1833 by the Swiss collector Hans Georg N\u00e4geli with Simrock, refers to it as \"Messe\" Finally, Nageli and Simrock produced the first publication in 1845, calling it the \"High Mass in B Minor\" (Hohe Messe in h-moll). The adjective \"high\", Butt argues, was \"strongly influenced by the monumental impact of Beethoven's Missa solemnis.\" It soon fell from common usage, but the prepositional phrase \"in B Minor\" survives, even though it is in some ways misleading: only five of the work's 27 movements are in B minor, while twelve, including the final ones of each of the four major sections, are in D major (the relative major of B minor).

Although a true canon at the unison in three parts, it also has elements of a chaconne. Neither the date nor the circumstances of its composition are known (suggested dates range from 1680 to 1706), and the oldest surviving manuscript copy of the piece dates from 1838 to 1842.Like his other works, Pachelbel's Canon went out of style, and remained in obscurity for centuries. A 1968 arrangement and recording of it by the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paillard chamber orchestra gained popularity over the next decade, and in the 1970s the piece began to be recorded by many ensembles; by the early 1980s its presence as background music was deemed inescapable.

However, that edition contained numerous articulation marks and dynamics not in the original score. Furthermore, Seiffert provided tempi he considered right for the piece, but that were not supported by later research. The canon was first recorded in 1940 by Arthur Fiedler.In 1968, the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paillard chamber orchestra made a recording of the piece that would change its fortunes significantly. This rendition was done in a more Romantic style, at a significantly slower tempo than it had been played at before, and contained obbligato parts, written by Paillard. The Paillard recording was released in June in France by Erato Records as part of an LP record that also included the Trumpet Concerto by Johann Friedrich Fasch and other works by Pachelbel and Fasch, all played by the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paillard chamber orchestra. Paillard's interpretation of the canon was also included on a widely distributed album by the mail-order label Musical Heritage Society in 1968.\nIn July 1968, Greek band Aphrodite's Child released the single \"Rain and Tears\", which was a baroque-rock adaptation of Pachelbel's Canon. The band was based in France at the time, although it is unknown whether they had heard the Paillard recording, or were inspired by it. \"Rain and Tears\" was a success, reaching number 1 on the pop charts of various European countries. Several months later, in October 1968, Spanish band Pop-Tops released the single \"Oh Lord, Why Lord\", which again was based on Pachelbel's Canon. Again, it is unknown whether they were aware of or had been inspired by the releases from earlier that year. \"Oh Lord, Why Lord\" was covered by American band Parliament on their 1970 album Osmium.\nIn 1970, a classical radio station in San Francisco played the Paillard recording and became inundated by listener requests. The piece gained growing fame, particularly in California. In 1974, London Records, aware of the interest in the piece, reissued a 1961 album of the Corelli Christmas Concerto performed by the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra, which happened to contain the piece, now re-titled to Pachelbel Kanon: the Record That Made it Famous and other Baroque Favorites. The album was the highest-selling classical album of 1976. Its success led to many other record labels issuing their own recordings of the work, many of which also sold well.Its use from 1975 in television ads for Pure New Wool popularised the piece in Britain and Ireland.In 1977, the RCA Red Seal label reissued the original Erato album in the United States and elsewhere. In the U.S. it was the 6th-highest-selling classical album of 1977. (Two other albums containing Pachelbel's Canon charted for the year: the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra album at number 17, and another album featuring the Paillard recording, Go For Baroque!, at number 13.) The Paillard arrangement of the piece was then featured prominently in the soundtrack of the 1980 film Ordinary People. The Erato/RCA album kept climbing the Billboard Classical Albums chart, and in January 1982 it reached the number 1 position, where it remained until May 1982, when it was knocked out of first place by an album featuring Pachelbel's Canon played by the Academy of Ancient Music directed by Christopher Hogwood.

It was written for the 1910 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Michel Fokine, who collaborated with Alexandre Benois and others on a scenario based on the Russian fairy tales of the Firebird and the blessing and curse it possesses for its owner. It was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra de Paris on 25 June 1910 and was an immediate success, catapulting Stravinsky to international fame and leading to future Diaghilev\u2013Stravinsky collaborations including Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913).  \nThe Firebird's mortal and supernatural elements are distinguished with a system of leitmotifs placed in the harmony dubbed \"leit-harmony\".

The focus of the arrangements is not the brilliantly polished beautiful sound of centuries-old traditional musical tradition, but rather its strict breakthrough in order to gain a new, undisguised access to the topicality of old texts and the core of the music.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_52211", "text": "Many have attempted to explain the reason Schubert composed Winterreise. A possible explanation is documented in a book by Elizabeth Norman McKay, Schubert: The Piano and Dark Keys: \"Towards the end of 1822 ... Schubert was very sick, having contracted the syphilis that inevitably was to affect the remainder of his life: his physical and mental health, and the music he was to compose.\" As detailed below, he worked on Winterreise as he was dying of syphilis.In addition to his friend Franz von Schober, Schubert's friends who often attended his Schubertiaden or musical sessions included Eduard von Bauernfeld, Joseph von Spaun, and the poet Johann Mayrhofer. Both Spaun and Mayrhofer describe the period of the composition of Winterreise as one in which Schubert was in a deeply melancholic frame of mind, as Mayrhofer puts it, because \"life had lost its rosiness and winter was upon him.\" Spaun tells that Schubert was gloomy and depressed, and when asked the reason replied,\n\n\"Come to Schober's today and I will play you a cycle of terrifying songs; they have affected me more than has ever been the case with any other songs.\" He then, with a voice full of feeling, sang the entire Winterreise for us. We were altogether dumbfounded by the sombre mood of these songs, and Schober said that one song only, \"Der Lindenbaum\", had pleased him. Thereupon Schubert leaped up and replied: \"These songs please me more than all the rest, and in time they will please you as well.\"\nIt is argued that in the gloomy nature of the Winterreise, compared with Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin, there is \na change of season, December for May, and a deeper core of pain, the difference between the heartbreak of a youth and a man. There is no need to seek in external vicissitudes an explanation of the pathos of the Winterreise music when the composer was this Schubert who, as a boy of seventeen, had the imagination to fix Gretchen's cry in music once for all, and had so quivered year by year in response to every appeal, to Mignon's and the Harper's grief, to Mayrhofer's nostalgia.

Schubert's music is as naive as the poet's expressions; the emotions contained in the poems are as deeply reflected in his own feelings, and these are so brought out in sound that no-one can sing or hear them without being touched to the heart.\n\nElena Gerhardt said of the Winterreise, \"You have to be haunted by this cycle to be able to sing it.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_52213", "text": "Franz Liszt transcribed 12 of the songs in the cycle for piano (S. 561), rearranging their order: 1. \"Gute Nacht\" (S.561/1); 4. \"Erstarrung\" (S.561/5); 5. \"Der Lindenbaum\" (S.561/7); 6. \"Wasserflut\" (S.561/6); 13. \"Die Post\" (S.561/4); 17. \"Im Dorfe\" (S.561/12); 18. \"Der st\u00fcrmische Morgen\" (S.561/11); 19. \"T\u00e4uschung\" (S.561/9); 21. \"Das Wirtshaus\" (S.561/10); 22. \"Mut!\" (S.561/3); 23. \"Die Nebensonnen\" (S.561/2); and 24. \"Der Leiermann\" (S.561/8).

The orchestral suite composed in 1945 was played that year by many symphony orchestras; the suite is among Copland's best-known works, and the ballet remains essential in the Martha Graham Dance Company repertoire.\nGraham was known for creating the \"Graham technique\" of dance; in the 1930s, she began commissioning scores from various composers, often related to American history and culture. Around the same time, Copland incorporated relatable and accessible musical characteristics of the Americana style to increase his music's appeal to the general public; he first implemented this in earlier ballets like Billy the Kid and Rodeo. The initial scenario for Appalachian Spring devised by Graham was revised many times by both her and Copland; the title characters' names were changed numerous times and other characters from the early revisions were cut in the final production. Originally orchestrated for a thirteen-piece chamber orchestra, the score was arranged into various suites by Copland for different purposes; the original ballet featured eight episodes, three of which were cut in the well-known orchestral suite.\nThe ballet takes place in a small settlement in 19th-century Pennsylvania. There are four main characters: the Bride, the Husbandman, the Pioneer Woman, and the Revivalist; the last is accompanied by four Followers. Appalachian Spring follows the Bride and the Husbandman as they get married and celebrate with the community. Themes of war are present throughout the story; it is suggested that the Husbandman leaves for war, causing worry and anxiety among the community. Shaker themes also influenced the ballet, notably in the music, where Copland incorporated a theme and variations on the common Shaker tune \"Simple Gifts\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_52241", "text": "The first recording of Appalachian Spring was of the orchestral suite: the 1945 premiere of the suite by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra was recorded and reissued in 1999.

The first recording of the original ballet was made in 1990 by Andrew Schenck and Hugh Wolff. In 1958, a film of the ballet was made with Graham in the lead role and Stuart Hodes dancing the Husbandman. The film was financed by WQED, who had already produced one successful Graham film. Nathan Kroll, a musician who had a good understanding of the score, directed the film and consulted Louis Horst (the conductor of the premiere) to ensure the music was just as Copland wanted.

It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a \"riot\" or \"near-riot\", though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later. Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.\nStravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. Le Sacre du printemps was the third such major project, after the acclaimed Firebird (1910) and Petrushka (1911). The concept behind The Rite of Spring, developed by Roerich from Stravinsky's outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, \"Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts\"; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by L\u00e9onide Massine replaced Nijinsky's original, which saw only eight performances. Massine's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world's leading choreographers, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinsky's original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles.\nStravinsky's score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. Regarded as among the first modernist works, the music influenced many of the 20th-century's leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50542", "text": "La s\u00e9r\u00e9nade interrompue is a musical composition by French composer Claude Debussy.

It was premiered on 30 September 1863 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique in Paris, and was given 18 performances in its initial run. Set in ancient times on the island of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the opera tells the story of how two men's vow of eternal friendship is threatened by their love for the same woman, whose own dilemma is the conflict between secular love and her sacred oath as a priestess. The friendship duet \"Au fond du temple saint\", generally known as \"The Pearl Fishers Duet\", is one of the best-known in Western opera.\nAt the time of the premiere, Bizet (born on 25 October 1838) was not yet 25 years old: he had yet to establish himself in the Parisian musical world. The commission to write Les p\u00eacheurs arose from his standing as a former winner of the prestigious Prix de Rome. Despite a good reception by the public, press reactions to the work were generally hostile and dismissive, although other composers, notably Hector Berlioz, found considerable merit in the music. The opera was not revived in Bizet's lifetime, but from 1886 onwards it was performed with some regularity in Europe and North America, and from the mid-20th century has entered the repertory of opera houses worldwide. Because the autograph score was lost, post-1886 productions were based on amended versions of the score that contained significant departures from the original. Since the 1970s, efforts have been made to reconstruct the score in accordance with Bizet's intentions.\nModern critical opinion has been kinder than that of Bizet's day. Commentators describe the quality of the music as uneven and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as a work of promise in which Bizet's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen.

The works are based loosely on characters from Germanic heroic legend, namely Norse legendary sagas and the Nibelungenlied. The composer termed the cycle a \"B\u00fchnenfestspiel\" (stage festival play), structured in three days preceded by a Vorabend (\"preliminary evening\"). It is often referred to as the Ring cycle, Wagner's Ring, or simply The Ring.\nWagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874. The four parts that constitute the Ring cycle are, in sequence:\n\nDas Rheingold (The Rhinegold)\nDie Walk\u00fcre (The Valkyrie)\nSiegfried\nG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung (Twilight of the Gods)Individual works of the sequence are often performed separately, and indeed the operas contain dialogues that mention events in the previous operas, so that a viewer could watch any of them without having watched the previous parts and still understand the plot. However, Wagner intended them to be performed in series. The first performance as a cycle opened the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, beginning with Das Rheingold on 13 August and ending with G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung on 17 August.

Its anonymous poet was likely from the region of Passau. The Nibelungenlied is based on an oral tradition of Germanic heroic legend that has some of its origin in historic events and individuals of the 5th and 6th centuries and that spread throughout almost all of Germanic-speaking Europe. Scandinavian parallels to the German poem are found especially in the heroic lays of the Poetic Edda and in the V\u00f6lsunga saga.\nThe poem is split into two parts. In the first part, the prince Siegfried comes to Worms to acquire the hand of the Burgundian princess Kriemhild from her brother King Gunther. Gunther agrees to let Siegfried marry Kriemhild if Siegfried helps Gunther acquire the warrior-queen Br\u00fcnhild as his wife. Siegfried does this and marries Kriemhild; however, Br\u00fcnhild and Kriemhild become rivals, leading eventually to Siegfried's murder by the Burgundian vassal Hagen with Gunther's involvement. In the second part, the widow Kriemhild is married to Etzel, king of the Huns. She later invites her brother and his court to visit Etzel's kingdom intending to kill Hagen. Her revenge results in the death of all the Burgundians who came to Etzel's court as well as the destruction of Etzel's kingdom and the death of Kriemhild herself.\nThe Nibelungenlied was the first heroic epic put into writing in Germany, helping to found a larger genre of written heroic poetry there. The poem's tragedy appears to have bothered its medieval audience, and very early on a sequel was written, the Nibelungenklage, which made the tragedy less final. The poem was forgotten after around 1500 but was rediscovered in 1755. Dubbed the \"German Iliad\", the Nibelungenlied began a new life as the German national epic. The poem was appropriated for nationalist purposes and was heavily used in anti-democratic, reactionary, and Nazi propaganda before and during the Second World War. Its legacy today is most visible in Richard Wagner's operatic cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen, which, however, is mostly based on Old Norse sources. In 2009, the three main manuscripts of the Nibelungenlied were inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in recognition of their historical significance.

The cycle is modelled after ancient Greek dramas that were presented as three tragedies and one satyr play. The Ring proper begins with Die Walk\u00fcre and ends with G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, with Rheingold as a prelude. Wagner called Das Rheingold a Vorabend or \"Preliminary Evening\", and Die Walk\u00fcre, Siegfried and G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung were subtitled First Day, Second Day and Third Day, respectively, of the trilogy proper.\nThe scale and scope of the story is epic.

The drama and intrigue continue through three generations of protagonists, until the final cataclysm at the end of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung.\nThe music of the cycle is thick and richly textured, and grows in complexity as the cycle proceeds. Wagner wrote for an orchestra of gargantuan proportions, including a greatly enlarged brass section with new instruments such as the Wagner tuba, bass trumpet and contrabass trombone. Remarkably, he uses a chorus only relatively briefly, in acts 2 and 3 of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, and then mostly of men with just a few women. He eventually had a purpose-built theatre constructed, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, in which to perform this work.

The first LP edition of Rigoletto (also the very first opera recording on LP) was released by RCA Victor in 1950 conducted by Renato Cellini and featured Leonard Warren in the title role.

Grimani's libretto, considered one of the best that Handel set, is an \"anti-heroic satirical comedy\", full of topical political allusions. Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI.\nHandel composed Agrippina at the end of a three-year sojourn in Italy. It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709. It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed. Observers praised the quality of the music\u2014much of which, in keeping with the contemporary custom, had been borrowed and adapted from other works, including the works of other composers. Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work, Handel did not promote further stagings. There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel's operas, including Agrippina, fell out of fashion in the mid-18th century.\nIn the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of the work have become ever more common, with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007, and the Metropolitan Opera in 2020.

His first opera composed in Italy, though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson, was Rodrigo (1707, original title Vincer se stesso \u00ea la maggior vittoria), and was presented there. It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto, Agrippina.
