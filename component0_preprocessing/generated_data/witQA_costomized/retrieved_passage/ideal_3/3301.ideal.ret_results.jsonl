It was the 136th FA Cup final overall of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup), organised by the Football Association (FA).   This was a rematch of the 2002 FA Cup Final and the first final since 2003 in which the sides had won once in the Premier League against one another, with a 3\u20130 victory for Arsenal in September 2016, and a 3\u20131 win for Chelsea the following February. The game was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by both BBC and BT Sport. BBC One provided the free-to-air coverage and BT Sport 2 was the pay-TV alternative.  \nThe match was refereed by Anthony Taylor in front of a crowd of 89,472.  Arsenal kicked off and dominated the early stages, opening the scoring with a controversial goal from Alexis S\u00e1nchez in the fourth minute. On 68 minutes, Victor Moses fell in the Arsenal penalty area under pressure and appealed for a penalty but instead was shown his second yellow card by the referee for diving and was sent off.  In the 76th minute, Diego Costa scored for Chelsea to level the score at 1\u20131: he received the ball from Willian and struck the ball past David Ospina, the Arsenal goalkeeper.  Two minutes later Aaron Ramsey scored with a header past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois after a cross from Olivier Giroud, who had come on as a substitute less than a minute earlier, to make it 2\u20131 to Arsenal.  After four minutes of stoppage time, the whistle was blown and Arsenal won the FA Cup final 2\u20131, to secure a record 13th title, while Ars\u00e8ne Wenger became the most successful manager in the tournament's history with seven wins.\nWinning the FA Cup would have meant Arsenal qualified for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League group stage had they not already secured their place in the competition after finishing fifth in the 2016\u201317 Premier League.  They also earned the right to play Chelsea who were the Premier League champions for the 2017 FA Community Shield.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "3301_39306", "text": "Arsenal were appearing in the FA Cup final for the 20th time, and for the third time in four years. They had won the cup twelve times, and were beaten finalists seven times; most recently in 2001.  By comparison, Chelsea were making their 12th appearance in a FA Cup final. The club won the cup seven times and lost four finals. The clubs had previously met 13 times in the FA Cup. Arsenal held an advantage in those meetings, winning seven of the last eight; Chelsea won the last FA Cup tie, a 2\u20131 victory in April 2009. This was the second FA Cup final to feature both sides; the first was won by Arsenal in 2002.\nThe most recent meeting between the two teams was a league encounter in February 2017, Chelsea winning by three goals to one, a result which moved them 12 points clear in first position. The victory was significant given that Chelsea had lost the reverse fixture 3\u20130 in September 2016, in what BBC journalist Phil McNulty described as a \"watershed moment\" in their season. While Arsenal struggled to build momentum throughout autumn and winter, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte's tactical switch from 4\u20133\u20133 to 3\u20134\u20133 thereafter resulted in a 13-match winning run. They won the Premier League with two matches to spare, and later set a new divisional record for the most wins (30). \nArsenal ended the season in fifth place, their lowest placing under manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, missing out on UEFA Champions League football for the first time in 20 years. Wenger's future had been cast into doubt following a bad run of form in February and March, which included the team losing 10\u20132 on aggregate against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, the worst aggregate performance by an English club in the history of the tournament.To arrest the decline, Wenger adopted a similar tactical change to Conte, playing three defenders at the back. Arsenal went on to win eight of their last nine fixtures, but Wenger suggested his team were not favourites: \"it's quite even or maybe Chelsea are ahead, so it's a bit similar to what happened in the semi-final against Manchester City. That's part of what makes it all exciting as well.\" Of his future he said, \"It will not be my last match anyway, because I will stay, no matter what happens, in football.\" Former Arsenal player Paul Merson's evaluation was, \"Mertesacker is going to be crucial for Arsenal if he plays; he will have to play very well if Arsenal are to have any chance. If he doesn't play well then Chelsea are going to cut through Arsenal like a knife through butter.\"Conte described Wenger as one of the \"greats\" in football, and felt he would remain as Arsenal manager come the season's end. \"He has done a fantastic job. Sometimes in England I think you undervalue the achievement of qualifying for the Champions League. Only this season they haven't qualified for the Champions League,\" he continued. Conte reiterated the importance of his players keeping their focus and wanted Chelsea to \"pay great attention and focus\" to their opponents. Hazard, who was playing in his first FA Cup final, was eager to win the competition: \"For Chelsea, for such a big club like this, you need to win one, two, three trophies every season if you can. Now we have the possibility to win another trophy so all the players are ready for that. It's such a great competition for the fans.\"\nWhile Chelsea had no injury or suspension worries, Arsenal had doubts over the fitness of Petr \u010cech and Shkodran Mustafi, and were already without defenders Laurent Koscielny (suspension) and Gabriel (ankle injury). Per Mertesacker was expected to start; the Germany international only featured once for Arsenal's first team during the season.  The day before the final The Guardian reported that Wenger chose David Ospina to start in goal ahead of \u010cech.Both clubs received an allocation of approximately 28,000 tickets. For adults, these were priced \u00a345, \u00a365, \u00a385 and \u00a3115, with concessions in place. Chelsea supporters were situated in the west side of the ground, while Arsenal's were allocated in the east.  The remaining 14,000 tickets were distributed to what the FA described as the \"football family which includes volunteers representing counties, leagues, local clubs and charities\". The losing finalist would receive \u00a31.6 million in total prize money while the winners earned a total of \u00a33.4 million. Security at Wembley Stadium was tightened in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing and Arsenal cancelled a screening of the game at their ground.

They had won the cup twelve times, and were beaten finalists seven times; most recently in 2001.  By comparison, Chelsea were making their 12th appearance in a FA Cup final. The club won the cup seven times and lost four finals. The clubs had previously met 13 times in the FA Cup. Arsenal held an advantage in those meetings, winning seven of the last eight; Chelsea won the last FA Cup tie, a 2\u20131 victory in April 2009. This was the second FA Cup final to feature both sides; the first was won by Arsenal in 2002.\nThe most recent meeting between the two teams was a league encounter in February 2017, Chelsea winning by three goals to one, a result which moved them 12 points clear in first position. The victory was significant given that Chelsea had lost the reverse fixture 3\u20130 in September 2016, in what BBC journalist Phil McNulty described as a \"watershed moment\" in their season. While Arsenal struggled to build momentum throughout autumn and winter, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte's tactical switch from 4\u20133\u20133 to 3\u20134\u20133 thereafter resulted in a 13-match winning run. They won the Premier League with two matches to spare, and later set a new divisional record for the most wins (30). \nArsenal ended the season in fifth place, their lowest placing under manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, missing out on UEFA Champions League football for the first time in 20 years. Wenger's future had been cast into doubt following a bad run of form in February and March, which included the team losing 10\u20132 on aggregate against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, the worst aggregate performance by an English club in the history of the tournament.To arrest the decline, Wenger adopted a similar tactical change to Conte, playing three defenders at the back. Arsenal went on to win eight of their last nine fixtures, but Wenger suggested his team were not favourites: \"it's quite even or maybe Chelsea are ahead, so it's a bit similar to what happened in the semi-final against Manchester City. That's part of what makes it all exciting as well.\" Of his future he said, \"It will not be my last match anyway, because I will stay, no matter what happens, in football.\" Former Arsenal player Paul Merson's evaluation was, \"Mertesacker is going to be crucial for Arsenal if he plays; he will have to play very well if Arsenal are to have any chance. If he doesn't play well then Chelsea are going to cut through Arsenal like a knife through butter.\"Conte described Wenger as one of the \"greats\" in football, and felt he would remain as Arsenal manager come the season's end. \"He has done a fantastic job. Sometimes in England I think you undervalue the achievement of qualifying for the Champions League. Only this season they haven't qualified for the Champions League,\" he continued. Conte reiterated the importance of his players keeping their focus and wanted Chelsea to \"pay great attention and focus\" to their opponents. Hazard, who was playing in his first FA Cup final, was eager to win the competition: \"For Chelsea, for such a big club like this, you need to win one, two, three trophies every season if you can. Now we have the possibility to win another trophy so all the players are ready for that. It's such a great competition for the fans.\"\nWhile Chelsea had no injury or suspension worries, Arsenal had doubts over the fitness of Petr \u010cech and Shkodran Mustafi, and were already without defenders Laurent Koscielny (suspension) and Gabriel (ankle injury). Per Mertesacker was expected to start; the Germany international only featured once for Arsenal's first team during the season.  The day before the final The Guardian reported that Wenger chose David Ospina to start in goal ahead of \u010cech.Both clubs received an allocation of approximately 28,000 tickets. For adults, these were priced \u00a345, \u00a365, \u00a385 and \u00a3115, with concessions in place. Chelsea supporters were situated in the west side of the ground, while Arsenal's were allocated in the east.  The remaining 14,000 tickets were distributed to what the FA described as the \"football family which includes volunteers representing counties, leagues, local clubs and charities\". The losing finalist would receive \u00a31.6 million in total prize money while the winners earned a total of \u00a33.4 million. Security at Wembley Stadium was tightened in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing and Arsenal cancelled a screening of the game at their ground.

{"id": "3301_36", "question": "What channel broadcast the BRIT Awards?", "ctxs": [{"id": "3301_39369", "text": "The BRIT Awards (often simply called the BRITs) are the British Phonographic Industry's annual popular music awards. The name was originally a shortened form of \"British\", \"Britain\", or \"Britannia\" (in the early days the awards were sponsored by Britannia Music Club), but subsequently became a backronym for British Record Industry Trusts Show. The awards were first held in 1977 and originated as an annual event in 1982 under the auspices of the British record industry's trade association, the BPI. In 1989, they were renamed The BRIT Awards. Mastercard has been the long-term sponsor of the event. In addition, an equivalent awards ceremony for classical music, called the Classic BRIT Awards, was held annually between 2000 and 2013, before being revived in 2018 but has not been held since.\nThe highest profile music awards ceremony in the UK, the BRIT Awards have featured some of the most notable events in British popular culture, such as the final public appearance of Freddie Mercury, the Jarvis Cocker protest against Michael Jackson, the height of a high-profile feud between Oasis and fellow Britpop band Blur, the Union Jack dress worn by Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls, and a Chumbawamba member throwing a bucket of iced water over then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. These moments took place in the 1990s when the ceremony had a reputation for being \"a little shambolic, unpredictable and, at times, anarchic\" with a criticism it has lost its edge since then and \"evolved into a more polished, sanitised affair.\"\nThe BRIT Awards were broadcast live until 1989, when Samantha Fox and Mick Fleetwood hosted a widely criticised show in which little went as rehearsed. From 1990 to 2006, the event was recorded and broadcast the following night. From 2007, The BRIT Awards reverted to a live broadcast on British television, on 14 February on ITV. That year, comedian Russell Brand was the host and three awards were dropped from the ceremony: British Rock Act, British Urban Act and British Pop Act. For the last time, on 16 February 2010, Earls Court in London was the venue for The BRITs. The BRIT Awards were held at the O2 Arena in London for the first time in 2011.\nThe BRIT Award statuette given to the winners features Britannia, the female personification of Britain. Since 2011, the statuette has been regularly redesigned by well known British artists, architects, and designers including Vivienne Westwood, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Peter Blake, Zaha Hadid, Anish Kapoor, David Adjaye, Yinka Ilori and Es Devlin, Pam Hogg, Olaolu Slawn and Rachel Jones. In 1992, KLF opened the show and invited extreme metal band Extreme Noise Terror on stage, complete with flame-throwers, and fired machine gun blanks over the crowd. The group sent a dead sheep to the aftershow party, and later buried their BRIT Award statuette at Stonehenge signifying their abhorrence of the music industry. Robbie Williams holds the record for the most BRIT Awards, 13 as a solo artist and another five as part of Take That. Girl group Little Mix made history at the Brit Awards 2021, when they became the first female group to receive the award at the ceremony after 43 years since it was first introduced.

They were initially referred to as the \"Clare Awards\" or \"The Clares\" after Clare Mendon\u00e7a, the editor of The Times of India and modelled after the Academy Awards.\nA dual voting system was developed in 1956. Under this system, in contrast to the National Film Awards, which are decided by a panel appointed by the Indian Government, the Filmfare Awards are voted on by both the public and a committee of experts. The ceremony has been sponsored by various private organisations in the past as well as in present provisions. During several years in the 1990s, a live ceremony was broadcast to television audiences but was later discontinued due to unknown reasons.\nSince 2001, a recorded and edited version of the awards ceremony was televised on SET a week or two after the ceremony has been held. Since 2018, the ceremony has been televised on Colors. Until 2023, the function was held in Mumbai except for year 2020 when the 65th Filmfare Awards event was held on 16 February 2020 at Sarusajai Stadium, Guwahati.\nUntil the mid-1990s, Filmfare Awards were the preeminent and most-recognised awards in Bollywood until several other awards sprouted up in Mumbai.

Her win set a record for the biggest gap between acting wins, subsequently broken by Katharine Hepburn (48 years between her first and last wins).\nThe documentary film Woodstock garnered three Oscar nominations, making it the most nominated documentary film in Oscar history (its record was later tied by Flee, 51 years later).\nThis was the only time since the 6th Academy Awards that all five nominees for Best Actress were first-time nominees, and was the last time that either lead acting category was entirely composed of new nominees until the 95th Academy Awards.

According to the SPLC, the show has featured a \"Who's Who of the radical right\", including members of the Ku Klux Klan; they say Edwards has probably done more than anyone in America to promote neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and other extremists.The show features Edwards and his co-hosts Keith Alexander, Bill Rolen, Winston Smith, and Eddie Miller, as well as producer Art Frith.
