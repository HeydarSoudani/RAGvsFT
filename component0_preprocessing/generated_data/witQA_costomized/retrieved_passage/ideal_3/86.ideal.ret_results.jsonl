Local (Andalusian) dialect is used.  It was written between August 1904 and March 1905, but not produced until 1913.  The first performance was given (in a French translation by Paul Millet) at the Casino Municipal in Nice on 1 April 1913. Paris and Madrid performances followed, later in 1913 and in 1914 respectively.  Claude Debussy played a major role in influencing Falla to transform it from the number opera it was at its Nice premiere to an opera with a more continuous musical texture and more mature orchestration.  This revision was first heard at the Paris premiere at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in December 1913, and is the standard version.\nOnly an hour long, the complete opera is seldom performed today, but its orchestral sections are, especially the act 2 music published as Interlude and Dance, which is popular at concerts of Spanish music. (Fritz Kreisler in 1926 arranged for violin and piano the dance from this pairing under the spurious title Danse espagnole.) Indeed the opera is unusual for having nearly as much instrumental music as vocal: act 1, scene 2 consists entirely of a short symphonic poem (with distant voices) called Intermedio, depicting sunset in Granada; act 2, Scene 1 includes the above-referenced Danza and Interludio, with the latter ending the scene, i.e. in the opposite sequence to the excerpted pairing; and act 2, scene 2 begins with the a second and longer Danza (with vocal punctuation).\nThe role of Salud is central to the action.

It is an indeterminate piece created using the I Ching and based, rhythmically, on Socrate by Erik Satie.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_49887", "text": "Like numerous other works by Cage, Cheap Imitation was a result of his collaboration with Merce Cunningham's dance company. However, in this case the original choreography relied not on Cage's music, but on a piano arrangement of Erik Satie's symphonic drama Socrate. In 1947 Cunningham choreographed a dance based on the first movement of Satie's work, and Cage provided a two-piano transcription of the music (since Cunningham's dances were usually accompanied by piano only). In 1968 it was decided to expand the choreography by two movements, based on the remaining two movements of the Satie work. Cage, who was at the time working on HPSCHD, a large multimedia work, requested help of an acquaintance from the University of Illinois, Arthur Maddox, and together they completed a two-piano arrangement of the remaining two movements. The new choreography was to be premiered in early 1970.\nHowever, in December 1969 Cage received news from Satie's publisher, \u00c9ditions Max Eschig, that he had been refused the rights to perform the piece, although Eschig hadn't even requested to see the transcription. Because the choreography was based on the rhythms and structure of Socrate, Cage could not simply compose a new piece of music. He decided to imitate Satie's work in a piano solo.

However, in this case the original choreography relied not on Cage's music, but on a piano arrangement of Erik Satie's symphonic drama Socrate. In 1947 Cunningham choreographed a dance based on the first movement of Satie's work, and Cage provided a two-piano transcription of the music (since Cunningham's dances were usually accompanied by piano only). In 1968 it was decided to expand the choreography by two movements, based on the remaining two movements of the Satie work. Cage, who was at the time working on HPSCHD, a large multimedia work, requested help of an acquaintance from the University of Illinois, Arthur Maddox, and together they completed a two-piano arrangement of the remaining two movements. The new choreography was to be premiered in early 1970.\nHowever, in December 1969 Cage received news from Satie's publisher, \u00c9ditions Max Eschig, that he had been refused the rights to perform the piece, although Eschig hadn't even requested to see the transcription. Because the choreography was based on the rhythms and structure of Socrate, Cage could not simply compose a new piece of music. He decided to imitate Satie's work in a piano solo.

It was published by Microsoft Game Studios in 2007 in Japan and 2008 in western territories. The story follows Kaim, one of a select group of \"immortals\" who have lost their memories: while confronting threats generated by the world's approaching magical industrial revolution, he must also face the pain brought by his returning memories. The gameplay features many staples of the genre, such as navigation using a world map, random encounters, and a turn-based battle system.\nFirst discussions surrounding Lost Odyssey began in 2003, with development beginning the following year as an internal Microsoft project. After running into difficulties, Feelplus was established as a dedicated studio to work on the game. The story was written by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Japanese author Kiyoshi Shigematsu: Sakaguchi wanted to create a story focusing on evoking human emotions, and kept the gameplay within genre traditions so he could experiment with the story. The game went through a difficult development, with problems stemming from the chosen engine technology and the arrangement of development teams. The music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, a veteran composer for the Final Fantasy series.\nFirst hinted at in 2005, the game was officially revealed shortly before that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo. At the time it was released, it was Microsoft's largest console game, spanning four dual-layer DVDs. Upon its debut in Japan, it sold favourably, eventually selling nearly 110,000 units by April 2010. It also received strong sales overseas. Its critical reception has been generally positive: while praise has focused on its story, many journalists were critical of its traditional design and loading times.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_49935", "text": "Lost Odyssey uses a traditional turn-based battle system seen in most Japanese role-playing games, similar to early Final Fantasy iterations. A world map allows the player to move the party between adjacent towns or fields on the map, while later in the game the player is given more freedom to explore the world through the use of ocean-going ships. Towns and cities provide inns for the player to read the thousand years of dreams, Mana/HP recovery orb for health and mana, stores for buying and selling of equipment, and save points for the game. While exploring certain areas, the player will randomly encounter monsters to fight.\nThe combat system incorporates aspects of battle initiative and length of actions to determine how events resolve each turn. Item usage is instantaneous, regular melee attacks are executed on the same turn, while casting spells or using special abilities may delay the player's action for one or more turns, depending on their speed. Actions can be delayed if the user is hit by an attack. The player has the option to cancel an action on a subsequent turn if necessary.\nMelee attacks include an \"Aim Ring System\" using equippable rings with added effects. As the character launches the attack, two concentric targeting rings appear on screen. The player must time their button release in order to make the rings intersect. An accuracy rank (\"Perfect\", \"Good\" or \"Bad\") indicates the potency of the effect.

The first discussions began in 2003. It was a collaboration between Mistwalker, an independent game studio set up by Sakaguchi in 2004, and Microsoft. It was initially an internal project by Microsoft with Sakaguchi, but development ran into difficulties. The game development company Feelplus, which formed one part of AQ Interactive was brought in to assist with the game\u2019s development. The staff of feelplus included a large number of developers from the defunct Shadow Hearts developer Nautilus, and staff members from The Legend of Dragoon and Phantom Dust. Among the shared staff were art director Takamasa Ohsawa. They also included developers from Microsoft and Sega. Further freelance staff were also brought in. Development started in 2004 and lasted three and a half years. Mistwalker handled the story and character design, Feelplus developed the actual product, while Microsoft provided funding, project management and testing. While development started with ten people, at development's peak it was at 150. The game's respective director and technical director, Daisuke Fukugawa and Katsuhisa Higuchi, had previously worked at Square Enix. Sakaguchi was fairly closely involved during the initial development, but during later phases he took a more hands-off supervisory approach.The game's story was written by Sakaguchi, whose main aim was to create a highly emotional experience that explored the human psyche. According to him, the game's setting revolved around conflict and its effects. In addition to Sakaguchi's work, Japanese novelist Kiyoshi Shigematsu created over thirty stories detailing Kaim's life as an immortal, titled \"A Thousand Years of Dreams\". According to Shigematsu, it was the first time he had ever worked on a video game, and was unsure about whether he could evoke emotion as he did in his books. In the end, he found that the interactive medium gave his work a new impact that moved him to tears upon seeing it in place. These story segments were presented in the game in a similar style to a visual novel, as the stories were intended to evoke emotion. The gameplay, such as the battle system, was kept deliberately traditional so that Sakaguchi had freedom to experiment with the story. Despite this, he wanted to introduce new real-time elements into the system. One of the elements Sakaguchi checked was how story and gameplay were balanced: sometimes, he would ask for a cutscene to be removed or for a boss battle to be lengthened if the balance seemed off.The music was composed and produced by Nobuo Uematsu at his studio Smile Please, a composer famous for his work on the Final Fantasy series. Arrangements were done by Satoshi Henmi and Hiroyuki Nakayama. Uematsu was contracted to Mistwalker to work on three of their games, with the first being Blue Dragon. He was highly excited for the title as it was Sakaguchi's first \"serious\" game since leaving Square Enix in 2003. As he was involved with Lost Odyssey from the early stages, receiving information on the characters and setting, he was able to create his first musical pieces while the game was in early stages. Most of the two hours worth of music was recorded with a live orchestra, as Uematsu felt that the emotion evoked by the game could only be communicated through live instruments. As with his previous work, Uematsu's music covered a lot of ground: the musical style varied from grand orchestral pieces, to hardcore rock, to ambient electronic music. In addition, he used unusual ethnic instruments to introduce unconventional sounds, including a sitar and a shakuhachi. The main theme was written in a minor key to express the burden of living for over a millennium: it was incorporated into the score in various forms. Two of the songs in the game, \"What You Are\" and \"Eclipse of Time\", were sung by award-winning vocalist Sheena Easton. The vocal track \"Kaette Kuru, Kitto...\" was sung by Japanese band Flip Flap. The lyrics for all the songs were written by Sakaguchi.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_49935", "text": "Lost Odyssey uses a traditional turn-based battle system seen in most Japanese role-playing games, similar to early Final Fantasy iterations. A world map allows the player to move the party between adjacent towns or fields on the map, while later in the game the player is given more freedom to explore the world through the use of ocean-going ships. Towns and cities provide inns for the player to read the thousand years of dreams, Mana/HP recovery orb for health and mana, stores for buying and selling of equipment, and save points for the game. While exploring certain areas, the player will randomly encounter monsters to fight.\nThe combat system incorporates aspects of battle initiative and length of actions to determine how events resolve each turn. Item usage is instantaneous, regular melee attacks are executed on the same turn, while casting spells or using special abilities may delay the player's action for one or more turns, depending on their speed. Actions can be delayed if the user is hit by an attack. The player has the option to cancel an action on a subsequent turn if necessary.\nMelee attacks include an \"Aim Ring System\" using equippable rings with added effects. As the character launches the attack, two concentric targeting rings appear on screen. The player must time their button release in order to make the rings intersect. An accuracy rank (\"Perfect\", \"Good\" or \"Bad\") indicates the potency of the effect. These include additional damage specific to certain types of monsters or their magic element, hit point or mana absorption, status ailments, or being able to steal items.

Financed by McDonald's, Ronald McDonald Children's Charities, it was originally simulcast for a limited time on April 21, 1990, on all four major American television networks (by supporting their Saturday morning characters): ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, and most independent stations, as well as various cable networks. McDonald's released a VHS home video edition of the special distributed by Buena Vista Home Video, which opened with an introduction from President George H. W. Bush, First Lady Barbara Bush and their dog, Millie. It was produced by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation and Southern Star Productions, and was animated overseas by Wang Film Productions. The musical number \"Wonderful Ways to Say No\" was written by Academy Award-winning composer, Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman, who also wrote the songs for Walt Disney Animation Studios' The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.\nThe plot chronicles the exploits of Michael, a teenage boy who is using marijuana as well as stealing and drinking alcohol, leaving his family worried.

While recording 18 Months, Harris expressed interest in working with Welch. He mentioned that it was not easy and he had to chase her, due to schedule conflicts. Welch accepted his invitation and the two recorded \"Sweet Nothing\". The track premiered on The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1 on 28 August 2012 and was later released as the fifth single from the album on 12 October 2012.\n\"Sweet Nothing\" is an electronic dance music song, with heartfelt vocals and an escalating beat. Lyrically, it talks about a romance with no depth, where the protagonist is receiving \"sweet nothing\". \"Sweet Nothing\" received favourable reviews, with many critics praising its production and Welch's vocals. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, marking Harris' first number-one single as a main artist in the United Kingdom since his 2009 single, \"I'm Not Alone\". The song is also Welch's first top-ten hit in the United States, peaking at number 10. \"Sweet Nothing\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 56th Grammy Awards.\nThe music video for the song, directed by Vincent Haycock, premiered on 20 September 2012.

Leigh (words) and Henry E.

It has featured in a number of films since the earliest days of cinema.   The silent film Waiting at the Church featured a performance by Victoria as she acted out the lyrics. Several other silent films were made to accompany recordings of the song.   Sound films which use the song include Here Come the Huggetts, Millions Like Us and I Thank You. Richard Thompson included it on his album 1000 Years of Popular Music. It has also been covered many times, including by Julie Andrews and Miss Piggy.\nThe song became famed in British politics when the second half of its refrain was sung by the then Prime Minister James Callaghan at the Annual Congress of the TUC in September 1978, to indicate that there would not be a general election that year. Callaghan misattributed the song to the better-known Marie Lloyd, an error not corrected by many news media when reporting it and which has in consequence become common.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

It premiered in Prague on January 19, 1787, during Mozart's first visit to the city. Because it was first performed in Prague, it is popularly known as the Prague Symphony. Mozart's autograph thematic catalogue records December 6, 1786, as the date of completion for this composition.Other works written by Mozart roughly contemporary with this symphony include the Piano Trio in B\u266d, K. 502 (completed November 18, 1786), the Piano Concerto No. 25, K. 503 (completed December 4, 1786), and scena and rond\u00f2 Ch'io mi scordi di te?, K. 505, for soprano and orchestra (completed December 26, 1786).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50045", "text": "Although Mozart's popularity among the Viennese waxed and waned, he was consistently popular among the Bohemians and had a devoted following in Prague. In spite of the fact that the Symphony No. 38 was first performed in Prague, it is not certain that it was actually written for Prague. Much of the confusion surrounds the chronology of its inception. It is clear that Mozart was invited to Prague on the strength of the reception of his opera Le nozze di Figaro during the 1786\u201387 winter season of the National Theatre (now called the Estates Theatre) in Prague. It is not known, however, when the run started, possibly in November 1786, possibly in December. No mention of the overwhelming success of Le nozze di Figaro is recorded in the Prague press until December 11, 1786, five days after the symphony was completed. It is certain that the opera's run began before that week, but there is no documentation to confirm when. It is known from a letter of Leopold Mozart written in January 1787 that Mozart was invited to Prague by a group of musicians and patrons. It is possible that this invitation came through long before Le nozze di Figaro was actually performed in Prague, perhaps during the time of rehearsals, when the brilliance of the music would have been recognized already by the musicians playing it. It is also possible that the Prague Symphony was intended to be performed for the Advent instrumental concerts given in Vienna in December 1786 along with the Piano Concerto No. 25, but all that can be established for certain is that it was not performed in Vienna before it was performed in Prague.\nThe lavish use of wind instruments might offer a clue that the Prague Symphony was fashioned specifically with the Prague public in mind. The wind players of Bohemia were famed throughout Europe, and the Prague press specifically attributed the great success of the operas Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail and Le nozze di Figaro partially to their skillful deployment of wind instruments. It is also possible that the extensive use of winds in the Prague Symphony was simply the result of experiments with orchestration that Mozart had been cultivating in the orchestral accompaniments for his piano concertos for the previous two years and the new experience he had of writing for winds would have shown up in his symphonies regardless. No matter, the use of wind instruments in the Prague Symphony represents a major advance in Mozart's symphonic technique that was imitated in his last symphonies, and also by Haydn, Beethoven, and Schubert. Indeed, it would be difficult to identify any earlier symphony by any composer not of a special type that contains so many passages in which no stringed instruments play at all, only various types of wind ensembles.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50046", "text": "The early classical symphonies of the eighteenth century were originally cast in three movements (fast\u2013slow\u2013fast) following their origins in Italian overtures. Then, starting in the 1750s, it was normal in Germany and Austria to include a minuet to create the format fast\u2013slow\u2013minuet\u2013fast. The Prague Symphony has no minuet, however, something that would have been extraordinarily unusual for a symphony written in Vienna in the late 1780s. Mozart himself, who wrote many more symphonies in the old-fashioned fast\u2013slow\u2013fast format than Haydn did (because of his closer connections with Italy), never before wrote a three-movement symphony for Vienna, not even as a child in the 1760s, when three-movement symphonies were still common in many parts of Europe. Daniel E. Freeman has suggested that the three-movement format might have been chosen as a means to appeal to the musical public of Prague. It so happens that the only symphonist from Prague that Mozart ever knew well was Josef Myslive\u010dek, a close associate of the Mozart family between 1770 and 1778. As it happens, almost all of Myslive\u010dek's symphonies are cast in the three-movement pattern favored in Italy, where he mainly worked throughout his adult life. Nonetheless, a definitive explanation for the three-movement format of the Prague Symphony is still lacking.\nThe Prague Symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings.\nIt has three movements, each in sonata form:\n\nAdagio \u2013 Allegro, 44\nAndante in G major, 68\nFinale (Presto), 24The first movement begins with a slow introduction (he does this in only two other symphonies, No. 36 [\"Linz\"] and No. 39). Daniel E. Freeman has noted that it is probably the longest and most sophisticated slow introduction written for any major symphony up to that time, perhaps to compensate for the length of the missing minuet in order to help bring the entire work into closer alignment with the customary length of a standard four-movement symphony. The introduction gives way to the main portion of the movement, in which six melodies are developed and recapitulated in a very contrapuntal example of sonata-allegro form. Certain phrases in the first movement bear a resemblance to the overture to Die Zauberfl\u00f6te. The allegro proper opens in a complicated manner with the \"first theme\" traded off between the second violins (who start it) and the first violins (who finish it off).\nThe second movement's structure is typical of Mozart symphonies dating from this period, although the music shifts into the minor-key in a movement of contrasting moods. It is in the subdominant key of G major.\nThe third movement is a lively Presto in which the flute plays a prominent role, especially in counterpointing the main melody in the development section. This movement \"shows Mozart in an unusual mood, nearer to Beethoven's boisterousness than his fastidious taste normally allowed him to go.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50045", "text": "Although Mozart's popularity among the Viennese waxed and waned, he was consistently popular among the Bohemians and had a devoted following in Prague.

Indeed, it would be difficult to identify any earlier symphony by any composer not of a special type that contains so many passages in which no stringed instruments play at all, only various types of wind ensembles.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50046", "text": "The early classical symphonies of the eighteenth century were originally cast in three movements (fast\u2013slow\u2013fast) following their origins in Italian overtures. Then, starting in the 1750s, it was normal in Germany and Austria to include a minuet to create the format fast\u2013slow\u2013minuet\u2013fast. The Prague Symphony has no minuet, however, something that would have been extraordinarily unusual for a symphony written in Vienna in the late 1780s. Mozart himself, who wrote many more symphonies in the old-fashioned fast\u2013slow\u2013fast format than Haydn did (because of his closer connections with Italy), never before wrote a three-movement symphony for Vienna, not even as a child in the 1760s, when three-movement symphonies were still common in many parts of Europe. Daniel E. Freeman has suggested that the three-movement format might have been chosen as a means to appeal to the musical public of Prague. It so happens that the only symphonist from Prague that Mozart ever knew well was Josef Myslive\u010dek, a close associate of the Mozart family between 1770 and 1778. As it happens, almost all of Myslive\u010dek's symphonies are cast in the three-movement pattern favored in Italy, where he mainly worked throughout his adult life. Nonetheless, a definitive explanation for the three-movement format of the Prague Symphony is still lacking.\nThe Prague Symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings.\nIt has three movements, each in sonata form:\n\nAdagio \u2013 Allegro, 44\nAndante in G major, 68\nFinale (Presto), 24The first movement begins with a slow introduction (he does this in only two other symphonies, No. 36 [\"Linz\"] and No. 39). Daniel E. Freeman has noted that it is probably the longest and most sophisticated slow introduction written for any major symphony up to that time, perhaps to compensate for the length of the missing minuet in order to help bring the entire work into closer alignment with the customary length of a standard four-movement symphony. The introduction gives way to the main portion of the movement, in which six melodies are developed and recapitulated in a very contrapuntal example of sonata-allegro form. Certain phrases in the first movement bear a resemblance to the overture to Die Zauberfl\u00f6te. The allegro proper opens in a complicated manner with the \"first theme\" traded off between the second violins (who start it) and the first violins (who finish it off).\nThe second movement's structure is typical of Mozart symphonies dating from this period, although the music shifts into the minor-key in a movement of contrasting moods. It is in the subdominant key of G major.\nThe third movement is a lively Presto in which the flute plays a prominent role, especially in counterpointing the main melody in the development section. This movement \"shows Mozart in an unusual mood, nearer to Beethoven's boisterousness than his fastidious taste normally allowed him to go.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The autopsy report shows zolpidem presence in the body, but no signs of coercion. In a few days, a second police officer goes missing, his body is found in the backyard of the police station, along with a Lady Justice figurine.\nAnwar finds a similar artefact in the previous crime scene from the forensic photos. Autopsy results are the same as previous. The station's CCTV footage has been tampered, indicating the killer is also a security hacker. Anwar employs hacker Andrew for cyber investigation. Catherine implements a plan to lure the killer in which two officers should pair and patrol the night at 100-meter distance. During duty, Catherine's driver Paulson is kidnapped, where his scooter's camera footage shows a wolf-masked man and another man's voice, indicating they work as a team. Paulson's body is delivered to Anwar's house in a refrigerator box.\nThe fingerprint of a cocaine dealer named Shameer is found. They track him to a cottage where they find his mummified corpse. It was a decoy. Anwar accidentally discovers a signature imprinted on the figurine, which turns out to be that of its sculptor, Sudhakar Devalokam. On questioning, Sudhakar explains that he made five such figurines for two men, who blinded him after he delivered it. From that, Anwar deduces there will be two more murders. On another day, CI Sharathchandran is abducted after a struggle at his home, where in addition to the figurine, they also find a fidget spinner. His body is dropped in a Kochi Metro train by a woman. With that, Catherine is replaced with ACP Prakash Seetharam.\nSharathchandran had regularly taken a prescription drug named Tenormin. Anwar theorises that the killers inject hypnotic drug Zolpidem in victim's body somehow before kidnapping and hypnotize them for taking away; Tenormin is a counter-drug against Zolpidem, so Sharathchandran's hypnosis was unsuccessful, hence the struggle. Anwar recalls seeing a photo of a similar spinner in the police file for a homicidal psychopath and hacker named Simon. While Simon is recorded dead during an explosion in prison, Anwar is not convinced. Andrew recognises Simon as the one who cross-dressed as the woman on the train.\nAnwar reports his findings but is informed that Simon and his crime partner Aravindan's bodies were found that morning with a suicide note confessing to the murders left along with the last figurine. Anwar is unconvinced and believes it is a decoy to stop the investigation. Anwar is called by Sudhakar after a man comes to his workshop for a sixth figurine. He has made a facial composite. Anwar identifies him as psychologist Dr Benjamin Louis since he always recommends his psychology books for referring when he goes to be a guest lecturer to psychology colleges. From Benjamin's foster parent Sudhevan, Anwar learns that when Benjamin was a teenager, his sister Rebecca was impregnated by a priest named Bennet Franko.\nWhen their father Louis reported the crime, SI Anil and Constable Sharathchandran framed him for assaulting his daughter after taking a bribe from Father Bennet. Rebecca was placed in a distant convent, and their father committed suicide in prison. Later, Benjamin went to the United States for higher studies and came back. Anwar deduces that the first three murders were random and the actual targets are Sharathchandran and Anil. He goes to warn Anil but finds only his deserted car. From a nearby quadcopter, Anwar finds footage of Benjamin's van, Andrew traces it to a pig farm.\nAnwar and two officers intercepts Benjamin before he can kill Anil. Benjamin knocks them down and chokes Anwar, but is saved by Catherine and Benjamin is arrested. On questioning, Benjamin does not disclose his motive. Anwar deduces that the burned corpse misidentified in prison as Simon's was actually Bennet's.  While in transit for presenting him in court, his escort officers kills Benjamin in a fake encounter.

In a few days, a second police officer goes missing, his body is found in the backyard of the police station, along with a Lady Justice figurine.\nAnwar finds a similar artefact in the previous crime scene from the forensic photos. Autopsy results are the same as previous. The station's CCTV footage has been tampered, indicating the killer is also a security hacker. Anwar employs hacker Andrew for cyber investigation. Catherine implements a plan to lure the killer in which two officers should pair and patrol the night at 100-meter distance. During duty, Catherine's driver Paulson is kidnapped, where his scooter's camera footage shows a wolf-masked man and another man's voice, indicating they work as a team. Paulson's body is delivered to Anwar's house in a refrigerator box.\nThe fingerprint of a cocaine dealer named Shameer is found. They track him to a cottage where they find his mummified corpse. It was a decoy. Anwar accidentally discovers a signature imprinted on the figurine, which turns out to be that of its sculptor, Sudhakar Devalokam. On questioning, Sudhakar explains that he made five such figurines for two men, who blinded him after he delivered it. From that, Anwar deduces there will be two more murders. On another day, CI Sharathchandran is abducted after a struggle at his home, where in addition to the figurine, they also find a fidget spinner. His body is dropped in a Kochi Metro train by a woman. With that, Catherine is replaced with ACP Prakash Seetharam.\nSharathchandran had regularly taken a prescription drug named Tenormin. Anwar theorises that the killers inject hypnotic drug Zolpidem in victim's body somehow before kidnapping and hypnotize them for taking away; Tenormin is a counter-drug against Zolpidem, so Sharathchandran's hypnosis was unsuccessful, hence the struggle. Anwar recalls seeing a photo of a similar spinner in the police file for a homicidal psychopath and hacker named Simon. While Simon is recorded dead during an explosion in prison, Anwar is not convinced. Andrew recognises Simon as the one who cross-dressed as the woman on the train.\nAnwar reports his findings but is informed that Simon and his crime partner Aravindan's bodies were found that morning with a suicide note confessing to the murders left along with the last figurine. Anwar is unconvinced and believes it is a decoy to stop the investigation. Anwar is called by Sudhakar after a man comes to his workshop for a sixth figurine. He has made a facial composite. Anwar identifies him as psychologist Dr Benjamin Louis since he always recommends his psychology books for referring when he goes to be a guest lecturer to psychology colleges. From Benjamin's foster parent Sudhevan, Anwar learns that when Benjamin was a teenager, his sister Rebecca was impregnated by a priest named Bennet Franko.\nWhen their father Louis reported the crime, SI Anil and Constable Sharathchandran framed him for assaulting his daughter after taking a bribe from Father Bennet. Rebecca was placed in a distant convent, and their father committed suicide in prison. Later, Benjamin went to the United States for higher studies and came back. Anwar deduces that the first three murders were random and the actual targets are Sharathchandran and Anil. He goes to warn Anil but finds only his deserted car. From a nearby quadcopter, Anwar finds footage of Benjamin's van, Andrew traces it to a pig farm.\nAnwar and two officers intercepts Benjamin before he can kill Anil. Benjamin knocks them down and chokes Anwar, but is saved by Catherine and Benjamin is arrested. On questioning, Benjamin does not disclose his motive. Anwar deduces that the burned corpse misidentified in prison as Simon's was actually Bennet's.  While in transit for presenting him in court, his escort officers kills Benjamin in a fake encounter. At the same time, a girl visits Anil at his apartment. Anwar enters when she leaves and finds Anil dead. He realises that the girl killed him. Through the window, Anwar calls her Rebecca, to which she turns back, looks at him and moves.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50118", "text": "Initially, Actor-writer Vineeth Vasudevan (who co-wrote Allu Ramendran) who is also a chakyar koothu artiste was roped in to play Psycho Simon, but later got replaced.He later plays a small role in the movie.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its release was set a week earlier than initially planned in order to combat bootlegging. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2001 at Manhattan Center Studios and Baseline Studios in New York City. Contrasting the radio-friendly sound of Jay-Z's previous work, The Blueprint features soul-based sampling and production handled primarily by Kanye West, Just Blaze, and Bink, as well as Timbaland, Trackmasters, and Eminem, who also contributes the album's sole guest feature.\nAt the time of the album's recording, Jay-Z was awaiting two criminal trials, one for gun possession and another for assault, and had become one of hip hop's most dissed artists, receiving insults from rappers such as Nas, Prodigy, and Jadakiss. The album is also notable for both its producers Kanye West and Just Blaze's breakouts as major producers. West produced four of the thirteen tracks on the album, including the songs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\" and the controversial \"Takeover\", which included diss lyrics aimed at rappers Nas and Prodigy, while Just Blaze produced three tracks, \"Girls, Girls, Girls\", \"Song Cry\", and \"U Don't Know\", also including the hidden bonus track \"Breathe Easy (Lyrical Exercise)\".\nThe Blueprint received universal acclaim from music critics, with praise being directed at Jay-Z's performance and the album's soul based soundscape. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time as well as one of the greatest albums ever made in general. Despite its release coinciding with the September 11 attacks, it sold over 427,000 copies in its opening week and debuted at number one in the US, holding the spot for three weeks.

Joseph Kessel and Maurice Druon wrote the French lyrics. It was performed by Anna Marly, broadcast by the BBC and adopted by the maquis. The lyrics of the song revolve around the idea of a life-or-death struggle for national liberation.\nAfter the war the \"Chant des Partisans\" was so popular, it was proposed as a new national anthem for France. It became for a short while the unofficial national anthem, next to the official \"La Marseillaise\".\nAnna Marly also wrote and performed a more introspective song, \"La Complainte du Partisan\", which was later adapted and translated into English as \"The Partisan\". It was most famously covered by Leonard Cohen. The two songs are sometimes confused.", "hasanswer": true}]}

This increasingly anarchistic bacchanal culminates in a violent crescendo of gunshots and in-fighting, until finally an impossibly large wrecking ball \u2014 its presence going unexplained \u2014 smashes with God-like wrath through a wall of the building (at the altar of this former church), causing the death of the harpist beneath an avalanche of rubble.\nAs the silenced fellow musicians reflect on this tragedy in a cloud of settling dust, the conductor steps in to eulogize with a motivational speech declaring that music requires them to play through the pain of life, to find strength, identity and guidance in the fated notes of its composition. Amid the ruins, the newly inspired musicians accommodatingly take to their instruments to deliver a tour de force redemptive performance. At its conclusion, however, the conductor's former words of fleeting praise once again sour to perfectionist dissatisfaction, resuming his comically agitated critique at the dais as the picture fades to black, to the swelling accompaniment of a classical opus. As the credit roll commences, the conductor's continued Italian dialogue berating the orchestra is heard to slip into dictatorial German barking, suggesting a sharper political allegory at play in the movie's message all along.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50205", "text": "Balduin Baas - Conductor\nClara Colosimo - Harp player\nElizabeth Labi - Piano player\nRonaldo Bonacchi - Bassoon player\nFerdinando Villella] - Cello player\nFranco Iavarone - Bass tuba player (as Giovanni Javarone)\nDavid Maunsell - First violin\nFrancesco Aluigi - Second violin\nAndy Miller - Oboe player\nSibyl Amarilli Mostert - Flute player\nFranco Mazzieri - Trumpet player\nDaniele Pagani - Trombone player\nLuigi Uzzo - Violin player\nCesare Martignon - Clarinet player\nUmberto Zuanelli - Copyist\nFilippo Trincaia - Head of orchestra\nClaudio Ciocca - Union man\nAngelica Hansen - Violin player\nHeinz Kreuger - Violin player", "hasanswer": false}]}

Using a four-track recorder, this first performance featured George Harrison's guitar on track 1, Lennon's guitar on track 2, Ringo Starr's drums on track 3, and McCartney's piano set on track 4. After those individual tracks had been combined in a reduction mix, McCartney overdubbed a bass guitar part.The 24 February session was devoted to adding vocals. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, McCartney had told George Martin, the band's producer, that he wanted the backing vocals to replicate how the Beach Boys \"might approach the song\". The Beatles were visited in the studio that evening by Tony Hicks of the Hollies, American musicians David Crosby and Shawn Phillips, and the brother of Ravi Shankar, Harrison's sitar teacher. Also present was Leslie Bryce, a photographer from Beatles Monthly. McCartney recorded his lead vocal with the tape speed reduced, so that his voice sounded at a higher pitch when the speed was corrected. Bryce took photos of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Crosby grouped around a microphone, and the Beat Instrumental report stated that the backing vocals were recorded that night with Crosby's participation. Phillips later supported this and said that he too sang backing vocals with the three Beatles. However, Phillips' recollection is not supported by others, who say the group vocals were instead overdubbed on 7 March.The session was led by Lennon and recorded with heavy tape echo. Enjoying the lighthearted session, the Beatles also added percussive effects played on comb and paper, serving as handmade kazoos, and vocalised sounds such as moans, sighs and screams. The latter sounds appear over the song's extended coda. Martin later described the session as \"anarchy\", given how little was achieved over the seven hours, and cited it as a precedent for the group's \"undisciplined, sometimes self-indulgent\" method of working on Magical Mystery Tour later in 1967.A second piano, played by Martin and processed electromechanically to wobble in and out of tune, was added for the solo on 21 March. This session was again filled with visitors. Among these were the band Pink Floyd, who were recording in a neighbouring studio and gained entry to the session through their producer, Norman Smith, formerly the Beatles' recording engineer. Although Pink Floyd were established as one of the leading bands in the London underground scene, they were intimidated to be in the Beatles' presence. Drummer Nick Mason recalled that they watched the band mixing \"Lovely Rita\" but they were \"God-like figures to us\" and any interaction between the two groups was minimal. Pink Floyd later used effects inspired by \"Lovely Rita\" when recording their instrumental composition \"Pow R. Toc H.\" from their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.The final mono mix was completed that night, and a month later, the stereo mix was done. During mixdown the tape machine ran at 48.75 Hz instead of the standard 50 Hz, affecting the pitch on the released track. With vari-speed having been applied throughout the recording process, the song's key is around E flat major. According to Martin, \"Lovely Rita\" and \"When I'm Sixty Four\" were the songs that would have been cut from Sgt. Pepper had the Beatles not been pressured into issuing \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" as a non-album single in advance of the album's release.

A reproduction of the manuscript shows only the opening chorus and verse in McCartney's handwriting; the remaining lyrics appear in Beatles assistant Mal Evans' handwriting, after he and Neil Aspinall joined the two songwriters in a corner of the studio.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50267", "text": "Recording began on 23 February 1967 with eight takes required to achieve a satisfactory basic track. Using a four-track recorder, this first performance featured George Harrison's guitar on track 1, Lennon's guitar on track 2, Ringo Starr's drums on track 3, and McCartney's piano set on track 4. After those individual tracks had been combined in a reduction mix, McCartney overdubbed a bass guitar part.The 24 February session was devoted to adding vocals. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, McCartney had told George Martin, the band's producer, that he wanted the backing vocals to replicate how the Beach Boys \"might approach the song\". The Beatles were visited in the studio that evening by Tony Hicks of the Hollies, American musicians David Crosby and Shawn Phillips, and the brother of Ravi Shankar, Harrison's sitar teacher. Also present was Leslie Bryce, a photographer from Beatles Monthly. McCartney recorded his lead vocal with the tape speed reduced, so that his voice sounded at a higher pitch when the speed was corrected. Bryce took photos of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Crosby grouped around a microphone, and the Beat Instrumental report stated that the backing vocals were recorded that night with Crosby's participation. Phillips later supported this and said that he too sang backing vocals with the three Beatles. However, Phillips' recollection is not supported by others, who say the group vocals were instead overdubbed on 7 March.The session was led by Lennon and recorded with heavy tape echo. Enjoying the lighthearted session, the Beatles also added percussive effects played on comb and paper, serving as handmade kazoos, and vocalised sounds such as moans, sighs and screams. The latter sounds appear over the song's extended coda. Martin later described the session as \"anarchy\", given how little was achieved over the seven hours, and cited it as a precedent for the group's \"undisciplined, sometimes self-indulgent\" method of working on Magical Mystery Tour later in 1967.A second piano, played by Martin and processed electromechanically to wobble in and out of tune, was added for the solo on 21 March. This session was again filled with visitors. Among these were the band Pink Floyd, who were recording in a neighbouring studio and gained entry to the session through their producer, Norman Smith, formerly the Beatles' recording engineer. Although Pink Floyd were established as one of the leading bands in the London underground scene, they were intimidated to be in the Beatles' presence. Drummer Nick Mason recalled that they watched the band mixing \"Lovely Rita\" but they were \"God-like figures to us\" and any interaction between the two groups was minimal. Pink Floyd later used effects inspired by \"Lovely Rita\" when recording their instrumental composition \"Pow R. Toc H.\" from their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.The final mono mix was completed that night, and a month later, the stereo mix was done. During mixdown the tape machine ran at 48.75 Hz instead of the standard 50 Hz, affecting the pitch on the released track. With vari-speed having been applied throughout the recording process, the song's key is around E flat major. According to Martin, \"Lovely Rita\" and \"When I'm Sixty Four\" were the songs that would have been cut from Sgt. Pepper had the Beatles not been pressured into issuing \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" as a non-album single in advance of the album's release. In the opinion of music critic Richie Unterberger, \"Lovely Rita\" is \"one of the more lighthearted songs on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and consequently one of the more critically overlooked\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The soloists were Julia Culp and Thorpe Bates, with the Edward Mason Choir and Beecham Symphony Orchestra.  Other works performed that night were Paris: The Song of a Great City, the Dance Rhapsody, and Appalachia.\nThe occasion was also the first meeting of Delius with Philip Heseltine, then a 16-year-old Eton schoolboy, who had seen a copy of the score and wanted nothing more than to hear it.  The school's permission had to be obtained for him to attend the concert.  That meeting led to a lifelong friendship between the two, even though Delius was almost 33 years older than Heseltine.Songs of Sunset was dedicated to the Elberfeld Choral Society, whose chief conductor Hans Haym was one of Delius's greatest supporters in Germany.  The Elberfeld chorus performed it first in 1914.

He considered it a model for German opera.The opera was revived in Weimar in 1999, when the town was European Capital of Culture. Conducted by Stephan E. Wehr, it was staged in the Richard-Wagner-Saal of the Hotel Elephant, and broadcast live by Deutschlandfunk. Ideas and Impresario was the visual artist Cornel Wachter from Cologne. The ensemble, with Ursula Targler as Alceste, Sylvia Koke as Parthenia, Christian Voigt as Admet and Christoph Johannes Wendel as Herkules, with the Philharmonisches Orchester Erfurt and its chorus recorded the opera in 2001. Another recording was made in 2008 by Concerto K\u00f6ln conducted by Michael Hofstetter on period instruments, with Simone Schneider, Cyndia Sieden, Christoph Genz and Josef Wagner. The DVD recorded a performance staged by Hendrik M\u00fcller in the Festsaal (festive hall) of Schloss Weimar, on the occasion of the reopening after the fire of the Duchess Anna Amalia Library.", "hasanswer": false}]}

But the child, through her loving attitude and respect for their religions, makes the other two also like her. Now, all three believe that the child is God like and give her all the affection they can. Their problem begins when the child does not eat and demands the aaya (maid) to feed her. They try, but the child cries for Aaya Gowri. Left with no choice, Jambu travels to bring her. A Police Inspector is investigating the case and enquires to Gowri about why she, who usually spent every night with the child, left the child alone that specific night. They suspect that she was hand-in-glove with the robbers and keep her in their custody. Jambu learns Gowri's address from the two fellow passengers.

Gowri overhears this and escapes with the child. However, they soon find out and chase her. The child starts shouting and to make her silent, Gowri shuts her mouth which leads to her wheezing and a heart problem.

He puts up a demand that he will attend to the child only if they agree to surrender to the police for their crimes. The three express their fear of losing the love of the child if they surrender. For this, Ramanathan assures that he will fight for them in the court and also ensure that the child comes and meets them every day. The three agree to surrender and Ramanathan attends to the child.

They continue stealing from various shops and hotels; their atrocities become the talk of the city. The three enter a rich man Prabhakar's house, kill everybody and steal the money. They see a young child Geetha there and Jambu starts to like her. The other two do not show any affection, but Jambu decides to bring her along with him. The Police arrive but by then the three have escaped with the child. The police find that all the robberies and the killings were carried out by the same set of robbers and announce a reward of \u20b910,000 (equivalent to \u20b9520,000 or US$6,500 in 2023) to anyone who can provide a clue to catch them.\nAt their hideout, Jambu gets attached to the child, whilst the other two believe the child has come to kill them. But the child, through her loving attitude and respect for their religions, makes the other two also like her. Now, all three believe that the child is God like and give her all the affection they can. Their problem begins when the child does not eat and demands the aaya (maid) to feed her. They try, but the child cries for Aaya Gowri. Left with no choice, Jambu travels to bring her. A Police Inspector is investigating the case and enquires to Gowri about why she, who usually spent every night with the child, left the child alone that specific night. They suspect that she was hand-in-glove with the robbers and keep her in their custody. Jambu learns Gowri's address from the two fellow passengers. He meets Gowri's mother as her brother Manickam, convinces everyone that he is their close relative including the police officers and then takes Gowri with him forcefully, jumps off the train and escapes from the police.\nGowri is happy to see the child, but is shaken about being with the robbers who killed her master. She takes care of the child and also cooks and attends to them. She tries to kill them by mixing poison with milk, but they find that out and beat her. She then plans to split them and escape with the child. She tries entice them and Joseph and Naseer fall for it. But Jambu understands her game and puts sense into the other two. Her plan fails again. The three decide that Gowri should be out of the life of the child. So they demand her to behave in a manner that the child shall hate her. She does not agree because she has brought up the child. Jambu gets more attached to the child and it is mutual. He starts believing that the child will live without Gowri and decides to kill her. Gowri overhears this and escapes with the child. However, they soon find out and chase her. The child starts shouting and to make her silent, Gowri shuts her mouth which leads to her wheezing and a heart problem. They catch them and she asks for their help to bring Dr. Ramanathan, who knows the child's health condition. Joseph goes in the disguise of sardar and visits Ramanathan who is at a wedding and convinces him to come with him. The police, who were at the marriage venue find it fishy and follow their car. The police try to shoot and stop them, but Joseph somehow escapes with the doctor.\nJoseph and the doctor reach their hideout and Ramanathan understands the dire situation. He attends to the child and stops treating her saying that the child will die anyway. The three beat him, but he refuses to treat the child and says that they will become the reason for the death of the child. The three get emotionally disturbed and beg for his help. He puts up a demand that he will attend to the child only if they agree to surrender to the police for their crimes. The three express their fear of losing the love of the child if they surrender. For this, Ramanathan assures that he will fight for them in the court and also ensure that the child comes and meets them every day. The three agree to surrender and Ramanathan attends to the child. Naseer goes to the city to get medicine. The shopkeeper informs the police and they arrive to catch him, but he escapes. Ramanathan treats the child and the three pray for her recovery. Finally, the child recovers and asks for the three uncles instead of Gowri. The three get attached to the child and decide to leave all their wealth behind and move away with her. They get surrounded by a large number of police. The three attack the police courageously. Ramanathan and Gowri manage to escape with the child. Joseph is injured and when they realise that the child has been taken away, they decide to escape somewhere in order to get her back. They manage to escape and hide and police are unable to trace them. Ramanathan convinces the police about the love the three have for the child. The police assure that the child can meet them in jail and also not to shoot them when they surrender. Ramanathan now asks the child to speak in the mike and the child calls for the three uncles. They hear her and surrender to the police. Ramanathan assures to take care of the child and bring her to meet them regularly.

Kote tells Levan that he is in love and wants to marry, but that he fears his love's father will not approve.  Levan happily tells Kote that he too is planning to marry and believes that Tkuilkotriashviliwill not refuse him because of him impoverished state.

Makar leaves, followed by the saddened Keto.\nKote arrives, wanting to see Keto.  She and Barbale soon appear, and Kote fears that an angry Makar may surprise them.

Prince Kote, Levan's nephew, returns from a long journey and joins the festivities as everyone greets him joyously.   Prince Levan's matchmaker, Babusi, also promises to find a wife for Kote and then approaches the impoverished Levan to tell him that she has already found a wife for him, Keto, the beautiful daughter of the wealthy merchant Makar Tkuilkotriashvili.  Prince Levan is enjoying the party so much that he pays no attention.\nAs the guests move to the garden, Kote stops his uncle and asks for a word.  Kote tells Levan that he is in love and wants to marry, but that he fears his love's father will not approve.  Levan happily tells Kote that he too is planning to marry and believes that Tkuilkotriashviliwill not refuse him because of him impoverished state. Kote is overwhelmed to hear the name of Keto's father, and Levan becomes worried, but Kote quickly calms him down, and the Prince joins his guests in the garden.\nBarbale, another matchmaker, enters.  Kote rushes to her to tell her about his problem.  Barbale, calms him down, telling him to listen only to her and everything will be alright.  The now hopeful Kote leaves, bidding Barbale goodbye.  As Levan, Maro, and Babusi enter, Barbale approaches them, saying that she has already arranged Levan's marriage.  Everyone is surprised as now two matchmakers have arranged Levan's marriage.  A quarrel between the two breaks out.  Levan, trying to make peace, suggest settling the dispute by throwing lots.  Babusi wins.  The angry Barbale is ordered to leave.  She leaves, but is resolved to be the final winner.\nAct 2\nMakar is at home, sitting at a table and dreaming of money.  His mood is good as his daughter will shortly marry Prince Levan.  Soon Levan will arrive to meet his daughter, and Makar tells Keto to dress in her new clothes.  Keto asks her father not to marry her to Levan.  Makar orders her to be quiet and get ready.  Makar leaves, followed by the saddened Keto.\nKote arrives, wanting to see Keto.  She and Barbale soon appear, and Kote fears that an angry Makar may surprise them.  Barbale calms him down; if Makar comes, they will tell him that Kote is there to tune the piano.  Keto's cousins, Sacko and Sicko, enter in a happy mood singing a merry song about wine and food.  When Sicko congratulates her on her upcoming marriage to Prince Levan, she tells him she will not marry him as she loves another--Prince Kote, who is here now.  She points to him.\nAmidst the cousin's astonishment, Barbale produces a letter to Makar that she has allegedly found on Keto's table, saying that she is going to kill herself because she does not wish to marry a man she doesn't love.  She blames her father and her cousins who helped him.  Worried about this, Sacko and Sicko start to leave, but Barbale stops them as she needs their help.  Makar enters.  He is expecting Prince Levan and is nervous.  He asked everyone to prepare for the visit and leaves.\nBarbale shares her plan with the cousins.  She will dress in bridal clothes and present herself to the Prince in a most unseemly fashion, who will mistake her for Keto.  But Makar must be away from the house for this to work, so the cousins will forge a letter from the magistrate summoning him immediately.

A rishi, who uses his power to locate Sarva, sees Sarva and Divya getting married. He doesn't inform anything about Malar.\nAfter an incident where Malar spooks everyone at the apartment she's staying at night, she accidentally flees to Sarva's house without realising. The snake scares Sarva, and Divya confesses that she lied about having Naga dhosham get married. They consult an astrologist who tells them to go to the Naga temple and advises them not to engage in sexual activity. They coincidentally come to the place where Malar is staying. Rishi finds this using his power and tells Malar that Sarva is married now and that she should forget him. She strangles the rishi in anger and says he is her husband forever. Sarva and Divya stay in a resort, and Malar follows them there. She dreams of Sarva recognising her and leaving Divya. But he doesn't recognise her at all. The rishi tells her that if she seduces Sarva, he might get back his past life memory back. So, Malar shapeshifts into Divya and goes to charm Sarva. But her plan fails since they are not there for the honeymoon. Malar gets furious after seeing the closeness of Sarva and Divya and scares them into the bedroom. Afterwards, at night, she lures Divya to the woods by taking her scarf and tries to kill her again without success. The area people capture Malar (in snake form) in a barrel and transport her. But she escapes from them.\n``Past`` In 1993, Malar is a college student travelling in the local bus. She encounters Vikram, who beats up local goons for misbehaving with another girl. They soon fall in love, and due to being in a different caste, her parents try to kill Vikram.\nDevi and Manas are two shapeshifting snakes who want to be human in the woodlands. For snakes to become completely human, they need to retrieve a thali from the Naga statute surrounded by thousand of snakes who had failed before. After a struggle, they recover the thali but faint before tying it. Vikram and Malar flee from home, and he ties the same thali on Malar. Devan tries to remove it, but a fight ensues between him and Vikram, who mistake him for Malar's father's goon. Malar accidentally kills him; Devi is distraught. She poisons Vikram. She curses Malar with the same curse she had suffered and dies.\n``Present``: Malar becomes Nagarani and is doomed to roam as a snake at night for eternity. Malar convinces Sarva to follow her, telling her that she will show his previous avatars, trying to remind him of his past life with her. Malar finally tells the story to Sarva. Sarva accidentally shrugs off Malar, who falls from the waterfall cliff into the lake. He gets his past memories when he tries to resurrect her post-rescue. However, Divya frantically searches for her lost husband and learns that Malar is actually a snake. A different rishi advises her to take poison herself and try to bite Malar.

They exist in the woods cursed by gods to this fate, dreaming of becoming humans.\nThe story revolves around Sarva, whose horoscope dangers the person he marries since he has Naga dhosham. Divya has been following Sarva for three years, and he always rejects her confession. Sarva finally confesses his dhosham to Divya, who says she has Naga dhosham too. And they get married soon after. Meanwhile, Malar is a woman who grieves, holding a pencil book of sketches with a Sarva lookalike. Her past flashes show them to be married and in love. She is searching for Sarva, who looks like her husband. While in search, she encounters a few men pretending to know Sarva, who tries to rape her. And we finally know that Malar is a shapeshifting snake who kills them all. She is a woman by day and forced to turn a snake by night. A rishi, who uses his power to locate Sarva, sees Sarva and Divya getting married. He doesn't inform anything about Malar.\nAfter an incident where Malar spooks everyone at the apartment she's staying at night, she accidentally flees to Sarva's house without realising. The snake scares Sarva, and Divya confesses that she lied about having Naga dhosham get married. They consult an astrologist who tells them to go to the Naga temple and advises them not to engage in sexual activity. They coincidentally come to the place where Malar is staying. Rishi finds this using his power and tells Malar that Sarva is married now and that she should forget him. She strangles the rishi in anger and says he is her husband forever. Sarva and Divya stay in a resort, and Malar follows them there. She dreams of Sarva recognising her and leaving Divya. But he doesn't recognise her at all. The rishi tells her that if she seduces Sarva, he might get back his past life memory back. So, Malar shapeshifts into Divya and goes to charm Sarva. But her plan fails since they are not there for the honeymoon. Malar gets furious after seeing the closeness of Sarva and Divya and scares them into the bedroom. Afterwards, at night, she lures Divya to the woods by taking her scarf and tries to kill her again without success. The area people capture Malar (in snake form) in a barrel and transport her. But she escapes from them.\n``Past`` In 1993, Malar is a college student travelling in the local bus. She encounters Vikram, who beats up local goons for misbehaving with another girl. They soon fall in love, and due to being in a different caste, her parents try to kill Vikram.\nDevi and Manas are two shapeshifting snakes who want to be human in the woodlands. For snakes to become completely human, they need to retrieve a thali from the Naga statute surrounded by thousand of snakes who had failed before. After a struggle, they recover the thali but faint before tying it. Vikram and Malar flee from home, and he ties the same thali on Malar. Devan tries to remove it, but a fight ensues between him and Vikram, who mistake him for Malar's father's goon. Malar accidentally kills him; Devi is distraught. She poisons Vikram. She curses Malar with the same curse she had suffered and dies.\n``Present``: Malar becomes Nagarani and is doomed to roam as a snake at night for eternity. Malar convinces Sarva to follow her, telling her that she will show his previous avatars, trying to remind him of his past life with her. Malar finally tells the story to Sarva. Sarva accidentally shrugs off Malar, who falls from the waterfall cliff into the lake. He gets his past memories when he tries to resurrect her post-rescue. However, Divya frantically searches for her lost husband and learns that Malar is actually a snake. A different rishi advises her to take poison herself and try to bite Malar. But there's no antidote for this poison. She takes the poison and hastens to kill Malar. Rishi warns Divya that if Malar and Sarva get together, he will become a snake too.\nAs Malar chases the pair, Divya's poisoning becomes worse. Sarva chooses Divya over Malar. And Malar dies after biting poison from Divya's leg, willingly leaving Sarva and Divya in peace. In the end, Malar tells Sarva that she had already died when you chose Divya over her and informs him that she passed away for him in the last era. She will die for him and owes to live with Sarva in the next life and expires with sad contentment because, for Vikram, she has waited for nearly 25 years.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50405", "text": "The first schedule of Neeya 2 was shot in Pondicherry, and the subsequent ones were completed in Talakonam, Chennai, Madurai, and Chalakudy.

Jackson, Michael Rapaport, and LL Cool J. It is the first film of the film series by the same name. Set in an isolated underwater facility, the film follows a team of scientists and their research on mako sharks to help fight Alzheimer's disease. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on a rampage and flood the facility.\nDeep Blue Sea had a production budget of $60\u201382 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since Cliffhanger in 1993. The film was primarily shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. Although Deep Blue Sea features some shots of real sharks, most of the sharks used in the film were either animatronic or computer generated. Trevor Rabin composed the film score; LL Cool J contributed two songs to the film: \"Deepest Bluest (Shark's Fin)\" and \"Say What\".\nReleased in theaters on July 28, 1999, Deep Blue Sea grossed $165 million worldwide. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences, but criticized its unoriginality and B movie conventions. Retrospectively, Deep Blue Sea has been regarded as a successful shark film, especially within a limited genre that has been dominated by Steven Spielberg's 1975 thriller Jaws.

{"id": "86_169", "question": "Who composed the music for Lawrence of Arabia?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_50462", "text": "Lawrence of Arabia is a 1962 epic biographical adventure drama film based on the life of T. E. Lawrence and his 1926 book Seven Pillars of Wisdom (also known as Revolt in the Desert). It was directed by David Lean and produced by Sam Spiegel through his British company Horizon Pictures and distributed by Columbia Pictures. The film stars Peter O'Toole as Lawrence with Alec Guinness playing Prince Faisal. The film also stars Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quayle, Claude Rains and Arthur Kennedy. The screenplay was written by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson.\nThe film depicts Lawrence's experiences in the Ottoman provinces of Hejaz and Greater Syria during the First World War, in particular his attacks on Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the violence inherent in war, his identity and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes.\nThe film was nominated for ten Oscars at the 35th Academy Awards in 1963, winning seven including Best Picture and Best Director. It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and the BAFTA Awards for Best Film and Outstanding British Film. The dramatic score by Maurice Jarre and the Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young also won praise from critics.\nLawrence of Arabia is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. In 1991, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1998, the American Film Institute placed it fifth on their 100 Years...100 Movies list of the greatest American films and it ranked seventh on their 2007 updated list. In 1999, the British Film Institute named the film the third-greatest British film. In 2004, it was voted the best British film in The Sunday Telegraph poll of Britain's leading filmmakers.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50463", "text": "Peter O'Toole as T. E. Lawrence. Albert Finney was a virtual unknown at the time but he was Lean's first choice to play Lawrence. Finney was cast and began principal photography but was fired after two days for reasons that are still unclear. Marlon Brando was also offered the part, while Anthony Perkins and Montgomery Clift were briefly considered before O'Toole was cast. Spiegel disliked Clift, having worked with him on Suddenly, Last Summer (1959). Alec Guinness had played Lawrence in the play Ross and was briefly considered for the part but Lean and Spiegel thought him too old. Lean had seen O'Toole in The Day They Robbed the Bank of England (1960) and was bowled over by his screen test, proclaiming, \"This is Lawrence!\" Spiegel eventually acceded to Lean's choice. Pictures of Lawrence suggest also that O'Toole bore some resemblance to him, though at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall O'Toole was significantly taller than Lawrence. O'Toole's looks prompted a different reaction from No\u00ebl Coward, who quipped after seeing the premi\u00e8re of the film, \"If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia\".\nAlec Guinness as Prince Faisal. Faisal was originally to be portrayed by Laurence Olivier. Guinness had performed in other David Lean films and he got the part when Olivier dropped out. Guinness was made up to look as much like the real Faisal as possible; he recorded in his diaries that, while shooting in Jordan, he met several people who had known Faisal who actually mistook him for the late prince. Guinness said in interviews that he developed his Arab accent from a conversation that he had with Omar Sharif.\nAnthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi. Quinn got very much into his role; he spent hours applying his own makeup, using a photograph of the real Auda to make himself look as much like him as he could. One anecdote has Quinn arriving on-set for the first time in full costume, whereupon Lean mistook him for a native and asked his assistant to ring Quinn and notify him that they were replacing him with the new arrival.\nJack Hawkins as General Edmund Allenby. Spiegel pushed Lean to cast Cary Grant or Laurence Olivier (who was engaged at the Chichester Festival Theatre and declined). Lean convinced him to choose Hawkins because of his work for them on The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). Hawkins shaved his head for the role and reportedly clashed with Lean several times during filming. Guinness recounted that Hawkins was reprimanded by Lean for celebrating the end of a day's filming with an impromptu dance. Hawkins became close friends with O'Toole during filming, and the two often improvised dialogue during takes, to Lean's dismay.\nOmar Sharif as Sherif Ali ibn el Kharish. The role was offered to many actors before Sharif was cast. Horst Buchholz was the first choice but had already signed on for the film One, Two, Three. Alain Delon had a successful screen test but ultimately declined because of the brown contact lenses he would have had to wear. Maurice Ronet and Dilip Kumar were also considered. Sharif, who was already a major star in the Middle East, was originally cast as Lawrence's guide Tafas but when the other actors proved unsuitable, Sharif was shifted to the part of Ali. An amalgamation of numerous Arab leaders, particularly Sharif Nassir, Faisal's cousin, who led the Harith forces in the attack on Aqaba, this character was created largely because Lawrence did not serve with any one Arab leader (aside from Auda) throughout the majority of the war; most such leaders were combined into Ali's character.\nJos\u00e9 Ferrer as the Turkish Bey. Ferrer was initially dissatisfied with the small size of his part and accepted the role only on the condition of being paid $25,000 (more than O'Toole and Sharif combined) plus a Porsche. Afterwards, Ferrer considered this his best film performance, saying in an interview: \"If I was to be judged by any one film performance, it would be my five minutes in Lawrence\". Peter O'Toole once said that he learned more about screen acting from Ferrer than he could in any acting class. According to Lawrence in Seven Pillars of Wisdom, this was General Hajim Bey (in Turkish, Hacim Muhiddin Bey), though the film does not name him. Biographers including Jeremy Wilson and John Mack have argued that Lawrence's account is to be believed; others including Michael Asher and Lawrence James argue that contemporary evidence suggests that Lawrence never went to Deraa at this time and that the story is invented.\nAnthony Quayle as Colonel Harry Brighton. Quayle, a veteran of military roles, was cast after Jack Hawkins, the original choice, was shifted to the part of Allenby. Quayle and Lean argued over how to portray the character, with Lean feeling Brighton to be an honourable character, while Quayle thought him an idiot. He is in essence a composite of all of the British officers who served in the Middle East with Lawrence, most notably Lieutenant Colonel S. F. Newcombe (in Michael Wilson's original script, the character was named Colonel Newcombe, before Robert Bolt changed it). Newcombe, like Brighton in the film, was Lawrence's predecessor as liaison to the Arab Revolt; he and many of his men were captured by the Turks in 1916 but he escaped. Brighton was created to represent how ordinary British soldiers would feel about a man like Lawrence: impressed by his accomplishments but repulsed by his affected manner.\nClaude Rains as Mr. Dryden. Like Sherif Ali and Colonel Brighton, Dryden was an amalgamation of several historical figures, primarily Ronald Storrs, a member of the Arab Bureau but also David Hogarth, an archaeologist friend of Lawrence; Henry McMahon, the High Commissioner of Egypt who negotiated the McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence which began the Arab Revolt and Mark Sykes, who helped draw up the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement which partitioned the post-war Middle East. Robert Bolt stated that the character was created to \"represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives\".\nArthur Kennedy as Jackson Bentley. In the early days of the production, when the Bentley character had a more prominent role, Kirk Douglas was considered for the part; Douglas expressed interest but demanded a star salary and the highest billing after O'Toole and thus was turned down by Spiegel. Later, Edmond O'Brien was cast in the part. O'Brien filmed the Jerusalem scene and (according to Omar Sharif) Bentley's political discussion with Ali but he suffered a heart attack on location and had to be replaced at the last moment by Kennedy, who was recommended to Lean by Anthony Quinn. The character was based on famed American journalist Lowell Thomas, whose reports helped make Lawrence famous. Thomas was a young man at the time who spent only weeks at most with Lawrence in the field, unlike Bentley, who is a middle-aged man present for all of Lawrence's later campaigns. Bentley was the narrator in Wilson's original script but Bolt reduced his role significantly in the final treatment.\nDonald Wolfit as General Archibald Murray. He releases Lawrence to Mr. Dryden.\nI. S. Johar as Gasim. Johar was a well-known Indian actor who occasionally appeared in international productions.\nGamil Ratib as Majid. Ratib was a veteran Egyptian actor. His English was not considered good enough, so he was dubbed by an uncredited Robert Rietti in the final edit.\nMichel Ray as Farraj. At the time, Ray was a rising Anglo-Brazilian actor who had appeared in several films, including Irving Rapper's The Brave One (1956) and Anthony Mann's The Tin Star (1957).\nJohn Dimech as Daud\nZia Mohyeddin as Tafas. Mohyeddin, one of Pakistan's best-known actors, played a character based on Lawrence's actual guide, Sheikh Obeid el-Rashid of the Hazimi branch of the Beni Salem, whom Lawrence referred to as Tafas several times in Seven Pillars.\nHoward Marion-Crawford as the medical officer. He was cast at the last minute during the filming of the Damascus scenes in Seville. The character was based on an officer mentioned in an incident in Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Lawrence's meeting the officer again while in British uniform was an invention of the script.\nJack Gwillim as the club secretary. Gwillim was recommended to Lean for the film by close friend Quayle.\nHugh Miller as the RAMC colonel.

Including cast and extras, over 1,000 people worked on the film. Members of the crew portrayed minor characters. First assistant director Roy Stevens played the truck driver who transports Lawrence and Farraj to the Cairo HQ at the end of Act I; the sergeant who stops Lawrence and Farraj (\"Where do you think you're going to, Mustapha?\") is construction assistant Fred Bennett and screenwriter Robert Bolt has a wordless cameo as one of the officers watching Allenby and Lawrence confer in the courtyard (he is smoking a pipe).

Little background is provided on the history of the region, the First World War and the Arab Revolt, probably because of Bolt's increased focus on Lawrence (Wilson's draft script had a broader, more politicised version of events). The second half of the film presents a fictional desertion of Lawrence's Arab army, almost to a man, as he moved farther north.\nThe film's timeline inaccurately depicts the chronology of the Arab Revolt and First World War, as well as the geography of the Hejaz region.

They wore British-style uniforms with keffiyehs and fought in conventional battles. The film makes no mention of the Sharifian Army and leaves the viewer with the impression that the Hashemite forces were composed exclusively of Bedouin irregulars.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The song cycle is set to poems\nby Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov, a relative of the composer. \nMussorgsky chose six unpublished poems for the cycle by Golenishchev-Kutuzov, whom he had recently met. These poems comprise a loose narrative that is nostalgic, surreal, and pessimistic, dwelling upon lost love, romantic rejection, and doubts from the protagonist's past, culminating in a contemplation of death. This narrative is believed to be in part autobiographical; musicologist Richard Taruskin characterized it as the voice of \"a neurotically self-absorbed, broken-down aristocrat.\" Scholars have speculated that this pessimism may have arisen from the poor reception of Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov, the death of Mussorgsky's friends Viktor Gartmann and Nadezhda Opochinina in 1873-74, tensions in Mussorgsky's relationship with Golenishchev-Kutuzov, and/or the class tensions of the decade. \nSunless was described by scholar Simon Perry as \"aesthetically and stylistically anomalous\" among Mussorgsky's work, makes use of symmetrical or \u201csynthetic\u201d chromaticism.The song cycle, like Boris Godunov, met a scathing reception, and Mussorgsky did not mention it in his autobiography.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50468", "text": "The individual song titles are as follows:\n\n\"\u0412 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0445\" (\"Within four walls\") \u2013 D major\n\"\u041c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u043f\u0435 \u0442\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430\" (\"Thou didst not know me in the crowd\") \u2013 D major\n\"\u041e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0448\u0443\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\" (\"The noisy festival day is ended\") \u2013 C major\n\"\u0421\u043a\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439\" (\"Boredom: For the album of a fashionable young lady\") \u2013 B minor\n\"\u042d\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f\" (\"Elegy\") \u2013 B minor, ending in F-sharp minor\n\"\u041d\u0430\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0439\" (\"By the River\") \u2013 C-sharp major", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50469", "text": "The piece was featured and discussed in the film-essay Sans Soleil by director Chris Marker, receiving an electronic experimental interpretation by composer Isao Tomita.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50468", "text": "The individual song titles are as follows:\n\n\"\u0412 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0445\" (\"Within four walls\") \u2013 D major\n\"\u041c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u043f\u0435 \u0442\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430\" (\"Thou didst not know me in the crowd\") \u2013 D major\n\"\u041e\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0435\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0448\u0443\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\" (\"The noisy festival day is ended\") \u2013 C major\n\"\u0421\u043a\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439\" (\"Boredom: For the album of a fashionable young lady\") \u2013 B minor\n\"\u042d\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0438\u044f\" (\"Elegy\") \u2013 B minor, ending in F-sharp minor\n\"\u041d\u0430\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0439\" (\"By the River\") \u2013 C-sharp major", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50469", "text": "The piece was featured and discussed in the film-essay Sans Soleil by director Chris Marker, receiving an electronic experimental interpretation by composer Isao Tomita.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was composed during the reign of caudillo Franco in Spain and is a call for unity of action to achieve freedom.

Later, a Belarusian language adaptation of the Polish version became a symbol of the 2020 Belarusian protests.Lakadjina and Yasser Jeradi made a version of the song that became the anthem of the Tunisian Revolution in 2011.L'Estaca is also an anthem for the supporters of the rugby team USAP, of Perpignan in Northern Catalonia, in France.\nThe song was covered in Yiddish (under the title \"Der Yokh\") by the American klezmer band, The Klezmatics, in their 2016 album Apikorsim.\nThe song was also sung in Bilbao in Basque on September 16, 2017 in support of Catalonia's Referendum on Independence scheduled for October 1, 2017 before a crowd of 32,000.In October 2020, as part of a protest movement against the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, L'Estaca was translated to Hebrew and performed by the artistic narrator and radio broadcaster Benny Hendel.

A sort of dedication can be recognized in Paganini's own score, where he annotated between 1832 and 1840 the following 'dedicatee' for each Caprice (possibly ready for a new printed edition): 1: Henri Vieuxtemps; 2: Giuseppe Austri; 3: Ernesto Camillo Sivori; 4: Ole Bornemann Bull; 5: Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst; 6: Karol J\u00f3zef Lipi\u0144ski; 7: Franz Liszt; 8: Delphin Alard; 9: Herrmann; 10: Theodor Haumann; 11: Sigismond Thalberg; 12: Dhuler; 13: Charles Philippe Lafont; 14: Jacques Pierre Rode; 15: Louis Spohr; 16: Rodolphe Kreutzer; 17: Alexandre Art\u00f4t; 18: Antoine Bohrer; 19: Andreas Jakob Romberg; 20: Carlo Bignami; 21: Antonio Bazzini; 22: Luigi Alliani; 23: [no name]; 24: Nicol\u00f2 Paganini, sepolto pur troppo (to my self, regrettably buried).\nFerdinand David's first edition was published by Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel in 1854. David, as editor, also issued an edition of Caprices with piano accompaniments by Robert Schumann. Another edition by David was issued in two books of 12 caprices each \"mit hinzugef\u00fcgter Begleitung des Pianoforte von Ferdinand David\" (with additional piano accompaniment by Ferdinand David) and published by Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel (c. 1860).Unlike many earlier and later sets of 24 pieces, there was no intention to write these caprices in 24 different keys.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50513", "text": "Critical edition by Franco Gulli (Ed.

He grows to like the party's ideology. Anandan marries Pushpavalli, while Tamizhselvan marries Maragatham, from their respective villages. When the two return to Madras, Anandan's film has been cancelled due to financial difficulties. In a few months, Tamizhselvan's party becomes the main opposition party. Anandan is reduced to playing minor roles. He sends Pushpavalli back to their village and considers joining the army. A few days later, Pushpavalli dies from illness and Tamizhselvan consoles a despondent Anandan.\nWeeks later, Anandan's fortunes return, and he is again offered the part of the protagonist. He convinces the director to hire Tamizhselvan as screenwriter. The film receives tremendous response upon release. Anandan becomes a celebrity and a major star in Tamil Cinema within a few years. During the next elections, Tamizhselvan encourages Anandan to use his popularity to help their party attract more attention. Anandan marries fellow actress Ramani who was being tortured by her own family. Five years later, Ayya Veluthambi asks Anandan to contest in the upcoming elections, much to the displeasure of Tamizhselvan, who thinks other, more devoted workers deserve candidacy.\nAnandan is shot in neck by a prop gun while filming a scene, but the party sweeps elections, with 152 seats out of 234. Ayya Veluthambi refuses to become chief minister. He asks Anandan and another leader, Madhivannan, to decide who should be given the post. Tamizhselvan is resentful that Veluthambi did not involve him, but is chosen to be the chief minister of Tamil Nadu with Anandan's wholehearted support. Anandan later asks to be made the health minister, but Tamizhselvan refuses, on the pretext that the executive committee forbids ministers to continue acting while in office. He offers Anandan any portfolio of his choice on the condition that he suspend his acting career. Anandan does not take it up.\nSenthamarai, who had admired Tamizhselvan's daring protests, moves in with him when he writes her a poetic letter and has a daughter with him. Anandan's co-star in his new film is Kalpana who resembles his late wife. While initially distant, Kalpana's chattiness draws Anandan to her. But still married to Ramani, his indecision about another marriage, angers Kalpana because of which she leaves him.\nIn a memorial function on Ayya Veluthambi's death, Anandan claims party's corruption in governance was the cause of death of the former. Anandan's expulsion by Tamizhselvan splits the party, with several members creating a new one under Anandan's leadership.\nAnandan uses next 4 years for his popular films to highlight corruption in Tamizhselvan's government and storms to power in the next election with 145/234 seats. But his governance turns out to be no different. Tamizhselvan's eloquent diatribes against misgovernance spark protests and Anandan orders his arrest with a heavy heart. Meanwhile, Anandan sees Kalpana at a disaster relief site and asks her to be brought. The car bringing her meets an accident and Kalpana dies.\nAnandan is distraught over Kalpana's death. At the wedding of Ayya Veluthambi's granddaughter, a visibly ailing Anandan meets Tamizhselvan. They share a handshake but hardly talk. The next morning, Ramani finds Anandan dead in his bed.

He convinces the director to hire Tamizhselvan as screenwriter. The film receives tremendous response upon release. Anandan becomes a celebrity and a major star in Tamil Cinema within a few years. During the next elections, Tamizhselvan encourages Anandan to use his popularity to help their party attract more attention. Anandan marries fellow actress Ramani who was being tortured by her own family. Five years later, Ayya Veluthambi asks Anandan to contest in the upcoming elections, much to the displeasure of Tamizhselvan, who thinks other, more devoted workers deserve candidacy.\nAnandan is shot in neck by a prop gun while filming a scene, but the party sweeps elections, with 152 seats out of 234. Ayya Veluthambi refuses to become chief minister. He asks Anandan and another leader, Madhivannan, to decide who should be given the post. Tamizhselvan is resentful that Veluthambi did not involve him, but is chosen to be the chief minister of Tamil Nadu with Anandan's wholehearted support. Anandan later asks to be made the health minister, but Tamizhselvan refuses, on the pretext that the executive committee forbids ministers to continue acting while in office. He offers Anandan any portfolio of his choice on the condition that he suspend his acting career. Anandan does not take it up.\nSenthamarai, who had admired Tamizhselvan's daring protests, moves in with him when he writes her a poetic letter and has a daughter with him. Anandan's co-star in his new film is Kalpana who resembles his late wife. While initially distant, Kalpana's chattiness draws Anandan to her. But still married to Ramani, his indecision about another marriage, angers Kalpana because of which she leaves him.\nIn a memorial function on Ayya Veluthambi's death, Anandan claims party's corruption in governance was the cause of death of the former. Anandan's expulsion by Tamizhselvan splits the party, with several members creating a new one under Anandan's leadership.\nAnandan uses next 4 years for his popular films to highlight corruption in Tamizhselvan's government and storms to power in the next election with 145/234 seats. But his governance turns out to be no different. Tamizhselvan's eloquent diatribes against misgovernance spark protests and Anandan orders his arrest with a heavy heart. Meanwhile, Anandan sees Kalpana at a disaster relief site and asks her to be brought. The car bringing her meets an accident and Kalpana dies.\nAnandan is distraught over Kalpana's death. At the wedding of Ayya Veluthambi's granddaughter, a visibly ailing Anandan meets Tamizhselvan. They share a handshake but hardly talk. The next morning, Ramani finds Anandan dead in his bed. Tamizhselvan, in an emotional monologue set in a place where the two had previously planned dominating the Tamil state, recites poetry mourning his death.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50529", "text": "The soundtrack was composed by A.

{"id": "86_195", "question": "Who composed Robert le diable?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_50554", "text": "Robert le diable (Robert the Devil) is an opera in five acts composed by Giacomo Meyerbeer between 1827 and 1831, to a libretto written in French by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe and Germain Delavigne. Robert le diable is regarded as one of the first grand operas at the Paris Op\u00e9ra.  It has only a superficial connection to the medieval legend of Robert the Devil.\nThe opera was immediately successful from its first night on 21 November 1831 at the Op\u00e9ra; the dramatic music, harmony and orchestration, its melodramatic plot, its star singers and its sensational stage effects compelled Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, who was in the audience, to say, \"If ever magnificence was seen in the theatre, I doubt that it reached the level of splendour shown in Robert...It is a masterpiece...Meyerbeer has made himself immortal\". Robert initiated the European fame of its composer, consolidated the fame of its librettist, Scribe, and launched the reputation of the new director of the Op\u00e9ra, Louis-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 V\u00e9ron, as a purveyor of a new genre of opera. It also had influence on development of the ballet, and was frequently mentioned and discussed in contemporary French literature.\nRobert continued as a favourite in opera houses all over the world throughout the nineteenth century. After a period of neglect, it began to be revived towards the end of the twentieth century.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50555", "text": "Giacomo Meyerbeer's early studies had been in Germany, but from 1816 to 1825 he worked in Italy. There he studied opera, then dominated by Gioachino Rossini, and wrote his own Italian operas, which were moderately successful and also had some performances in other European countries. The success of Il crociato in Egitto (1824) throughout Europe, including at Paris in 1825, persuaded Meyerbeer, who was already thirty-three years old, to fulfil at last his ambition to base himself in Paris and to seek a suitable libretto for an opera to be launched there.Meyerbeer first mentions Robert le diable in his diaries in February 1827. The Journal de Paris announced on 19 April 1827 that the libretto of Scribe and Delavigne had been passed by the censor and that 'the music is to be entrusted to a composer, M. Meyer-Beer, who, having acquired a brilliant reputation in Germany and Italy, is extending it to our country, where several of his works have been already successfully represented.'The libretto was fabricated on the basis of old legends about Duke Robert the Magnificent of Normandy, the father of William the Conqueror, alleged in some versions to have been the son of the Devil. The librettists padded out this outline with a variety of melodramatic incidents. The plot reflected 'the fantastic legendary elements which fascinated the opera public of 1830', a taste which had evolved from the 1824 Paris production of Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freisch\u00fctz (in its French version Robin des bois), which also features a doubtful hero befriended by a demon promising him success.The libretto was originally planned as a three-act op\u00e9ra comique for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique theatre. Meyerbeer stopped work on the opera in 1827 when the theatre underwent financial difficulties. In August 1829, the composer and librettists agreed to refashion the work in a five-act form to meet the requirements of the Paris Op\u00e9ra. This entailed some significant rewriting of the storyline, reducing the essentially comic role of Raimbaut (who vanishes after Act 3 in the final version, but whose antics \u2013 including the spending of Bertram's money \u2013 continued throughout in the earlier libretto). It also meant that the traditional 'pairing' of lovers in op\u00e9ra comique (Robert/Isabelle paralleled throughout by the 'lower-class' Raimbaut/Alice) was swept aside in favour of concentration on the more sensational story-line of Robert's diabolic ancestry.The contract for the opera, specifying it as a \"grand opera in five acts and seven scenes\", was signed by the then director of the Op\u00e9ra, \u00c9mile Lubbert, on 29 December 1829.

There he studied opera, then dominated by Gioachino Rossini, and wrote his own Italian operas, which were moderately successful and also had some performances in other European countries. The success of Il crociato in Egitto (1824) throughout Europe, including at Paris in 1825, persuaded Meyerbeer, who was already thirty-three years old, to fulfil at last his ambition to base himself in Paris and to seek a suitable libretto for an opera to be launched there.Meyerbeer first mentions Robert le diable in his diaries in February 1827. The Journal de Paris announced on 19 April 1827 that the libretto of Scribe and Delavigne had been passed by the censor and that 'the music is to be entrusted to a composer, M. Meyer-Beer, who, having acquired a brilliant reputation in Germany and Italy, is extending it to our country, where several of his works have been already successfully represented.'The libretto was fabricated on the basis of old legends about Duke Robert the Magnificent of Normandy, the father of William the Conqueror, alleged in some versions to have been the son of the Devil. The librettists padded out this outline with a variety of melodramatic incidents. The plot reflected 'the fantastic legendary elements which fascinated the opera public of 1830', a taste which had evolved from the 1824 Paris production of Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freisch\u00fctz (in its French version Robin des bois), which also features a doubtful hero befriended by a demon promising him success.The libretto was originally planned as a three-act op\u00e9ra comique for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique theatre. Meyerbeer stopped work on the opera in 1827 when the theatre underwent financial difficulties. In August 1829, the composer and librettists agreed to refashion the work in a five-act form to meet the requirements of the Paris Op\u00e9ra. This entailed some significant rewriting of the storyline, reducing the essentially comic role of Raimbaut (who vanishes after Act 3 in the final version, but whose antics \u2013 including the spending of Bertram's money \u2013 continued throughout in the earlier libretto). It also meant that the traditional 'pairing' of lovers in op\u00e9ra comique (Robert/Isabelle paralleled throughout by the 'lower-class' Raimbaut/Alice) was swept aside in favour of concentration on the more sensational story-line of Robert's diabolic ancestry.The contract for the opera, specifying it as a \"grand opera in five acts and seven scenes\", was signed by the then director of the Op\u00e9ra, \u00c9mile Lubbert, on 29 December 1829. Meyerbeer completed the composition of the work in Spa, Belgium in June and July 1830.

The opera was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1639\u20131640 carnival season. The story, taken from the second half of Homer's Odyssey, tells how constancy and virtue are ultimately rewarded, treachery and deception overcome. After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to his kingdom where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope. With the assistance of the gods, his son Telemaco and a staunch friend Eumete, Ulisse vanquishes the suitors and recovers his kingdom.\nIl ritorno is the first of three full-length works which Monteverdi wrote for the burgeoning Venetian opera industry during the last five years of his life. After its initial successful run in Venice the opera was performed in Bologna before returning to Venice for the 1640\u201341 season. Thereafter, except for a possible performance at the Imperial court in Vienna late in the 17th century, there were no further revivals until the 20th century. The music became known in modern times through the 19th-century discovery of an incomplete manuscript score which in many respects is inconsistent with the surviving versions of the libretto. After its publication in 1922 the score's authenticity was widely questioned, and performances of the opera remained rare during the next 30 years. By the 1950s the work was generally accepted as Monteverdi's, and after revivals in Vienna and Glyndebourne in the early 1970s it became increasingly popular. It has since been performed in opera houses all over the world, and has been recorded many times.\nTogether with Monteverdi's other Venetian stage works, Il ritorno is classified as one of the first modern operas. Its music, while showing the influence of earlier works, also demonstrates Monteverdi's development as a composer of opera, through his use of fashionable forms such as arioso, duet and ensemble alongside the older-style recitative. By using a variety of musical styles, Monteverdi is able to express the feelings and emotions of a great range of characters, divine and human, through their music. Il ritorno has been described as an \"ugly duckling\", and conversely as the most tender and moving of Monteverdi's surviving operas, one which although it might disappoint initially, will on subsequent hearings reveal a vocal style of extraordinary eloquence.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50571", "text": "Monteverdi was an established court composer in the service of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga in Mantua when he wrote his first operas, L'Orfeo and L'Arianna, in the years 1606\u201308. After falling out with Vincenzo's successor, Duke Francesco Gonzaga, Monteverdi moved to Venice in 1613 and became director of music at St Mark's Basilica, a position he held for the rest of his life. Alongside his steady output of madrigals and church music, Monteverdi continued to compose works for the stage, though not actual operas. He wrote several ballets and, for the Venice carnival of 1624\u201325, Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda (\"The Battle of Tancred and Clorinda\"), a hybrid work with some characteristics of ballet, opera and oratorio.\nIn 1637 fully-fledged opera came to Venice with the opening of the Teatro San Cassiano.

The work is generally regarded as a major contribution towards the development of Czech music. It was composed during the period 1863 to 1866, and first performed at the Provisional Theatre, Prague, on 30 May 1866 in a two-act format with spoken dialogue. Set in a country village and with realistic characters, it tells the story of how, after a late surprise revelation, true love prevails over the combined efforts of ambitious parents and a scheming marriage broker.\nThe opera was not immediately successful, and was revised and extended in the following four years. In its final version, premiered in 1870, it rapidly gained popularity and eventually became a worldwide success. Until this time, the Czech national opera had only been represented by minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana's second, was part of his quest to create a truly Czech operatic genre. Smetana's musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms, such as the polka and furiant, and, although he largely avoided the direct quotation of folksong, he nevertheless created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech in spirit. The overture, often played as a concert piece independently from the opera, was, unusually, composed before almost any of the other music had been written. \nAfter a performance at the Vienna Music and Theatre Exhibition of 1892, the opera achieved international recognition. It was performed in Chicago in 1893, London in 1895 and reached New York in 1909, subsequently becoming the first, and for many years the only, Czech opera in the general repertory. Many of these early international performances were in German, under the title Die verkaufte Braut, and the German-language version continues to be played and recorded.

His failure to achieve wider recognition in the Bohemian capital led him to depart in 1856 for Sweden, where he spent the next five years. During this period he extended his compositional range to large-scale orchestral works in the descriptive style championed by Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. Liszt was Smetana's long-time mentor; he had accepted a dedication of the latter's Opus 1: Six Characteristic Pieces for Piano in 1848, and had encouraged the younger composer's career since then. In September 1857 Smetana visited Liszt in Weimar, where he met Peter Cornelius, a follower of Liszt's who was working on a comic opera, Der Barbier von Bagdad. Their discussions centred on the need to create a modern style of comic opera, as a counterbalance to Wagner's new form of music drama. A comment was made by the Viennese conductor Johann von Herbeck to the effect that Czechs were incapable of making music of their own, a remark which Smetana took to heart: \"I swore there and then that no other than I should beget a native Czech music.\"Smetana did not act immediately on this aspiration. The announcement that a Provisional Theatre was to be opened in Prague, as a home for Czech opera and drama pending the building of a permanent National Theatre, influenced his decision to return permanently to his homeland in 1861. He was then spurred to creative action by the announcement of a prize competition, sponsored by the Czech patriot Jan von Harrach, to provide suitable operas for the Provisional Theatre. By 1863 he had written The Brandenburgers in Bohemia to a libretto by the Czech nationalist poet Karel Sabina, whom Smetana had met briefly in 1848. The Brandenburgers, which was awarded the opera prize, was a serious historical drama, but even before its completion Smetana was noting down themes for use in a future comic opera. By this time he had heard the music of Cornelius's Der Barbier, and was ready to try his own hand at the comic genre.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50580", "text": "Although much of the music of The Bartered Bride is folk-like, the only significant use of authentic folk material is in the act 2 furiant, with a few other occasional glimpses of basic Czech folk melodies. The \"Czechness\" of the music is further illustrated by the closeness to Czech dance rhythms of many individual numbers. Smetana's diary indicates that he was trying to give the music \"a popular character, because the plot [...] is taken from village life and demands a national treatment.\" According to his biographer John Clapham, Smetana \"certainly felt the pulse of the peasantry and knew how to express this in music, yet inevitably he added something of himself.\" Historian Harold Schonberg argues that \"the exoticisms of the Bohemian musical language were not in the Western musical consciousness until Smetana appeared.\" Smetana's musical language is, on the whole, one of happiness, expressing joy, dancing and festivals.\n\nThe mood of the entire opera is set by the overture, a concert piece in its own right, which Tyrrell describes as \"a tour de force of the genre, wonderfully spirited & wonderfully crafted.\" Tyrrell draws attention to several of its striking features \u2013 its extended string fugato, climactic tutti and prominent syncopations. The overture does not contain many of the opera's later themes: biographer Brian Large compares it to Mozart's overtures to The Marriage of Figaro and The Magic Flute, in establishing a general mood. It is followed immediately by an extended orchestral prelude, for which Smetana adapted part of his 1849 piano work Wedding Scenes, adding special effects such as bagpipe imitations.Schonberg has suggested that Bohemian composers express melancholy in a delicate, elegiac manner \"without the crushing world-weariness and pessimism of the Russians.\" Thus, Ma\u0159enka's unhappiness is illustrated in the opening chorus by a brief switch to the minor key; likewise, the inherent pathos of Va\u0161ek's character is demonstrated by the dark minor key music of his act 3 solo. Smetana also uses the technique of musical reminiscence, where particular themes are used as reminders of other parts of the action; the lilting clarinet theme of \"faithful love\" is an example, though it and other instances fall short of being full-blown Wagnerian leading themes or Leitmotifs.Large has commented that despite the colour and vigour of the music, there is little by way of characterisation, except in the cases of Kecal and, to a lesser extent, the loving pair and the unfortunate Va\u0161ek. The two sets of parents and the various circus folk are all conventional and \"penny-plain\" figures. In contrast, Kecal's character \u2013 that of a self-important, pig-headed, loquacious bungler \u2013 is instantly established by his rapid-patter music. Large suggests that the character may have been modelled on that of the boastful Baron in Cimarosa's opera Il matrimonio segreto. Ma\u0159enka's temperament is shown in vocal flourishes which include coloratura passages and sustained high notes, while Jen\u00edk's good nature is reflected in the warmth of his music, generally in the G minor key. For Va\u0161ek's dual image, comic and pathetic, Smetana uses the major key to depict comedy, the minor for sorrow. Large suggests that Va\u0161ek's musical stammer, portrayed especially in his opening act 2 song, was taken from Mozart's character Don Curzio in The Marriage of Figaro.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50579", "text": "Until the middle 1850s Bed\u0159ich Smetana was known in Prague principally as a teacher, pianist and composer of salon pieces.

A comment was made by the Viennese conductor Johann von Herbeck to the effect that Czechs were incapable of making music of their own, a remark which Smetana took to heart: \"I swore there and then that no other than I should beget a native Czech music.\"Smetana did not act immediately on this aspiration. The announcement that a Provisional Theatre was to be opened in Prague, as a home for Czech opera and drama pending the building of a permanent National Theatre, influenced his decision to return permanently to his homeland in 1861. He was then spurred to creative action by the announcement of a prize competition, sponsored by the Czech patriot Jan von Harrach, to provide suitable operas for the Provisional Theatre. By 1863 he had written The Brandenburgers in Bohemia to a libretto by the Czech nationalist poet Karel Sabina, whom Smetana had met briefly in 1848. The Brandenburgers, which was awarded the opera prize, was a serious historical drama, but even before its completion Smetana was noting down themes for use in a future comic opera. By this time he had heard the music of Cornelius's Der Barbier, and was ready to try his own hand at the comic genre.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50580", "text": "Although much of the music of The Bartered Bride is folk-like, the only significant use of authentic folk material is in the act 2 furiant, with a few other occasional glimpses of basic Czech folk melodies. The \"Czechness\" of the music is further illustrated by the closeness to Czech dance rhythms of many individual numbers. Smetana's diary indicates that he was trying to give the music \"a popular character, because the plot [...] is taken from village life and demands a national treatment.\" According to his biographer John Clapham, Smetana \"certainly felt the pulse of the peasantry and knew how to express this in music, yet inevitably he added something of himself.\" Historian Harold Schonberg argues that \"the exoticisms of the Bohemian musical language were not in the Western musical consciousness until Smetana appeared.\" Smetana's musical language is, on the whole, one of happiness, expressing joy, dancing and festivals.\n\nThe mood of the entire opera is set by the overture, a concert piece in its own right, which Tyrrell describes as \"a tour de force of the genre, wonderfully spirited & wonderfully crafted.\" Tyrrell draws attention to several of its striking features \u2013 its extended string fugato, climactic tutti and prominent syncopations. The overture does not contain many of the opera's later themes: biographer Brian Large compares it to Mozart's overtures to The Marriage of Figaro and The Magic Flute, in establishing a general mood. It is followed immediately by an extended orchestral prelude, for which Smetana adapted part of his 1849 piano work Wedding Scenes, adding special effects such as bagpipe imitations.Schonberg has suggested that Bohemian composers express melancholy in a delicate, elegiac manner \"without the crushing world-weariness and pessimism of the Russians.\" Thus, Ma\u0159enka's unhappiness is illustrated in the opening chorus by a brief switch to the minor key; likewise, the inherent pathos of Va\u0161ek's character is demonstrated by the dark minor key music of his act 3 solo. Smetana also uses the technique of musical reminiscence, where particular themes are used as reminders of other parts of the action; the lilting clarinet theme of \"faithful love\" is an example, though it and other instances fall short of being full-blown Wagnerian leading themes or Leitmotifs.Large has commented that despite the colour and vigour of the music, there is little by way of characterisation, except in the cases of Kecal and, to a lesser extent, the loving pair and the unfortunate Va\u0161ek. The two sets of parents and the various circus folk are all conventional and \"penny-plain\" figures. In contrast, Kecal's character \u2013 that of a self-important, pig-headed, loquacious bungler \u2013 is instantly established by his rapid-patter music. Large suggests that the character may have been modelled on that of the boastful Baron in Cimarosa's opera Il matrimonio segreto. Ma\u0159enka's temperament is shown in vocal flourishes which include coloratura passages and sustained high notes, while Jen\u00edk's good nature is reflected in the warmth of his music, generally in the G minor key. For Va\u0161ek's dual image, comic and pathetic, Smetana uses the major key to depict comedy, the minor for sorrow. Large suggests that Va\u0161ek's musical stammer, portrayed especially in his opening act 2 song, was taken from Mozart's character Don Curzio in The Marriage of Figaro.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The musical has had several Broadway and London revivals, as well as a 1955 film adaptation starring Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, and Vivian Blaine.\nIn 1998, Vivian Blaine, Sam Levene, Robert Alda and Isabel Bigley, along with the original Broadway cast of the 1950 Decca cast album, were \ninducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50606", "text": "Guys and Dolls was conceived by producers Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin as an adaptation of Damon Runyon's short stories. These stories, written in the 1920s and 1930s, concerned gangsters, gamblers, and other characters of the New York underworld. Runyon was known for the unique comic dialect he employed in his stories; mixing highly formal language, without contractions, and colorful slang. Frank Loesser, who had spent most of his career as a lyricist for movie musicals, was hired as composer and lyricist. George S. Kaufman was hired as director. When the first version of the show's book, or dialogue, written by Jo Swerling was deemed unusable, Feuer and Martin asked radio comedy writer Abe Burrows to rewrite it.Loesser had already written much of the score to correspond with the first version of the book. Burrows later recalled:\n\nFrank Loesser's fourteen songs were all great, and the [new book] had to be written so that the story would lead into each of them. Later on, the critics spoke of the show as 'integrated'. The word integration usually means that the composer has written songs that follow the story line gracefully. Well, we accomplished that but we did it in reverse.\nAbe Burrows specifically crafted the role of Nathan Detroit around Sam Levene who signed for the project long before Burrows wrote a single word of dialogue, a similar break Burrows said he had when he later wrote Cactus Flower for Lauren Bacall. In \u201cHonest, Abe: Is There Really No Business Like Show Business?\u201d, Burrows recalls \"I had the sound of their voices in my head. I knew the rhythm of their speech and it helped make the dialogue sharper and more real\". Although Broadway and movie veteran Sam Levene was not a singer, it was agreed he was otherwise perfect as Nathan Detroit; indeed, Levene was one of Runyon's favorite actors. Frank Loesser agreed it was easier adjusting the music to Levene's limitations than substituting a better singer who couldn't act. Levene's lack of singing ability is the reason the lead role of Nathan Detroit only has one song, the duet \"Sue Me\".\nComposer and lyricist Frank Loesser specifically wrote \"Sue Me\" for Sam Levene, and structured the song so he and Vivian Blaine never sang their showstopping duet together. The son of a cantor, Sam Levene was fluent in Yiddish: \"Alright, already, I'm just a no-goodnick; alright, already, it\u2019s true, so nu?

These stories, written in the 1920s and 1930s, concerned gangsters, gamblers, and other characters of the New York underworld. Runyon was known for the unique comic dialect he employed in his stories; mixing highly formal language, without contractions, and colorful slang. Frank Loesser, who had spent most of his career as a lyricist for movie musicals, was hired as composer and lyricist. George S. Kaufman was hired as director. When the first version of the show's book, or dialogue, written by Jo Swerling was deemed unusable, Feuer and Martin asked radio comedy writer Abe Burrows to rewrite it.Loesser had already written much of the score to correspond with the first version of the book. Burrows later recalled:\n\nFrank Loesser's fourteen songs were all great, and the [new book] had to be written so that the story would lead into each of them. Later on, the critics spoke of the show as 'integrated'. The word integration usually means that the composer has written songs that follow the story line gracefully. Well, we accomplished that but we did it in reverse.\nAbe Burrows specifically crafted the role of Nathan Detroit around Sam Levene who signed for the project long before Burrows wrote a single word of dialogue, a similar break Burrows said he had when he later wrote Cactus Flower for Lauren Bacall. In \u201cHonest, Abe: Is There Really No Business Like Show Business?\u201d, Burrows recalls \"I had the sound of their voices in my head. I knew the rhythm of their speech and it helped make the dialogue sharper and more real\". Although Broadway and movie veteran Sam Levene was not a singer, it was agreed he was otherwise perfect as Nathan Detroit; indeed, Levene was one of Runyon's favorite actors. Frank Loesser agreed it was easier adjusting the music to Levene's limitations than substituting a better singer who couldn't act. Levene's lack of singing ability is the reason the lead role of Nathan Detroit only has one song, the duet \"Sue Me\".\nComposer and lyricist Frank Loesser specifically wrote \"Sue Me\" for Sam Levene, and structured the song so he and Vivian Blaine never sang their showstopping duet together. The son of a cantor, Sam Levene was fluent in Yiddish: \"Alright, already, I'm just a no-goodnick; alright, already, it\u2019s true, so nu?

It was first performed as a two-act \"op\u00e9ra bouffon\" at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes-Parisiens, Paris, on 21 October 1858, and was extensively revised and expanded in a four-act \"op\u00e9ra f\u00e9erie\" version, presented at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9, Paris, on 7 February 1874.\nThe opera is a lampoon of the ancient legend of Orpheus and Eurydice. In this version Orpheus is not the son of Apollo but a rustic violin teacher. He is glad to be rid of his wife, Eurydice, when she is abducted by the god of the underworld, Pluto. Orpheus has to be bullied by Public Opinion into trying to rescue Eurydice. The reprehensible conduct of the gods of Olympus in the opera was widely seen as a veiled satire of the court and government of Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Some critics expressed outrage at the librettists' disrespect for classic mythology and the composer's parody of Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice; others praised the piece highly.\nOrph\u00e9e aux enfers was Offenbach's first full-length opera. The original 1858 production became a box-office success, and ran well into the following year, rescuing Offenbach and his Bouffes company from financial difficulty. The 1874 revival broke records at the Ga\u00eet\u00e9's box-office. The work was frequently staged in France and internationally during the composer's lifetime and throughout the 20th century. It is one of his most often performed operas, and continues to be revived in the 21st century.\nIn the last decade of the 19th century the Paris cabarets the Moulin Rouge and Folies Berg\u00e8re adopted the music of the \"Galop infernal\" from the culminating scene of the opera to accompany the can-can, and ever since then the tune has been popularly associated with the dance.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50629", "text": "Between 1855 and 1858 Offenbach presented more than two dozen one-act operettas, first at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Lacaze, and then at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Choiseul. The theatrical licensing laws then permitted him only four singers in any piece, and with such small casts, full-length works were out of the question. In 1858 the licensing restrictions were relaxed, and Offenbach was free to go ahead with a two-act work that had been in his mind for some time. Two years earlier he had told his friend the writer Hector Cr\u00e9mieux that when he was musical director of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in the early 1850s he swore revenge for the boredom he suffered from the posturings of mythical heroes and gods of Olympus in the plays presented there. Cremieux and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy sketched out a libretto for him lampooning such characters. By 1858, when Offenbach was finally allowed a large enough cast to do the theme justice, Hal\u00e9vy was preoccupied with his work as a senior civil servant, and the final libretto was credited to Cr\u00e9mieux alone. Most of the roles were written with popular members of the Bouffes company in mind, including D\u00e9sir\u00e9, L\u00e9once, Lise Tautin, and Henri Tayau as an Orph\u00e9e who could actually play Orpheus's violin.\nThe first performance took place at the Salle Choiseul on 21 October 1858. At first the piece did reasonably well at the box-office but was not the tremendous success Offenbach had hoped for. He insisted on lavish stagings for his operas: expenses were apt to outrun receipts, and he was in need of a substantial money-spinner. Business received an inadvertent boost from the critic Jules Janin of the Journal des d\u00e9bats. He had praised earlier productions at the Bouffes-Parisiens but was roused to vehement indignation at what he maintained was a blasphemous, lascivious outrage \u2013 \"a profanation of holy and glorious antiquity\". His attack, and the irreverent public ripostes by Cr\u00e9mieux and Offenbach, made headlines and provoked huge interest in the piece among the Parisian public, who flocked to see it. In his 1980 study of Offenbach, Alexander Faris writes, \"Orph\u00e9e became not only a triumph, but a cult.\" It ran for 228 performances, at a time when a run of 100 nights was considered a success. Albert Lasalle, in his history of the Bouffes-Parisiens (1860), wrote that the piece closed in June 1859 \u2013 although it was still performing strongly at the box-office \u2013 \"because the actors, who could not tire the public, were themselves exhausted\".In 1874 Offenbach substantially expanded the piece, doubling the length of the score and turning the intimate op\u00e9ra bouffon of 1858 into a four-act op\u00e9ra f\u00e9erie extravaganza, with substantial ballet sequences. This version opened at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9 on 7 February 1874, ran for 290 performances, and broke box-office records for that theatre. During the first run of the revised version Offenbach expanded it even further, adding ballets illustrating the kingdom of Neptune in Act 3 and bringing the total number of scenes in the four acts to twenty-two.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50630", "text": "The score of the opera, which formed the pattern for the many full-length Offenbach operas that followed, is described by Faris as having an \"abundance of couplets\" (songs with repeated verses for one or more singers), \"a variety of other solos and duets, several big choruses, and two extended finales\". Offenbach wrote in a variety of styles \u2013 from Rococo pastoral vein, via pastiche of Italian opera, to the uproarious galop \u2013 displaying, in Faris's analysis, many of his personal hallmarks, such as melodies that \"leap backwards and forwards in a remarkably acrobatic manner while still sounding not only smoothly lyrical, but spontaneous as well\". In such up-tempo numbers as the \"Galop infernal\", Offenbach makes a virtue of simplicity, often keeping to the same key through most of the number, with largely unvarying instrumentation throughout. Elsewhere in the score Offenbach gives the orchestra greater prominence. In the \"duo de la mouche\" Jupiter's part, consisting of buzzing like a fly, is accompanied by the first and second violins playing sul ponticello, to produce a similarly buzzing sound. In Le Figaro, Gustave Lafargue remarked that Offenbach's use of a piccolo trill punctuated by a tap on a cymbal in the finale of the first scene was a modern recreation of an effect invented by Gluck in his score of Iphig\u00e9nie en Aulide. Wilfrid Mellers also remarks on Offenbach's use of the piccolo to enhance Eurydice's couplets with \"girlish giggles\" on the instrument.

Faris instances three numbers from the second act (1858 version), which all are in the key of A major and use identical notes in almost the same order, \"but it would be hard to imagine a more extreme difference in feeling than that between the song of the King of the Boeotians and the Galop\". In a 2014 study Heather Hadlock comments that for the former, Offenbach composed \"a languid yet restless melody\" over a static musette-style drone-bass accompaniment of alternating dominant and tonic harmonies, simultaneously evoking and mocking nostalgia for a lost place and time and \"creating a perpetually unresolved tension between pathos and irony\". Mellers finds that Styx's aria has \"a pathos that touches the heart\" \u2013 perhaps, he suggests, the only instance of true feeling in the opera.In 1999 Thomas Schipperges wrote in the International Journal of Musicology that many scholars hold that Offenbach's music defies all musicological methods. He did not agree, and analysed the \"Galop infernal\", finding it to be sophisticated in many details: \"For all its straightforwardness, it reveals a calculated design. The overall 'economy' of the piece serves a deliberate musical dramaturgy.\"  Hadlock observes that although the best-known music in the opera is \"driven by the propulsive energies of Rossinian comedy\" and the up-tempo galop, such lively numbers go side by side with statelier music in an 18th-century vein: \"The score's sophistication results from Offenbach's intertwining of contemporary urban musical language with a restrained and wistful tone that is undermined and ironized without ever being entirely undone\".Orph\u00e9e aux enfers was the first of Offenbach's major works to have a chorus. In a 2017 study Melissa Cummins comments that although the composer used the chorus extensively as Pluton's minions, bored residents of Olympus, and bacchantes in Hades, they are merely there to fill out the vocal parts in the large ensemble numbers, and \"are treated as a nameless, faceless crowd who just happen to be around.\" In the Olympus scene the chorus has an unusual bocca chiusa section, marked \"Bouche ferm\u00e9e\", an effect later used by Bizet in Djamileh and Puccini in the \"Humming Chorus\" in Madama Butterfly.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50629", "text": "Between 1855 and 1858 Offenbach presented more than two dozen one-act operettas, first at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Lacaze, and then at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Choiseul. The theatrical licensing laws then permitted him only four singers in any piece, and with such small casts, full-length works were out of the question. In 1858 the licensing restrictions were relaxed, and Offenbach was free to go ahead with a two-act work that had been in his mind for some time. Two years earlier he had told his friend the writer Hector Cr\u00e9mieux that when he was musical director of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in the early 1850s he swore revenge for the boredom he suffered from the posturings of mythical heroes and gods of Olympus in the plays presented there. Cremieux and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy sketched out a libretto for him lampooning such characters. By 1858, when Offenbach was finally allowed a large enough cast to do the theme justice, Hal\u00e9vy was preoccupied with his work as a senior civil servant, and the final libretto was credited to Cr\u00e9mieux alone. Most of the roles were written with popular members of the Bouffes company in mind, including D\u00e9sir\u00e9, L\u00e9once, Lise Tautin, and Henri Tayau as an Orph\u00e9e who could actually play Orpheus's violin.\nThe first performance took place at the Salle Choiseul on 21 October 1858. At first the piece did reasonably well at the box-office but was not the tremendous success Offenbach had hoped for. He insisted on lavish stagings for his operas: expenses were apt to outrun receipts, and he was in need of a substantial money-spinner. Business received an inadvertent boost from the critic Jules Janin of the Journal des d\u00e9bats. He had praised earlier productions at the Bouffes-Parisiens but was roused to vehement indignation at what he maintained was a blasphemous, lascivious outrage \u2013 \"a profanation of holy and glorious antiquity\". His attack, and the irreverent public ripostes by Cr\u00e9mieux and Offenbach, made headlines and provoked huge interest in the piece among the Parisian public, who flocked to see it. In his 1980 study of Offenbach, Alexander Faris writes, \"Orph\u00e9e became not only a triumph, but a cult.\" It ran for 228 performances, at a time when a run of 100 nights was considered a success. Albert Lasalle, in his history of the Bouffes-Parisiens (1860), wrote that the piece closed in June 1859 \u2013 although it was still performing strongly at the box-office \u2013 \"because the actors, who could not tire the public, were themselves exhausted\".In 1874 Offenbach substantially expanded the piece, doubling the length of the score and turning the intimate op\u00e9ra bouffon of 1858 into a four-act op\u00e9ra f\u00e9erie extravaganza, with substantial ballet sequences. This version opened at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9 on 7 February 1874, ran for 290 performances, and broke box-office records for that theatre. During the first run of the revised version Offenbach expanded it even further, adding ballets illustrating the kingdom of Neptune in Act 3 and bringing the total number of scenes in the four acts to twenty-two.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50630", "text": "The score of the opera, which formed the pattern for the many full-length Offenbach operas that followed, is described by Faris as having an \"abundance of couplets\" (songs with repeated verses for one or more singers), \"a variety of other solos and duets, several big choruses, and two extended finales\". Offenbach wrote in a variety of styles \u2013 from Rococo pastoral vein, via pastiche of Italian opera, to the uproarious galop \u2013 displaying, in Faris's analysis, many of his personal hallmarks, such as melodies that \"leap backwards and forwards in a remarkably acrobatic manner while still sounding not only smoothly lyrical, but spontaneous as well\". In such up-tempo numbers as the \"Galop infernal\", Offenbach makes a virtue of simplicity, often keeping to the same key through most of the number, with largely unvarying instrumentation throughout. Elsewhere in the score Offenbach gives the orchestra greater prominence. In the \"duo de la mouche\" Jupiter's part, consisting of buzzing like a fly, is accompanied by the first and second violins playing sul ponticello, to produce a similarly buzzing sound.

The lead female characters of the operas Anna Bolena, Maria Stuarda, and Roberto Devereux are often referred to as the \"Three Donizetti Queens\". The story is loosely based on the lives of Mary, Queen of Scots (Mary Stuart) and her cousin Queen Elizabeth I. Schiller had invented the confrontation of the two Queens, who in fact never met.After a series of problems surrounding its presentation in Naples after the final dress rehearsal \u2013 including having to be re-written for a totally different location, a different time period, and with Buondelmonte as its new title \u2013 Maria Stuarda as we know it today premiered on 30 December 1835 at La Scala in Milan.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50658", "text": "As musicologist and Donizetti expert William Ashbrook notes, in many respects the musical structure of the opera is fairly straightforward and follows many of the conventions of the day. For example, Elisabeth, Mary, and Leicester \"are each given a \"double-aria\" (a cantabile followed by a cabaletta) at their first appearances and Mary is also given one at the opera's end. However, the composer's strength lies in being able to tailor the framework to \"a specific set of dramatic circumstances\". Singled out is Maria's Oh nube! che lieve per l'aria t'aggiri (\"Oh cloud, that wanders light upon the breeze\") which appears in her entrance scene.Therefore, adapting to many of the conventions of 19th Century Italian opera, which had become the tradition before he began composing, Donizetti's work increasingly shows a shift to more dramatically complex musical forms, the aim of which is to enhance the often-dramatic confrontations between the characters in his operas. Ashbrook notes two of these conventions: the tradition of the soprano's aria di sortita (given upon her first appearance onstage) and the typical, often florid, aria which becomes the opera's finale. Therefore, in the case of the soprano's entrance aria, Ashbrook observes:\n\nAs if to counteract [these dramatic limitations], through much of his composing life Donizetti worked to expand the expressive potential of duets.  The broad spectrum of dramatic situations possible for duets appealed to his strong theatrical sense, and they came to occupy an increasingly important place in his designs.

One is the Leicester-Elizabeth duet (beginning with Leicester's Era d'amor l'immagine / \"She was the picture of love\") which appears before Maria's entrance and where Leicester pleads for Maria while Elizabeth's \"ironic interjections provide a contrast of rhythmic emphasis and melodic pattern to the tenor's balanced lyric phrases\".Most significantly, the other is in the great dramatic scene (unusually long and elaborate tempo di mezzo, between the pezzo concertato and the stretta) at the end of act 1 (act 2 in some productions) \u2013 the confrontation between the two queens \u2013 which gives \"the climactic moment something of the immediacy of the spoken theatre.

The first performance was at the Paris Conservatoire on 5 December 1830. \nBerlioz wrote semi-autobiographical programme notes for the piece that allude to the romantic sufferings of a gifted artist who has poisoned himself with opium because of his unrequited love for a beautiful and fascinating woman (in real life, the Shakespearean actress Harriet Smithson, who in 1833 became the composer's wife). The composer, who revered Beethoven, followed the latter's unusual addition in the Pastoral Symphony of a fifth movement to the normal four of a classical symphony. The artist's  reveries take him to a ball and to a pastoral scene in a field, which is interrupted by a hallucinatory march to the scaffold, leading to a grotesque satanic dance (witches' sabbath). Within each episode, the artist's passion is represented by a recurring theme called the id\u00e9e fixe.\nThe symphony has long been a favourite with audiences and conductors.

The story focuses on 18-year-old Susannah Polk, an innocent girl who is targeted as a sinner in the small mountain town of New Hope Valley, in the Southern American state of Tennessee.\nThe opera was awarded the New York Music Critics Circle Award for Best New Opera in 1956 and was chosen to represent American music and culture at the World's Fair at Brussels in 1958, with a production (by Frank Corsaro) that featured Phyllis Curtin and Norman Treigle. It received its Metropolitan Opera premiere in 1999, with Ren\u00e9e Fleming singing the title role, Jerry Hadley singing Sam and Samuel Ramey singing Blitch. Ramey also recorded the complete opera with Cheryl Studer as Susannah and Jerry Hadley as Sam.  Other well-known sopranos who have portrayed the heroine have included Lee Venora, Joy Clements, Faith Esham, Maralin Niska, Nancy Shade, Diana Soviero, Karan Armstrong, Kelly Kaduce and Phyllis Treigle (opposite Michael Devlin as Blitch).\nSusannah is one of the most performed American operas, second to Porgy and Bess, and celebrated its 50th anniversary with a performance on the very stage where it premiered February 24, 1955, in Ruby Diamond Auditorium at Florida State University. At the first performance, Carlisle Floyd was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Florida State.\nIt has been speculated that the opera was inspired by McCarthyism, and threat of institutional Hollywood communist invasion of America during the early 1950s. The opera also contains many feminist themes that had not been widely explored in popular culture at the time of the opera's writing. Floyd said this opera was meant to be different from a traditional opera.The music is largely characterized by Appalachian folk melodies. Also included are some Protestant hymns and some traditional classical music. A particularly prominent part of the opera is Susannah's soaring and melancholy aria in Act II, \"The Trees on the Mountain\", which is similar to Appalachian folk tunes but in fact Floyd's own composition.

The music was written \"in the spring, summer and fall of 1975.\" Glass recounts the collaborative process: \"I put [Wilson\u2019s notebook of sketches] on the piano and composed each section like a portrait of the drawing before me.

The opera contains writings by Christopher Knowles, Samuel M. Johnson and Lucinda Childs. It is Glass's first and longest opera score, taking approximately five hours in full performance without intermission; given the length, the audience is permitted to enter and leave as desired.The work became the first in Glass's thematically related Portrait Trilogy, along with Satyagraha (1979), and Akhnaten (1983).

This is in accord with Wilson's formalist approach, which he asserts creates more truth on stage than naturalist theater. Wilson structured Einstein on the Beach as a repeating sequence of three different kinds of space. Between major acts are shorter entr'actes known as \"knee plays,\" a signature technique that Wilson has applied throughout his oeuvre.

Beethoven composed the concerto in 1809 under salary in Vienna, and he dedicated it to Archduke Rudolf, who was his patron, friend, and pupil. Its public premiere was on 28 November 1811 in Leipzig, with Friedrich Schneider as the soloist and Johann Philipp Christian Schulz conducting the Gewandhaus Orchestra. Beethoven, usually the soloist, could not perform due to declining hearing.\nThe work's military aspects and symbolism characterize its heroic style. Beethoven used novel approaches with the piece, such as beginning the solo entrance without orchestral introduction, lengthening the concerto, and creating a new relationship between piano and orchestra. The first of its three movements, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Beethoven's earlier piano concertos. The second movement, Adagio un poco mosso, is a nocturne that directly builds into the third movement. The last movement, Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo, is in seven-part rondo form. The concerto is approximately forty minutes.\nThe origin of the epithet Emperor is uncertain; it may have been coined by Johann Baptist Cramer, the English publisher of the concerto. The concerto has no association with any emperor, and according to Donald Tovey and Betsy Schwarm, Beethoven would have disliked it due to his disapproval of Napoleon's conquest.

As their younger counterparts approach them, Phyllis comments to Ben about their past. He feigns a lack of interest; there is an underlying tension in their relationship. As more guests arrive, Sally's husband, Buddy, enters. He is a salesman, in his early 50s, appealing and lively, whose smiles cover inner disappointment.\nFinally, Weismann enters to greet his guests. Roscoe, the old master of ceremonies, introduces the former showgirls (\"Beautiful Girls\"). Former Weismann performers at the reunion include Max and Stella Deems, who lost their radio jobs and became store owners in Miami; Solange La Fitte, a coquette, who is vibrant and flirtatious even at 66; Hattie Walker, who has outlived five younger husbands; Vincent and Vanessa, former dancers who now own an Arthur Murray franchise; Heidi Schiller, for whom Franz Leh\u00e1r once wrote a waltz (\"or was it Oscar Straus?\" Facts never interest her; what matters is the song!); and Carlotta Campion, a film star who has embraced life and benefited from every experience.\nAs the guests reminisce, the stories of Ben, Phyllis, Buddy, and Sally unfold. Phyllis and Sally were roommates while in the Follies, and Ben and Buddy were best friends at school in New York. When Sally sees Ben, her former lover, she greets him self-consciously (\"Don't Look at Me\"). Buddy and Phyllis join their spouses and the foursome reminisces about the old days of their courtship and the theater, their memories vividly coming to life in the apparitions of their young counterparts (\"Waiting For The Girls Upstairs\"). Each of the four is shaken at the realization of how life has changed them. Elsewhere, Willy Wheeler (portly, in his sixties) cartwheels for a photographer. Emily and Theodore Whitman, ex-vaudevillians in their seventies, perform an old routine (\"The Rain on the Roof\"). Solange proves she is still fashionable at what she claims is 66 (\"Ah, Paris!\"), and Hattie Walker performs her old showstopping number (\"Broadway Baby\").\nBuddy warns Phyllis that Sally is still in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben's apparently glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made the right choices and considers how things might have been (\"The Road You Didn't Take\"). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) (\"In Buddy's Eyes\"). However, it is clear that Sally is still in love with Ben \u2013 even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside.\nPhyllis interrupts this tender moment and has a biting encounter with Sally. Before she has a chance to really let loose, they are both called on to participate in another performance \u2013 Stella Deems gets Sally, Phyllis, Emily, Hattie, and some others to perform an old number (\"Who's That Woman?\"), as they are mirrored by their younger selves. Afterward, Phyllis and Ben angrily discuss their lives and relationship, which has become numb and emotionless. Sally is bitter, having never been happy with Buddy, although he has always adored her. She accuses him of having affairs while he is on the road, and he admits he has a steady girlfriend, Margie, in another town, but always returns home. Carlotta amuses a throng of admirers with a tale of how her dramatic solo was cut from the Follies because the audience found it humorous, transforming it as she sings it into an anthem-like toast to her own hard-won survival (\"I'm Still Here\").\nBen confides to Sally that his life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips between them and the three move together (\"Too Many Mornings\"). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy watches from the shadows. Sally thinks this is a sign that the two will finally get married, and Ben is about to protest until Sally interrupts him with a kiss and runs off to gather her things, thinking that the two will leave together. Buddy leaves the shadows furious, and fantasizes about the girl he should have married, Margie, who loves him and makes him feel like \"a somebody\", but bitterly concludes he does not love her back (\"The Right Girl\"). He tells Sally that he's done, but she is lost in a fantasy world and tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him. Buddy tells her she must be either crazy or drunk, but he's already supported Sally through rehab clinics and mental hospitals and cannot take any more. Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover and coolly turns him down. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs \"One More Kiss\", her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self. Phyllis kisses a waiter and confesses to him that she had always wanted a son. She then tells Ben that their marriage can't continue the way it has been. Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this, but still wants Phyllis out of his life. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request (\"Could I Leave You?\").\nPhyllis begins wondering at her younger self, who worked so hard to become the socialite that Ben needed. Ben yells at his younger self for not appreciating all the work that Phyllis did. Both Buddys enter to confront the Bens about how they stole Sally. Sally and her younger self enter and Ben firmly tells Sally that he never loved her. All the voices begin speaking and yelling at each other. Suddenly, at the peak of madness and confusion, the couples are engulfed by their follies, which transform the rundown theater into a fantastical \"Loveland\", an extravaganza even more grand and opulent than the gaudiest Weismann confection: \"the place where lovers are always young and beautiful, and everyone lives only for love\". Sally, Phyllis, Ben, and Buddy show their \"real and emotional lives\" in \"a sort of group nervous breakdown\".What follows is a series of musical numbers performed by the principal characters, each exploring their biggest desires. The two younger couples sing in a counterpoint of their hopes for the future (\"You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through\"). Buddy then appears, dressed in \"plaid baggy pants, garish jacket, and a shiny derby hat\", and performs a high-energy vaudeville routine depicting how he is caught between his love for Sally and Margie's love for him (\"The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues\"). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past - and her obsession with him now (\"Losing My Mind\"). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated and her desire to combine them (\"The Story of Lucy and Jessie\"). Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy (\"Live, Laugh, Love\"), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis.\n\"Loveland\" has dissolved back into the reality of the crumbling and half-demolished theater; dawn is approaching. Ben admits to Phyllis his admiration for her, and Phyllis shushes him and helps Ben regain his dignity before they leave.

Afterward, Phyllis and Ben angrily discuss their lives and relationship, which has become numb and emotionless. Sally is bitter, having never been happy with Buddy, although he has always adored her. She accuses him of having affairs while he is on the road, and he admits he has a steady girlfriend, Margie, in another town, but always returns home. Carlotta amuses a throng of admirers with a tale of how her dramatic solo was cut from the Follies because the audience found it humorous, transforming it as she sings it into an anthem-like toast to her own hard-won survival (\"I'm Still Here\").\nBen confides to Sally that his life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips between them and the three move together (\"Too Many Mornings\"). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy watches from the shadows. Sally thinks this is a sign that the two will finally get married, and Ben is about to protest until Sally interrupts him with a kiss and runs off to gather her things, thinking that the two will leave together. Buddy leaves the shadows furious, and fantasizes about the girl he should have married, Margie, who loves him and makes him feel like \"a somebody\", but bitterly concludes he does not love her back (\"The Right Girl\"). He tells Sally that he's done, but she is lost in a fantasy world and tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him. Buddy tells her she must be either crazy or drunk, but he's already supported Sally through rehab clinics and mental hospitals and cannot take any more. Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover and coolly turns him down. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs \"One More Kiss\", her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self. Phyllis kisses a waiter and confesses to him that she had always wanted a son. She then tells Ben that their marriage can't continue the way it has been. Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this, but still wants Phyllis out of his life. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request (\"Could I Leave You?\").\nPhyllis begins wondering at her younger self, who worked so hard to become the socialite that Ben needed. Ben yells at his younger self for not appreciating all the work that Phyllis did. Both Buddys enter to confront the Bens about how they stole Sally. Sally and her younger self enter and Ben firmly tells Sally that he never loved her. All the voices begin speaking and yelling at each other. Suddenly, at the peak of madness and confusion, the couples are engulfed by their follies, which transform the rundown theater into a fantastical \"Loveland\", an extravaganza even more grand and opulent than the gaudiest Weismann confection: \"the place where lovers are always young and beautiful, and everyone lives only for love\". Sally, Phyllis, Ben, and Buddy show their \"real and emotional lives\" in \"a sort of group nervous breakdown\".What follows is a series of musical numbers performed by the principal characters, each exploring their biggest desires. The two younger couples sing in a counterpoint of their hopes for the future (\"You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through\"). Buddy then appears, dressed in \"plaid baggy pants, garish jacket, and a shiny derby hat\", and performs a high-energy vaudeville routine depicting how he is caught between his love for Sally and Margie's love for him (\"The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues\"). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past - and her obsession with him now (\"Losing My Mind\"). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated and her desire to combine them (\"The Story of Lucy and Jessie\"). Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy (\"Live, Laugh, Love\"), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis.\n\"Loveland\" has dissolved back into the reality of the crumbling and half-demolished theater; dawn is approaching. Ben admits to Phyllis his admiration for her, and Phyllis shushes him and helps Ben regain his dignity before they leave. After exiting, Buddy escorts the emotionally devastated Sally back to their hotel with the promise to work things out later. Their ghostly younger selves appear, watching them go. The younger Ben and Buddy softly call to their \"girls upstairs\", and the Follies end.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists\u2014retired bank robber Michael De Santa (Ned Luke), street gangster Franklin Clinton (Shawn Fonteno), and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips (Steven Ogg), and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's open world countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.\nThe game world is navigated on foot and by vehicle, from either a third-person or first-person perspective. Players control the protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A \"wanted\" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. In Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.\nShared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide, the game's development began around the time of Grand Theft Auto IV's release. The developers drew influence from many of their previous projects (such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3) and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. Grand Theft Auto V was released in September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in April 2015 for Windows, and in March 2022 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nExtensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in its first three days. It received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple-protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. However, its depiction of violence and women caused controversies. Several gaming publications awarded the game year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards. In retrospect, it is considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made. It is the second-best-selling video game of all time with over 195 million copies shipped, and one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all time, with over $8.5 billion in worldwide revenue.

{"id": "86_231", "question": "Who is the composer of Nixon in China?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_50749", "text": "Nixon in China is an opera in three acts by John Adams with a libretto by Alice Goodman. Adams's first opera, it was inspired by U.S. president Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to the People's Republic of China. The work premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on October 22, 1987, in a production by Peter Sellars with choreography by Mark Morris. When Sellars approached Adams with the idea for the opera in 1983, Adams was initially reluctant, but eventually decided that the work could be a study in how myths come to be, and accepted the project. Goodman's libretto was the result of considerable research into Nixon's visit, though she disregarded most sources published after the 1972 trip.\nTo create the sounds he sought, Adams augmented the orchestra with a large saxophone section, additional percussion, and electronic synthesizer. Although sometimes described as minimalist, the score displays a variety of musical styles, embracing minimalism after the manner of Philip Glass alongside passages echoing 19th-century composers such as Wagner and Johann Strauss. With these ingredients, Adams mixes Stravinskian 20th-century neoclassicism, jazz references, and big band sounds reminiscent of Nixon's youth in the 1930s. The combination of these elements varies frequently, to reflect changes in the onstage action.\nFollowing the 1987 premiere, the opera received mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, it has been presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded at least five times. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, and in the same year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company. Recent critical opinion has tended to recognize the work as a significant and lasting contribution to American opera.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50750", "text": "Time: February 1972.\nPlace: In and around Peking.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50751", "text": "The work was a joint commission from the Houston Grand Opera, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Netherlands Opera and the Washington Opera, all of which planned to mount early productions of the opera. Fearful that the work might be challenged as defamatory or not in the public domain, Houston Grand Opera obtained insurance to cover such an eventuality. Before its stage premiere, the opera was presented in concert form in May 1987 in San Francisco, with intermission discussions led by Adams. According to the Los Angeles Times review, a number of audience members left as the work proceeded.Nixon in China formally premiered on the Brown Stage at the new Wortham Theater Center in Houston on October 22, 1987, with John DeMain conducting the Houston Grand Opera. Former president Nixon was invited, and was sent a copy of the libretto; however, his staff indicated that he was unable to attend, due to illness and an impending publication deadline. A Nixon representative later stated that the former president disliked seeing himself on television or other media, and had little interest in opera. According to Adams, he was later told by former Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment that Nixon was highly interested in everything written about him, and so likely saw the Houston production when it was televised on PBS's Great Performances.The piece opened in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Music Critics Association, guaranteeing what the Houston Chronicle described as a \"very discriminating audience\".  Members of the association also attended meetings with the opera's production team.  When Carolann Page, originating Pat Nixon, waved to the audience in character as First Lady, many waved back at her. Adams responded to complaints that the words were difficult to understand (no supertitles were provided) by indicating that it is not necessary that all the words be understood on first seeing an opera.  The audience's general reaction was expressed by what the Los Angeles Times termed \"polite applause\", the descent of the Spirit of '76 being the occasion for clapping from both the onstage chorus and from the viewers in the opera house.When the opera reached the Brooklyn Academy of Music, six weeks after the world premiere, there was again applause during the Spirit of '76's descent. Chou En-lai's toast, addressed by baritone Sanford Sylvan directly to the audience, brought what pianist and writer William R. Braun called \"a shocked hush of chastened admiration\". The meditative Act 3 also brought silence, followed at its conclusion by a storm of applause. On March 26, 1988, the work opened at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, where Nixon's emergence from the plane was again met with applause.After the opera's European premiere at the Muziektheater in Amsterdam in June 1988, it received its first German performance later that year at the Bielefeld Opera, in a production by John Dew with stage designs by Gottfried Pilz.  In the German production, Nixon and Mao were given putty noses in what the Los Angeles Times considered \"a garish and heavy-handed satire\". Also in 1988 the opera received its United Kingdom premiere, at the Edinburgh International Festival in August.For the Los Angeles production in 1990, Sellars made revisions to darken the opera in the wake of the Tiananmen Square protests.  The original production had not had an intermission between Acts 2 and 3; one was inserted, and Sellars authorized supertitles, which he had forbidden in Houston.  Adams conducted the original cast in the French premiere, at the Maison de la Culture de Bobigny, Paris, on December 14, 1991.  Thereafter, performances of the opera became relatively rare; writing in The New York Times in April 1996, Alex Ross speculated on why the work had, at that time, \"dropped from sight\".The London premiere of the opera took place in 2000, at the London Coliseum, with Sellars producing and Paul Daniel conducting the English National Opera (ENO).  A revival of this production was planned for the reopening of the renovated Coliseum in 2004, but delays in the refurbishment caused the revival to be postponed until 2006. The ENO productions helped to revive interest in the work, and served as the basis of the Metropolitan Opera's 2011 production. Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, had approached Adams in 2005 about staging his operas there. Gelb intended that Nixon in China be the first of such productions, but Adams chose Doctor Atomic to be the first Adams work to reach the Met. However, Gelb maintained his interest in staging Nixon in China, which received its Metropolitan premiere on February 2, 2011.  The work received its BBC Proms debut at the Royal Albert Hall in London on September 5, 2012, although the second-act ballet was omitted.While a number of productions have used variations on the original staging, the February 2011 production by the Canadian Opera Company used an abstract setting revived from a 2004 production by the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis.  Alluding to Nixon's \"News\" aria, the omnipresence of television news was dramatized by set designer Allen Moyer by keeping a group of televisions onstage throughout much of the action, often showing scenes from the actual visit.  Instead of an airplane descending in Act 1, a number of televisions descended showing an airplane in flight.Adams conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Los Angeles Master Chorale for performances of the opera at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2017 during a series of concerts celebrating his 70th birthday.  This \"musically and visually dazzling reimagining of the piece\"  included Super 8mm home movies of the visit to China (shot by H. R. Haldeman, Dwight Chapin, and others) projected onto a giant screen with the appearance of a 1960s television set.  In some scenes the historical footage was a backdrop that was artfully synchronized to the live cast in the foreground, in other scenes the actors were lit from behind the translucent screen appearing inside the TV, adding to the surreal experience.  The props and other details were simple but effective, including the miniature souvenir program designed after Mao's Little Red Book.\nDespite a recent proliferation of performances worldwide, the opera has not yet been shown in China.Houston Grand Opera is again producing the opera in 2017 on the 30th anniversary of the world premiere to mixed reviews.A new production was premiered at Staatsoper Stuttgart in April 2019.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50750", "text": "Time: February 1972.\nPlace: In and around Peking.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50751", "text": "The work was a joint commission from the Houston Grand Opera, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Netherlands Opera and the Washington Opera, all of which planned to mount early productions of the opera.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC, where Nixon's emergence from the plane was again met with applause.After the opera's European premiere at the Muziektheater in Amsterdam in June 1988, it received its first German performance later that year at the Bielefeld Opera, in a production by John Dew with stage designs by Gottfried Pilz.  In the German production, Nixon and Mao were given putty noses in what the Los Angeles Times considered \"a garish and heavy-handed satire\". Also in 1988 the opera received its United Kingdom premiere, at the Edinburgh International Festival in August.For the Los Angeles production in 1990, Sellars made revisions to darken the opera in the wake of the Tiananmen Square protests.  The original production had not had an intermission between Acts 2 and 3; one was inserted, and Sellars authorized supertitles, which he had forbidden in Houston.  Adams conducted the original cast in the French premiere, at the Maison de la Culture de Bobigny, Paris, on December 14, 1991.  Thereafter, performances of the opera became relatively rare; writing in The New York Times in April 1996, Alex Ross speculated on why the work had, at that time, \"dropped from sight\".The London premiere of the opera took place in 2000, at the London Coliseum, with Sellars producing and Paul Daniel conducting the English National Opera (ENO).  A revival of this production was planned for the reopening of the renovated Coliseum in 2004, but delays in the refurbishment caused the revival to be postponed until 2006. The ENO productions helped to revive interest in the work, and served as the basis of the Metropolitan Opera's 2011 production. Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, had approached Adams in 2005 about staging his operas there. Gelb intended that Nixon in China be the first of such productions, but Adams chose Doctor Atomic to be the first Adams work to reach the Met. However, Gelb maintained his interest in staging Nixon in China, which received its Metropolitan premiere on February 2, 2011.  The work received its BBC Proms debut at the Royal Albert Hall in London on September 5, 2012, although the second-act ballet was omitted.While a number of productions have used variations on the original staging, the February 2011 production by the Canadian Opera Company used an abstract setting revived from a 2004 production by the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis.  Alluding to Nixon's \"News\" aria, the omnipresence of television news was dramatized by set designer Allen Moyer by keeping a group of televisions onstage throughout much of the action, often showing scenes from the actual visit.  Instead of an airplane descending in Act 1, a number of televisions descended showing an airplane in flight.Adams conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Los Angeles Master Chorale for performances of the opera at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2017 during a series of concerts celebrating his 70th birthday.  This \"musically and visually dazzling reimagining of the piece\"  included Super 8mm home movies of the visit to China (shot by H. R. Haldeman, Dwight Chapin, and others) projected onto a giant screen with the appearance of a 1960s television set.  In some scenes the historical footage was a backdrop that was artfully synchronized to the live cast in the foreground, in other scenes the actors were lit from behind the translucent screen appearing inside the TV, adding to the surreal experience.  The props and other details were simple but effective, including the miniature souvenir program designed after Mao's Little Red Book.\nDespite a recent proliferation of performances worldwide, the opera has not yet been shown in China.Houston Grand Opera is again producing the opera in 2017 on the 30th anniversary of the world premiere to mixed reviews.A new production was premiered at Staatsoper Stuttgart in April 2019.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The process was set in motion, with Verdi still living and working on initial ideas from Paris, where he had been living for almost two years before moving back to his home town of Busseto in the summer of 1849. It was from there that he wrote the music and traveled to Naples for rehearsals.  The first performance was given on 8 December 1849.\nThis was Verdi's 15th opera (counting J\u00e9rusalem, the French translation and revision of I Lombardi alla prima crociata), and it is regarded as the beginning of the composer's \"middle period\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50786", "text": "In August 1848, Verdi had written to the Naples opera house cancelling his contract of three years previous, in which he had agreed to write an opera for them.

NPR Music said that \"with a tense melodic line and taut harmonies, the composition is considered by many to be the most popular of all 20th-century orchestral works.\" Thomas Larson remarked that the piece \"evokes a deep sadness in those who hear it\". Many recordings of the piece have a duration of about eight minutes. According to music theorist Matthew BaileyShea, the Adagio \"features a deliberately archaic sound, with Renaissance-like polyphony and simple tertian harmonies\" underlying a \"chant-like melody\". The work is in \"the key of B\u266d minor (with some modal inflections)\".The Adagio is an example of arch form and builds on a melody that first ascends and then descends in stepwise fashion. Barber subtly manipulates the pulse throughout the work by varying the primary 42 time signature with isolated measures of 52, 62, and 32. After four climactic chords and a long pause, the piece presents the opening theme again and fades away on an unresolved dominant chord.\nMusic critic Olin Downes wrote that the piece is very simple at climaxes but reasoned that the simple chords create significance for the piece.

On November 5, 1938, a selected audience was invited to Studio 8H in Rockefeller Center to watch Toscanini conduct the first performance; it was broadcast on radio and also recorded. Initially, the critical reception was mixed. The New York Times' Olin Downes praised the piece, but he was reproached by other critics who claimed that he overrated it.Toscanini conducted Adagio for Strings in South America and Europe, the first performances of the work on both continents.

NPR Music said that \"with a tense melodic line and taut harmonies, the composition is considered by many to be the most popular of all 20th-century orchestral works.\" Thomas Larson remarked that the piece \"evokes a deep sadness in those who hear it\". Many recordings of the piece have a duration of about eight minutes. According to music theorist Matthew BaileyShea, the Adagio \"features a deliberately archaic sound, with Renaissance-like polyphony and simple tertian harmonies\" underlying a \"chant-like melody\". The work is in \"the key of B\u266d minor (with some modal inflections)\".The Adagio is an example of arch form and builds on a melody that first ascends and then descends in stepwise fashion. Barber subtly manipulates the pulse throughout the work by varying the primary 42 time signature with isolated measures of 52, 62, and 32. After four climactic chords and a long pause, the piece presents the opening theme again and fades away on an unresolved dominant chord.\nMusic critic Olin Downes wrote that the piece is very simple at climaxes but reasoned that the simple chords create significance for the piece. Downes went on to say: \"That is because we have here honest music, by an honest musician, not striving for pretentious effect, not behaving as a writer would who, having a clear, short, popular word handy for his purpose, got the dictionary and fished out a long one.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Following his death, the score was lost and only rediscovered early in the twentieth century.\nPurcell did not set any of Shakespeare's text to music; instead he composed music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques are related to the play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear no relationship to the play. Recent scholarship has shown that the opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.Growing interest in Baroque music and the rise of the countertenor contributed to the work's re-entry into the repertoire. The opera received several full-length recordings in the latter part of the 20th century and several of its arias, including \"The Plaint\" (\"O let me weep\"), have become popular recital pieces.\nIn July 2009, in celebration of the 350th anniversary of Purcell's birth, The Fairy-Queen was performed by Glyndebourne Festival Opera using a new edition of the score, prepared for the Purcell Society by Bruce Wood and Andrew Pinnock.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50807", "text": "The Fairy-Queen was first performed on 2 May 1692 at the Queen's Theatre, Dorset Garden in London by the United Company.

The libretto is based on an incident mentioned in Dante's Divine Comedy. The work is the third and final part of Puccini's Il trittico (The Triptych) \u2013 three one-act operas with contrasting themes, originally written to be presented together. Although it continues to be performed with one or both of the other trittico operas, Gianni Schicchi is now more frequently staged either alone or with short operas by other composers. The aria \"O mio babbino caro\" is one of Puccini's best known, and one of the most popular arias in opera.\nPuccini had long considered writing a set of one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced with a lack of suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, completes the triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, and it has been praised for its inventiveness and imagination.\nWhen Il trittico premiered at New York's Metropolitan Opera in December 1918, Gianni Schicchi became an immediate hit, while the other two operas were received with less enthusiasm. This pattern was broadly repeated at the Rome and London premieres and led to commercial pressures to abandon the less successful elements. Although on artistic grounds Puccini opposed performing the three operas except as the original triptych, by 1920 he had given his reluctant consent to separate performances.

The women help him to change into Buoso's clothes as they sing the lyrical trio \"Spogliati, bambolino\" (\"Undress, little boy\"). Before taking his place in the bed, Schicchi warns the company of the grave punishment for those found to have falsified a will: amputation of one hand, and then, exile from Florence.\nThe notary arrives, and Schicchi starts to dictate the new will, declaring any prior will null and void. To general satisfaction, he allocates the minor bequests, but when it comes to the mule, the house and the mills, he orders that these be left to \"my devoted friend Gianni Schicchi\". Incredulous, the family can do nothing while the lawyer is present, especially when Schicchi slyly reminds them of the penalties that discovery of the ruse will bring. Their outrage when the notary leaves is accompanied by a frenzy of looting as Schicchi chases them out of what is now his house.\nMeanwhile, Lauretta and Rinuccio sing a love duet, \"Lauretta mia\", as there is no bar to their marriage since Schicchi can now provide a respectable dowry. Schicchi, returning, stands moved at the sight of the two lovers. He turns to the audience and asks them to agree that no better use could be found for Buoso's wealth: although the poet Dante has condemned him to hell for this trick, Schicchi asks the audience to forgive him in light of \"extenuating circumstances.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The commission came from the impresario Domenico Guardasoni, who lived in Prague and who had been charged by the Estates of Bohemia with providing a new work to celebrate the coronation of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, as King of Bohemia. The coronation had been planned by the Estates in order to ratify a political agreement between Leopold and the nobility of Bohemia (it had rescinded efforts of Leopold's brother Joseph II to initiate a program to free the serfs of Bohemia and increase the tax burden of aristocratic landholders). Leopold desired to pacify the Bohemian nobility in order to forestall revolt and strengthen his empire in the face of political challenges engendered by the French Revolution. The ceremony was to take place on 6 September; Guardasoni had been approached about the opera in June. No opera of Mozart was more clearly pressed into the service of a political agenda than La clemenza di Tito, in this case to promote the reactionary political and social policies of an aristocratic elite. No evidence exists to evaluate Mozart's attitude toward this, or even whether he was aware of the internal political conflicts raging in the kingdom of Bohemia in 1791.In a contract dated 8 July, Guardasoni promised that he would engage a castrato \"of leading quality\" (this seems to have mattered more than who wrote the opera); that he would \"have the libretto caused to be written...and to be set to music by a distinguished maestro\". The time was tight and Guardasoni had a get-out clause: if he failed to secure a new text, he would resort to La clemenza di Tito, a libretto written more than half a century earlier by Pietro Metastasio (1698\u20131782).\nMetastasio's libretto had already been set by nearly 40 composers; the story is based on the life of Roman Emperor Titus, from some brief hints in The Lives of the Caesars by the Roman writer Suetonius, and was elaborated by Metastasio in 1734 for the Italian composer Antonio Caldara. Among later settings were Gluck's in 1752 and Josef Myslive\u010dek's version in 1774. Mozart was definitely familiar with the libretto before composition; in 1770, he saw a production with his father of Michelangelo Valentini's setting in Cremona.

It has been praised for its approach to themes of racism, homosexuality and internet pornography.\nThe musical premiered Off-Broadway in 2003 at the Vineyard Theatre, co-produced by the Vineyard Theatre and The New Group. In July of that same year, the show moved to the John Golden Theatre on Broadway, where it ran until 2009, playing for over 2,500 performances.

Major productions have been staged in Las Vegas and the West End, and the musical has been staged and toured in several countries around the world. A school-friendly script has been produced.\nThe principal cast includes four puppeteers and three human actors.

The same puppet may be operated by different puppeteers in different scenes, and the actor voicing the puppet may be, at times, not the one animating it. One puppeteer sometimes voices two or more puppets simultaneously. Conversely, the so-called \"live-hands\" puppets require two puppeteers \u2013 again, in full view of the audience.\nThe show draws inspiration from and imitates the format of children's educational television show Sesame Street. Marx interned at the program early in his career, and all four of the original cast's principal puppeteers \u2013 John Tartaglia, Stephanie D'Abruzzo, Jennifer Barnhart and Rick Lyon \u2013 were Sesame Street performers (D'Abruzzo returned to Sesame Street after leaving Avenue Q). Three of the puppet characters are direct recognizable parodies of Sesame Street puppets: Roommates Rod and Nicky are a riff on Bert and Ernie, while Trekkie Monster bears the distinctive voice and disposition of Cookie Monster, though not his obsession with baked goods. (The production officially disclaims any connection with either Sesame Workshop or The Jim Henson Company.)All of the characters (puppet and human) are young adults who face real-world problems with uncertain solutions, as opposed to the simplistic problems and invariably happy resolutions encountered by characters on children's television programming. Much of the show's ironic humor emerges from its contrasts with Sesame Street, including the differences between innocent childhood experiences and complex adulthood. The storyline presupposes the existence of \"monsters\" and talking animals, and human actors sing, dance and interact with puppets, both human and non-human, as if they were sentient beings, in a light-hearted, quasi-fantasy environment. However, the characters use a considerable amount of profanity, and puppet nudity and sex are portrayed. The show addresses adult themes, such as racism, pornography, coming out, and schadenfreude.\nThe story does not explain why three of the human characters are portrayed by human actors, while other characters intended to be perceived as humans are puppets. One human character is a fictionalized version of the real-life celebrity Gary Coleman, the juvenile actor who played Arnold Jackson in the 1980s American sitcom Diff'rent Strokes and later famously sued his parents and business advisers for stealing his earnings. Coleman is portrayed (by a woman in most productions) as an adult, who happens to be the building superintendent in the run-down Avenue Q neighborhood due to his dire financial situation. Marx and Lopez said that they originally intended to offer the Gary Coleman role to Coleman himself, and he expressed interest in accepting it, but did not show up for a meeting scheduled to discuss it. They stated that the character illustrates \"one of the most important themes in Avenue Q ... that life isn't as easy as we've been led to believe\". Coleman threatened to sue Avenue Q producers for their depiction of him, but ultimately he did not.When Coleman died on May 28, 2010, casts of both the Off-Broadway production in New York City and the second national tour in Dallas dedicated that evening's performances to his memory.

Conversely, the so-called \"live-hands\" puppets require two puppeteers \u2013 again, in full view of the audience.\nThe show draws inspiration from and imitates the format of children's educational television show Sesame Street. Marx interned at the program early in his career, and all four of the original cast's principal puppeteers \u2013 John Tartaglia, Stephanie D'Abruzzo, Jennifer Barnhart and Rick Lyon \u2013 were Sesame Street performers (D'Abruzzo returned to Sesame Street after leaving Avenue Q). Three of the puppet characters are direct recognizable parodies of Sesame Street puppets: Roommates Rod and Nicky are a riff on Bert and Ernie, while Trekkie Monster bears the distinctive voice and disposition of Cookie Monster, though not his obsession with baked goods. (The production officially disclaims any connection with either Sesame Workshop or The Jim Henson Company.)All of the characters (puppet and human) are young adults who face real-world problems with uncertain solutions, as opposed to the simplistic problems and invariably happy resolutions encountered by characters on children's television programming. Much of the show's ironic humor emerges from its contrasts with Sesame Street, including the differences between innocent childhood experiences and complex adulthood. The storyline presupposes the existence of \"monsters\" and talking animals, and human actors sing, dance and interact with puppets, both human and non-human, as if they were sentient beings, in a light-hearted, quasi-fantasy environment. However, the characters use a considerable amount of profanity, and puppet nudity and sex are portrayed. The show addresses adult themes, such as racism, pornography, coming out, and schadenfreude.\nThe story does not explain why three of the human characters are portrayed by human actors, while other characters intended to be perceived as humans are puppets. One human character is a fictionalized version of the real-life celebrity Gary Coleman, the juvenile actor who played Arnold Jackson in the 1980s American sitcom Diff'rent Strokes and later famously sued his parents and business advisers for stealing his earnings. Coleman is portrayed (by a woman in most productions) as an adult, who happens to be the building superintendent in the run-down Avenue Q neighborhood due to his dire financial situation. Marx and Lopez said that they originally intended to offer the Gary Coleman role to Coleman himself, and he expressed interest in accepting it, but did not show up for a meeting scheduled to discuss it. They stated that the character illustrates \"one of the most important themes in Avenue Q ... that life isn't as easy as we've been led to believe\". Coleman threatened to sue Avenue Q producers for their depiction of him, but ultimately he did not.When Coleman died on May 28, 2010, casts of both the Off-Broadway production in New York City and the second national tour in Dallas dedicated that evening's performances to his memory.  The Coleman character remains in the show with modified dialogue.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50833", "text": "The show is set on a fictional street in an \"outer-outer borough\" of New York City.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Both the crowd and the nation go into a period of public mourning (\"Requiem for Evita\") as Che, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did \"nothing for years\" (\"Oh What a Circus\").\nIn 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte lives in the city of Jun\u00edn, and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva takes up with a tango singer-songwriter, Agust\u00edn Magaldi, after she meets him at one of his shows (\"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\"). Eva persuades Magaldi to take her with him to Buenos Aires, and though he is initially resistant, he eventually accepts (\"Eva, Beware of the City\"). Upon her arrival in the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress (\"Buenos Aires\").\nAfter her arrival, Eva is quick to leave Magaldi, and Che relates how Eva sleeps her way up the social ladder, becoming a model, radio star, and actress (\"Goodnight and Thank You\"). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder (\"The Lady's Got Potential\"). In a game of musical chairs that represents the rise of political figures, Per\u00f3n and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy (\"The Art of the Possible\").\nAfter a massive earthquake hits the town of San Juan, Per\u00f3n organizes a charity concert at Luna Park to provide aid to the earthquake's victims. Eva attends and briefly reunites with Agust\u00edn Magaldi, who coldly shuns her for her past actions. Per\u00f3n addresses the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva as soon as he exits (\"Charity Concert\"). Eva and Per\u00f3n share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Per\u00f3n rise to power (\"I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You\").

In 1946, after launching his presidential bid, Per\u00f3n discusses his chances of winning the election with Eva. After reassuring him of their chances of winning, Eva organizes rallies for the descamisados and gives them hope for a better future while Per\u00f3n and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way (\"A New Argentina\").\nDuring the period between Act I and Act II, Eva and Per\u00f3n are married \u2013 a fact merely alluded to, in the \"Casa Rosada balcony\" scene, at the start of Act II.\nAct II\nPer\u00f3n is elected President in a sweeping victory in 1946.

Both the crowd and the nation go into a period of public mourning (\"Requiem for Evita\") as Che, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did \"nothing for years\" (\"Oh What a Circus\").\nIn 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte lives in the city of Jun\u00edn, and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva takes up with a tango singer-songwriter, Agust\u00edn Magaldi, after she meets him at one of his shows (\"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\"). Eva persuades Magaldi to take her with him to Buenos Aires, and though he is initially resistant, he eventually accepts (\"Eva, Beware of the City\"). Upon her arrival in the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress (\"Buenos Aires\").\nAfter her arrival, Eva is quick to leave Magaldi, and Che relates how Eva sleeps her way up the social ladder, becoming a model, radio star, and actress (\"Goodnight and Thank You\"). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder (\"The Lady's Got Potential\"). In a game of musical chairs that represents the rise of political figures, Per\u00f3n and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy (\"The Art of the Possible\").\nAfter a massive earthquake hits the town of San Juan, Per\u00f3n organizes a charity concert at Luna Park to provide aid to the earthquake's victims. Eva attends and briefly reunites with Agust\u00edn Magaldi, who coldly shuns her for her past actions. Per\u00f3n addresses the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva as soon as he exits (\"Charity Concert\"). Eva and Per\u00f3n share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Per\u00f3n rise to power (\"I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You\"). Eva dismisses Per\u00f3n's Mistress (the character is known only by that title), who ponders the rejection (\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\").\nUpon moving in with Per\u00f3n, Eva is introduced to high society only to be met with disdain from the upper classes and the Argentine Army (\"Per\u00f3n's Latest Flame\"). In 1946, after launching his presidential bid, Per\u00f3n discusses his chances of winning the election with Eva. After reassuring him of their chances of winning, Eva organizes rallies for the descamisados and gives them hope for a better future while Per\u00f3n and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way (\"A New Argentina\").\nDuring the period between Act I and Act II, Eva and Per\u00f3n are married \u2013 a fact merely alluded to, in the \"Casa Rosada balcony\" scene, at the start of Act II.\nAct II\nPer\u00f3n is elected President in a sweeping victory in 1946. He stands \"On The Balcony of the Casa Rosada\" addressing his descamisados (shirtless ones).

It is a sequel to the long-running 1986 musical The Phantom of the Opera and was loosely adapted from Forsyth's 1999 novel The Phantom of Manhattan.\nThe plot is not based on the storyline in the original 1910 novel by Gaston Leroux. Lloyd Webber stated, \"I don't regard this as a sequel\u2014it's a stand-alone piece.\" He later clarified, \"Clearly, it is a sequel, but I really do not believe that you have to have seen Phantom of the Opera to understand Love Never Dies.\" Glenn Slater subsequently explained that Lloyd Webber \"didn\u2019t view it as a sequel as much as 'a second story with these characters'\". The musical is set in 1907, which Lloyd Webber states is \"ten years roughly after the end of the original Phantom\", although the events of the original actually took place in 1881.In the show, Christine Daa\u00e9 is invited by Oscar Hammerstein I for her American debut, until an anonymous impresario contracts her to perform at Phantasma, a new attraction on Coney Island. With her husband Raoul and son Gustave in tow, she journeys to Brooklyn, unaware that it is actually the Phantom who has arranged her appearance in the popular beach resort.Although Lloyd Webber began working on Love Never Dies in 1990, it was not until 2007 that he began writing the music. The show opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London's West End on 9 March 2010, with previews from 22 February 2010. It was originally directed by Jack O'Brien and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell, starring Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess. However, the show closed for four days in November 2010 for substantial re-writes, which were overseen by Lloyd Webber, and it re-opened with new direction from Bill Kenwright. Set and costume designs were by Bob Crowley. The original London production received mostly negative reviews. A subsequent Australian production starring Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne, featuring an entirely new design team and heavy revisions was generally better received, although the show finally closed with heavy discounting to tickets. A planned Broadway production, which was to have opened simultaneously with the West End run, was cancelled, the amount of negative press having deterred potential backers.

Following a conversation with Maria Bj\u00f6rnson, the designer of The Phantom of the Opera, Lloyd Webber decided that, were a sequel to come about, it would be set in New York City at the turn of the 20th century. One of his ideas was to have the Phantom live above ground in Manhattan's first penthouse, but he rejected this when he saw a TV documentary about the Coney Island fairground. Lloyd Webber began collaborating with author Frederick Forsyth on the project, but it soon fell apart as Lloyd Webber felt the ideas they were developing would be difficult to adapt for a stage musical. Forsyth went on to publish some of the ideas he had worked on with Lloyd Webber in 1999 as a novel entitled The Phantom of Manhattan.Lloyd Webber returned to the project in 2006, collaborating with a number of writers and directors. However, he still did not feel the ideas he had were adaptable into a piece of musical theatre. Finally, in early 2007, Lloyd Webber approached Ben Elton (who had served as the librettist for Lloyd Webber's The Beautiful Game) to help shape a synopsis for a sequel, based on Lloyd Webber's initial ideas. Elton's treatment of the story focused more on the original characters of The Phantom of the Opera and omitted new characters that Lloyd Webber and Forsyth had developed. Lloyd Webber was pleased with Elton's treatment and began work on the sequel. In March 2007, he announced he would be moving forward with the project. When Lloyd Webber approached the lyricist Glenn Slater to join the project, Slater's initial thought was that \"it just sounded like a terrible idea\".The sequel was delayed because Lloyd Webber's six-month-old kitten Otto, a rare-breed Turkish Van, climbed onto Lloyd Webber's Clavinova digital piano and managed to delete the entire score. Lloyd Webber was unable to recover any of it from the instrument, but was eventually able to reconstruct the score.

After the success of the next Lloyd Webber and Rice piece, Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph received amateur stage productions in the US beginning in 1970, and the first American release of the album was in 1971. The musical had its professional premiere, as a 35-minute musical, at the Haymarket ice rink during the Edinburgh International Festival in 1972. It was Part Two of Bible One, a Young Vic Theatre Company production presented by the National Theatre of Great Britain. While still undergoing various modifications and expansions, the musical was produced in the West End in 1973. In 1974, its full modern format was performed at the Haymarket Theatre in Leicester and was also recorded that year. The musical was mounted on Broadway in 1982.

The opera's theme of overcoming the loss of a loved one resonated with contemporary audiences of the 1920s who had just come through the trauma and grief of World War I, and this undoubtedly fuelled the work's popularity.\nDie tote Stadt was one of the greatest hits of the 1920s. Within two years of its premiere it had circled the globe, including several performances at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The Berlin premi\u00e8re was on 12 April 1924 with Lotte Lehmann as Marietta/Marie and Richard Tauber as Paul, conducted by George Szell.\nBut the work was banned by the Nazi r\u00e9gime because of Korngold's Jewish ancestry and after World War II it fell into obscurity. The key postwar revivals of the piece were at the Vienna Volksoper (1967) and the New York City Opera (1975). In recent years, however, the work has enjoyed notable revivals, among others at the Theater Bonn, the Royal Opera House, the San Francisco Opera and at the Vienna State Opera.The French premiere of the opera took place in a concert performance in 1982 at the Paris Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The first French staged performance was in April 2001 in Strasbourg under the baton of Jan Latham-Koenig with Torsten Kerl (Paul) and Angela Denoke (Marietta).\nThe opera received its UK premiere on 14 January 1996 in a concert performance by the Kensington Symphony Orchestra conducted by Russell Keable at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with Ian Caley (Paul) and Christine Teare (Marie/Marietta). The first UK staged performance was on 27 January 2009 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. The opera was first staged in English by English National Opera in March 2023, directed by Annilese Miskimmon and conducted by Kirill Karabits.The opera was first performed in Latin America at Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on September 19, 1999, with Carlos Bengolea as Paul, Cynthia Makris as Marie/Marietta and David Pittman-Jennings as Frank; Stefan Lano was the conductor.\nIn Australia, the work was first premiered by Opera Australia on 30 June 2012 at the Sydney Opera House, with Cheryl Barker as Marie/Marietta, and Stefan Vinke as Paul, conducted by Christian Badea, directed by Bruce Beresford. In 1986, Beresford directed the episode \"Gl\u00fcck, das mir verblieb\" of Aria.\nOpera Colorado opened a new production directed by Chas Rader-Shieber, designed by Robert Perdziola, and conducted by music director Ari Pelto on 26 February 2023 at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House.

Larson suggested setting the play \"amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, drag queens and punk\" in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, which happened to be down the street from his Greenwich Village apartment. He also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that \"rent\" also means torn apart). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make Rent his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for Rent; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera \"to bring musical theater to the MTV generation\". Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for \"original concept & additional lyrics\".Jonathan Larson focused on composing Rent in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the Moondance Diner to support himself. Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of Rent's script. When Rent had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of Rent featured songs that never made it into the final version, such as:\n\n\"You're a Fool\"\n\"Do a Little Business\", the predecessor of \"You'll See\", featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins and Angel\n\"Female to Female A & B\", featuring Maureen and Joanne\n\"He's a Fool\"\n\"He Says\"\n\"Right Brain, Left Brain\", later rewritten as \"One Song Glory\", featuring Roger\n\"You'll Get Over It\", the predecessor of \"Tango: Maureen\", featuring Mark and Maureen\n\"Real Estate\", a number wherein Benny tries to convince Mark to become a real estate agent and drop his filmmaking\n\"Open Road\", the predecessor of \"What You Own\", with a backing track similar to this in \"Your Eyes\"This workshop version of Rent starred Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi.

Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera La Boh\u00e8me, the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before Rent's premiere. La Boh\u00e8me was also about the lives of poor young artists. Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in Rent; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of Rent's characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in Rent represents the character of Alcindoro in Boh\u00e8me, but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only Rent character whose predecessor in La Boh\u00e8me is a different sex.\n\nOther examples of parallels between Larson's and Puccini's work include Larson's song \"Light My Candle\", which draws melodic content directly from \"Che gelida manina\"; \"Quando me'n vo'\" (\"Musetta's Waltz\"), a melody taken directly from Puccini's opera; and \"Goodbye Love\", a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini's and Larson's work. \"Quando me'n vo'\" is paralleled in the first verse of \"Take Me or Leave Me\", when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, \"Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song...\"  Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, \"...that  doesn't remind us of 'Musetta's Waltz'.\" This part of \"Musetta's Waltz\" is also later used in \"Your Eyes\", a song Roger writes.\nRent is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in \"Rent\"]) made their way into the musical . Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson's own girlfriend left him for a woman.  The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson's friends, cinematographer and producer Jonathan Burkhart and documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein.\nPlaywright Sarah Schulman alleged that Rent bore striking similarities to her novel People in Trouble.The line, \"I'm more of a man than you'll ever be... and more of a woman than you'll ever get!\", attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at her funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films Mannequin (1987) and Mannequin Two: On the Move (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women's clothing. This line was originally in the film Car Wash (1976), delivered by Antonio Fargas as a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser named Lindy.\nThe earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off Oedipus in her performance piece instead of Hey Diddle Diddle; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a jazz philosopher, while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like \"Real Estate\", which was later cut.\nMany actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. Life Caf\u00e9, where the \"La Vie Boh\u00e8me\" numbers are set, was an actual restaurant (closed 2013) on 10th Street and Avenue B in the East Village of New York City. The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village riot in 1988 that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in Tompkins Square Park.\"Will I?\", a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or had died from AIDS.The scene and song \"Life Support\" were also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the \"forget regret\" refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this \"credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?\" Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, \"Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?\" Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year.

The title is commonly shortened to Rienzi. Written between July 1838 and November 1840, it was first performed at the K\u00f6nigliches Hoftheater Dresden, on 20 October 1842, and was the composer's first success.\nThe opera is set in Rome and is based on the life of Cola di Rienzo (1313\u20131354), a late medieval Italian populist figure who succeeds in outwitting and then defeating the nobles and their followers and in raising the power of the people. Magnanimous at first, he is forced by events to crush the nobles' rebellion against the people's power, but popular opinion changes and even the Church, which had urged him to assert himself, turns against him. In the end the populace burns the Capitol, in which Rienzi and a few adherents have made a last stand.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50970", "text": "Rienzi is Wagner's third completed opera, and is mostly written in a grand opera style. In his 1860 essay \"Music of the Future,\" Wagner called it \"a work full of youthful fire\" which was inspired by \"the heroic opera of Spontini\" and the Parisian grand opera of Daniel Auber, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Fromental Hal\u00e9vy. Rienzi's depictions of the mob, the liberal ethos associated with the hero and the political intervention of a reactionary clergy recall Spontini's La vestale (1807), Hal\u00e9vy's La Juive (1835), and Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots (1836). Each act ends with an extended finale ensemble and is replete with solos, duets, trios and crowd scenes. There is also an extended ballet in act 2 according to the accepted Grand Opera format. Hans von B\u00fclow was later to joke that \"Rienzi is Meyerbeer's best opera\".Wagner began to draft the opera in Riga in 1837, after reading Lytton's novel (although John Deathridge has argued that Wagner's work also bears the influence of Mary Russell Mitford's 1828 \"highly successful English play\" Rienzi). During a 1839 visit to the bathing resort town of Boulogne, Wagner approached Meyerbeer with a partial draft of Rienzi, and the elder composer responded with encouragement.

Moreover, Wagner's wife Minna, in a letter of 28 October 1840 to Wagner's friend Apel, who had likely first made the suggestion that Wagner compose Rienzi, mentions a plan to perform the overture to Rienzi \"a fortnight hence\", but contains a clear indication that her husband had just been committed to a debtors' prison.

Wally, short for Walburga, is a girl with some heroic attributes. The story is based on an episode in the life of Tyrolean painter Anna Stainer-Knittel, whom von Hillern met. She got her epithet \"Geier\" (vulture, the local name for eagle) from having gutted a bearded vulture's nest going down a rope; this dangerous task, aimed at protecting the sheep in the Alpine village, was typically performed by a man.\nVon Hillern's piece was originally serialized in Deutsche Rundschau and was reproduced in English as \"A German Peasant Romance\" in the Cornhill Magazine in 1875.\nThe opera is best known for its aria \"Ebben?

It focuses on an archetypal Disney princess-to-be named Giselle\nexiled from her animated world into the live-action world of New York City.\nThe film is both a homage to and a self-parody of Disney's animated features, making numerous references to past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, traditional animation, and computer-generated imagery. It also marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had written songs for previous Disney films, wrote and produced the songs of Enchanted, and Menken also composed the film's score.

Although the studio was looking for a film star in the role, director Kevin Lima insisted on casting a lesser-known actress. Out of the 300 or so actresses who auditioned for the role, Adams stood out to Lima because not only did she look like a Disney princess but her \"commitment to the character, her ability to escape into the character's being without ever judging the character was overwhelming\". Hailing from Andalasia, Giselle displays similar traits to early Disney Princesses; Lima describes her as \"about 80% Snow White, with some traits borrowed from Cinderella and Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty... although her spunkiness comes from Ariel from The Little Mermaid\". She is \"eternally optimistic and romantic\" but is also \"very independent and true to her convictions\".

Lima cast Dempsey after Disney was satisfied with the casting of Adams but had wanted more well-known actors in the film. Dempsey, whose starring role on TV series Grey's Anatomy had earned him the nickname \"McDreamy\", was described by Lima as \"a modern-day Prince Charming to today's audience\". The role was challenging for Dempsey because he had to play the straight man to Adams' and Marsden's more outrageous characters.\nJames Marsden as Prince Edward: A dim-witted, yet brave, heroic and good-hearted, prince who is baffled by the world of New York once he enters it. Marsden was announced to have been cast on December 6, 2005. At the time Marsden was auditioning, the role of Robert had not been cast but he decided to pursue the role of Prince Edward because he was \"more fun and he responded more to that character\". Edward is a prince in Andalasia and the stepson of Queen Narissa. He is \"very pure, very simple-minded and naive, but innocently narcissistic\".\nTimothy Spall as Nathaniel: A servant of Queen Narissa, who gets controlled through his infatuation with the Queen and his own lack of self-esteem.

Since the role did not require any singing, Menzel said in an interview that \"it was a compliment to be asked to just be hired on my acting talents alone\". She is named after Lady Tremaine, the stepmother from Cinderella.\nRachel Covey as Morgan Philip: Robert's 6-year-old daughter. Despite her father misunderstanding her and telling her otherwise, she believes in fairy tales and also believes that magic exists.\nSusan Sarandon as Queen Narissa: Edward's evil stepmother, a sorceress, and a megalomaniac with a hatred for Giselle simply for being an obstacle for her to keep her power. Sarandon had been attracted to the project prior to Lima's involvement as director. Since Sarandon's on-screen time was relatively short, it took only two weeks to film her scenes.

She meets Giselle and leaves, assuming Robert is unfaithful. He is initially upset, but he spends the day with Giselle, knowing she is vulnerable in the city. She questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending her flowers and an invitation to a costume ball at the Woolworth Building.\nEdward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment. Although he is eager to take her home to Andalasia and marry her, she suggests they should first go on a date and get to know each other better. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after the ball that night, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Narissa decides to enter the real world and kill Giselle herself after Nathaniel fails twice to poison her.\nAt the ball, Robert and Giselle dance romantically with each other. Giselle and Edward prepare to depart, but she feels depressed about leaving Robert behind. Narissa appears as the old hag and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising that it will wipe her memories. She takes a bite and plunges into sleep with mere minutes to live.\nNarissa tries escaping with Giselle's body but Edward thwarts her. Realizing that Narissa never cared about him, Nathaniel reveals her plot and apologizes for his previous actions. Robert realizes that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's curse. Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, so he and Nancy prompt Robert to kiss her instead.\nWhen Robert kisses her, she awakens. Infuriated, Narissa transforms into a dragon and takes him hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa to the top of the building to rescue Robert. Pip comes to support Giselle and causes Narissa to fall to her death on the streets below. Robert almost falls as well, but Giselle rescues him, and they share another kiss on the roof.\nA happy new life unfolds for everyone, showing Edward and Nancy falling in love and marrying in Andalasia while Nathaniel, who stays in New York, and Pip, who returns to Andalasia, each write autobiographies based on their experiences in the real world. Giselle starts a prevalent fashion design business and then forms a happy family with Robert and Morgan in New York.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50982", "text": "Amy Adams as Giselle: A singing and dancing princess-to-be who ends up almost having her dream of meeting her prince a reality. Adams was announced to have been cast in the role of Giselle on November 14, 2005. Although the studio was looking for a film star in the role, director Kevin Lima insisted on casting a lesser-known actress. Out of the 300 or so actresses who auditioned for the role, Adams stood out to Lima because not only did she look like a Disney princess but her \"commitment to the character, her ability to escape into the character's being without ever judging the character was overwhelming\". Hailing from Andalasia, Giselle displays similar traits to early Disney Princesses; Lima describes her as \"about 80% Snow White, with some traits borrowed from Cinderella and Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty... although her spunkiness comes from Ariel from The Little Mermaid\". She is \"eternally optimistic and romantic\" but is also \"very independent and true to her convictions\". Over the course of the film, she becomes more mature (even stopping her habit of singing in a continuous manner) but maintains her fondness of singing, kindness, innocence and optimism.\nPatrick Dempsey as Robert Philip: A cynical Manhattan divorce attorney at Churchill, Harline & Smith LLP who does not believe in true love, happily-ever-after, or fairy tales since his wife left him and their daughter. He falls in love with Giselle after her adventure to New York City, and her sense of fun gradually rubs off on him over the course of the film. Lima cast Dempsey after Disney was satisfied with the casting of Adams but had wanted more well-known actors in the film. Dempsey, whose starring role on TV series Grey's Anatomy had earned him the nickname \"McDreamy\", was described by Lima as \"a modern-day Prince Charming to today's audience\". The role was challenging for Dempsey because he had to play the straight man to Adams' and Marsden's more outrageous characters.\nJames Marsden as Prince Edward: A dim-witted, yet brave, heroic and good-hearted, prince who is baffled by the world of New York once he enters it. Marsden was announced to have been cast on December 6, 2005. At the time Marsden was auditioning, the role of Robert had not been cast but he decided to pursue the role of Prince Edward because he was \"more fun and he responded more to that character\". Edward is a prince in Andalasia and the stepson of Queen Narissa. He is \"very pure, very simple-minded and naive, but innocently narcissistic\".\nTimothy Spall as Nathaniel: A servant of Queen Narissa, who gets controlled through his infatuation with the Queen and his own lack of self-esteem. He initially does Narissa's bidding, but ultimately realizes her true nature and rebels against her. He has a penchant for disguises.\nIdina Menzel as Nancy Tremaine: A fashion designer and Robert's girlfriend. Once Giselle falls in love with Robert, she falls for Edward and leaves with him. Since the role did not require any singing, Menzel said in an interview that \"it was a compliment to be asked to just be hired on my acting talents alone\". She is named after Lady Tremaine, the stepmother from Cinderella.\nRachel Covey as Morgan Philip: Robert's 6-year-old daughter. Despite her father misunderstanding her and telling her otherwise, she believes in fairy tales and also believes that magic exists.\nSusan Sarandon as Queen Narissa: Edward's evil stepmother, a sorceress, and a megalomaniac with a hatred for Giselle simply for being an obstacle for her to keep her power. Sarandon had been attracted to the project prior to Lima's involvement as director. Since Sarandon's on-screen time was relatively short, it took only two weeks to film her scenes. Narissa's mannerisms, characteristics, powers, and physical features were inspired by such classical Disney villainesses as the Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty.Giselle's chipmunk friend Pip is voiced by Jeff Bennett in Andalasia, where he has no trouble expressing himself through speech, while Enchanted director Kevin Lima voices Pip in the real world, where he must communicate through squeaks and charades. Much of Pip's personality were based on Disney sidekicks such as Mushu from Mulan and Timon from The Lion King. The Andalasia cast also includes Lima's daughter Emma Rose Lima as the bluebird and the fawn, Teala Dunn as a bunny and Fred Tatasciore as the troll. Julie Andrews provides the film's narration.Paige O'Hara and Judy Kuhn make cameo appearances as soap opera character Angela and a pregnant woman Edward encounters, respectively. John Rothman and Jodi Benson portray, respectively, Robert's boss Carl and secretary Sam, while Tonya Pinkins and Isiah Whitlock Jr. portray Phoebe and Ethan Banks, a couple whose divorce Robert is mediating.

It is produced by Sesame Workshop (known as the Children's Television Workshop until June 2000) and was created by Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett. It is known for its images communicated through the use of Jim Henson's Muppets, and includes short films, with humor and cultural references. It premiered on November 10, 1969, to positive reviews, some controversy, and high viewership. It has aired on the United States national public television provider PBS since its debut, with its first run moving to premium channel HBO on January 16, 2016, then its sister streaming service HBO Max in 2020.\nThe show's format consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect changes in American culture and audiences' viewing habits. It was the first children's TV show to use educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content, and the first show whose educational effects were formally studied. Its format and content have undergone significant changes to reflect changes to its curriculum.\nShortly after its creation, its producers developed what came to be called the CTW Model (after the production company's previous name), a system of planning, production and evaluation based on collaboration between producers, writers, educators and researchers. The show was initially funded by government and private foundations, but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements, international sales and other media. By 2006, independently produced versions (\"co-productions\") of Sesame Street were broadcast in 20 countries. In 2001, there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of Sesame Street; and by its 40th anniversary in 2009, it was broadcast in more than 140 countries.\nSince its debut, Sesame Street has garnered praise. It was by then the 15th-highest-rated children's television show in the United States. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched it by the time they were three. In 2018, it was estimated that 86 million Americans had watched it as children. As of 2022, it has won 222 Emmy Awards and 11 Grammy Awards, more than any other children's show. Sesame Street remains one of the longest-running shows in the world.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_50996", "text": "Sesame Street was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Foundation vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children's television show that would \"master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them,\" such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of US$8 million ($66 million in 2023 dollars) from the Carnegie Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the U.S. federal government to create and produce a new children's television show.Sesame Street was officially announced at a press conference on May 6, 1969. Joan Ganz Cooney, Children's Television Workshop's executive director, said that Sesame Street would use the techniques of commercial television programs to teach young children. Live shorts and animated cartoons would teach young children the alphabet, numbers, vocabulary, shapes, and basic reasoning skills. By repeating concepts throughout an episode, young children's interest would be held while they learn the concepts. Guest cameos would help attract older children and adults. Cooney said that the name Sesame Street came from the saying \"open sesame\", which gives the idea of a place where exciting things occur. The show was given an initial six-month run in order to determine whether it was effective and would continue to air.The program premiered on public television stations on November 10, 1969. It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research. Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy, and high ratings.\n\nAccording to writer Michael Davis, by the mid-1970s the show had become \"an American institution.\" The cast and crew expanded during this time, with emphasis on the hiring of women crew members and the addition of minorities to the cast. The show's success continued into the 1980s. In 1981, when the federal government withdrew its funding, CTW turned to and expanded other revenue sources, including its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing, and foreign broadcast income. Its curriculum has expanded to include more affective topics such as relationships, ethics and emotions. Many of its storylines have been inspired by the experiences of its writing staff, cast and crew\u2014most notably, the 1982 death of Will Lee, who played Mr. Hooper; and the marriage of Luis and Maria in 1988.By the end of the 1990s, the show faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in young children's viewing habits, competition from other shows, the development of cable television, and a drop in ratings. As the 21st century began, the show made major changes. Starting in 2002, its format became more narrative-focused and included ongoing storylines. After its 30th anniversary in 1999, due to the popularity of the Muppet Elmo, the show also incorporated a popular segment known as Elmo's World. In 2009, the show won the Outstanding Achievement Emmy for its 40 years on the air.In late 2015, in response to \"sweeping changes in the media business\" and as part of a five-year programming and development deal, premium television service HBO began airing first-run episodes of Sesame Street. The episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. The deal allowed Sesame Workshop to produce more episodes\u2014increasing from 18 to 35 per season\u2014and to create a spinoff series with the Sesame Street Muppets, and a new educational series.At its 50th anniversary in 2019, Sesame Street had produced over 4,500 episodes, two feature-length movies (Follow That Bird in 1985 and The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland in 1999), 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel has almost five million subscribers. It was announced in October 2019 that first-run episodes will move to HBO Max beginning with the show's 51st season in 2020.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50997", "text": "From its first episode, Sesame Street's format has utilized \"a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music,\" as well as animation and live-action short films. When it premiered, most researchers believed that young children did not have long attention spans, and the show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their attention. At first, its \"street scenes\"\u2014the action recorded on its set\u2014consisted of character-driven interactions. Rather than ongoing stories, they were written as individual, curriculum-based segments interrupted by \"inserts\" of puppet sketches, short films and animations. This structure allowed producers to use a mixture of styles and characters, and to vary its pace, presumably keeping it interesting to young viewers. However, by season 20, research showed that children were able to follow a story\u2014and the street scenes, while still interspersed with other segments, became evolving storylines.\n\nOn recommendations by child psychologists, the producers initially decided that the show's human actors and Muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse young children.

The new version focused on fewer characters, reduced pop culture references \"once included as winks for their parents\", and focused \"on a single backbone topic.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50996", "text": "Sesame Street was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Foundation vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children's television show that would \"master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them,\" such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of US$8 million ($66 million in 2023 dollars) from the Carnegie Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the U.S. federal government to create and produce a new children's television show.Sesame Street was officially announced at a press conference on May 6, 1969. Joan Ganz Cooney, Children's Television Workshop's executive director, said that Sesame Street would use the techniques of commercial television programs to teach young children. Live shorts and animated cartoons would teach young children the alphabet, numbers, vocabulary, shapes, and basic reasoning skills. By repeating concepts throughout an episode, young children's interest would be held while they learn the concepts. Guest cameos would help attract older children and adults. Cooney said that the name Sesame Street came from the saying \"open sesame\", which gives the idea of a place where exciting things occur. The show was given an initial six-month run in order to determine whether it was effective and would continue to air.The program premiered on public television stations on November 10, 1969. It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research. Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy, and high ratings.\n\nAccording to writer Michael Davis, by the mid-1970s the show had become \"an American institution.\" The cast and crew expanded during this time, with emphasis on the hiring of women crew members and the addition of minorities to the cast. The show's success continued into the 1980s. In 1981, when the federal government withdrew its funding, CTW turned to and expanded other revenue sources, including its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing, and foreign broadcast income. Its curriculum has expanded to include more affective topics such as relationships, ethics and emotions. Many of its storylines have been inspired by the experiences of its writing staff, cast and crew\u2014most notably, the 1982 death of Will Lee, who played Mr. Hooper; and the marriage of Luis and Maria in 1988.By the end of the 1990s, the show faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in young children's viewing habits, competition from other shows, the development of cable television, and a drop in ratings. As the 21st century began, the show made major changes. Starting in 2002, its format became more narrative-focused and included ongoing storylines. After its 30th anniversary in 1999, due to the popularity of the Muppet Elmo, the show also incorporated a popular segment known as Elmo's World. In 2009, the show won the Outstanding Achievement Emmy for its 40 years on the air.In late 2015, in response to \"sweeping changes in the media business\" and as part of a five-year programming and development deal, premium television service HBO began airing first-run episodes of Sesame Street. The episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. The deal allowed Sesame Workshop to produce more episodes\u2014increasing from 18 to 35 per season\u2014and to create a spinoff series with the Sesame Street Muppets, and a new educational series.At its 50th anniversary in 2019, Sesame Street had produced over 4,500 episodes, two feature-length movies (Follow That Bird in 1985 and The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland in 1999), 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel has almost five million subscribers. It was announced in October 2019 that first-run episodes will move to HBO Max beginning with the show's 51st season in 2020.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_50997", "text": "From its first episode, Sesame Street's format has utilized \"a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music,\" as well as animation and live-action short films. When it premiered, most researchers believed that young children did not have long attention spans, and the show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their attention. At first, its \"street scenes\"\u2014the action recorded on its set\u2014consisted of character-driven interactions. Rather than ongoing stories, they were written as individual, curriculum-based segments interrupted by \"inserts\" of puppet sketches, short films and animations. This structure allowed producers to use a mixture of styles and characters, and to vary its pace, presumably keeping it interesting to young viewers. However, by season 20, research showed that children were able to follow a story\u2014and the street scenes, while still interspersed with other segments, became evolving storylines.\n\nOn recommendations by child psychologists, the producers initially decided that the show's human actors and Muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse young children. When CTW tested the new show, they found that children paid attention during the Muppet segments, and that their interest was lost during the \"Street\" segments.

BBC television commissioned an opera for television from him in 1966 and, in 1968, he and Piper began work on the libretto. The work was completed by August 1970.\nThe premiere was recorded at Snape Maltings in November 1970 and first broadcast on BBC2 on 16 May 1971. The music is influenced by Britten's interest in twelve-tone serialist techniques. A large tuned percussion section anticipates the musical treatment of his next (and last) opera, Death in Venice. In addition to its being an expression of Britten's own pacifism, he was reported as saying that this opera was partly a response to the Vietnam War.The costumes were designed by Charles Knode, who also designed some of the costumes for Death in Venice.\nBritten had never owned a television at that time.

During the early stages of the album, Madonna was encouraged by her manager to work with Avicii and his team of songwriters. Together, they worked on seven songs and \"Devil Pray\" was composed after Madonna desired to talk about her experiences with drugs and quest for spirituality. Lyrically, the song deals with themes of drug addiction, sin, temptation, and the desire for salvation.\n\"Devil Pray\" is a techno-folk song, which combines elements of country-pop and has similarities with Madonna's own single \"Don't Tell Me\", Avicii's previous work and The Animals' version of the traditional folk song \"The House of the Rising Sun\". The song received high praise from critics for its musical elements, while also being highlighted for its self-conscious lyrics. However, there was some criticism towards the list of drugs used in the chorus. Following its release as a pre-ordered song from Rebel Heart, the song charted in many European territories, reaching the top-25 in Finland, Greece, Hungary and Lebanon.

In an interview with David Blaine for Interview, Madonna said of the song:\n\nIt's about how people take drugs to connect to God or to a higher level of consciousness.

But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the illusion of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you.

It was first performed in London on 15 April 1738. The Italian libretto was adapted by an unknown hand from that by Silvio Stampiglia (1664\u20131725) for an earlier opera of the same name by Giovanni Bononcini in 1694. Stampiglia's libretto was itself based on one by Nicol\u00f2 Minato (ca.1627\u20131698) that was set by Francesco Cavalli in 1654. The opera is set in Persia (modern-day Iran) about 470 BC and is very loosely based upon Xerxes I of Persia. Serse, originally sung by a mezzo-soprano castrato, is now usually performed by a female mezzo-soprano or countertenor.\nThe opening aria, \"Ombra mai fu\", sung by Xerxes to a plane tree (Platanus orientalis), is set to one of Handel's best-known melodies, and is often known as Handel's \"Largo\" (despite being marked \"larghetto\" in the score).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51064", "text": "In late 1737 the King's Theatre, London, commissioned Handel to write two new operas.

Inspired by Russian literary works and legend, Mussorgsky composed a \"musical picture\", St. John's Eve on Bald Mountain (Russian: \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435, romanized: Ivanova noch\u2032 na lysoy gore) on the theme of a Witches' Sabbath occurring at Bald Mountain on St. John's Eve, which he completed on that very night, 23 June 1867. Together with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko (1867), it is one of the first tone poems by a Russian composer.Although Mussorgsky was proud of his youthful effort, his mentor, Mily Balakirev, refused to perform it. To salvage what he considered worthy material, Mussorgsky attempted to insert his Bald Mountain music, recast for vocal soloists, chorus, and orchestra, into two subsequent projects\u2014the collaborative opera-ballet Mlada (1872), and the opera The Fair at Sorochyntsi (1880). However, Night on Bald Mountain was never performed in any form during Mussorgsky's lifetime.In 1886, five years after Mussorgsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov published an arrangement of the work, described as a \"fantasy for orchestra.\" Some musical scholars consider this version to be an original composition of Rimsky-Korsakov, albeit one based on Mussorgsky's last version of the music, for The Fair at Sorochyntsi:\n\nI need hardly remind the reader that the orchestral piece universally known as 'Mussorgsky's Night on the Bare Mountain' is an orchestral composition by Rimsky-Korsakov based on the later version of the Bare Mountain music which Mussorgsky prepared for Sorochintsy Fair.\nIt is through Rimsky-Korsakov's version that Night on Bald Mountain achieved lasting fame. Premiering in Saint Petersburg in 1886, the work became a concert favourite. Half a century later, the work obtained perhaps its greatest exposure through the Walt Disney animated film Fantasia (1940), featuring an arrangement by Leopold Stokowski, based on Rimsky-Korsakov's version.

It was written and produced by Madonna, Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid, with additional writing from MoZella and Toby Gad. Originally intended for a Valentine's Day 2015 release, the song was rush-released as the lead single from the album on December 20, 2014, by Interscope Records, after demos recorded for the album leaked on to the internet. An EDM, diva house, disco and electropop track on which Madonna experimented with different musical genres, \"Living for Love\" contains instrumentation from percussion and piano by singer Alicia Keys, along with a gospel choir. Madonna composed the track as a break-up song, however she wanted to deviate and make the lyrics as uplifting in nature, talking about counteracting negative thoughts with positive responses.\n\"Living for Love\" received positive reviews from critics, who praised its rhythm and lyrics, comparing it to her earlier works. They also considered the song a step-up from her last two lead singles. In the United States, it failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100, but became Madonna's 44th number-one hit on the Dance Club Songs chart, tying her with country singer George Strait as the act with most number-one singles on any Billboard chart. Although United Kingdom's BBC Radio 1 decided not to play it, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 26, becoming Madonna's 71st top-forty single, extending her record as the female artist with the most top-forty UK singles. \"Living for Love\" reached the top-twenty of the charts in Finland, Hungary, Israel, Japan and Lebanon, but was commercially unsuccessful in other nations.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by the French duo Julien Choquart and Camille Hirigoyen, together known as J.A.C.K., and was released in February 2015. The storyline incorporates mythological elements and shows Madonna as a matador, fighting her dancers dressed like minotaurs in a red circular stage. It had numerous costume changes, and was critically appreciated for its empowering theme and transcending gender roles. Madonna first performed the song in a similar matador theme at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards; it became the most-watched moment of the night. The second performance was at the 2015 Brit Awards, which made headlines due to the singer's wardrobe malfunction causing her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage.

It launched the careers of Josephine Baker, Adelaide Hall, Florence Mills, Fredi Washington and Paul Robeson, and was so popular it caused \"curtain time traffic jams\" on West 63rd Street.A 2016 adaptation, Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed, focused on the challenges of mounting the original production as well as its lasting effects on Broadway and race relations.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51093", "text": "The show's four writers were African-American Vaudeville veterans who first met in 1920 at a NAACP benefit held at the newly opened Dunbar Theatre in Philadelphia.

After finding a small source of funding, Shuffle Along toured New Jersey and Pennsylvania. However, with its limited budget, it was difficult to meet travel and production expenses. Cast members were rarely paid, and were \"trapped out of town when the box-office receipts could not cover train fare\". The budget was so low that cast members had to wear damaged and worn leftover costumes from other shows.

It was first performed at the Exposition Universelle on 15 May 1889 by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique on the Place du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris.\nEsclarmonde is perhaps Massenet's most ambitious work for the stage and is his most Wagnerian in style and scope. In orchestral coloring and structure of melody, however, it follows French traditions. The opera has been revived sporadically in the modern era, most notably during the 1970s with Joan Sutherland, conducted by Massenet champion Richard Bonynge. The role of Esclarmonde is notoriously difficult to sing, with challenging stratospheric coloratura passages.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51118", "text": "The story of the opera is based on the medieval chivalric tale Parth\u00e9nop\u00e9us de Blois, which was written in the middle of the 12th century by Denis Pyramus. In the original tale, however, the protagonist sorceress is called \"Melior\"; Esclarmonde's name was borrowed from another chanson de geste of the 13th century: Huon de Bordeaux. Although the Esclarmonde who appears in Huon is completely different from her operatic counterpart, Huon clearly served as the basis of at least part of the opera's libretto. Alfred Blau discovered Parth\u00e9nop\u00e9us in 1871 in the library of Blois, where he took refuge during the time of the Paris Commune. The libretto was originally called Pertinax; it was first drafted in prose and later versified by Blau's collaborator, Louis de Gramont. In that form \u2013 a romantic melodrama in five acts \u2013 it was offered in 1882 to the Belgian composer Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Gevaert, who, however, declined to set it. Soon the libretto found its way into Massenet's hands, though the precise circumstances in which this occurred remain a mystery.\nOn 1 August 1886, Massenet and his publisher Georges Hartmann attended a performance of Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival, an event which deeply impressed the composer and had a significant influence on his music. He had already seen the entire Ring cycle when it was produced in Brussels in 1883.\nIn his Memoirs, which were compiled in 1911 near the end of his life, Massenet ascribes the creation of the role of Esclarmonde to a chance meeting with Sibyl Sanderson sometime in the spring of 1887. He recounts how he was astonished by the range and capacity of her voice, realizing at once that she was the perfect choice for the heroine of his new opera, which he had begun to compose at the end of 1886. It is almost certain, however, that he had received the libretto to Esclarmonde much earlier than that, and the meeting with Sybil Sanderson served rather as an additional catalyst \u2013 a stimulus to complete the opera. The work was commissioned as a spectacular event to open the Paris Exposition of 1889. During the most intensive period of creation in the summer of 1887, Massenet moved into the Grand Hotel in Vevey, where Miss Sanderson was also staying; there he rehearsed with her each evening the various sections of his new opera as he composed them. The opera was completed by the end of 1888, and stage rehearsals started at Op\u00e9ra-Comique. Massenet dedicated the work to Sybil Sanderson in gratitude, allowing her signature to stand alongside his own in the manuscript of the score. Rodney Milnes suggests that Massenet's \"passion for his leading lady resulted in some of his most chromatically tortuous erotic writing\" while observing that the operatic events are \"dispatched in just over two hours of music\". Crichton notes also the skill of Massenet in writing for male voices - both the tenors Roland and \u00c9n\u00e9as, but also for the Bishop, the Emperor Phorcas and the King. He also points to the scoring of low instruments, where the bass clarinet and tuba show \"an individual application of lessons well learned from the later parts of The Ring, used with a discretion unlikely to upset the general public of the day\".Seven black and white projections for the scenes of sorcery, using the magic lantern technology, were created by Eug\u00e8ne Grasset, who also illustrated the original vocal score.After a very successful initial run, however, the opera disappeared from the repertoire and fell into almost complete oblivion. Soon afterwards Sybil Sanderson fell ill. When she died around the start of the 20th century, it seems that Massenet himself lost interest in the opera he had written for her and he discouraged any further productions. The work was not revived until 1923, well after the composer's death. Some short-lived revivals then followed, either staged or in concert performance. It was only in the 1970s that the efforts of Richard Bonynge and Joan Sutherland brought Esclarmonde back to life.

In the original tale, however, the protagonist sorceress is called \"Melior\"; Esclarmonde's name was borrowed from another chanson de geste of the 13th century: Huon de Bordeaux. Although the Esclarmonde who appears in Huon is completely different from her operatic counterpart, Huon clearly served as the basis of at least part of the opera's libretto. Alfred Blau discovered Parth\u00e9nop\u00e9us in 1871 in the library of Blois, where he took refuge during the time of the Paris Commune. The libretto was originally called Pertinax; it was first drafted in prose and later versified by Blau's collaborator, Louis de Gramont. In that form \u2013 a romantic melodrama in five acts \u2013 it was offered in 1882 to the Belgian composer Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Gevaert, who, however, declined to set it.

It became very popular in Britain during World War II.\nThe concerto is written in imitation of the style of Sergei Rachmaninoff.

Beyond the noh source dramatic material, Britten incorporated elements of noh treatment of theatrical time into this composition. Curlew River marked a departure in style for the remainder of the composer's creative life, paving the way for such works as Owen Wingrave, Death in Venice and the Third String Quartet.\nPlomer translated the setting of the original into a Christian parable, set in early medieval times near the fictional Curlew River, in the fenlands of East Anglia. Peter F. Alexander has investigated in detail the librettist's contribution to the work, through study of the letters between Plomer and Britten. Mikiko Ishi has done a comparative study of the 'weeping mother' figures in Sumidagawa, Curlew River, and various religious plays from medieval Europe. Daniel Albright has examined Britten's and Plomer's adaptations of aspects of the Sumidagawa original into the context of their own cultural and religious backgrounds in the creation of Curlew River.Under Colin Graham's direction, the work was premiered on 13 June 1964 at St Bartholomew's Church, Orford, Suffolk, England, by the English Opera Group.

The work was written between 1872 and 1880 in St. Petersburg, Russia. The composer wrote the libretto based on historical sources.  The opera was almost finished in piano score when the composer died in 1881, but the orchestration was almost entirely lacking.\nLike Mussorgsky's earlier Boris Godunov, Khovanshchina deals with an episode in Russian history, first brought to the composer's attention by his friend the critic Vladimir Stasov. It concerns the rebellion of Prince Ivan Khovansky, the Old Believers, and the Muscovite Streltsy against the regent Sofia Alekseyevna and the two young Tsars Peter the Great and Ivan V, who were attempting to institute Westernizing reforms in Russia. Khovansky had helped to foment the Moscow Uprising of 1682, which resulted in Sofia becoming regent on behalf of her younger brother Ivan and half-brother Peter, who were crowned joint Tsars. In the fall of 1682 Prince Ivan Khovansky turned against Sofia. Supported by the Old Believers and the Streltsy, Khovansky \u2013 who supposedly wanted to install himself as the new regent \u2013 demanded the reversal of Patriarch Nikon's reforms. Sofia and her court were forced to flee Moscow. Eventually, Sofia managed to suppress the so-called Khovanshchina (Khovansky affair) with the help of the diplomat Fyodor Shaklovity, who succeeded Khovansky as leader of the Muscovite Streltsy. With the rebellion crushed, the Old Believers committed mass suicide (in the opera, at least).\nNikolai Rimsky-Korsakov completed, revised, and orchestrated Khovanshchina in 1881\u20131882. In 1958 Dmitri Shostakovich was commissioned to revise and reorchestrate the opera for a film version released the following year. It is the Shostakovich version which is now usually performed. In 1913 Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel made their own arrangement at Sergei Diaghilev's request. When Feodor Chaliapin refused to sing the part of Dosifey in any other orchestration than Rimsky-Korsakov's, Diaghilev's company employed a mixture of orchestrations which did not prove successful. The Stravinsky-Ravel orchestration was forgotten, except for Stravinsky's finale, which is still sometimes used.\nAlthough the background of the opera comprises the Moscow Uprising of 1682 and the Khovansky affair a few months later, its main themes are the struggle between progressive and reactionary political factions during the minority of Tsar Peter the Great and the passing of old Muscovy before Peter's westernizing reforms.

The manager of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s, Th\u00e9odore Cogniard, was penny-pinching and unsympathetic to Offenbach's taste for lavish staging and large-scale orchestration, and the two leading ladies \u2013 Hortense Schneider and L\u00e9a Silly \u2013 engaged in a running feud with each other. The feud became public knowledge and provoked increasing interest in the piece among Parisian theatregoers.The opera opened on 17 December 1864. The first night audience was enthusiastic but the reviews were mixed, and box-office business was sluggish for a few subsequent performances until supportive reviews by leading writers such as Henri Rochefort and Jules Vall\u00e8s made their impression on the public,  after which the piece drew large audiences from fashionable bohemians as well as respectable citizens from the wealthy arrondissements. It ran through most of 1865 (with a summer break in mid-run), and was replaced in February 1866 with Barbe-bleue, starring the same leading players, except for Silly, with whom Schneider declined ever to appear with again.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51190", "text": "Place: Sparta and the shores of the sea\nTime: Before the Trojan War.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is sometimes referred to as a \"ragtime opera\", though Joplin did not refer to it as such and it encompasses a wide range of musical styles. The music of Treemonisha includes an overture and prelude, along with various recitatives, choruses, small ensemble pieces, a ballet, and a few arias.The opera was largely unknown before its first complete performance in 1972. Joplin was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1976 for Treemonisha. The performance was called a \"semimiracle\" by music historian Gilbert Chase, who said Treemonisha \"bestowed its creative vitality and moral message upon many thousands of delighted listeners and viewers\" when it was recreated. The musical style of the opera is the popular romantic one of the early 20th century. It has been described as \"charming and piquant and ... deeply moving\", with elements of black folk songs and dances, including a kind of pre-blues music, spirituals, and a call-and-response style scene featuring a preacher and congregation.The opera celebrates African-American music and culture while stressing that education is the salvation of African Americans.

Backed by John Lennon's \"I Am the Walrus\", it was issued as a non-album single in November 1967, the group's first release since the death of their manager, Brian Epstein. The single was commercially successful around the world, topping charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Canada, Australia and several other countries.\nMcCartney later said that the lyrics take duality as their theme. The song originated when, in response to a question from Beatles aide Alistair Taylor about songwriting, McCartney sat down at a harmonium and asked Taylor to say the opposite of whatever he said. The completed song includes a musical coda, which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967. Unimpressed with the composition, Lennon pushed for \"I Am the Walrus\" to be the single's A-side, before reluctantly accepting that \"Hello, Goodbye\" was the more commercial-sounding of the two sides. The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song, one of which was shown on The Ed Sullivan Show in America.

The English lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks. It was first recorded by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto in 1960 for his album O Amor, o Sorriso e a Flor.The song title refers to the main melody line, which at first consists of a long series of notes of a single tone (typically D, as played in the key of G) played over a descending chord progression in a bossa nova rhythm. The first eight measures consist of D, followed by four measures of G, and then four measures of D. This is followed by eight measures of a more conventional, scalar melody line.This well-known song first reached a wide audience on the Grammy-winning bossa nova LP Jazz Samba (Getz/Byrd/Betts), which reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 in 1963. Another well-known release is the Sergio Mendes-Brasil '66 version, in medley with \"Spanish Flea\".The song was featured in a prominent scene of \"A Man Without a Skin\", a 1963 episode of Naked City. The song was mentioned in the song \"Astrud\" by Basia.

The series was broadcast by NBC from September 22, 1958, to 1960 and by ABC in 1960\u20131961. The series was created by Blake Edwards, who, on occasion, was also writer (for 39 episodes) and director (for 9 episodes).According to Vincent Terrace, Peter Gunn was the first detective series whose character was created especially for television, instead of adapted from other media.The series is probably best remembered today for its music, including the iconic \"Peter Gunn Theme\", which was nominated for an Emmy Award and two Grammys for Henry Mancini. Subsequently it has been performed and recorded by many jazz, rock and blues musicians. The progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer recorded the song adding synthesizers.

Whereas other gumshoes are often coarse and vulgar, Gunn is a sophisticate with expensive tastes. A contemporary article in Life noted that Edwards \"deliberately tailored the part after the famous movie smoothie Cary Grant\".Gunn operates in a gloomy waterfront city, the name and location of which is not revealed in the series. He often visits Mother's, a smokey, wharfside jazz club that Gunn uses as his \"office\", usually meeting new clients there. Gunn has a reputation for integrity and being among the best investigators; he has many reliable informants and is well-connected. His reputation is so good, the police occasionally ask him for help or advice. He sometimes works cases out of state and occasionally out of the country. Gunn was observed in \"Murder on the Midway\" as \"wearing $30 shoes, a $200 suit and carrying a solid gold cigarette lighter\". Gunn drives a 1958 two-tone DeSoto two-door hardtop in the first few episodes of the first season, then a 1959 Plymouth Fury convertible with a white top and a car phone. In the third season Gunn drives a 1960 white Plymouth Fury convertible with a car phone, later changing to a 1961 Plymouth Fury convertible.\nGunn's girlfriend, Edie Hart (Lola Albright), is a sultry singer employed at Mother's; she opens her own restaurant and nightclub in season 3, named Edie's. Gunn's pet name for Edie is \"Silly\". Herschel Bernardi costarred as Lieutenant Jacoby, a jaded veteran  police detective and friend of Gunn who works at the 13th Precinct. Occasionally he refers people to Gunn as clients. He is especially notable for his crackling, cynical sardonic wit. In 1959, Bernardi received his only Emmy nomination for the role. Hope Emerson appeared as Mother, who had been a singer and piano player in speakeasies during Prohibition. She received an Emmy nomination for the role. For the second season, Mother was played by Minerva Urecal, following the departure of Emerson for a starring role in The Dennis O'Keefe Show.

He often visits Mother's, a smokey, wharfside jazz club that Gunn uses as his \"office\", usually meeting new clients there. Gunn has a reputation for integrity and being among the best investigators; he has many reliable informants and is well-connected. His reputation is so good, the police occasionally ask him for help or advice. He sometimes works cases out of state and occasionally out of the country. Gunn was observed in \"Murder on the Midway\" as \"wearing $30 shoes, a $200 suit and carrying a solid gold cigarette lighter\". Gunn drives a 1958 two-tone DeSoto two-door hardtop in the first few episodes of the first season, then a 1959 Plymouth Fury convertible with a white top and a car phone.

In his analysis of the structure, one indication of the complexity of the music is that the first scene of over 30 bars contains 9 meter changes and 16 tempo changes.

Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage is widely considered as the masterwork and summation of Liszt's musical style. The third volume is notable as an example of his later style. Composed well after the first two volumes, it displays less virtuosity and more harmonic experimentation.\n\nThe title Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage refers to Goethe's famous novel of self-realization, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, and especially its sequel Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years (whose original title Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre meant Years of Wandering or Years of Pilgrimage, the latter being used for its first French translation). Liszt clearly places these compositions in line with the Romantic literature of his time, prefacing most pieces with a literary passage from writers such as Schiller, Byron or Senancour, and, in an introduction to the entire work, writing: Having recently travelled to many new countries, through different settings and places consecrated by history and poetry; having felt that the phenomena of nature and their attendant sights did not pass before my eyes as pointless images but stirred deep emotions in my soul, and that between us a vague but immediate relationship had established itself, an undefined but real rapport, an inexplicable but undeniable communication, I have tried to portray in music a few of my strongest sensations and most lively impressions.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51376", "text": "There have been numerous recordings made of the suites, in both complete and incomplete form.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51377", "text": "Edition Peters publishes the complete score, with the first volume of the trilogy \"Suisse\" published together with the \"Trois Morceaux suisses\" for the first time, in line with the composer\u2019s original intention to combine all his Swiss-inspired character pieces into a single volume.

Set in the 1470s during a time of war between the Turks and Venetians, the work was commissioned by the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. Della Valle based his libretto on his earlier play Anna Erizo. The name of the title character, Maometto II, refers to the real-life Ottoman Sultan and conqueror of Constantinople Mehmed II, who lived from 1432 to 1481.\nRegarded \"in some ways [as his] most ambitious opera\" and as \"the best of Rossini's Neapolitan operas\", Maometto II failed to find an audience in Naples and, \"to help ensure [its] success in Venice and Paris, he smoothed out the most audacious elements of the score\". Venice first saw it on 22 December 1822 and then, translated into French and changed significantly, it was presented as Le si\u00e8ge de Corinthe in 1826.\nUntil the preparation of the critical editions of Maometto II, the composer's original intentions remained obscure. The introduction to an early version prepared by musicologists Philip Gossett and Patricia Brauner (along with Claudio Scimone) notes some of the difficulties of determining what Rossini had intended:\n\nExtraordinary for its dramatic power and the nobility of its musical content, Maometto II is also an opera that poses many textual problems, since Rossini's successive revisions were made directly in the autograph score. Using copies of the score dating back to the original productions of each of these versions, the critical edition reconstructs the text of the first version (Naples, 1820), which reflects the composer's original intentions.\nA new critical edition was prepared under the supervision of Philip Gossett and edited by Dutch scholar Hans Schellevis.

{"id": "86_365", "question": "What composer wrote Symphony No. 1?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_51447", "text": "The Symphony No. 1 in D major by Gustav Mahler was mainly composed between late 1887 and March 1888, though it incorporates music Mahler had composed for previous works. It was composed while Mahler was second conductor at the Leipzig Opera in Germany. Although in his letters Mahler almost always referred to the work as a symphony, the first two performances described it as a symphonic poem and as a tone poem in symphonic form, respectively. The work was premi\u00e8red at the Vigad\u00f3 Concert Hall in Budapest, Hungary, in 1889, but was not well-received. Mahler made some major revisions for the second performance, given at Hamburg, Germany, in October 1893; further alterations were made in the years prior to the first publication, in late 1898. Some modern performances and recordings give the work the title Titan, despite the fact that Mahler only used this label for the second and third performances, and never after the work had reached its definitive four-movement form in 1896.\nMahler conducted more performances of this symphony than of any of his later works.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51448", "text": "The symphony's movements are arranged in a fairly typical four-movement setup. Conventionally, the minuet and trio would be the third movement and the slow movement the second, but Mahler has them switched, which was also sometimes done by Ludwig van Beethoven. The keys are D major for the first movement, A major for the second, D minor for the third, and F minor for the last, with a grand finale at the end in D major. The usage of F minor for the last movement was a dramatic break from conventional usage.\nFor the first three performances (Budapest, Hamburg and Weimar), an additional movement, Blumine (flower piece), was played between the first and second movements of the piece as it now stands. This movement was originally written in June 1884 as the opening piece \u2013 \"Ein St\u00e4ndchen am Rhein\" \u2013 of Mahler's incidental music for a series of seven tableaux vivants based on Joseph Victor von Scheffel's poem Der Trompeter von S\u00e4ckingen, which, Blumine aside, has since been lost. The addition of this movement appears to have been an afterthought, and Mahler discarded it after the Weimar performance in 1894; it was rediscovered in 1966 by Donald Mitchell. The following year, Benjamin Britten conducted the first performance of it since Mahler's time at the Aldeburgh Festival. The symphony is almost never played with this movement included today, although it is sometimes heard separately. In the 1970s, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra made the first recording of the symphony by a major orchestra to include Blumine. Some 20 recordings exist that include Blumine; however, most of them combine it with the revised edition of the other movements, thus making a \"blended\" version of the symphony that was at no time authorised by Mahler.\nNevertheless, Mahler quotes the main theme from the Blumine movement in two subsequent movements. It appears early in the second movement; he also quotes it in the final movement, as well as other themes from the other movements, which is in keeping with Beethoven's own practice in his Symphony No. 9 of quoting themes from the first, second, and third movements early in the final movement. Beethoven gave the impression of rejecting the earlier themes, after he quotes them, and then introduces the famous \"Ode to Joy\" theme. The five-movement version generally runs around an hour, just as Mahler's later symphonies (except for Symphony No. 4) are an hour or longer in length. Mahler followed a precedent, established by Beethoven in his ninth symphony and by Anton Bruckner in many of his symphonies, of lengthier, more detailed development of the themes, usually resulting in a performance time of an hour or more.\nUnder this early five-movement scheme, the work was envisioned by Mahler as a large symphonic poem in two parts, and he wrote a programme to describe the piece, but without adding any further title for the 1889 Budapest premiere. The first part consisted of the first two movements of the symphony as it is now known plus Blumine, and the second consisted of the funeral-march and finale. For the 1893 Hamburg and 1894 Weimar performances, Mahler gave the piece the title Titan after the novel by Jean Paul, although Mahler specified that the piece was not in any way \"about\" the book; the nickname is often used today, but properly only applies to those two versions.The opening of the third movement features a double bass soloist performing a variation on the theme of \"Fr\u00e8re Jacques\", distinguishing it as one of the few symphonic pieces to use the instrument in such a manner. Mahler uses the song, which he cites as \"Bruder Martin\", changed from major to minor, thus giving the piece the character of a funeral march. The mode change to minor is not an invention by Mahler, as is often believed, but rather the way this round was sung in the 19th and early 20th century in Austria.

Mahler uses the song, which he cites as \"Bruder Martin\", changed from major to minor, thus giving the piece the character of a funeral march. The mode change to minor is not an invention by Mahler, as is often believed, but rather the way this round was sung in the 19th and early 20th century in Austria.

Brahms began work on the piece in 1878 and completed it in 1881 while in Pressbaum near Vienna. It took him three years to work on this concerto, which indicates that he was always self-critical. He wrote to Clara Schumann: \"I want to tell you that I have written a very small piano concerto with a very small and pretty scherzo.\" Ironically, he was describing a huge piece. This concerto is dedicated to his teacher, Eduard Marxsen. The public premiere of the concerto was given in Budapest on 9 November 1881, with Brahms as soloist and the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra, and was an immediate success. He proceeded to perform the piece in many cities across Europe.The piece is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (B\u266d), 2 bassoons, 4 horns (initially 2 in B\u266d bass, 2 in F), 2 trumpets (B\u266d), timpani (B\u266d and F, A and D in second movement) and strings. (The trumpets and timpani are used only in the first two movements, which is unusual.)The piece is in four movements, rather than the three typical of concertos in the Classical and Romantic periods:\n\nThe additional movement results in a concerto considerably longer than most other concertos written up to that time, with typical performances lasting around 50 minutes. Upon its completion, Brahms sent its score to his friend, the surgeon and violinist Theodor Billroth to whom Brahms had dedicated his first two string quartets, describing the work as \"some little piano pieces.\" Brahms even described the stormy scherzo as a \"little wisp of a scherzo.\"The autograph manuscript of the concerto is preserved in the Hamburg State and University Library Carl von Ossietzky.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51458", "text": "The work opens with the following horn call, which provides much of the thematic material for the first movement:", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51458", "text": "The work opens with the following horn call, which provides much of the thematic material for the first movement:", "hasanswer": false}]}

The work reflects the creators' observations of the hippie counterculture and sexual revolution of the late 1960s, and several of its songs became anthems of the anti-Vietnam War peace movement. The musical's profanity, its depiction of the use of illegal drugs, its treatment of sexuality, its irreverence for the American flag, and its nude scene caused much comment and controversy. The work broke new ground in musical theatre by defining the genre of \"rock musical\", using a racially integrated cast, and inviting the audience onstage for a \"Be-In\" finale.Hair tells the story of the \"tribe\", a group of politically active, long-haired hippies of the \"Age of Aquarius\" living a bohemian life in New York City and fighting against conscription into the Vietnam War.  Claude, his good friend Berger, their roommate Sheila and their friends struggle to balance their young lives, loves and the sexual revolution, with their rebellion against the war and their conservative parents and society.  Ultimately, Claude must decide whether to resist the draft as his friends have done, or to serve in Vietnam, compromising his pacifist principles and risking his life.\nAfter an off-Broadway debut on October 17, 1967, at Joseph Papp's Public Theater and a run at the Cheetah nightclub from December 1967 through January 1968, the show opened on Broadway in April 1968 and ran for 1,750 performances.  Simultaneous productions in cities across the United States and Europe followed shortly thereafter, including a successful London production that ran for 1,997 performances. Since then, numerous productions have been staged around the world, spawning dozens of recordings of the musical, including the 3 million-selling original Broadway cast recording.

It was completed in 1948 and premiered the next year. Blitzstein chose this source in order to make a strong statement against capitalism. In three acts, the musical style has been described as new American verismo, abounding in the use of spirituals, Victorian parlour music, dance forms, ragtime, aria and large, symphonic score.Borrowing from both opera and Broadway styles, in a manner similar to Leonard Bernstein in Trouble in Tahiti and Virgil Thomson in Four Saints in Three Acts, Regina has been said to straddle the line between entertainment and so-called serious music. Hellman gave Blitzstein considerable advice and strongly objected to any departures from the play's structure. Blitzstein planned an elaborate choral prologue, but Hellman convinced him to shorten and finally jettison it. Before the premiere, producer Cheryl Crawford insisted on still further cuts to the opera, asking Blitzstein to reduce the work from three acts to two.

He was loved by the common people. He performed in street theatres and other open air venues in small portable booths or behind screens that could be easily assembled and just as easily disassembled. After the Russian Revolution, Soviet authorities forced Petrushka indoors. They wanted to be better able to monitor his subversiveness.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51496", "text": "The gestation of Petrushka was not a straightforward matter. While completing The Firebird during the spring of 1910, Stravinsky had a \"vision\" of a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of The Rite of Spring. Immediately following the stunning success of The Firebird in June 1910, Diaghilev approached Stravinsky about a new ballet; the composer proposed the Rite theme. Diaghilev accepted in principle and suggested that the premiere might take place during the Paris season of the Ballets Russes during the spring of 1912.\nAt the end of September 1910, Diaghilev went to visit Stravinsky in Clarens, Switzerland, where he was living at the time. Expecting to discuss the new ballet, Diaghilev was astonished to find Stravinsky hard at work on a totally different project. Stravinsky, it seems, had had another vision: \"I saw a man in evening dress, with long hair, the musician or poet of the romantic tradition. He placed several heteroclite objects on the keyboard and rolled them up and down. At this the orchestra exploded with the most vehement protestations \u2013 hammer blows, in fact \u2026\"Later, Stravinsky wrote: \"[i]n composing the music, I had in my mind a distinct picture of a puppet, suddenly endowed with life, exasperating the patience of the orchestra with diabolical cascades of arpeggios.

Whatever his name, he is a trickster, a rebel, and a wife beater. He enforces moral justice with a wooden club, speaks in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, and argues with the devil. His plays were formulaic and subversive. They repeated key scenes from one play to another. The plays usually ended with a dog, a policeman, or the devil dragging him away.Empress Anna Ivanovna brought marionettes to Russia in the 18th century. These puppets were an amusement for the aristocracy. Rod puppets were an Asian import. They performed religious plays, mostly at Christmas. Petrushka, however, was a hand puppet. He was loved by the common people. He performed in street theatres and other open air venues in small portable booths or behind screens that could be easily assembled and just as easily disassembled.

They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of The Rite of Spring. Immediately following the stunning success of The Firebird in June 1910, Diaghilev approached Stravinsky about a new ballet; the composer proposed the Rite theme. Diaghilev accepted in principle and suggested that the premiere might take place during the Paris season of the Ballets Russes during the spring of 1912.\nAt the end of September 1910, Diaghilev went to visit Stravinsky in Clarens, Switzerland, where he was living at the time. Expecting to discuss the new ballet, Diaghilev was astonished to find Stravinsky hard at work on a totally different project. Stravinsky, it seems, had had another vision: \"I saw a man in evening dress, with long hair, the musician or poet of the romantic tradition.

In 2014, BBC Radio 6 Music listeners voted it their favourite Britpop song in an online poll. In a 2015 Rolling Stone readers' poll it was voted the greatest Britpop song.The song is a critique of the wealthy wanting to be \"like common people\" \u2013 ascribing glamour to poverty. This phenomenon is referred to as slumming or \"class tourism\". The song was written by the band members Jarvis Cocker, Nick Banks, Candida Doyle, Steve Mackey and Russell Senior. Cocker had conceived the song after meeting a Greek art student while studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London (the college and the student feature in the lyrics). He came up with the tune on a Casiotone keyboard he had bought in a music store in Notting Hill, west London.\nJustin Myers of the Official Charts Company wrote the song \"was typical Pulp \u2013 a biting satire of posh people 'roughing it' and acting like tourists by hanging with the \"common people\". Jarvis delivered his scathing putdown with glee, in an iconic music video, directed by Pedro Romhanyi, featuring actress Sadie Frost as the posh woman on the receiving end of Jarvis' acid tongue.\" Pulp first performed the song in public during the band's set at the Reading Festival in August 1994.

The single reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart on 8 June and stayed there for six weeks. Without much promotion, it reached number 5 on the US Billboard Hot 100. One of the anthems of the 1967 Summer of Love, it is one of the most commercially successful singles in history, having sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. In the years since, \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" has become an enduring classic, with more than 1,000 known cover versions by other artists.With its Bach-derived instrumental melody, soulful vocals, melancholic tone, and unusual lyrics, the music of \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" was composed by Gary Brooker and Matthew Fisher, while the lyrics were written by Keith Reid. Originally, the writing credits only listed Brooker and Reid. In 2009, Fisher won co-writing credit for the music in a unanimous ruling from the Law Lords.\nIn 1977, the song was named joint winner (along with Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\") of \"The Best British Pop Single 1952\u20131977\" at the Brit Awards. In 1998, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The plot indicates the influence of Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user. Both centre on medieval knights struggling between a life of sensual indulgence and ideal love. Edgar is \"torn between the sacred love of Fidelia and the profane love of Tigrana\"; Wagner's hero indulges himself with Venus while pining for the love of Elizabeth. The gypsy-like figure of Tigrana (supposedly the child of \"wandering Moors\") also parallels the anti-heroine of Bizet's Carmen.\nThe original version had four acts and was tepidly received. In January 1890, Ricordi published a revised version, including a different ending for act 2.

The libretto was to be an adaptation and partial translation of the composer's original 1843 Italian opera, I Lombardi alla prima crociata. It was the one opera which he regarded as the most suitable for being translated into French and, taking Eug\u00e8ne Scribe's advice, Verdi agreed that a French libretto was to be prepared by Alphonse Royer and Gustave Va\u00ebz, who had  written the libretto for Donizetti's most successful French opera, La favorite.  The opera received its premiere performance at the Salle Le Peletier in Paris on 26 November 1847. The maiden production was designed by Paul Lormier (costumes), Charles S\u00e9chan, Jules Di\u00e9terle and \u00c9douard Desplechin (sets of Act I, Act II, scene 1, Act III scene 1, and Act IV), and Charles-Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry (sets for Act II, scene 2 and Act III, scene 2).", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51566", "text": "The director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra, L\u00e9on Pillet, had invited Verdi to compose an opera for the company in November 1845 and February 1846, but initially Verdi declined. This was the composer's first encounter with the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique, as the Paris Op\u00e9ra was officially known. Among 19th-century Italian composers, there had been an increasing interest in writing for Paris, where the combination of money, prestige, and flexibility of style were appealing.  Musicologist Julian Budden provides examples of those composers who had crossed the Alps, the most well-known being Rossini and Donizetti (as well as Vincenzo Bellini who, before he died in 1835, was planning a French grand opera.)\nHowever, Verdi had given some consideration of the idea of adapting one of the librettos written by Temistocle Solera in earlier years, librettos which music historian David Kimball regards as having something of grand opera in their structure.After conducting the premiere of I masnadieri in London and within a week of Verdi's arrival in Paris on 27 July 1847, he received his first commission from the company, agreeing to adapt I Lombardi to a new French libretto. The adaptation meant that Verdi could \"try his hand at grand opera\" without having to write something entirely new, a strategy which both Donizetti and Rossini had employed for their Paris debuts.There are significant changes in the location and action of the French version of Lombardi, especially given the need to set the story for French involvement in the First Crusade of 1095\u20131099. Characters' names changed from Italian to French and one, Arvino (who was renamed as the Count of Toulouse, though elements of his character were given to the principal tenor role, Gaston) was now a baritone instead of a tenor. Several roles present in the original version were deleted, including the leading tenor role of Oronte. In the restructured libretto, the central romance is given more prominence, and a happier ending.  In addition, Verdi added a standard ballet and new music, but re-shaped much of the structure by removing inappropriate material he felt to be weak.  As musicologist Roger Parker notes, \"only a few of the original numbers [remain] in their former positions.\"  Verdi himself described the new work as having \"transformed [I Lombardi] out of recognition\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51567", "text": "During this period in Paris, Verdi was to work on and complete the score for J\u00e9rusalem. From Paris, he fulfilled the obligation to write the opera Il corsaro from a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave which took place in Trieste in October 1848. Also, he worked with Salvadore Cammarano on two librettos, one for La battaglia di Legnano (then attend its January 1849 Rome premiere), the other being Luisa Miller which was presented in Naples in December 1849 after Verdi's return to Italy.\nMany writers, including Baldini and Frank Walker, have speculated on supposed relationships which Verdi, a man then close to (and then in) his thirties, might have had (or did have) with women in the years following his first wife's death.  However, the only real evidence, visible in Walker's The Man Verdi and Baldini's The Story of Giuseppe Verdi, relates to Giuseppina Strepponi, the singer who Verdi first encountered at the time he was writing Nabucco in 1842.  She sang the first Abigaille, and continued on and off with that role in spite of her declining voice up to her retirement and move to Paris in October 1846 where she became a singing teacher in November and also planned a concert of Verdi's music for the following June.\nIt is known that the two had conducted friendly correspondence over several years and that Strepponi had offered various pieces of advice to the composer. As is known, Verdi and Emanuele Muzio had arrived in Paris on 2 June 1847 en route to London for I masnadieri, and the composer had sent Muzio on to London to make sure that Jenny Lind, about whom rumours of her reluctance to come to England abounded, was already present and ready to go to work.  While Verdi remained in the city, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz in her massive biography of the composer, speculates that Verdi saw her in the three days he was present,.On 27 July 1847, having left London, Verdi returned to Paris.

This is described by British music critic Andrew Porter as \"one of the more romantic discoveries of recent years\".Baldini tells us that \"at the end of 1847 Verdi rented a little house in Passy, and went to live there with Giuseppina\", but Phillips-Matz does not go so far, noting only that \"he may have moved into her apartment or a separate apartment in her building\", but later does confirm the move to Passy, dating it to June 1848.However, the couple were to remain together for many years, and when the time came to leave Paris, Verdi left in late July and \"made straight for Busseto to wait for her there\", while it appear that Strepponi visited her family in Florence and Pavia before joining him.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51566", "text": "The director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra, L\u00e9on Pillet, had invited Verdi to compose an opera for the company in November 1845 and February 1846, but initially Verdi declined. This was the composer's first encounter with the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique, as the Paris Op\u00e9ra was officially known. Among 19th-century Italian composers, there had been an increasing interest in writing for Paris, where the combination of money, prestige, and flexibility of style were appealing.  Musicologist Julian Budden provides examples of those composers who had crossed the Alps, the most well-known being Rossini and Donizetti (as well as Vincenzo Bellini who, before he died in 1835, was planning a French grand opera.)\nHowever, Verdi had given some consideration of the idea of adapting one of the librettos written by Temistocle Solera in earlier years, librettos which music historian David Kimball regards as having something of grand opera in their structure.After conducting the premiere of I masnadieri in London and within a week of Verdi's arrival in Paris on 27 July 1847, he received his first commission from the company, agreeing to adapt I Lombardi to a new French libretto. The adaptation meant that Verdi could \"try his hand at grand opera\" without having to write something entirely new, a strategy which both Donizetti and Rossini had employed for their Paris debuts.There are significant changes in the location and action of the French version of Lombardi, especially given the need to set the story for French involvement in the First Crusade of 1095\u20131099. Characters' names changed from Italian to French and one, Arvino (who was renamed as the Count of Toulouse, though elements of his character were given to the principal tenor role, Gaston) was now a baritone instead of a tenor. Several roles present in the original version were deleted, including the leading tenor role of Oronte. In the restructured libretto, the central romance is given more prominence, and a happier ending.  In addition, Verdi added a standard ballet and new music, but re-shaped much of the structure by removing inappropriate material he felt to be weak.  As musicologist Roger Parker notes, \"only a few of the original numbers [remain] in their former positions.\"  Verdi himself described the new work as having \"transformed [I Lombardi] out of recognition\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51567", "text": "During this period in Paris, Verdi was to work on and complete the score for J\u00e9rusalem. From Paris, he fulfilled the obligation to write the opera Il corsaro from a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave which took place in Trieste in October 1848. Also, he worked with Salvadore Cammarano on two librettos, one for La battaglia di Legnano (then attend its January 1849 Rome premiere), the other being Luisa Miller which was presented in Naples in December 1849 after Verdi's return to Italy.\nMany writers, including Baldini and Frank Walker, have speculated on supposed relationships which Verdi, a man then close to (and then in) his thirties, might have had (or did have) with women in the years following his first wife's death.  However, the only real evidence, visible in Walker's The Man Verdi and Baldini's The Story of Giuseppe Verdi, relates to Giuseppina Strepponi, the singer who Verdi first encountered at the time he was writing Nabucco in 1842.  She sang the first Abigaille, and continued on and off with that role in spite of her declining voice up to her retirement and move to Paris in October 1846 where she became a singing teacher in November and also planned a concert of Verdi's music for the following June.\nIt is known that the two had conducted friendly correspondence over several years and that Strepponi had offered various pieces of advice to the composer. As is known, Verdi and Emanuele Muzio had arrived in Paris on 2 June 1847 en route to London for I masnadieri, and the composer had sent Muzio on to London to make sure that Jenny Lind, about whom rumours of her reluctance to come to England abounded, was already present and ready to go to work.  While Verdi remained in the city, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz in her massive biography of the composer, speculates that Verdi saw her in the three days he was present,.On 27 July 1847, having left London, Verdi returned to Paris.

The text was compiled from the King James Bible and the Coverdale Psalter by Charles Jennens. It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere a year later. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music.\nHandel's reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; Messiah was his sixth work in this genre. Although its structure resembles that of opera, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens's text is an extended reflection on Jesus as the Messiah called Christ. The text begins in Part I with prophecies by Isaiah and others, and moves to the annunciation to the shepherds, the only \"scene\" taken from the Gospels. In Part II, Handel concentrates on the Passion of Jesus and ends with the Hallelujah chorus. In Part III he covers Paul's teachings on the resurrection of the dead and Christ's glorification in heaven.\nHandel wrote Messiah for modest vocal and instrumental forces, with optional alternate settings for many of the individual numbers. In the years after his death, the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale, with giant orchestras and choirs. In other efforts to update it, its orchestration was revised and amplified, such as Mozart's Der Messias. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to Handel's original intentions, although \"big Messiah\" productions continue to be mounted.

Wagner's own libretto for the work is freely based on the 13th-century Middle High German chivalric romance Parzival of the Minnes\u00e4nger Wolfram von Eschenbach and the Old French chivalric romance Perceval ou le Conte du Graal by the 12th-century trouv\u00e8re Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, recounting different accounts of the story of the Arthurian knight Parzival (Percival) and his spiritual quest for the Holy Grail.\nWagner conceived the work in April 1857, but did not finish it until 25 years later. In composing it he took advantage of the particular acoustics of his newly built Bayreuth Festspielhaus. Parsifal was first produced at the second Bayreuth Festival in 1882. The Bayreuth Festival maintained a monopoly on Parsifal productions until 1903, when the opera was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\nWagner described Parsifal not as an opera, but as Ein B\u00fchnenweihfestspiel (a sacred festival stage play). At Bayreuth a tradition has arisen that audiences do not applaud at the end of the first act. The autograph manuscript of the work is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51612", "text": "Wagner read von Eschenbach's poem Parzival while taking the waters at Marienbad in 1845. After encountering Arthur Schopenhauer's writings in 1854, Wagner became interested in Indian philosophies, especially Buddhism. Out of this interest came Die Sieger (The Victors, 1856), a sketch Wagner wrote for an opera based on a story from the life of Buddha. The themes of self-renunciation, rebirth, compassion, and even exclusive social groups (castes in Die Sieger, the knights of the Grail in Parsifal) which were later explored in Parsifal were first introduced in Die Sieger.According to his autobiography Mein Leben, Wagner conceived Parsifal on Good Friday morning, April 1857, in the Asyl (German: \"Asylum\"), the small cottage on Otto Wesendonck's estate in the Z\u00fcrich suburb of Enge, which Wesendonck \u2013 a wealthy silk merchant and generous patron of the arts \u2013 had placed at Wagner's disposal, through the good offices of his wife Mathilde Wesendonck. The composer and his wife Minna had moved into the cottage on 28 April:\n... on Good Friday I awoke to find the sun shining brightly for the first time in this house: the little garden was radiant with green, the birds sang, and at last I could sit on the roof and enjoy the long-yearned-for peace with its message of promise. Full of this sentiment, I suddenly remembered that the day was Good Friday, and I called to mind the significance this omen had already once assumed for me when I was reading Wolfram's Parzival. Since the sojourn in Marienbad [in the summer of 1845], where I had conceived Die Meistersinger and Lohengrin, I had never occupied myself again with that poem; now its noble possibilities struck me with overwhelming force, and out of my thoughts about Good Friday I rapidly conceived a whole drama, of which I made a rough sketch with a few dashes of the pen, dividing the whole into three acts.\nHowever, as his second wife Cosima Wagner later reported on 22 April 1879, this account had been colored by a certain amount of poetic licence:\nR[ichard] today recalled the impression which inspired his \"Good Friday Music\"; he laughs, saying he had thought to himself, \"In fact it is all as far-fetched as my love affairs, for it was not a Good Friday at all \u2013 just a pleasant mood in Nature which made me think, 'This is how a Good Friday ought to be'\u2009\".\nThe work may indeed have been conceived at Wesendonck's cottage in the last week of April 1857, but Good Friday that year fell on 10 April, when the Wagners were still living at Zeltweg 13 in Z\u00fcrich. If the prose sketch which Wagner mentions in Mein Leben was accurately dated (and most of Wagner's surviving papers are dated), it could settle the issue once and for all, but unfortunately it has not survived.\nWagner did not resume work on Parsifal for eight years, during which time he completed Tristan und Isolde and began Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. Then, between 27 and 30 August 1865, he took up Parsifal again and made a prose draft of the work; this contains a fairly brief outline of the plot and a considerable amount of detailed commentary on the characters and themes of the drama. But once again the work was dropped and set aside for another eleven and a half years. During this time most of Wagner's creative energy was devoted to the Ring cycle, which was finally completed in 1874 and given its first full performance at Bayreuth in August 1876. Only when this gargantuan task had been accomplished did Wagner find the time to concentrate on Parsifal. By 23 February 1877 he had completed a second and more extensive prose draft of the work, and by 19 April of the same year he had transformed this into a verse libretto (or \"poem\", as Wagner liked to call his libretti).In September 1877 he began the music by making two complete drafts of the score from beginning to end. The first of these (known in German as the Gesamtentwurf and in English as either the preliminary draft or the first complete draft) was made in pencil on three staves, one for the voices and two for the instruments. The second complete draft (Orchesterskizze, orchestral draft, short score or particell) was made in ink and on at least three, but sometimes as many as five, staves. This draft was much more detailed than the first and contained a considerable degree of instrumental elaboration.The second draft was begun on 25 September 1877, just a few days after the first; at this point in his career Wagner liked to work on both drafts simultaneously, switching back and forth between the two so as not to allow too much time to elapse between his initial setting of the text and the final elaboration of the music. The Gesamtentwurf of act 3 was completed on 16 April 1879 and the Orchesterskizze on the 26th of the same month.The full score (Partiturerstschrift) was the final stage in the compositional process. It was made in ink and consisted of a fair copy of the entire opera, with all the voices and instruments properly notated according to standard practice.

After encountering Arthur Schopenhauer's writings in 1854, Wagner became interested in Indian philosophies, especially Buddhism. Out of this interest came Die Sieger (The Victors, 1856), a sketch Wagner wrote for an opera based on a story from the life of Buddha. The themes of self-renunciation, rebirth, compassion, and even exclusive social groups (castes in Die Sieger, the knights of the Grail in Parsifal) which were later explored in Parsifal were first introduced in Die Sieger.According to his autobiography Mein Leben, Wagner conceived Parsifal on Good Friday morning, April 1857, in the Asyl (German: \"Asylum\"), the small cottage on Otto Wesendonck's estate in the Z\u00fcrich suburb of Enge, which Wesendonck \u2013 a wealthy silk merchant and generous patron of the arts \u2013 had placed at Wagner's disposal, through the good offices of his wife Mathilde Wesendonck. The composer and his wife Minna had moved into the cottage on 28 April:\n... on Good Friday I awoke to find the sun shining brightly for the first time in this house: the little garden was radiant with green, the birds sang, and at last I could sit on the roof and enjoy the long-yearned-for peace with its message of promise. Full of this sentiment, I suddenly remembered that the day was Good Friday, and I called to mind the significance this omen had already once assumed for me when I was reading Wolfram's Parzival. Since the sojourn in Marienbad [in the summer of 1845], where I had conceived Die Meistersinger and Lohengrin, I had never occupied myself again with that poem; now its noble possibilities struck me with overwhelming force, and out of my thoughts about Good Friday I rapidly conceived a whole drama, of which I made a rough sketch with a few dashes of the pen, dividing the whole into three acts.\nHowever, as his second wife Cosima Wagner later reported on 22 April 1879, this account had been colored by a certain amount of poetic licence:\nR[ichard] today recalled the impression which inspired his \"Good Friday Music\"; he laughs, saying he had thought to himself, \"In fact it is all as far-fetched as my love affairs, for it was not a Good Friday at all \u2013 just a pleasant mood in Nature which made me think, 'This is how a Good Friday ought to be'\u2009\".\nThe work may indeed have been conceived at Wesendonck's cottage in the last week of April 1857, but Good Friday that year fell on 10 April, when the Wagners were still living at Zeltweg 13 in Z\u00fcrich. If the prose sketch which Wagner mentions in Mein Leben was accurately dated (and most of Wagner's surviving papers are dated), it could settle the issue once and for all, but unfortunately it has not survived.\nWagner did not resume work on Parsifal for eight years, during which time he completed Tristan und Isolde and began Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. Then, between 27 and 30 August 1865, he took up Parsifal again and made a prose draft of the work; this contains a fairly brief outline of the plot and a considerable amount of detailed commentary on the characters and themes of the drama. But once again the work was dropped and set aside for another eleven and a half years. During this time most of Wagner's creative energy was devoted to the Ring cycle, which was finally completed in 1874 and given its first full performance at Bayreuth in August 1876. Only when this gargantuan task had been accomplished did Wagner find the time to concentrate on Parsifal. By 23 February 1877 he had completed a second and more extensive prose draft of the work, and by 19 April of the same year he had transformed this into a verse libretto (or \"poem\", as Wagner liked to call his libretti).In September 1877 he began the music by making two complete drafts of the score from beginning to end. The first of these (known in German as the Gesamtentwurf and in English as either the preliminary draft or the first complete draft) was made in pencil on three staves, one for the voices and two for the instruments. The second complete draft (Orchesterskizze, orchestral draft, short score or particell) was made in ink and on at least three, but sometimes as many as five, staves. This draft was much more detailed than the first and contained a considerable degree of instrumental elaboration.The second draft was begun on 25 September 1877, just a few days after the first; at this point in his career Wagner liked to work on both drafts simultaneously, switching back and forth between the two so as not to allow too much time to elapse between his initial setting of the text and the final elaboration of the music. The Gesamtentwurf of act 3 was completed on 16 April 1879 and the Orchesterskizze on the 26th of the same month.The full score (Partiturerstschrift) was the final stage in the compositional process. It was made in ink and consisted of a fair copy of the entire opera, with all the voices and instruments properly notated according to standard practice. Wagner composed Parsifal one act at a time, completing the Gesamtentwurf and Orchesterskizze of each act before beginning the Gesamtentwurf of the next act; but because the Orchesterskizze already embodied all the compositional details of the full score, the actual drafting of the Partiturerstschrift was regarded by Wagner as little more than a routine task which could be done whenever he found the time.

The most serious distortion has been the upward transposition of the role of Rosina, turning her from a lustrous alto into a pert soprano.\" However, it has also been noted that Rossini, who frequently altered his music for specific singers, wrote a new aria for the second act for Jos\u00e9phine Fodor-Mainvielle, a soprano who had sung Rosina in the 1818 London premiere, and sang the new aria c. 1820 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien in Paris, where it was published.The singing lesson in act 2 has often been turned into \"a show-stopping cabaret\".

The most serious distortion has been the upward transposition of the role of Rosina, turning her from a lustrous alto into a pert soprano.\" However, it has also been noted that Rossini, who frequently altered his music for specific singers, wrote a new aria for the second act for Jos\u00e9phine Fodor-Mainvielle, a soprano who had sung Rosina in the 1818 London premiere, and sang the new aria c. 1820 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien in Paris, where it was published.The singing lesson in act 2 has often been turned into \"a show-stopping cabaret\". Adelina Patti was known to include Luigi Arditi's \"Il bacio\", the Bolero from Verdi's I vespri siciliani, the Shadow Song from Meyerbeer's Dinorah, and Henry Bishop's \"Home! Sweet Home!\". Nellie Melba followed suit, accompanying herself on the piano in the final song. Pauline Viardot began the practice of inserting Alexander Alyabyev's \"Nightingale\". In a recording of a La Scala performance in 1956, Maria Callas sang a shortened version of \"Contro un cor\", transposed up a tone, in E.Once after Patti had sung a particularly florid rendition of the opera's legitimate aria, \"Una voce poco fa\", Rossini is reported to have asked her: \"Very nice, my dear, and who wrote the piece you have just performed?\"The piece is a staple of the operatic repertoire Because of a scarcity of true contraltos, the role of Rosina has most frequently been sung by a coloratura mezzo-soprano (with or without pitch alterations, depending on the singer), and has in the past, and occasionally in more recent times, been sung by coloratura sopranos such as Marcella Sembrich, Maria Callas, Roberta Peters, Gianna D'Angelo, Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles, Beverly Sills, Lily Pons, Diana Damrau, Edita Gruberov\u00e1, Kathleen Battle and Luciana Serra. Famous recent mezzo-soprano Rosinas include Marilyn Horne, Teresa Berganza, Frederica von Stade, Lucia Valentini Terrani, Susanne Marsee, Cecilia Bartoli, Joyce DiDonato, Jennifer Larmore, El\u012bna Garan\u010da, Isabel Leonard and Vesselina Kasarova. Famous contralto Rosinas include Ewa Podle\u015b who made her stage debut in that role.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder, and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias.\nPuccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.\nMusically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot\u2014musicologist Joseph Kerman famously called it a \"shabby little shocker\"\u2014the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51625", "text": "The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote more than 70 plays, almost all of them successful, and none of them performed today.

His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24 November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.Puccini had seen La Tosca at least twice, in Milan and Turin. On 7 May 1889 he wrote to his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, begging him to get Sardou's permission for the work to be made into an opera: \"I see in this Tosca the opera I need, with no overblown proportions, no elaborate spectacle, nor will it call for the usual excessive amount of music.\"Ricordi sent his agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to negotiate with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted by a French composer. He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy, particularly in Milan, and warned that other composers were interested in the piece. Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.In 1891, Illica advised Puccini against the project, most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form. When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like, Puccini took offence.

{"id": "86_400", "question": "Who is the composer of Tristan und Isolde?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_51636", "text": "Tristan und Isolde (Tristan and Isolde), WWV 90, is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner to a German libretto by the composer, based largely on the 12th-century romance Tristan and Iseult by Gottfried von Strassburg. It was composed between 1857 and 1859 and premiered at the K\u00f6nigliches Hoftheater und Nationaltheater in Munich on 10 June 1865 with Hans von B\u00fclow conducting. Wagner referred to the work not as an opera, but called it \"eine Handlung\" (literally a drama, a plot, or an action).\nWagner's composition of Tristan und Isolde was inspired by the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer (particularly The World as Will and Representation), as well as by Wagner's affair with Mathilde Wesendonck. Widely acknowledged as a pinnacle of the operatic repertoire, Tristan was notable for Wagner's unprecedented use of chromaticism, tonal ambiguity, orchestral colour, and harmonic suspension.\nThe opera was enormously influential among Western classical composers and provided direct inspiration to composers such as Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Benjamin Britten. Other composers such as Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Igor Stravinsky formulated their styles in contrast to Wagner's musical legacy. Many see Tristan as a milestone on the move away from common practice harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century. Both Wagner's libretto style and music were also profoundly influential on the symbolist poets of the late 19th century and early 20th century.The autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51637", "text": "Wagner was forced to abandon his position as conductor of the Dresden Opera in 1849, as there was a warrant posted for his arrest for his participation in the unsuccessful May Revolution. He left his wife, Minna, in Dresden, and fled to Z\u00fcrich. There, in 1852, he met the wealthy silk trader Otto Wesendonck. Wesendonck became a supporter of Wagner and bankrolled the composer for several years. Wesendonck's wife, Mathilde, became enamoured of the composer. Though Wagner was working on his epic Der Ring des Nibelungen, he found himself intrigued by the legend of Tristan and Isolde.\nThe re-discovery of medieval Germanic poetry, including Gottfried von Strassburg's version of Tristan, the Nibelungenlied and Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, left a large impact on the German Romantic movements during the mid-19th century. The story of Tristan and Isolde is a quintessential romance of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Several versions of the story exist, the earliest dating to the middle of the 12th century. Gottfried's version, part of the \"courtly\" branch of the legend, had a huge influence on later German literature.According to his autobiography, Mein Leben, Wagner decided to dramatise the Tristan legend after his friend, Karl Ritter, attempted to do so, writing that:\n\nHe had, in fact, made a point of giving prominence to the lighter phases of the romance, whereas it was its all-pervading tragedy that impressed me so deeply that I felt convinced it should stand out in bold relief, regardless of minor details.\nThis influence, together with his discovery of the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer in October 1854, led Wagner to find himself in a \"serious mood created by Schopenhauer, which was trying to find ecstatic expression. It was some such mood that inspired the conception of a Tristan und Isolde.\"\nWagner wrote of his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and Tristan in a letter to Franz Liszt (16 December 1854): Never in my life having enjoyed the true happiness of love I shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter repletion. I have devised in my mind a Tristan und Isolde, the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the 'black flag' that waves at the end I shall cover myself over \u2013 to die.\nBy the end of 1854, Wagner had sketched out all three acts of an opera on the Tristan theme, based on Gottfried von Strassburg's telling of the story. While the earliest extant sketches date from December 1856, it was not until August 1857 that Wagner began devoting his attention entirely to the opera, putting aside the composition of Siegfried to do so. On 20 August he began the prose sketch for the opera, and the libretto (or poem, as Wagner preferred to call it) was completed by 18 September. Wagner, at this time, had moved into a cottage built in the grounds of Wesendonck's villa, where, during his work on Tristan und Isolde, he became passionately involved with Mathilde Wesendonck. Whether or not this relationship was platonic remains uncertain. One evening in September of that year, Wagner read the finished poem of \"Tristan\" to an audience including his wife, Minna, his current muse, Mathilde, and his future mistress (and later wife), Cosima von B\u00fclow.\nBy October 1857, Wagner had begun the composition sketch of the first act. During November, however, he set five of Mathilde's poems to music known today as the Wesendonck Lieder. This was an unusual move by Wagner, who almost never set to music poetic texts other than his own. Wagner described two of the songs \u2013 \"Im Treibhaus\" and \"Tr\u00e4ume\" \u2013 as \"Studies for Tristan und Isolde\": \"Tr\u00e4ume\" uses a motif that forms the love duet in Act II of Tristan, while \"Im Treibhaus\" introduces a theme that later became the prelude to Act III. But Wagner resolved to write Tristan only after he had secured a publishing deal with the Leipzig-based firm Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel, in January 1858.

He left his wife, Minna, in Dresden, and fled to Z\u00fcrich. There, in 1852, he met the wealthy silk trader Otto Wesendonck. Wesendonck became a supporter of Wagner and bankrolled the composer for several years. Wesendonck's wife, Mathilde, became enamoured of the composer. Though Wagner was working on his epic Der Ring des Nibelungen, he found himself intrigued by the legend of Tristan and Isolde.\nThe re-discovery of medieval Germanic poetry, including Gottfried von Strassburg's version of Tristan, the Nibelungenlied and Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, left a large impact on the German Romantic movements during the mid-19th century. The story of Tristan and Isolde is a quintessential romance of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Several versions of the story exist, the earliest dating to the middle of the 12th century. Gottfried's version, part of the \"courtly\" branch of the legend, had a huge influence on later German literature.According to his autobiography, Mein Leben, Wagner decided to dramatise the Tristan legend after his friend, Karl Ritter, attempted to do so, writing that:\n\nHe had, in fact, made a point of giving prominence to the lighter phases of the romance, whereas it was its all-pervading tragedy that impressed me so deeply that I felt convinced it should stand out in bold relief, regardless of minor details.\nThis influence, together with his discovery of the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer in October 1854, led Wagner to find himself in a \"serious mood created by Schopenhauer, which was trying to find ecstatic expression. It was some such mood that inspired the conception of a Tristan und Isolde.\"\nWagner wrote of his preoccupations with Schopenhauer and Tristan in a letter to Franz Liszt (16 December 1854): Never in my life having enjoyed the true happiness of love I shall erect a memorial to this loveliest of all dreams in which, from the first to the last, love shall, for once, find utter repletion. I have devised in my mind a Tristan und Isolde, the simplest, yet most full-blooded musical conception imaginable, and with the 'black flag' that waves at the end I shall cover myself over \u2013 to die.\nBy the end of 1854, Wagner had sketched out all three acts of an opera on the Tristan theme, based on Gottfried von Strassburg's telling of the story. While the earliest extant sketches date from December 1856, it was not until August 1857 that Wagner began devoting his attention entirely to the opera, putting aside the composition of Siegfried to do so. On 20 August he began the prose sketch for the opera, and the libretto (or poem, as Wagner preferred to call it) was completed by 18 September. Wagner, at this time, had moved into a cottage built in the grounds of Wesendonck's villa, where, during his work on Tristan und Isolde, he became passionately involved with Mathilde Wesendonck. Whether or not this relationship was platonic remains uncertain. One evening in September of that year, Wagner read the finished poem of \"Tristan\" to an audience including his wife, Minna, his current muse, Mathilde, and his future mistress (and later wife), Cosima von B\u00fclow.\nBy October 1857, Wagner had begun the composition sketch of the first act. During November, however, he set five of Mathilde's poems to music known today as the Wesendonck Lieder. This was an unusual move by Wagner, who almost never set to music poetic texts other than his own. Wagner described two of the songs \u2013 \"Im Treibhaus\" and \"Tr\u00e4ume\" \u2013 as \"Studies for Tristan und Isolde\": \"Tr\u00e4ume\" uses a motif that forms the love duet in Act II of Tristan, while \"Im Treibhaus\" introduces a theme that later became the prelude to Act III. But Wagner resolved to write Tristan only after he had secured a publishing deal with the Leipzig-based firm Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel, in January 1858. From this point on, Wagner finished each act and sent it off for engraving before he started on the next \u2013 a remarkable feat given the unprecedented length and complexity of the score.In April 1858 Wagner's wife Minna intercepted a note from Wagner to Mathilde and, despite Wagner's protests that she was putting a \"vulgar interpretation\" on the note, she accused first Wagner and then Mathilde of unfaithfulness.

It was Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez's most successful play, one which Verdi scholar Julian Budden describes as \"a high flown, sprawling melodrama flamboyantly defiant of the Aristotelian unities, packed with all manner of fantastic and bizarre incident.\"The premiere took place at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 19 January 1853, where it \"began a victorious march throughout the operatic world\", a success due to Verdi's work over the previous three years. It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of Il trovatore. There followed, slowly and with interruptions, the preparation of the libretto, first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare, which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions, which were accomplished under his direction. These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora.\nFor Verdi, the three years were filled with musical activity; work on this opera did not proceed while the composer wrote and premiered Rigoletto in Venice in March 1851. His personal affairs also limited his professional work. In May 1851, an additional commission was offered by the Venice company after Rigoletto's success there. Another commission came from Paris while he was visiting that city from late 1851 to March 1852.

It belongs to the genre of the azione teatrale, meaning an opera on a mythological subject with choruses and dancing. The piece was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 5 October 1762, in the presence of Empress Maria Theresa.

Variations on its plot\u2014the underground rescue mission in which the hero must control, or conceal, his emotions\u2014can be found in Mozart's The Magic Flute, Beethoven's Fidelio, and Wagner's Das Rheingold.\nThough originally set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to the genre of French opera, particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence of vocal virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline. This reworking was given the title Orph\u00e9e et Eurydice, and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51668", "text": "Francesco Algarotti's Essay on the Opera (1755) was a major influence in the development of Gluck's reformist ideology.

It is loosely adapted from Louvet de Couvrai's novel Les amours du chevalier de Faublas and Moli\u00e8re's comedy Monsieur de Pourceaugnac. It was first performed at the K\u00f6nigliches Opernhaus in Dresden on 26 January 1911 under the direction of Max Reinhardt, with Ernst von Schuch conducting. Until the premiere, the working title was Ochs auf Lerchenau. (The choice of the name Ochs is not accidental, as \"Ochs\" means \"ox\", which describes the Baron's manner.)\nThe opera has four main characters: the aristocratic Marschallin; her 17-year-old lover, Count Octavian Rofrano; her brutish cousin Baron Ochs; and Ochs's prospective fianc\u00e9e, Sophie von Faninal, the daughter of a rich bourgeois. At the Marschallin's suggestion, Octavian acts as Ochs's Rosenkavalier by presenting a ceremonial silver rose to Sophie. But Octavian and Sophie fall in love on the spot, and soon devise a comic intrigue to extricate Sophie from her engagement, with help from the Marschallin, who then yields Octavian to Sophie. Though a comic opera, the work incorporates weighty themes (particularly through the Marschallin's character arc), including infidelity, aging, sexual predation, and selflessness in love.\nDer Rosenkavalier is notable for showcasing the female voice, as its protagonists (light lyric soprano Sophie, mezzo-soprano Octavian, and the mature dramatic soprano Marschallin) are written to be portrayed by women, who share several duets as well as a trio at the opera's emotional climax. Some singers have performed two or even all three of these roles over the course of their careers.\nThere are many recordings of the opera and it is regularly performed.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51676", "text": "Richard Strauss first met Hugo von Hofmannstal in 1899 in Berlin.

The libretto was originally prepared by Joseph Sonnleithner from the French of Jean-Nicolas Bouilly. The opera premiered at Vienna's Theater an der Wien on 20 November 1805. The following year, Beethoven's friend Stephan von Breuning rewrote the libretto, shortening the work from three acts to two. After further work on the libretto by Georg Friedrich Treitschke, a final version was performed at the K\u00e4rntnertortheater on 23 May 1814. As these libretto revisions were going on, Beethoven was also revising some of the music. By convention, only the final version is called Fidelio, and the others are referred to as Leonore.\nThe libretto tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard named \"Fidelio\", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison. Bouilly's scenario fits Beethoven's aesthetic and political outlook: a story of personal sacrifice, heroism, and eventual triumph. With its underlying struggle for liberty and justice mirroring contemporary political movements in Europe, such topics are typical of Beethoven's \"middle period\". Notable moments in the opera include the \"Prisoners' Chorus\" (O welche Lust\u2014\"O what a joy\"), an ode to freedom sung by a chorus of political prisoners, Florestan's vision of Leonore come as an angel to rescue him, and the scene in which the rescue finally takes place.

The contract included free lodging for Beethoven in the apartment complex that was part of Schikaneder's large suburban theater, the Theater an der Wien. Beethoven was to set a new libretto by Schikaneder, entitled Vestas Feuer; however, this libretto was not to Beethoven's liking. He spent about a month composing music for it, then abandoned it when the libretto for Fidelio came to his attention.\nThe time Beethoven spent on Vestas Feuer was not entirely wasted, as two important numbers from Fidelio, Pizarro's \"'Ha!

In addition, several incidents, of which the Forest of Fontainebleau scene and auto-da-f\u00e9 were the most substantial, were borrowed from Eug\u00e8ne Cormon's 1846 play Philippe II, Roi d'Espagne.

It is based on the Greek legend of Orpheus, and tells the story of his descent to Hades and his fruitless attempt to bring his dead bride Eurydice back to the living world. It was written in 1607 for a court performance during the annual Carnival at Mantua. While Jacopo Peri's Dafne is generally recognised as the first work in the opera genre, and the earliest surviving opera is Peri's Euridice, L'Orfeo is the earliest that is still regularly performed.\nBy the early 17th century the traditional intermedio\u2014a musical sequence between the acts of a straight play\u2014was evolving into the form of a complete musical drama or \"opera\". Monteverdi's L'Orfeo moved this process out of its experimental era and provided the first fully developed example of the new genre. After its initial performance the work was staged again in Mantua, and possibly in other Italian centres in the next few years. Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615. After the composer's death in 1643 the opera went unperformed for many years, and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances. At first these performances tended to be concert (unstaged) versions within institutes and music societies, but following the first modern dramatised performance in Paris, in 1911, the work began to be seen in theatres. After the Second World War many recordings were issued, and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses, although some leading venues resisted it. In 2007, the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world.\nIn his published score Monteverdi lists around 41 instruments to be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed at the point of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque, L'Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony. The work is not orchestrated as such; in the Renaissance tradition instrumentalists followed the composer's general instructions but were given considerable freedom to improvise.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51723", "text": "Claudio Monteverdi, born in Cremona in 1567, was a musical prodigy who studied under Marc'Antonio Ingegneri, the maestro di cappella (head of music) at Cremona Cathedral. After training in singing, string playing and composition, Monteverdi worked as a musician in Verona and Milan until, in 1590 or 1591, he secured a post as suonatore di vivuola (viola player) at Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga's court at Mantua. Through ability and hard work Monteverdi rose to become Gonzaga's maestro della musica (master of music) in 1601.Vincenzo Gonzaga's particular passion for musical theatre and spectacle grew from his family connections with the court of Florence. Towards the end of the 16th century innovative Florentine musicians were developing the intermedio\u2014a long-established form of musical interlude inserted between the acts of spoken dramas\u2014into increasingly elaborate forms.

Alfio swears to take vendetta (revenge) which causes Santuzza to repent for having disclosed the affair and begs Alfio to stop, but to no avail.\n\nThe square is empty as the orchestra plays the famous Intermezzo.\n\nThe villagers come out of the church.

Turiddu offers him wine, but he refuses it. All understand that trouble is in the air. The women leave, taking Lola with them. In a brief exchange of words, Alfio challenges Turiddu to a duel. Following Sicilian custom, the two men embrace, and Turiddu, in a token of acceptance, bites Alfio's ear, drawing blood which signifies a fight to the death. Alfio leaves and Turiddu calls Lucia back. He tells her that he is going outside to get some air and asks that she be a kindly mother to Santuzza if he should not return: \"Un bacio, mamma! Un altro bacio!\u2014Addio!\" (\"One kiss, mother! One more kiss! \u2013 Farewell!\").\nTuriddu rushes out. Lucia, weeping, wanders aimlessly around outside her house. Santuzza approaches and throws her arms around her. The villagers start to crowd around. Voices are heard in the distance and a woman cries, \"They have murdered Turiddu!\" Santuzza faints and Lucia collapses in the arms of the women villagers.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "86_417", "question": "Who composed the music for \"Cats\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_51756", "text": "Cats is a sung-through musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is based on the 1939 poetry collection Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot. The musical tells the story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles and the night they make the \"Jellicle choice\" by deciding which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life. As of 2022, Cats remains the fifth-longest-running Broadway show and the seventh-longest-running West End show.\nLloyd Webber began setting Eliot's poems to music in 1977, and the compositions were first presented as a song cycle in 1980. Producer Cameron Mackintosh then recruited director Trevor Nunn and choreographer Gillian Lynne to turn the songs into a complete musical. Cats opened to positive reviews at the New London Theatre in the West End in 1981 and then to mixed reviews at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in 1982. It won numerous awards including Best Musical at both the Laurence Olivier and Tony Awards. Despite its unusual premise that deterred investors initially, the musical turned out to be an unprecedented commercial success, with a worldwide gross of US$3.5 billion by 2012.\nThe London production ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances, while the Broadway production ran for 18 years and 7,485 performances, making Cats the longest-running musical in both theatre districts for a number of years. Cats has since been revived in the West End twice and on Broadway once. It has also been translated into multiple languages and performed around the world many times. Long-running foreign productions include a 15-year run at the Operettenhaus in Hamburg that played over 6,100 performances, as well as an ongoing run in a purpose-built theatre in Japan that has played over 10,000 performances since it opened in 1983.\nCats started the megamusical phenomenon, establishing a global market for musical theatre and directing the industry's focus to big-budget blockbusters, as well as family- and tourist-friendly shows. The musical's profound but polarising influence also reshaped the aesthetic, technology, and marketing of the medium.

{"id": "86_419", "question": "Who is the composer of \"Falstaff\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_51771", "text": "Falstaff (Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8falstaf]) is a comic opera in three acts by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. The Italian-language libretto was adapted by Arrigo Boito from the play The Merry Wives of Windsor and scenes from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2, by William Shakespeare. The work premiered on 9 February 1893 at La Scala, Milan.\nVerdi wrote Falstaff, the last of his 26 operas, as he approached the age of 80. It was his second comedy, and his third work based on a Shakespeare play, following Macbeth and Otello. The plot revolves around the thwarted, sometimes farcical, efforts of the fat knight Sir John Falstaff to seduce two married women to gain access to their husbands' wealth.\nVerdi was concerned about working on a new opera at his advanced age, but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito's draft libretto. It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, Falstaff did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer's canon. After the initial performances in Italy, other European countries and the US, the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s into the next century. Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi's previous operas, a view that Toscanini strongly opposed. Conductors of the generation after Toscanini to champion the work included Herbert von Karajan, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein. The work is now part of the standard operatic repertory.\nVerdi made numerous changes to the music after the first performance, and editors have found difficulty in agreeing on a definitive score. The work was first recorded in 1932 and has subsequently received many studio and live recordings. Singers closely associated with the title role have included Victor Maurel (the first Falstaff), Mariano Stabile, Giuseppe Valdengo, Tito Gobbi, Geraint Evans, Bryn Terfel and Ambrogio Maestri.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51772", "text": "Time: The reign of Henry IV, 1399 to 1413Place: Windsor, England", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51773", "text": "Verdi scored Falstaff for three flutes (third doubling piccolo), two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, four trombones, timpani, percussion (triangle, cymbals, bass drum), harp, and strings. In addition, a guitar, natural horn, and bell are heard from offstage. Unlike most of Verdi's earlier operatic scores, Falstaff is through-composed. No list of numbers is printed in the published full score. The score differs from much of Verdi's earlier work by having no overture: there are seven bars for the orchestra before the first voice (Dr Caius) enters. The critic Rodney Milnes comments that \"enjoyment ... shines from every bar in its irresistible forward impulse, its effortless melody, its rhythmic vitality, and sureness of dramatic pace and construction.\" In The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Roger Parker writes that:\n\nthe listener is bombarded by a stunning diversity of rhythms, orchestral textures, melodic motifs and harmonic devices. Passages that in earlier times would have furnished material for an entire number here crowd in on each other, shouldering themselves unceremoniously to the fore in bewildering succession.\nThe opera was described by its creators as a commedia lirica. McDonald commented in 2009 that Falstaff is very different \u2013 a stylistic departure \u2013 from Verdi's earlier work. In McDonald's view most of the musical expression is in the dialogue, and there is only one traditional aria. The result is that \"such stylistic economy \u2013 more sophisticated, more challenging than he had employed before \u2013 is the keynote of the work.\" McDonald argues that consciously or unconsciously, Verdi was developing the idiom that would come to dominate the music of the 20th century: \"the lyricism is abbreviated, glanced at rather than indulged. Melodies bloom suddenly and then vanish, replaced by contrasting tempo or an unexpected phrase that introduces another character or idea\". In McDonald's view the orchestral writing acts as a sophisticated commentator on the action. It has influenced at least one of Verdi's operatic successors: in 1952 Imogen Holst, musical assistant to Benjamin Britten, wrote, after a performance of Falstaff, \"I realised for the first time how much Ben owes to [Verdi]. There are orchestral bits which are just as funny to listen to as the comic instrumental bits in A. Herring!\"The extent to which Falstaff is a \"Shakespearian\" opera has often been debated by critics. Although the action is taken from The Merry Wives of Windsor, some commentators feel that Boito and Verdi have transmuted Shakespeare's play into a wholly Italian work. The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf believed there was nothing English or Shakespearian about the comedy: \"it was all done through the music\". In 1961 Peter Heyworth wrote in The Observer, \"Because of Shakespeare we like to think of Falstaff as a work that has a certain Englishness. In fact the opera is no more English than Aida is Egyptian. Boito and Verdi between them transformed the fat knight into one of the archetypes of opera buffa.\" Verdi himself, however, felt that the Falstaff of the opera is not a conventional Italian buffo character, but portrays Shakespeare's fuller, more ambiguous Falstaff of the Henry IV plays: \"My Falstaff is not merely the hero of The Merry Wives of Windsor, who is simply a buffoon, and allows himself to be tricked by the women, but also the Falstaff of the two parts of Henry IV. Boito has written the libretto in accordance.\" A contemporary critic argued that the text \"imitated with marvellous accuracy the metre and rhythm of Shakespeare's verse\", but Hepokoski notes Boito's use of traditional Italian metric conventions.Another recurrent question is how much, if at all, Verdi was influenced by Wagner's comic opera Die Meistersinger. At the time of the premiere this was a sensitive subject; many Italians were suspicious of or hostile to Wagner's music, and were protective in a nationalistic way of Verdi's reputation. Nevertheless, Verdi's new style was markedly different from that of his popular works of the 1850s and 1860s, and it seemed to some to have Wagnerian echoes. In 1999 the critic Andrew Porter wrote, \"That Falstaff was Verdi's and Boito's answer to Wagner's Meistersinger seems evident now. But the Italian Falstaff moves more quickly.\" Toscanini, who did more than anyone else to bring Falstaff into the regular operatic repertoire, commented:\n\nthe difference between Falstaff, which is the absolute masterpiece, and Die Meistersinger, which is an outstanding Wagnerian opera. Just think for a moment how many musical means \u2013 beautiful ones, certainly \u2013 Wagner must make use of to describe the Nuremberg night. And look how Verdi gets a similarly startling effect at a similar moment with three notes.\nVerdi scholars including Julian Budden have analysed the music in symphonic terms \u2013 the opening section \"a perfect little sonata movement\", the second act concluding with a variant of the classic slow concertante ensemble leading to a fast stretto, and the whole opera ending with \"the most academic of musical forms\", a fugue. Milnes suggests that this shows \"a wise old conservative's warning about the excesses of the verismo school of Italian opera\" already on the rise by the 1890s. Among the solo numbers woven into the continuous score are Falstaff's \"honour\" monologue, which concludes the first scene, and his reminiscent arietta (\"Quand'ero paggio\") about himself as a young page. The young lovers, Nannetta and Fenton, are given a lyrical and playful duet (\"Labbra di foco\") in act 1; in act 3, Fenton's impassioned love song, \"Dal labbro il canto estasiato vola\" briefly becomes a duet when Nannetta joins him. She then has the last substantial solo section of the score, the \"fairy\" aria, \"Sul fil d'un soffio etesio\", described by Parker as \"yet another aria suffused with the soft orchestral colours that characterize this scene\".The score is seen by the critic Richard Osborne as rich in self-parody, with sinister themes from Rigoletto and Un ballo in maschera transmuted into comedy. For Osborne the nocturnal music of act 3 draws on the examples of Weber, Berlioz and Mendelssohn, creating a mood akin to that of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Osborne views the whole opera as an ensemble piece, and he comments that grand soliloquy in the old Verdian style is reserved for Ford's \"jealousy\" aria in act 2, which is almost tragic in style but comic in effect, making Ford \"a figure to be laughed at.\" Osborne concludes his analysis, \"Falstaff is comedy's musical apogee: the finest opera, inspired by the finest dramatist, by the finest opera composer the world has known\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51772", "text": "Time: The reign of Henry IV, 1399 to 1413Place: Windsor, England", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51773", "text": "Verdi scored Falstaff for three flutes (third doubling piccolo), two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, four trombones, timpani, percussion (triangle, cymbals, bass drum), harp, and strings.

It is the only opera by Saint-Sa\u00ebns that is regularly performed. The second act love scene in Delilah's tent is one of the set pieces that define French opera.

The composer began work on the theme in 1867, just two years after completing his first (and as then yet unperformed) opera, Le timbre d'argent. Saint-Sa\u00ebns had approached Ferdinand Lemaire, the husband of one of his wife's cousins, about writing a libretto for the oratorio but Lemaire convinced the composer that the story was better suited to an opera.\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns later wrote: A young relative of mine had married a charming young man who wrote verse on the side. I realized that he was gifted and had in fact real talent. I asked him to work with me on an oratorio on a biblical subject. 'An oratorio!', he said, 'no, let's make it an opera!', and he began to dig through the Bible while I outlined the plan of the work, even sketching scenes, and leaving him only the versification to do. For some reason I began the music with act 2, and I played it at home to a select audience who could make nothing of it at all.\nAfter Lemaire finished the libretto, Saint-Sa\u00ebns began actively composing act 2 of the opera, producing an aria for Dalila, a duet for Samson and Dalila, and some musical pieces for the chorus (some of which were later assigned to act 1) during 1867\u20131869. From the very beginning, the work was conceived as a grand duet between Samson and Dalila set off against the approaching tempest. Although the orchestration was not yet complete, act 2 was presented in a private performance in 1870 just prior to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War with Saint-Sa\u00ebns playing the orchestral parts, which were largely improvised, on the piano. Composer Augusta Holm\u00e8s (Dalila), painter Henri Regnault (Samson), and Romain Bussine (High Priest) rendered their roles from part books.\nIn spite of many precedents, the French public reacted negatively to Saint-Sa\u00ebns's intention of putting a Biblical subject on the stage. The alarm on the part of the public caused him to abandon working further on the opera for the next two years.\nIn the summer of 1872, not too long after the premiere of Saint-Sa\u00ebns's second opera La princesse jaune, the composer went to Weimar to see the first revival of Wagner's Das Rheingold under the baton of Franz Liszt, the former musical director of the Weimar court orchestra and opera. Liszt was highly interested in producing new works by talented composers and persuaded Saint-Sa\u00ebns to finish Samson and Delilah, even offering to produce the completed work at the grand-ducal opera house in Weimar. Encouraged, Saint-Sa\u00ebns began composing act 1 in late 1872 and worked on it sporadically for the next few years. He wrote a large amount of act 1 and completed it during a trip to Algiers in 1874. Upon returning to France in 1875, Saint-Sa\u00ebns presented act 1 in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in a similar format as the 1870 performance of act 2. The work was harshly received by music critics and failed to gain the public's interest. That year acclaimed mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, for whom Saint-Sa\u00ebns wrote the role of Dalila, organized and performed in a private performance of act 2 at a friend's home in Croissy, with the composer at the piano. Viardot was a great admirer of the work and she hoped that this private performance would encourage Halanzier, the director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra who was in attendance, to mount a full production. Although Saint-Sa\u00ebns completed the score in 1876, no opera houses in France displayed any desire to stage Samson et Dalila.

The composer began work on the theme in 1867, just two years after completing his first (and as then yet unperformed) opera, Le timbre d'argent. Saint-Sa\u00ebns had approached Ferdinand Lemaire, the husband of one of his wife's cousins, about writing a libretto for the oratorio but Lemaire convinced the composer that the story was better suited to an opera.\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns later wrote: A young relative of mine had married a charming young man who wrote verse on the side. I realized that he was gifted and had in fact real talent. I asked him to work with me on an oratorio on a biblical subject. 'An oratorio!', he said, 'no, let's make it an opera!', and he began to dig through the Bible while I outlined the plan of the work, even sketching scenes, and leaving him only the versification to do. For some reason I began the music with act 2, and I played it at home to a select audience who could make nothing of it at all.\nAfter Lemaire finished the libretto, Saint-Sa\u00ebns began actively composing act 2 of the opera, producing an aria for Dalila, a duet for Samson and Dalila, and some musical pieces for the chorus (some of which were later assigned to act 1) during 1867\u20131869. From the very beginning, the work was conceived as a grand duet between Samson and Dalila set off against the approaching tempest. Although the orchestration was not yet complete, act 2 was presented in a private performance in 1870 just prior to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War with Saint-Sa\u00ebns playing the orchestral parts, which were largely improvised, on the piano. Composer Augusta Holm\u00e8s (Dalila), painter Henri Regnault (Samson), and Romain Bussine (High Priest) rendered their roles from part books.\nIn spite of many precedents, the French public reacted negatively to Saint-Sa\u00ebns's intention of putting a Biblical subject on the stage. The alarm on the part of the public caused him to abandon working further on the opera for the next two years.\nIn the summer of 1872, not too long after the premiere of Saint-Sa\u00ebns's second opera La princesse jaune, the composer went to Weimar to see the first revival of Wagner's Das Rheingold under the baton of Franz Liszt, the former musical director of the Weimar court orchestra and opera. Liszt was highly interested in producing new works by talented composers and persuaded Saint-Sa\u00ebns to finish Samson and Delilah, even offering to produce the completed work at the grand-ducal opera house in Weimar. Encouraged, Saint-Sa\u00ebns began composing act 1 in late 1872 and worked on it sporadically for the next few years. He wrote a large amount of act 1 and completed it during a trip to Algiers in 1874. Upon returning to France in 1875, Saint-Sa\u00ebns presented act 1 in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in a similar format as the 1870 performance of act 2. The work was harshly received by music critics and failed to gain the public's interest. That year acclaimed mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, for whom Saint-Sa\u00ebns wrote the role of Dalila, organized and performed in a private performance of act 2 at a friend's home in Croissy, with the composer at the piano. Viardot was a great admirer of the work and she hoped that this private performance would encourage Halanzier, the director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra who was in attendance, to mount a full production.

It was Monteverdi's last opera, with a libretto by Giovanni Francesco Busenello, and was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1643 carnival season. One of the first operas to use historical events and people, it describes how Poppaea, mistress of the Roman emperor Nero, is able to achieve her ambition and be crowned empress. The opera was revived in Naples in 1651, but was then neglected until the rediscovery of the score in 1888, after which it became the subject of scholarly attention in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s, the opera has been performed and recorded many times.\nThe original manuscript of the score does not exist; two surviving copies from the 1650s show significant differences from each other, and each differs to some extent from the libretto. How much of the music is actually Monteverdi's, and how much the product of others, is a matter of dispute. None of the existing versions of the libretto, printed or manuscript, can be definitively tied to the first performance at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo, the precise date of which is unknown. Details of the original cast are few and largely speculative, and there is no record of the opera's initial public reception. Despite these uncertainties, the work is generally accepted as part of the Monteverdi operatic canon, his last and perhaps his greatest work.\nIn a departure from traditional literary morality, it is the adulterous liaison of Poppea and Nerone which wins the day, although this triumph is demonstrated by history to have been transitory and hollow. In Busenello's version of the story all the major characters are morally compromised. Written when the genre of opera was only a few decades old, the music for L'incoronazione di Poppea has been praised for its originality, its melody, and for its reflection of the human attributes of its characters.

These works, L'Orfeo and L'Arianna, deal respectively with the Greek myths of Orpheus and Ariadne. After a disagreement in 1612 with Vincenzo's successor, Duke Francesco Gonzaga, Monteverdi moved to Venice to take up the position of director of music at St Mark's Basilica, where he remained until his death in 1643.Amid his official duties at Venice, Monteverdi maintained an interest in theatrical music and produced several stage works, including the substantial Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda (The battle of Tancred and Clorinda) for the 1624\u201325 carnival. When the first public opera house in the world opened in Venice in 1637, Monteverdi, by then in his 70th year, returned to writing full-scale opera.

Whiteman's band performed the rhapsody with Gershwin playing the piano. Whiteman's arranger Ferde Grof\u00e9 orchestrated the rhapsody several times including the 1924 original scoring, the 1926 pit orchestra scoring, and the 1942 symphonic scoring.\nThe rhapsody is one of Gershwin's most recognizable creations and a key composition that defined the Jazz Age. Gershwin's piece inaugurated a new era in America's musical history, established his reputation as an eminent composer and became one of the most popular of all concert works.

He developed this orchestration for solo piano and Whiteman's twenty-three musicians. For the reeds section, Ross Gorman (Reed I) played an oboe, a heckelphone, a clarinet in B\u266d, sopranino saxophones in E\u266d & B\u266d, an alto saxophone, one E\u266d soprano clarinet, and alto and bass clarinets; Donald Clark (Reed II) played a soprano saxophone in B\u266d, alto and baritone saxophones, and Hale Byers (Reed III) played soprano saxophone in B\u266d, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, and a flute.For the brass section, two trumpets in B\u266d were played by Henry Busse and Frank Siegrist; two French horns in F were played by Arturo Cerino and Al Corrado; two trombones were played by Roy Maxon and James Casseday, and a tuba and a double bass played by Guss Helleburg and Alus Armer respectively. The percussion section included a drum set, timpani, and a glockenspiel played by George Marsh; one piano typically played by either Ferde Grof\u00e9 or Henry Lange; one tenor banjo played by Michael Pingatore, and a complement of violins.Musicologists largely ignored this original arrangement\u2014with its unique instrumental requirements\u2014until its revival in reconstructions beginning in the mid-1980s, owing to the popularity and serviceability of the later scorings. After the 1924 premiere, Grof\u00e9 revised the score and made new orchestrations in 1926 and 1942, each time for larger orchestras. He published his arrangement for a theater orchestra in 1926. Grof\u00e9 orchestrated this adaptation for a more standard \"pit orchestra,\" which included one flute, one oboe, two clarinets, one bassoon, three saxophones; two French horns, two trumpets, and two trombones; as well as the same percussion and strings complement as the later 1942 version.\nGrof\u00e9 later produced a 1942 arrangement for a full symphony orchestra. It is scored for solo piano and an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B\u266d and A, one bass clarinet, two bassoons, two alto saxophones in E\u266d, one tenor saxophone in B\u266d; three French horns in F, three trumpets in B\u266d, three trombones, one tuba; a percussion section that includes timpani, one suspended cymbal, one snare drum, one bass drum, one tam-tam, one triangle, one glockenspiel, and cymbals; one tenor banjo; and strings. Since the mid-20th century, the 1942 arrangement became a staple of the concert repertoire until 1976 when Michael Tilson Thomas recorded the original jazz band version for the first time, employing Gershwin's actual 1925 piano roll with a full jazz orchestra.Grof\u00e9's other arrangements of Gershwin's piece include those done for Whiteman's 1930 film, King of Jazz, and the concert band setting (playable without piano) completed by 1938 and published 1942. The prominence of the saxophones in the later orchestrations is somewhat reduced, and the banjo part can be dispensed with, as its mainly rhythmic contribution is provided by the inner strings.Gershwin himself made versions of the piece for solo piano as well as two pianos.

On June 10, 1924, Gershwin and Whiteman's orchestra created an acoustic recording running 8 minutes and 59 seconds and issued by the Victor Talking Machine Company. A year later, Gershwin recorded his performance on a 1925 piano roll for a two-piano version. Later, on April 21, 1927, he made an electrical recording with Whiteman's orchestra running 9 minutes and 1 second and again recorded by Victor. Nathaniel Shilkret purportedly conducted the electrical recording after a dispute between Gershwin and Whiteman. Whiteman's orchestra later performed a truncated version of the piece in the 1930 film The King of Jazz with Roy Bargy on piano.Due to the length limitations of early recording formats, the first complete and unabridged recording of Gershwin's composition did not occur until the Great Depression. In July 1935, after several years of performing the rhapsody for sold-out audiences in Massachusetts, conductor Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the first unabridged version\u2014nearly fourteen minutes in length\u2014with Puerto Rican pianist Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Sanrom\u00e1 for RCA Victor. For this first unabridged recording, Fiedler discarded Ferde Grof\u00e9's original 1924 arrangement and adapted the piece for a conventional symphony.

Levant had been an intimate friend of the deceased composer, and he sought to replicate Gershwin's idiomatic playing style in his performance. Levant's homage\u2014labelled Columbia Masterworks 251\u2014received rapturous reviews and became one of the best-selling record albums of the year. As a result of Levant's recording and the 1945 biographical film about Gershwin's life, a \"Gershwin revival\" ensued.\n\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, Gershwin's rhapsody had become a predictable staple of both concert performances and orchestra recordings; consequently, more diverse and irreverent interpretations appeared over time. In Summer 1973, Brazilian jazz-rock artist Eumir Deodato reinterpreted Gershwin's rhapsody in an abridged version that featured uptempo neo\u2010samba rhythms. Although music critics derided Deodato's interpretation as \"mangled\" and barely recognizable, his single reached No. 41 on the \"Hot 100\" and No. 10 on \"Easy Listening\" on the Billboard charts, and No. 48 and No. 13 respectively in Canada. In the wake of Deodato's earlier reinterpretation, French pianist Richard Clayderman recorded a similarly abridged disco arrangement in 1978 which became one of his signature pieces.Concurrent with the emergence of these more diverse interpretations, scholarly interest revived in the original 1924 arrangement by Ferde Grof\u00e9 which had not been performed since the end of the Jazz Age. On February 14, 1973, conductor Kenneth Kiesler and pianist Paul Verrette performed Grof\u00e9's original arrangement on the University of New Hampshire campus. Soon after, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the Columbia Jazz Band recorded Grof\u00e9's arrangement in 1976, as did conductor Maurice Peress with pianist Ivan Davis in 1984 as part of a 60th-anniversary reconstruction of the entire 1924 concert.One hundred years after the debut of Gershwin's rhapsody in 1924, tens of thousands of orchestras as well as solo pianists have recorded the piece, both abridged and unabridged.

As a result of Levant's recording and the 1945 biographical film about Gershwin's life, a \"Gershwin revival\" ensued.\n\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, Gershwin's rhapsody had become a predictable staple of both concert performances and orchestra recordings; consequently, more diverse and irreverent interpretations appeared over time. In Summer 1973, Brazilian jazz-rock artist Eumir Deodato reinterpreted Gershwin's rhapsody in an abridged version that featured uptempo neo\u2010samba rhythms. Although music critics derided Deodato's interpretation as \"mangled\" and barely recognizable, his single reached No. 41 on the \"Hot 100\" and No. 10 on \"Easy Listening\" on the Billboard charts, and No. 48 and No. 13 respectively in Canada. In the wake of Deodato's earlier reinterpretation, French pianist Richard Clayderman recorded a similarly abridged disco arrangement in 1978 which became one of his signature pieces.Concurrent with the emergence of these more diverse interpretations, scholarly interest revived in the original 1924 arrangement by Ferde Grof\u00e9 which had not been performed since the end of the Jazz Age. On February 14, 1973, conductor Kenneth Kiesler and pianist Paul Verrette performed Grof\u00e9's original arrangement on the University of New Hampshire campus. Soon after, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the Columbia Jazz Band recorded Grof\u00e9's arrangement in 1976, as did conductor Maurice Peress with pianist Ivan Davis in 1984 as part of a 60th-anniversary reconstruction of the entire 1924 concert.One hundred years after the debut of Gershwin's rhapsody in 1924, tens of thousands of orchestras as well as solo pianists have recorded the piece, both abridged and unabridged. A number of these recordings have garnered critical recognition such as pianist Michel Camilo's 2006 rendition which won a Latin Grammy Award.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was written during his first year as director of church music in Leipzig and was first performed on 7 April 1724, at Good Friday Vespers at the St. Nicholas Church.The structure of the work falls in two halves, intended to flank a sermon. The anonymous libretto draws on existing works (notably by Barthold Heinrich Brockes) and is compiled from recitatives and choruses narrating the Passion of Christ as told in the Gospel of John, ariosos and arias reflecting on the action, and chorales using hymn tunes and texts familiar to a congregation of Bach's contemporaries. Compared with the St Matthew Passion, the St John Passion has been described as more extravagant, with an expressive immediacy, at times more unbridled and less \"finished\".The work is most often heard today in the 1739\u20131749 version (never performed during Bach's lifetime). Bach first performed the oratorio in 1724 and revised it in 1725, 1730, and 1749, adding several numbers. \"O Mensch, bewein dein S\u00fcnde gro\u00df\", a 1725 replacement for the opening chorus, found a new home in the 1736 St Matthew Passion but several arias from the revisions are found only in the appendices to modern editions.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51841", "text": "The St John Passion was intended for the vesper service on Good Friday of 1724, shortly after Bach's 39th birthday.

These were composed around 1718\u20131720, when Vivaldi was the court chapel master in Mantua. They were published in 1725 in Amsterdam, together with eight additional concerti, as Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione (The Contest Between Harmony and Invention).\nThe Four Seasons is the best known of Vivaldi's works. Though three of the concerti are wholly original, the first, \"Spring\", borrows patterns from a sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi's contemporaneous opera Il Giustino. The inspiration for the concertos is not the countryside around Mantua, as initially supposed, where Vivaldi was living at the time, since according to Karl Heller they could have been written as early as 1716\u20131717, while Vivaldi was engaged with the court of Mantua only in 1718.\nThey were a revolution in musical conception: Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), a shepherd and his barking dog, buzzing flies, storms, drunken dancers, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, and warm winter fires.\nUnusually for the period, Vivaldi published the concerti with accompanying sonnets (possibly written by the composer himself) that elucidated what it was in the spirit of each season that his music was intended to evoke. The concerti therefore stand as one of the earliest and most detailed examples of what would come to be called program music\u2014in other words, music with a narrative element. Vivaldi took great pains to relate his music to the texts of the poems, translating the poetic lines themselves directly into the music on the page. For example, in the middle section of \"Spring\", when the goatherd sleeps, his barking dog can be heard in the viola section. The music is elsewhere similarly evocative of other natural sounds.

It is based on Edna Ferber's best-selling 1926 novel of the same name. The musical follows the lives of the performers, stagehands and dock workers on the Cotton Blossom, a Mississippi River show boat, over 40 years from 1887 to 1927. Its themes include racial prejudice and tragic, enduring love. The musical contributed such classic songs as \"Ol' Man River\", \"Make Believe\", and \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\".\nThe musical was first produced in 1927 by Florenz Ziegfeld. The premiere of Show Boat on Broadway was an important event in the history of American musical theatre. It \"was a radical departure in musical storytelling, marrying spectacle with seriousness\", compared with the trivial and unrealistic operettas, light musical comedies and \"Follies\"-type musical revues that defined Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century. According to The Complete Book of Light Opera:\n\nHere we come to a completely new genre \u2013 the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy.  Now \u2026 the play was the thing, and everything else was subservient to that play. Now \u2026 came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity.\nThe quality of Show Boat was recognized immediately by critics, and it is frequently revived. Awards did not exist for Broadway shows in 1927, when the show premiered, or in 1932 when its first revival was staged.

Ferber researched these American showboats for months prior to her stay on the Floating Palace Theatre.  Jerome Kern was impressed by the novel and, hoping to adapt it as a musical, asked the critic Alexander Woollcott to introduce him to Ferber in October 1926. Woollcott introduced them that evening during the intermission of Kern's latest musical, Criss Cross.Ferber was at first shocked that anyone would want to adapt Show Boat as a musical. After being assured by Kern that he did not want to adapt it as the typical frivolous \"girlie\" show of the 1920s, she granted him and his collaborator, Oscar Hammerstein II, the rights to set her novel to music. After composing most of the first-act songs, Kern and Hammerstein auditioned their material for producer Florenz Ziegfeld, thinking that he was the person to create the elaborate production they felt necessary for Ferber's sprawling work.

Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists the show cannot proceed because Julie is a mulatto who has been passing as white and local law prohibits mixed marriages. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has \"black blood\" in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.\nRavenal returns and asks for passage on the boat.

Walter Kerr wrote in the New York Herald Tribune on September 27, 1957:\nThe radioactive fallout from West Side Story must still be descending on Broadway this morning. Director, choreographer, and idea-man Jerome Robbins has put together, and then blasted apart, the most savage, restless, electrifying dance patterns we've been exposed to in a dozen seasons .... the show rides with a catastrophic roar over the spider-web fire-escapes, the shadowed trestles, and the plain dirt battlegrounds of a big city feud ... there is fresh excitement in the next debacle, and the next. When a gang leader advises his cohorts to play it \"Cool\", the intolerable tension between an effort at control and the instinctive drives of these potential killers is stingingly graphic. When the knives come out, and bodies begin to fly wildly through space under buttermilk clouds, the sheer visual excitement is breathtaking .... Mr. Bernstein has permitted himself a few moments of graceful, lingering melody: in a yearning \"Maria\", in the hushed falling line of \"Tonight\", in the wistful declaration of \"I Have a Love\". But for the most part he has served the needs of the onstage threshing machine ... When hero Larry Kert is stomping out the visionary insistence of \"Something's Coming\" both music and tumultuous story are given their due. Otherwise it's the danced narrative that takes urgent precedence ...\nThe other reviews generally joined in speculation about how the new work would influence the course of musical theater. Typical was John Chapman's review in the New York Daily News on September 27, 1957, headed: \"West Side Story a Splendid and Super-Modern Musical Drama\".\n\nThe American theatre took a venturesome forward step when the firm of Griffith & Prince presented West Side Story at the Winter Garden last evening. This is a bold new kind of musical theatre \u2013 a juke-box Manhattan opera. It is, to me, extraordinarily exciting ... the manner of telling the story is a provocative and artful blend of music, dance and plot \u2013 and the music and the dancing are superb. In [the score], there is the drive, the bounce, the restlessness and the sweetness of our town. It takes up the American musical idiom where it was left when George Gershwin died. It is fascinatingly tricky and melodically beguiling, and it marks the progression of an admirable composer ...\nTime magazine found the dance and gang warfare more compelling than the love story and noted that the show's \"putting choreography foremost, may prove a milestone in musical-drama history\". One writer noted: \"The story appealed to society's undercurrent of rebellion from authority that surfaced in 1950s films like Rebel Without a Cause. ... Robbins' energetic choreography and Bernstein's grand score accentuated the satiric, hard-edged lyrics of Sondheim, and Laurents' capture of the angry voice of urban youth.

Walter Kerr wrote in the New York Herald Tribune on September 27, 1957:\nThe radioactive fallout from West Side Story must still be descending on Broadway this morning. Director, choreographer, and idea-man Jerome Robbins has put together, and then blasted apart, the most savage, restless, electrifying dance patterns we've been exposed to in a dozen seasons .... the show rides with a catastrophic roar over the spider-web fire-escapes, the shadowed trestles, and the plain dirt battlegrounds of a big city feud ... there is fresh excitement in the next debacle, and the next. When a gang leader advises his cohorts to play it \"Cool\", the intolerable tension between an effort at control and the instinctive drives of these potential killers is stingingly graphic. When the knives come out, and bodies begin to fly wildly through space under buttermilk clouds, the sheer visual excitement is breathtaking .... Mr. Bernstein has permitted himself a few moments of graceful, lingering melody: in a yearning \"Maria\", in the hushed falling line of \"Tonight\", in the wistful declaration of \"I Have a Love\". But for the most part he has served the needs of the onstage threshing machine ... When hero Larry Kert is stomping out the visionary insistence of \"Something's Coming\" both music and tumultuous story are given their due. Otherwise it's the danced narrative that takes urgent precedence ...\nThe other reviews generally joined in speculation about how the new work would influence the course of musical theater. Typical was John Chapman's review in the New York Daily News on September 27, 1957, headed: \"West Side Story a Splendid and Super-Modern Musical Drama\".\n\nThe American theatre took a venturesome forward step when the firm of Griffith & Prince presented West Side Story at the Winter Garden last evening. This is a bold new kind of musical theatre \u2013 a juke-box Manhattan opera. It is, to me, extraordinarily exciting ... the manner of telling the story is a provocative and artful blend of music, dance and plot \u2013 and the music and the dancing are superb. In [the score], there is the drive, the bounce, the restlessness and the sweetness of our town. It takes up the American musical idiom where it was left when George Gershwin died. It is fascinatingly tricky and melodically beguiling, and it marks the progression of an admirable composer ...\nTime magazine found the dance and gang warfare more compelling than the love story and noted that the show's \"putting choreography foremost, may prove a milestone in musical-drama history\". One writer noted: \"The story appealed to society's undercurrent of rebellion from authority that surfaced in 1950s films like Rebel Without a Cause. ... Robbins' energetic choreography and Bernstein's grand score accentuated the satiric, hard-edged lyrics of Sondheim, and Laurents' capture of the angry voice of urban youth.

It was based on a libretto by Angelo Anelli for Stefano Pavesi's opera Ser Marcantonio written in 1810 but, on the published libretto, the author appears as \"M.A.\"\nDonizetti so dominated the preparation of the libretto that Ruffini refused to allow his name to be put on the score. This resulted in confusion over the identity of the librettist for more than half a century, but as Herbert Weinstock establishes, it was largely Ruffini's work and, in withholding his name from it as librettist, \"Donizetti or [his assistant] Accursi may have thought that, lacking Ruffini's name, the authorship might as well be assigned to Accursi's initials as to a pseudonym\".The opera was first performed on 3 January 1843 by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour in Paris with great success and it is generally regarded as being the high point of the 19th century opera buffa tradition and, in fact, marking its ending.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51920", "text": "Donizetti had just returned to Paris from Vienna in the autumn of 1842 and it was there that it was suggested to him by Jules Janin, the newly appointed director of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien, that he might compose a new opera for that house.  Janin prepared a formal proposal on 27 September, but while no specific subject nor title was mentioned, Janin suggested that it should be a new opera buffa tailored to the talents of some major singers including Giulia Grisi, Antonio Tamburini, and Luigi Lablache. At around the same time in September, the Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 librettist Giovanni Ruffini, who lived in Paris, was approached by Michele Accursi (who is described as \"Donizetti's Paris factotum, [an] Italian exile, and politically treacherous double agent\" ) with the suggestion that Ruffini offer his services to Donizetti as a librettist. This is confirmed by a letter from Ruffini to his mother of around 5 October in which the librettist tells her of Accursi's suggestion that the composer would use a story which was written in 1810 and that he would need \"a working stonemason of verses to remake the old libretto, to cut, change, add, plaster, and I don't know what.\"  In addition, it is clear from another letter on 11 October to his mother that Ruffini is hard at work: \"I've been eating up the paper, as they say.  It's not a question of doing it well or doing it badly, but of doing it fast.\"  By the end, Ruffini stated that so much of the refinement of the work had been done by Donizetti that he felt that \"my freedom of action having been paralyzed by the maestro, I don't, so to say, recognize it as mine\".  Therefore, he refused to have his name associated with the libretto, which was eventually published by Casa Ricordi as by \"M.A.\", since it was Accursi who officially ceded the rights to Ricordi so long as his name was never associated with the work.In the tradition of opera buffa, the opera makes reference to the stock characters of the commedia dell'arte.

It was first produced at La Scala in Milan on 26 December 1831.\nThe opera is regarded as a leading example of the bel canto genre, and the soprano prayer \"Casta diva\" in Act 1 is a famous piece. Among the well known singers of Norma of the first half of the 20th century was Rosa Ponselle who played the role in New York and London. Notable exponents of the title role in the post-war period have been Maria Callas, Leyla Gencer, Joan Sutherland, and Montserrat Caball\u00e9.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51924", "text": "Crivelli and Company were managing both La Scala and La Fenice in Venice, and as a result, in April\u2013May 1830 Bellini was able to negotiate a contract with them for two operas, one at each theatre. The opera for December 1831 at La Scala became Norma, while the one for the 1832 Carnival season at La Fenice became Beatrice di Tenda.With Bellini's La sonnambula successfully staged in March 1831 and Giuditta Pasta having demonstrated her extensive vocal and dramatic ranges in creating the role of Amina, the Swiss village maiden, she had been engaged by La Scala for her debut during the following season. Bellini and Romani then began to consider the subject of the coming autumn's opera. By the summer, they had decided to base it on Alexandre Soumet's play which was being performed in Paris at around that time and which Pasta would have seen.\nFor the forthcoming autumn/winter season, La Scala had engaged Giulia Grisi (the sister of Giuditta Grisi) and the well-known tenor Domenico Donzelli, who had made a name for himself with Rossini roles, especially that of Otello. They would fill the roles of Adalgisa and Pollione. Donzelli provided Bellini with precise details of his vocal capabilities which were confirmed by a report which the Neapolitan composer Saverio Mercadante also provided. By the end of August it appears that Romani had completed a considerable amount of the libretto, enough at least to allow Bellini to begin work, which he certainly did in the first weeks of September as the verses were supplied. He reported in a letter to Pasta on 1 September:\n\nI hope that you will find this subject to your liking. Romani believes it to be very effective, and precisely because of the all-inclusive character for you, which is that of Norma. He will manipulate the situations so that they will not resemble other subjects at all, and he will retouch, even change, the characters to produce more effect, if need be.\nNorma was completed by about the end of November. While, for Romani, it became \"the most beautiful rose in the garland\" of all his work with Bellini, it was not achieved without some struggles. Bellini, now at the height of his powers, was very demanding of his librettist and required many re-writes before he was satisfied enough to set it to music.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51925", "text": "The title role\u2014\"one of the most taxing and wide-ranging parts in the entire repertory\"\u2014is one of the most difficult in the soprano repertoire. It calls for great vocal control of range, flexibility, and dynamics as well as containing a wide range of emotions: conflict of personal and public life, romantic life, maternal love, friendship, jealousy, murderous intent, and resignation. The German soprano Lilli Lehmann once remarked that the singing of all three Br\u00fcnnhilde roles of Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen in one evening would be less stressful than the singing of one Norma. She also commented \"When you sing Wagner, you are so carried away by the dramatic emotion, the action, and the scene that you do not have to think how to sing the words. That comes of itself. But in Bellini, you must always have a care for beauty of tone and correct emission.\" According to the Met Opera Archives, Lehmann said this to Herald Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel.\nThroughout the 20th century, many singers have tackled the role of Norma. In the early 1920s, it was Rosa Raisa, Claudia Muzio, and Rosa Ponselle who were each admired. Maria Callas emerged as a major force in the role in the post-World War II period. She made two studio recordings of the opera for EMI/HMV, and several broadcasts of her live performances have been preserved from the early 1950s through her final performances of the role in Paris in May 1965.\nIn the 1960s, two very different performers sang the role: the Australian Dame Joan Sutherland and the Turkish Leyla Gencer. Following Sutherland's 1963 debut as Norma, Luciano Pavarotti called her \"the greatest female voice of all time.\"The Dutch coloratura Cristina Deutekom tackled the role in 1970.

The opera for December 1831 at La Scala became Norma, while the one for the 1832 Carnival season at La Fenice became Beatrice di Tenda.With Bellini's La sonnambula successfully staged in March 1831 and Giuditta Pasta having demonstrated her extensive vocal and dramatic ranges in creating the role of Amina, the Swiss village maiden, she had been engaged by La Scala for her debut during the following season. Bellini and Romani then began to consider the subject of the coming autumn's opera. By the summer, they had decided to base it on Alexandre Soumet's play which was being performed in Paris at around that time and which Pasta would have seen.\nFor the forthcoming autumn/winter season, La Scala had engaged Giulia Grisi (the sister of Giuditta Grisi) and the well-known tenor Domenico Donzelli, who had made a name for himself with Rossini roles, especially that of Otello. They would fill the roles of Adalgisa and Pollione. Donzelli provided Bellini with precise details of his vocal capabilities which were confirmed by a report which the Neapolitan composer Saverio Mercadante also provided. By the end of August it appears that Romani had completed a considerable amount of the libretto, enough at least to allow Bellini to begin work, which he certainly did in the first weeks of September as the verses were supplied. He reported in a letter to Pasta on 1 September:\n\nI hope that you will find this subject to your liking. Romani believes it to be very effective, and precisely because of the all-inclusive character for you, which is that of Norma. He will manipulate the situations so that they will not resemble other subjects at all, and he will retouch, even change, the characters to produce more effect, if need be.\nNorma was completed by about the end of November. While, for Romani, it became \"the most beautiful rose in the garland\" of all his work with Bellini, it was not achieved without some struggles. Bellini, now at the height of his powers, was very demanding of his librettist and required many re-writes before he was satisfied enough to set it to music.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_51925", "text": "The title role\u2014\"one of the most taxing and wide-ranging parts in the entire repertory\"\u2014is one of the most difficult in the soprano repertoire. It calls for great vocal control of range, flexibility, and dynamics as well as containing a wide range of emotions: conflict of personal and public life, romantic life, maternal love, friendship, jealousy, murderous intent, and resignation. The German soprano Lilli Lehmann once remarked that the singing of all three Br\u00fcnnhilde roles of Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen in one evening would be less stressful than the singing of one Norma. She also commented \"When you sing Wagner, you are so carried away by the dramatic emotion, the action, and the scene that you do not have to think how to sing the words. That comes of itself. But in Bellini, you must always have a care for beauty of tone and correct emission.\" According to the Met Opera Archives, Lehmann said this to Herald Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel.\nThroughout the 20th century, many singers have tackled the role of Norma. In the early 1920s, it was Rosa Raisa, Claudia Muzio, and Rosa Ponselle who were each admired. Maria Callas emerged as a major force in the role in the post-World War II period. She made two studio recordings of the opera for EMI/HMV, and several broadcasts of her live performances have been preserved from the early 1950s through her final performances of the role in Paris in May 1965.\nIn the 1960s, two very different performers sang the role: the Australian Dame Joan Sutherland and the Turkish Leyla Gencer. Following Sutherland's 1963 debut as Norma, Luciano Pavarotti called her \"the greatest female voice of all time.\"The Dutch coloratura Cristina Deutekom tackled the role in 1970.

Given the complications of the original plot and the generally poor popular response \u2013 although the critical one was more encouraging \u2013 the opera dropped out of favour after 1866.  Finally, 23 years later, Verdi's publisher persuaded the composer to revise the opera, with text changes to be prepared by Arrigo Boito, the librettist who aspired to work with the aging composer on a project which eventually became a new opera, Otello, but to which Verdi had not totally committed at that time.\nThe revised version of Simon Boccanegra, with the now-famous Council Chamber scene, was first performed at La Scala in Milan on 24 March 1881.

But a year later, when overseeing a revival of La traviata at La Fenice, he agreed to a new opera for that house for the 1856/7 season, and he proposed the Guti\u00e9rrez play, which Budden presumes he had read in translation. Budden also presumes that the translation had been done by Strepponi, because she had been the translator of Guti\u00e9rrez' other play which had become Il trovatore.\nThe somewhat convoluted plot of Simon Boccanegra can be hard to follow.

It is Mussorgsky's only completed opera and is considered his masterpiece.

The composer created two versions\u2014the Original Version of 1869, which was rejected for production by the Imperial Theatres, and the Revised Version of 1872, which received its first performance in 1874 in Saint Petersburg.\nBoris Godunov has often been subjected to cuts, recomposition, re-orchestration, transposition of scenes, or conflation of the original and revised versions.\nSeveral composers, chief among them Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov and Dmitri Shostakovich, have created new editions of the opera to \"correct\" perceived technical weaknesses in the composer's original scores. Although these versions held the stage for decades, Mussorgsky's individual harmonic style and orchestration are now valued for their originality, and revisions by other hands have fallen out of fashion.\nIn the 1980s, Boris Godunov was closer to the status of a repertory piece than any other Russian opera, even Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, and is the most recorded Russian opera.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51950", "text": "Note: Musicologists are often not in agreement on the terms used to refer to the two authorial versions of Boris Godunov.

It was the first Shakespeare play that Verdi adapted for the operatic stage.\nAlmost twenty years later, Macbeth was revised and expanded into a French version and given in Paris on 21 April 1865. \nAfter the success of Attila in 1846, by which time the composer had become well-established, Macbeth came before the great successes of 1851 to 1853 (Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata) which propelled him into universal fame.  As sources, Shakespeare's plays provided Verdi with lifelong inspiration: some, such as an adaption of King Lear (as Re Lear) were never realized, but he wrote his two final operas using Othello as the basis for Otello (1887) and The Merry Wives of Windsor as the basis for Falstaff (1893).\nThe first version of Macbeth was completed during the time that Verdi described as his \"galley years,\" which ranged over 16 years and one that saw the composer produce 22 operas. By the standards of the subject matter of almost all Italian operas during the first fifty years of the 19th century, Macbeth was highly unusual.  The 1847 version was very successful, and it was presented widely. Pleased with his opera and with its reception, Verdi wrote to Antonio Barezzi, his former father-in-law and long-time supporter, about two weeks after the premiere:\n\nI have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, who have been father, benefactor, and friend to me.

It relates the journey of a pious man's soul from his deathbed to his judgment before God and settling into Purgatory. Elgar disapproved of the use of the term \"oratorio\" for the work (and the term occurs nowhere in the score), though his wishes are not always followed. The piece is widely regarded as Elgar's finest choral work, and some consider it his masterpiece.\nThe work was composed for the Birmingham Music Festival of 1900; the first performance took place on 3 October 1900, in Birmingham Town Hall. It was badly performed at the premiere, but later performances in Germany revealed its stature. In the first decade after its premiere, the Roman Catholic theology in Newman's poem caused difficulties in getting the work performed in Anglican cathedrals, and a revised text was used for performances at the Three Choirs Festival until 1910.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51977", "text": "Edward Elgar was not the first composer to think about setting John Henry Newman's poem \"The Dream of Gerontius\".

Elgar knew the poem well; he had owned a copy since at least 1885, and in 1889 he was given another as a wedding present. This copy contained handwritten transcriptions of extensive notes that had been made by General Gordon, and Elgar is known to have thought of the text in musical terms for several years. Throughout the 1890s, Elgar had composed several large-scale works for the regular festivals that were a key part of Britain's musical life. In 1898, based on his growing reputation, he was asked to write a major work for the 1900 Birmingham Triennial Music Festival. He was unable to start work on the poem that he knew so well until the autumn of 1899, and did so only after first considering a different subject.\nComposition proceeded quickly. Elgar and August Jaeger, his editor at the publisher Novello, exchanged frequent, sometimes daily, letters, which show how Jaeger helped in shaping the work, and in particular the climactic depiction of the moment of judgment. By the time Elgar had completed the work and Novello had printed it, there were only three months to the premiere. The Birmingham chorus, all amateurs, struggled to master Elgar's complex, demanding and somewhat revolutionary work. Matters were made worse by the sudden death of the chorus master Charles Swinnerton Heap and his replacement by William Stockley, an elderly musician who found the music beyond him. The conductor of the premiere, Hans Richter, received a copy of the full score only on the eve of the first orchestral rehearsal. The soloists at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900 were Marie Brema, Edward Lloyd and Harry Plunket Greene. The first performance was, famously, a near disaster. The choir could not sing the music adequately, and two of the three soloists were in poor voice. Elgar was deeply upset at the debacle, telling Jaeger, \"I have allowed my heart to open once \u2013 it is now shut against every religious feeling & every soft, gentle impulse for ever.\" However, many of the critics could see past the imperfect realisation and the work became established in Britain once it had had its first London performance on 6 June 1903, at the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral.Shortly after the premiere, the German conductor and chorus master Julius Buths made a German translation of the text and arranged a successful performance in D\u00fcsseldorf on 19 December 1901. Elgar was present, and he wrote \"It completely bore out my idea of the work: the chorus was very fine\". Buths presented it in D\u00fcsseldorf again on 19 May 1902 in conjunction with the Lower Rhenish Music Festival. The soloists included Muriel Foster and tenor Ludwig W\u00fcllner, and Elgar was again in the audience, being called to the stage twenty times to receive the audience's applause. This was the performance that finally convinced Elgar for the first time that he had written a truly satisfying work. Buths's festival co-director Richard Strauss was impressed enough by what he heard that at a post-concert banquet he said: \"I drink to the success and welfare of the first English progressive musician, Meister Elgar\". This greatly pleased Elgar, who considered Strauss to be \"the greatest genius of the age\".The strong Roman Catholicism of the work gave rise to objections in some influential British quarters; some Anglican clerics insisted that for performances in English cathedrals Elgar should modify the text to tone down the Roman Catholic references. There was no Anglican objection to Newman's words in general: Arthur Sullivan's setting of his \"Lead, Kindly Light\", for example, was sung at Westminster Abbey in 1904. Disapproval was reserved for the doctrinal aspects of The Dream of Gerontius repugnant to Anglicans, such as Purgatory. Elgar was unable to resist the suggested bowdlerisation, and in the ten years after the premiere the work was given at the Three Choirs Festival with an expurgated text. The Dean of Gloucester refused admission to the work until 1910. This attitude lingered until the 1930s, when the Dean of Peterborough banned the work from the cathedral. Elgar was also faced with many people's assumption that he would use the standard hymn tunes for the sections of the poem that had already been absorbed into Anglican hymn books: \"Firmly I believe and truly\", and \"Praise to the Holiest in the Height\".\nThe Dream of Gerontius received its US premiere on 23 March 1903 at The Auditorium, Chicago, conducted by Harrison M. Wild. It was given in New York, conducted by Walter Damrosch three days later. It was performed in Sydney, in 1903.

{"id": "86_455", "question": "Who composed The Rite of Spring?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_51982", "text": "The Rite of Spring (French: Le Sacre du printemps) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a \"riot\" or \"near-riot\", though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later. Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.\nStravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. Le Sacre du printemps was the third such major project, after the acclaimed Firebird (1910) and Petrushka (1911). The concept behind The Rite of Spring, developed by Roerich from Stravinsky's outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, \"Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts\"; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by L\u00e9onide Massine replaced Nijinsky's original, which saw only eight performances. Massine's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world's leading choreographers, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinsky's original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles.\nStravinsky's score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. Regarded as among the first modernist works, the music influenced many of the 20th-century's leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_51983", "text": "Igor Stravinsky was the son of Fyodor Stravinsky, the principal bass singer at the Imperial Opera, Saint Petersburg, and Anna, n\u00e9e Kholodovskaya, a competent amateur singer and pianist from an old-established Russian family. Fyodor's association with many of the leading figures in Russian music, including Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky, meant that Igor grew up in an intensely musical home. In 1901 Stravinsky began to study law at Saint Petersburg University while taking private lessons in harmony and counterpoint. Stravinsky worked under the guidance of Rimsky-Korsakov, having impressed him with some of his early compositional efforts. By the time of his mentor's death in 1908, Stravinsky had produced several works, among them a Piano Sonata in F\u266f minor (1903\u201304), a Symphony in E\u266d major (1907), which he catalogued as \"Opus 1\", and a short orchestral piece, Feu d'artifice (\"Fireworks\", composed in 1908).\nIn 1909 Feu d'artifice was performed at a concert in Saint Petersburg. Among those in the audience was the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who at that time was planning to introduce Russian music and art to western audiences.

Bach most likely composed them during the period 1717\u20131723, when he served as Kapellmeister in K\u00f6then. The title given on the cover of the Anna Magdalena Bach manuscript was Suites \u00e0 Violoncello Solo senza Basso (Suites for cello solo without bass).\nAs usual in a Baroque musical suite, after the prelude which begins each suite, all the other movements are based around baroque dance types. The cello suites are structured in six movements each: prelude, allemande, courante, sarabande, two minuets or two bourr\u00e9es or two gavottes, and a final gigue. Gary S. Dalkin of MusicWeb International called Bach's cello suites \"among the most profound of all classical music works\" and Wilfrid Mellers described them in 1980 as \"Monophonic music wherein a man has created a dance of God\".Due to the works' technical demands, \u00e9tude-like nature, and difficulty in interpretation because of the non-annotated nature of the surviving copies and the many discrepancies between them, the cello suites were little known and rarely publicly performed in the modern era until they were recorded by Pablo Casals (1876\u20131973) in the early 20th century.

The Count was often ill and had sleepless nights. At such times, Goldberg, who lived in his house, had to spend the night in an antechamber, so as to play for him during his insomnia. ... Once the Count mentioned in Bach's presence that he would like to have some clavier pieces for Goldberg, which should be of such a smooth and somewhat lively character that he might be a little cheered up by them in his sleepless nights. Bach thought himself best able to fulfill this wish by means of Variations, the writing of which he had until then considered an ungrateful task on account of the repeatedly similar harmonic foundation. But since at this time all his works were already models of art, such also these variations became under his hand. Yet he produced only a single work of this kind. Thereafter the Count always called them his variations. He never tired of them, and for a long time sleepless nights meant: \"Dear Goldberg, do play me one of my variations.\" Bach was perhaps never so rewarded for one of his works as for this. The Count presented him with a golden goblet filled with 100 Louis d'or. Nevertheless, even had the gift been a thousand times larger, their artistic value would not yet have been paid for.\nForkel wrote his biography in 1802, more than 60 years after the events related, and its accuracy has been questioned. The lack of dedication on the title page also makes the tale of the commission unlikely. Goldberg's age at the time of publication (14 years) has also been cited as grounds for doubting Forkel's tale, although it must be said that he was known to be an accomplished keyboardist and sight-reader. Williams (2001) contends that the Forkel story is entirely spurious.\nArnold Schering has suggested that the aria on which the variations are based was not written by Bach.

The edition contains various printing errors.The title page, shown in the figure above, reads in German:\n\nThe term \"Clavier Ubung\" (nowadays spelled \"Klavier\u00fcbung\") had been assigned by Bach to some of his previous keyboard works.

This copy includes printing corrections made by the composer and additional music in the form of fourteen canons on the Goldberg ground (see below).

The Count was often ill and had sleepless nights. At such times, Goldberg, who lived in his house, had to spend the night in an antechamber, so as to play for him during his insomnia. ... Once the Count mentioned in Bach's presence that he would like to have some clavier pieces for Goldberg, which should be of such a smooth and somewhat lively character that he might be a little cheered up by them in his sleepless nights. Bach thought himself best able to fulfill this wish by means of Variations, the writing of which he had until then considered an ungrateful task on account of the repeatedly similar harmonic foundation. But since at this time all his works were already models of art, such also these variations became under his hand. Yet he produced only a single work of this kind. Thereafter the Count always called them his variations. He never tired of them, and for a long time sleepless nights meant: \"Dear Goldberg, do play me one of my variations.\" Bach was perhaps never so rewarded for one of his works as for this. The Count presented him with a golden goblet filled with 100 Louis d'or. Nevertheless, even had the gift been a thousand times larger, their artistic value would not yet have been paid for.\nForkel wrote his biography in 1802, more than 60 years after the events related, and its accuracy has been questioned. The lack of dedication on the title page also makes the tale of the commission unlikely. Goldberg's age at the time of publication (14 years) has also been cited as grounds for doubting Forkel's tale, although it must be said that he was known to be an accomplished keyboardist and sight-reader. Williams (2001) contends that the Forkel story is entirely spurious.\nArnold Schering has suggested that the aria on which the variations are based was not written by Bach. More recent scholarly literature (such as the edition by Christoph Wolff) suggests that there is no basis for such doubts.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_52010", "text": "Rather unusually for Bach's works, the Goldberg Variations were published in his own lifetime, in 1741. The publisher was Bach's friend Balthasar Schmid of Nuremberg. Schmid printed the work by making engraved copper plates (rather than using movable type); thus the notes of the first edition are in Schmid's own handwriting. The edition contains various printing errors.The title page, shown in the figure above, reads in German:\n\nThe term \"Clavier Ubung\" (nowadays spelled \"Klavier\u00fcbung\") had been assigned by Bach to some of his previous keyboard works. Klavier\u00fcbung part 1 was the six partitas, part 2 the Italian Concerto and French Overture, and part 3 a series of chorale preludes for organ framed by a prelude and fugue in E\u266d major. Although Bach also called his variations \"Klavier\u00fcbung\", he did not specifically designate them as the fourth in this series.Nineteen copies of the first edition survive today. Of these, the most valuable is the Handexemplar (Bach's personal copy of the published score), discovered in 1974 in Strasbourg by the French musicologist Olivier Alain and now kept in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, Paris. This copy includes printing corrections made by the composer and additional music in the form of fourteen canons on the Goldberg ground (see below). The nineteen printed copies provide virtually the only information available to modern editors trying to reconstruct Bach's intent, as the autograph (handwritten) score has not survived.

Although the date of its origin is unknown, scholars have suggested between 1704 and the 1750s. The piece opens with a toccata section followed by a fugue that ends in a coda, and is largely typical of the north German organ school of the Baroque era.\nLittle is known about its early existence until the piece was discovered in an undated manuscript produced by Johannes Ringk. It was first published in 1833 during the early Bach Revival period through the efforts of composer Felix Mendelssohn, who also performed the piece in 1840. It was not until the 20th century that its popularity rose above that of other organ compositions by Bach, as exemplified by its inclusion in Walt Disney's 1940 animated film Fantasia that featured Leopold Stokowski's orchestral transcription from 1927.\nThe piece has been subject to a wide, and often conflicting, variety of analyses. It is often described as a type of program music depicting a storm, while in the context of Fantasia, is promoted as non-representational or absolute music. Scholars such as Peter Williams and Rolf Dietrich Claus argued against its authenticity, while Christoph Wolff defended the attribution to Bach. Other commentators ignored the doubts over its authenticity, or considered the attribution issue undecided.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_52070", "text": "The only extant near-contemporary source for BWV 565 is an undated copy by Johannes Ringk. According to the description provided by the Berlin State Library, where the manuscript is kept, and similar bibliographic descriptions, e.g. in the RISM catalogue, Ringk created his copy between 1740 and 1760. As far as is known, Ringk produced his first copy of a Bach score in 1730 when he was 12. According to Dietrich Kilian, who edited BWV 565 for the New Bach Edition, Ringk made his copy of the Toccata and Fugue between 1730 and 1740. In his critical commentary for Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel's 21st-century revised edition of the score, Jean-Claude Zehnder narrows the time of origin of the manuscript down to around the middle of the first half of the 1730s, based on an analysis of the evolution of Ringk's handwriting. At the time Ringk was a student of Bach's former student Johann Peter Kellner at Gr\u00e4fenroda, and probably faithfully copied what his teacher put before him. There are some errors in the score such as note values not adding up to fill a measure correctly. Such defects show a carelessness deemed typical of Kellner, who left over 60 copies of works by Bach.The title page of Ringk's manuscript writes the title of the work in Italian as Toccata con Fuga, names Johann Sebastian Bach as the composer of the piece, and indicates its tonality as \"ex. d. #.\", which is usually seen as the key signature being D minor.

According to the description provided by the Berlin State Library, where the manuscript is kept, and similar bibliographic descriptions, e.g. in the RISM catalogue, Ringk created his copy between 1740 and 1760. As far as is known, Ringk produced his first copy of a Bach score in 1730 when he was 12. According to Dietrich Kilian, who edited BWV 565 for the New Bach Edition, Ringk made his copy of the Toccata and Fugue between 1730 and 1740. In his critical commentary for Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel's 21st-century revised edition of the score, Jean-Claude Zehnder narrows the time of origin of the manuscript down to around the middle of the first half of the 1730s, based on an analysis of the evolution of Ringk's handwriting. At the time Ringk was a student of Bach's former student Johann Peter Kellner at Gr\u00e4fenroda, and probably faithfully copied what his teacher put before him. There are some errors in the score such as note values not adding up to fill a measure correctly. Such defects show a carelessness deemed typical of Kellner, who left over 60 copies of works by Bach.The title page of Ringk's manuscript writes the title of the work in Italian as Toccata con Fuga, names Johann Sebastian Bach as the composer of the piece, and indicates its tonality as \"ex. d. #.\", which is usually seen as the key signature being D minor.

La Cenerentola, which he completed in a period of three weeks, is considered to have some of his finest writing for solo voice and ensembles. Rossini saved some time by reusing an overture from La gazzetta and part of an aria from The Barber of Seville and by enlisting a collaborator, Luca Agolini, who wrote the secco recitatives and three numbers (Alidoro's \"Vasto teatro \u00e8 il mondo\", Clorinda's \"Sventurata! Mi credea\" and the chorus \"Ah, della bella incognita\").

However, Shaw, having had a bad experience with The Chocolate Soldier, a Viennese operetta based on his play Arms and the Man, refused permission for Pygmalion to be adapted into a musical. After Shaw died in 1950, Pascal asked lyricist Alan Jay Lerner to write the musical adaptation. Lerner agreed, and he and his partner Frederick Loewe began work. But they quickly realised that the play violated several key rules for constructing a musical: the main story was not a love story, there was no subplot or secondary love story, and there was no place for an ensemble. Many people, including Oscar Hammerstein II, who, with Richard Rodgers, had also tried his hand at adapting Pygmalion into a musical and had given up, told Lerner that converting the play to a musical was impossible, so he and Loewe abandoned the project for two years.During this time, the collaborators separated and Gabriel Pascal died. Lerner had been trying to musicalize Li'l Abner when he read Pascal's obituary and found himself thinking about Pygmalion again. When he and Loewe reunited, everything fell into place. All of the insurmountable obstacles that had stood in their way two years earlier disappeared when the team realised that the play needed few changes apart from (according to Lerner) \"adding the action that took place between the acts of the play\". They then excitedly began writing the show. However, Chase Manhattan Bank was in charge of Pascal's estate, and the musical rights to Pygmalion were sought both by Lerner and Loewe and by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, whose executives called Lerner to discourage him from challenging the studio.

However, Shaw, having had a bad experience with The Chocolate Soldier, a Viennese operetta based on his play Arms and the Man, refused permission for Pygmalion to be adapted into a musical. After Shaw died in 1950, Pascal asked lyricist Alan Jay Lerner to write the musical adaptation. Lerner agreed, and he and his partner Frederick Loewe began work. But they quickly realised that the play violated several key rules for constructing a musical: the main story was not a love story, there was no subplot or secondary love story, and there was no place for an ensemble. Many people, including Oscar Hammerstein II, who, with Richard Rodgers, had also tried his hand at adapting Pygmalion into a musical and had given up, told Lerner that converting the play to a musical was impossible, so he and Loewe abandoned the project for two years.During this time, the collaborators separated and Gabriel Pascal died. Lerner had been trying to musicalize Li'l Abner when he read Pascal's obituary and found himself thinking about Pygmalion again. When he and Loewe reunited, everything fell into place. All of the insurmountable obstacles that had stood in their way two years earlier disappeared when the team realised that the play needed few changes apart from (according to Lerner) \"adding the action that took place between the acts of the play\". They then excitedly began writing the show. However, Chase Manhattan Bank was in charge of Pascal's estate, and the musical rights to Pygmalion were sought both by Lerner and Loewe and by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, whose executives called Lerner to discourage him from challenging the studio. Loewe said, \"We will write the show without the rights, and when the time comes for them to decide who is to get them, we will be so far ahead of everyone else that they will be forced to give them to us.\" For five months Lerner and Loewe wrote, hired technical designers, and made casting decisions.

The film was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff (in their feature directorial debuts) and produced by Don Hahn, from a screenplay written by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick, Moira Kelly, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Rowan Atkinson, and Robert Guillaume. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, with a score by Hans Zimmer. Inspired by African wildlife, the story is modelled primarily on William Shakespeare's stage play Hamlet with some influence from the Biblical stories of Joseph and Moses, and follows a young heir apparent who is forced to flee after his uncle kills his father and usurps the throne. After growing up in exile, the rightful king returns to challenge the usurper and end his tyrannical rule over the kingdom.\nInitially, The Lion King was supposed to be a non-musical, leaning towards a style similar to that of a documentary. George Scribner, who had made his feature directorial debut with Oliver & Company (1988), was hired to direct, with Allers joining him soon after following his work as a story artist or head of story on Oliver & Company, The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), and Aladdin (1992). Allers brought in Brenda Chapman and Chris Sanders, whom he had worked with on Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, to serve as head of story and production designer, respectively.\nWoolverton, who had just wrapped up work as screenwriter for Beauty and the Beast, wrote the initial draft of the screenplay for this film, but following her departure from the project to write the libretto for the Broadway adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, Mecchi and Roberts were brought on board to finish and revise the script. Six months into production, Scribner left the project due to creative differences with Allers, producer Hahn, and Chapman about changing it into a musical, and Minkoff was hired to replace him in April 1992. Additionally, Beauty and the Beast directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise were hired to perform some additional rewrites to the script and story. Throughout production, Allers, Scribner, Minkoff, Hahn, Chapman, Sanders, and several other animators visited Kenya to observe wildlife and get inspiration for the characters and setting.\nThe Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, receiving critical acclaim for its music, story, themes, and animation. With an initial worldwide gross of $763 million, it finished its theatrical run as the highest-grossing film of 1994 and the second-highest-grossing film of all time, behind Jurassic Park (1993). It also held the title of being the highest-grossing animated film, until it was overtaken by Finding Nemo (2003). The film remains the highest-grossing traditionally animated film of all time, as well as the best-selling film on home video, having sold over 55 million copies worldwide. It received two Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy. It is considered by many to be among the greatest animated films ever made.\nThe film has led to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation in 1997; two direct-to-video follow-ups\u2014the sequel, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998), and the prequel/parallel, The Lion King 1\u00bd (2004); two television series, The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa (1995-1999) and The Lion Guard (2016-2019), the latter which premiered as a television film titled The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar in 2015; and a photorealistic remake in 2019, which also became the highest-grossing animated film at the time of its release. In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

Scar tricks Simba into believing that the event was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. He then orders the hyenas to kill Simba, but he escapes.

Scar begs for mercy and blames his actions on the hyenas; Simba spares Scar's life but, quoting what Scar told him long ago, orders Scar to leave the Pride Lands forever.

One day, Simba and his best friend Nala explore an elephant graveyard, where the two are chased by three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Mufasa is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed with Simba for disobeying him and endangering himself and Nala, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar, having planned the attack, visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill both Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.\nScar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede to trample him. Mufasa saves Simba but winds up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge; he begs for Scar's help, but Scar throws Mufasa back into the stampede to his death. Scar tricks Simba into believing that the event was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. He then orders the hyenas to kill Simba, but he escapes. Unaware of Simba's survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both his brother and nephew and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands.\nAfter he collapses in a desert, Simba is rescued by two outcasts, a meerkat and a warthog named Timon and Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in Swahili). Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. Simba and Nala fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become drought-stricken under Scar's reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa's spirit lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.\nAided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who taunts Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock. Enraged by the revelation that Scar killed his father, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to confess the truth to the rest of the pride. A battle breaks out between Simba and his allies and the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape, but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and blames his actions on the hyenas; Simba spares Scar's life but, quoting what Scar told him long ago, orders Scar to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar refuses and attacks his nephew, but following a brief battle, Simba throws him off the ledge to the ground below. Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and maul him to death.\nWith Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his place as king and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, thus continuing the circle of life.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_52104", "text": "Matthew Broderick as Simba, son of Mufasa and Sarabi, who grows up to become King of the Pride Lands.

Meyerbeer and Scribe began working on the opera in 1837, using the title L'Africaine, but around 1852 changed the plot to portray fictitious events in the life of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama and introduced the working title Vasco de Gama, the French version of his name. The copying of the full score was completed the day before Meyerbeer died in 1864.\nThe opera was premiered the following year by the Paris Op\u00e9ra in a version made by Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis, who restored the earlier title, L'Africaine. The F\u00e9tis version was published and was used for subsequent performances until 2013, when some productions and recordings began using Meyerbeer's preferred title, Vasco de Gama, for performing versions with revisions based on the manuscript score. In 2018 the music publisher Ricordi issued a critical edition of Meyerbeer's manuscript full score under that title.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_52108", "text": "The first contract between Meyerbeer and Scribe for the writing of the libretto was signed in May 1837. The starting point for the story was \"Le Mancenillier\", a poem by Charles Hubert Millevoye, in which a girl sits under a tree releasing poisonous vapors but is saved by her lover. The plot is also based on an unidentified German tale and a 1770 play by Antoine Lemierre, La Veuve de Malabar, in which a Hindu maiden loves a Portuguese navigator, a theme already treated by the composer Louis Spohr in his opera Jessonda.Corn\u00e9lie Falcon was originally intended for the principal soprano role of S\u00e9lika, but suffered an illness that ended her career. The loss of Falcon and reservations about the libretto caused Meyerbeer to set the project aside in the summer of 1838, when he shifted his focus to the preparation of Le Proph\u00e8te.Meyerbeer resumed work on L'Africaine (the original working title) in 1841 and completed the first draft and a piano score of the first two acts in 1843, after which he again set the project aside. The original story was set in Spain during the reign of Philip III. The protagonist was a naval officer by the name of Fernand (based on Ferdinand de Soto), who buys S\u00e9lika as a slave. While sailing for Mexico in Act 3, his ships are forced to seek shelter on the coast of S\u00e9lika's kingdom in Africa on the Niger River.In 1851\u20131852, Meyerbeer and Scribe continued working on the libretto. Meyerbeer had read a French translation of Camoens's The Lusiads, an epic poem that celebrates the discovery of a sea route to India by Vasco da Gama. Meyerbeer and Scribe changed the setting of Acts 1 and 2 to Lisbon and of Acts 4 and 5 to India. The protagonist became Vasco da Gama, and the working title was changed from L'Africaine to Vasco de Gama.Meyerbeer's work on L'\u00c9toile du nord and Le Pardon de Plo\u00ebrmel caused further delay, but Meyerbeer returned to the libretto in September 1855. He had intended the role of S\u00e9lika for the soprano Sophie Cruvelli, but Cruvelli's abrupt retirement from the public stage in January 1856 interrupted his plans. He began composing music for the Council Scene of Act 1 in Nice (December 1857 \u2013 April 1858). He worked on the opera almost continuously from March 1860 until a few days before his death. Scribe died on 20 February 1861, after which Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer provided German revisions that were translated into French by Joseph Duesberg. Meyerbeer himself revised S\u00e9lika's death scene in November and December 1863. He died on 2 May 1864, one day after the completion of the copying of the full score.Since substantial revisions and excisions almost always occur during rehearsals, Meyerbeer requested the opera should not be given, if he died before it was produced.

For the required ballet, which Meyerbeer had not provided, F\u00e9tis arranged two cut numbers (S\u00e9lika's Lullaby in Act 2 and the sailors' Ronde bachique of Act 3). He also moved a duet for S\u00e9lika and N\u00e9lusko from the Act 3 finale to Act 5.The music historian Robert Letellier has written that F\u00e9tis \"on the whole reached an acceptable compromise between the presumed artistic wishes of Meyerbeer and the practical necessities of performance\", but \"retaining the historical figure of Vasco, as well as the Hindu religion depicted in Act 4, led to almost irreparable absurdity in the action because of the change in locations given for Acts 4 and 5 on the printed libretto in the vocal score (an island on the east coast of Africa) and in the full score (an island in the Indian archipelago).\" Gabriela Cruz has published a detailed analysis of the historical context of the events of the opera and the opera setting itself.Tim Ashley of The Guardian wrote:\n\nF\u00e9tis's alterations consisted largely of cuts and re-orderings, the aim of which, ostensibly, was to bring the opera within manageable length, and to improve narrative clarity, though the plot, by operatic standards, isn't that difficult. ...

The term \"Gangnam Style\" is a neologism that refers to the nouveau riche lifestyles associated with the Gangnam region of Seoul.\nOn July 15, 2012, \"Gangnam Style\" debuted at number one on South Korea's Gaon Chart, receiving generally positive reviews, with praise for its catchy beat and Psy's amusing dancing during live performances and in various locations around the world in its music video. The song and its music video went viral in August 2012 and have influenced popular culture worldwide. In the United States, \"Gangnam Style\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, which at the time, was the highest charting song by a South Korean artist. By the end of 2012, \"Gangnam Style\" had topped the music charts of more than 30 countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Psy's dance in the music video itself became a cultural phenomenon.\nIt subsequently won Best Video at the MTV Europe Music Awards held that year. It became a source of parodies and reaction videos by many different individuals, groups, and organizations. On December 21, 2012, \"Gangnam Style\" became the first YouTube video to reach a billion views. The song's music video was the most viewed video on YouTube from November 24, 2012, when it surpassed the music video for \"Baby\" by Justin Bieber featuring Ludacris, to July 10, 2017, when it was itself surpassed by the music video for \"See You Again\" by Wiz Khalifa featuring Charlie Puth.Its dance was attempted by political leaders such as British Prime Minister David Cameron and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who hailed it as \"a force for world peace\". On May 7, 2013, at a bilateral meeting with South Korea's President Park Geun-hye at the White House, US President Barack Obama cited the success of \"Gangnam Style\" as an example of how people around the world are being \"swept up\" by the Korean Wave of culture.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_52121", "text": "\"Gangnam Style\" is a South Korean neologism that refers to a lifestyle associated with the Gangnam region of Seoul, where people are trendy, hip, and exude a certain supposed class.

As far as known, Bach's earliest cantatas date from 1707, the year he moved to M\u00fchlhausen, although he may have begun composing them at his previous post in Arnstadt. Most of Bach's church cantatas date from his first years as Thomaskantor and director of church music in Leipzig, a position which he took up in 1723.\nWorking for Leipzig's Thomaskirche and Nikolaikirche, it was part of Bach's job to perform a church cantata every Sunday and holiday, conducting soloists, the Thomanerchor and orchestra as part of the church service. In his first years in Leipzig, starting after Trinity of 1723, Bach regularly composed a new cantata every week, although some of these cantatas were adapted (at least in part) from work he had composed before his Leipzig era. Works from three annual cycles of cantatas for the liturgical calendar have survived. These relate to the readings prescribed by the Lutheran liturgy for the specific occasion. The last known cantata was composed in 1745.\nIn addition to the church cantatas composed for occasions of the liturgical year, Bach wrote sacred cantatas for functions like weddings or Ratswahl (the inauguration of a new town council). His secular cantatas, around 50 known works, less than half of which surviving with both text and music, were written for academic functions of the University of Leipzig, or anniversaries and entertainment among the nobility and in society, some of them Gl\u00fcckwunschkantaten (congratulatory cantatas) and Huldigungskantaten (homage cantatas).\nBach's cantatas usually require four soloists and a four-part choir, but he also wrote solo cantatas (i.e. for one soloist singer) and dialogue cantatas for two singers. The words of Bach's cantatas, almost always entirely in German, consist mostly of 18th-century poetry, Lutheran hymns and dicta. Hymns were mostly set to their Lutheran chorale tune.

The composition was completed in 1749, the year before the composer's death, and was to a large extent based on earlier work, such as a Sanctus Bach had composed in 1724. Sections that were specifically composed to complete the Mass in the late 1740s include the \"Et incarnatus est\" part of the Credo.\nAs usual for its time, the composition is formatted as a Neapolitan mass, consisting of a succession of choral movements with a broad orchestral accompaniment, and sections in which a more limited group of instrumentalists accompanies one or more vocal soloists. Among the more unusual characteristics of the composition is its scale: a total performance time of around two hours, and a scoring consisting of two groups of SATB singers and an orchestra featuring an extended winds section, strings and continuo. Its key, B minor, is rather exceptional for a composition featuring natural trumpets in D, although far more of the work is in this key than B minor.Even more exceptional, for a Lutheran composer such as Bach, is that the composition is a Missa tota. In Bach's day, Masses composed for Lutheran services usually consisted only of a Kyrie and Gloria. Bach had composed five such Kyrie\u2013Gloria Masses before he completed his Mass in B minor: the Kyrie\u2013Gloria Masses, BWV 233\u2013236, in the late 1730s, and the Mass for the Dresden court, which would become Part I of his only Missa tota, in 1733. The Mass was likely never performed in its entirety during Bach's lifetime. Its earliest documented complete performance took place in 1859.

Upon its completion, Bach visited Augustus III in Dresden and presented him with a copy of the Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass BWV 232 I (early version), together with a petition to be given a court title, dated July 27, 1733; in the accompanying inscription on the wrapper of the Mass he complains that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in Leipzig.

Other explanations are less event-specific, involving Bach's interest in 'encyclopedic' projects (like The Art of Fugue) that display a wide range of styles, and Bach's desire to preserve some of his best vocal music in a format with wider potential future use than the church cantatas they originated in (see \"Movements and their sources\" below).", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_52170", "text": "The chronology of the Mass in B minor has attracted extensive scholarly attention.

The canon was originally scored for three violins and basso continuo and paired with a gigue, known as Canon and Gigue for 3 violins and basso continuo. Both movements are in the key of D major. Although a true canon at the unison in three parts, it also has elements of a chaconne. Neither the date nor the circumstances of its composition are known (suggested dates range from 1680 to 1706), and the oldest surviving manuscript copy of the piece dates from 1838 to 1842.Like his other works, Pachelbel's Canon went out of style, and remained in obscurity for centuries. A 1968 arrangement and recording of it by the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paillard chamber orchestra gained popularity over the next decade, and in the 1970s the piece began to be recorded by many ensembles; by the early 1980s its presence as background music was deemed inescapable.

Hans-Joachim Schulze, writing in 1985, suggested that the piece may have been composed for Johann Christoph Bach's wedding, on 23 October 1694, which Pachelbel attended. Johann Ambrosius Bach, Pachelbel, and other friends and family provided music for the occasion. Johann Christoph Bach, the oldest brother of Johann Sebastian Bach, was a pupil of Pachelbel. Another scholar, Charles E. Brewer, investigated a variety of possible connections between Pachelbel's and Heinrich Biber's published chamber music.

However, that edition contained numerous articulation marks and dynamics not in the original score. Furthermore, Seiffert provided tempi he considered right for the piece, but that were not supported by later research. The canon was first recorded in 1940 by Arthur Fiedler.In 1968, the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paillard chamber orchestra made a recording of the piece that would change its fortunes significantly. This rendition was done in a more Romantic style, at a significantly slower tempo than it had been played at before, and contained obbligato parts, written by Paillard. The Paillard recording was released in June in France by Erato Records as part of an LP record that also included the Trumpet Concerto by Johann Friedrich Fasch and other works by Pachelbel and Fasch, all played by the Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Paillard chamber orchestra. Paillard's interpretation of the canon was also included on a widely distributed album by the mail-order label Musical Heritage Society in 1968.\nIn July 1968, Greek band Aphrodite's Child released the single \"Rain and Tears\", which was a baroque-rock adaptation of Pachelbel's Canon.

The album was the highest-selling classical album of 1976. Its success led to many other record labels issuing their own recordings of the work, many of which also sold well.Its use from 1975 in television ads for Pure New Wool popularised the piece in Britain and Ireland.In 1977, the RCA Red Seal label reissued the original Erato album in the United States and elsewhere. In the U.S. it was the 6th-highest-selling classical album of 1977. (Two other albums containing Pachelbel's Canon charted for the year: the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra album at number 17, and another album featuring the Paillard recording, Go For Baroque!, at number 13.) The Paillard arrangement of the piece was then featured prominently in the soundtrack of the 1980 film Ordinary People. The Erato/RCA album kept climbing the Billboard Classical Albums chart, and in January 1982 it reached the number 1 position, where it remained until May 1982, when it was knocked out of first place by an album featuring Pachelbel's Canon played by the Academy of Ancient Music directed by Christopher Hogwood.

The band was based in France at the time, although it is unknown whether they had heard the Paillard recording, or were inspired by it. \"Rain and Tears\" was a success, reaching number 1 on the pop charts of various European countries. Several months later, in October 1968, Spanish band Pop-Tops released the single \"Oh Lord, Why Lord\", which again was based on Pachelbel's Canon. Again, it is unknown whether they were aware of or had been inspired by the releases from earlier that year. \"Oh Lord, Why Lord\" was covered by American band Parliament on their 1970 album Osmium.\nIn 1970, a classical radio station in San Francisco played the Paillard recording and became inundated by listener requests. The piece gained growing fame, particularly in California. In 1974, London Records, aware of the interest in the piece, reissued a 1961 album of the Corelli Christmas Concerto performed by the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra, which happened to contain the piece, now re-titled to Pachelbel Kanon: the Record That Made it Famous and other Baroque Favorites. The album was the highest-selling classical album of 1976. Its success led to many other record labels issuing their own recordings of the work, many of which also sold well.Its use from 1975 in television ads for Pure New Wool popularised the piece in Britain and Ireland.In 1977, the RCA Red Seal label reissued the original Erato album in the United States and elsewhere. In the U.S. it was the 6th-highest-selling classical album of 1977. (Two other albums containing Pachelbel's Canon charted for the year: the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra album at number 17, and another album featuring the Paillard recording, Go For Baroque!, at number 13.) The Paillard arrangement of the piece was then featured prominently in the soundtrack of the 1980 film Ordinary People. The Erato/RCA album kept climbing the Billboard Classical Albums chart, and in January 1982 it reached the number 1 position, where it remained until May 1982, when it was knocked out of first place by an album featuring Pachelbel's Canon played by the Academy of Ancient Music directed by Christopher Hogwood. The canon was selected for the soundtrack of Carl Sagan's popular 1980 American PBS television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, and the astronomer cited this work as one of his Desert Island Discs on the BBC on 18 July 1981. In 1981 The Music of Cosmos, an album by RCA Records, and in 2000 a CD by the Cosmos Studios label of the soundtrack were published, that feature an arrangement of the canon by Glenn Spreen and James Galway.In 1982, pianist George Winston included his \"Variations on the Kanon by Johann Pachelbel\" on his solo piano album December, which has sold over three million copies.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is based on the 1756 fairy tale of the same name by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (who was only credited in the French dub), while also containing ideas from the 1946 French film also of the same name directed by Jean Cocteau. The film was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise (in their feature directorial debuts) and produced by Don Hahn, from a screenplay by Linda Woolverton.\nBeauty and the Beast focuses on the relationship between the Beast, a prince who is magically transformed into a monster and his servants into household objects as punishment for his arrogance and cruelty, and Belle, a young woman whom he imprisons in his castle in exchange for her father's freedom. To break the curse, the Beast must learn to love Belle and earn her love in return before the last petal from an enchanted rose falls, or else he will remain a monster forever. The film stars Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson as the voices of Belle and the Beast, respectively, as well as the ensemble voices of Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, Jesse Corti, Rex Everhart, and Angela Lansbury.Walt Disney first attempted to adapt Beauty and the Beast into an animated film during the 1930s and 1950s, but was unsuccessful. Following the success of The Little Mermaid (1989), Walt Disney Pictures decided to adapt the fairy tale, which Richard Purdum originally conceived as a non-musical period drama. After seeing a test reel, Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg scrapped Purdum's idea and ordered that the film be a musical similar to The Little Mermaid instead. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman, both of whom previously worked on The Little Mermaid, returned to write this film's songs. Ashman, who additionally served as the film's executive producer, died of AIDS-related complications six months before the film's release, and the film is thus dedicated to his memory.\nBeauty and the Beast premiered as an unfinished film at the New York Film Festival on September 29, 1991, followed by its theatrical release as a completed film at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 13. The film grossed $331 million at the box office worldwide on a $25 million budget and received widespread acclaim for its romantic narrative, animation (particularly the ballroom scene), characters, and musical numbers. Beauty and the Beast won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, the first animated film to ever win that category. It also became the first animated film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 64th Academy Awards (ultimately losing to The Silence of the Lambs), where it won the Academy Award for Best Original Score and Best Original Song for its title song and received additional nominations for Best Original Song and Best Sound. In April 1994, Beauty and the Beast became Disney's first animated film to be adapted into a Broadway musical, which ran until 2007.\nAn IMAX version of the film was released in 2002 and included the new song \"Human Again\", originally an eight-minute storyboarded musical sequence ultimately replaced with \"Something There\", but later revised in the 1994 musical as a five-minute piece. That same year, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". After the success of the 3D re-release of The Lion King, the film was reissued in 3D in 2012. In 2014, Time magazine ranked Beauty and the Beast as the greatest film of the Disney Renaissance and one of the greatest animated films of all time.\nOther derived works and material inspired by the film, include a 2017 live-action remake of the film directed by Bill Condon, which was released on March 17, 2017, and a 2022 musical presentation of the film on ABC as part of The Wonderful World of Disney.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_52193", "text": "An enchantress disguised as a beggar woman visits the castle of a cruel and selfish prince, offering him an enchanted rose in exchange for shelter from a storm.

She frequently avoids Gaston, a narcissistic hunter who wants to marry her because of her beauty. En route to a fair to showcase his latest invention, an automatic wood chopper, Maurice gets lost in the forest and seeks refuge in the Beast's castle.

It was written for the 1910 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Michel Fokine, who collaborated with Alexandre Benois and others on a scenario based on the Russian fairy tales of the Firebird and the blessing and curse it possesses for its owner. It was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra de Paris on 25 June 1910 and was an immediate success, catapulting Stravinsky to international fame and leading to future Diaghilev\u2013Stravinsky collaborations including Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913).  \nThe Firebird's mortal and supernatural elements are distinguished with a system of leitmotifs placed in the harmony dubbed \"leit-harmony\". Stravinsky intentionally used many specialist techniques in the orchestra, including ponticello, col legno, flautando, glissando, and flutter-tonguing. Set in the evil immortal Koschei's castle, the ballet follows Prince Ivan, who battles Koschei with the help of the magical Firebird.\nStravinsky later created three concert suites based on the work: in 1911, ending with the \"Infernal Dance\"; in 1919, which remains the most popular today; and in 1945, featuring significant reorchestration and structural changes. Other choreographers have staged the work with Fokine's original choreography or created entirely new productions using the music, some with new settings or themes. Many recordings of the suites have been made; the first was released in 1928, using the 1911 suite.

However, he had heard the whole cycle performed by Vogl (which received a much more enthusiastic reception), though he did not live to see the final publication, nor the opinion of the Wiener Theaterzeitung:\nM\u00fcller is naive, sentimental, and sets against outward nature a parallel of some passionate soul-state which takes its colour and significance from the former. Schubert's music is as naive as the poet's expressions; the emotions contained in the poems are as deeply reflected in his own feelings, and these are so brought out in sound that no-one can sing or hear them without being touched to the heart.\n\nElena Gerhardt said of the Winterreise, \"You have to be haunted by this cycle to be able to sing it.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The origin of this was the novel Le pasteur d\u2019hommes, by \u00c9mile Souvestre, which was published in 1838. This was adapted into the French play Le pasteur, ou L'\u00e9vangile et le foyer by Souvestre together with Eug\u00e8ne Bourgeois. (Its premiere was on 10 February 1849 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte Saint-Martin in Paris.) That play was in turn translated into Italian by Gaetano Vestri as Stifellius; this formed the basis of Piave's libretto.Verdi's experience in Naples for Luisa Miller had not been a good one and he returned home to Busseto to consider the subject for his next opera. The idea for Stiffelio came from his librettist and, entering into a contract with his publisher, Ricordi, he agreed to proceed, leaving the decision as to the location of the premiere to Ricordi. This became the Teatro Grande (now the Teatro Comunale Giuseppe Verdi) in  Trieste and, in spite of difficulties with the censors which resulted in cuts and changes, the opera  \u2013 Verdi's 16th \u2013 was first performed on 16 November 1850.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_52218", "text": "Before Luisa Miller was staged in Naples, Verdi had offered the San Carlo company another work for 1850, with the new opera to be based on Victor Hugo's Le roi s'amuse from a libretto to be written by Salvadore Cammarano. But his experience with Luisa was such that he decided not to pursue this, and approached his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, with the proposal that he should work with the librettist on the possibility of an opera, Re Lear, which would be based on Shakespeare's King Lear and which had long been on Verdi's mind. However, by June 1850 it became clear that the subject was beyond Cammarano's ability to fashion into a libretto, and so it was abandoned.  However, the commitment to Ricordi remained.Verdi had returned to Busseto with many ideas in mind, among them a new opera for Venice, which included a request for a draft scenario from Piave based on Victor Hugo's Le roi s'amuse. plus several others of interest to him. However, it was the librettist who came back with the suggestion of Stifellius, and between March and May 1850 discussions with Piave proceeded until a sketch of Stiffelio was received. Verdi responded enthusiastically, proclaiming it \"good and exciting\" and asking: \"Is this Stiffelio a historical person?  In all the history I've read, I don't remember coming across the name.\"  At the same time, it appears that Verdi continued to be fascinated by Le Roi s'amuse, a play which Budden notes as having been banned at its first performance: \"it was, politically speaking, dynamite\" but he  adds that the Venetian censors had allowed Ernani.Reactions to the choice of subject and how it worked as a libretto and opera have been fairly uniform.  Musicologist Roger Parker in Grove describes it as:\n\nA bold choice, a far cry from the melodramatic plots of Byron and Hugo: modern, 'realistic', subjects were unusual in Italian opera, and the religious subject matter seemed bound to cause problems with the censor.

Commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, Copland composed the ballet for Graham; the original choreography was by Graham, with costumes by Edythe Gilfond and sets by Isamu Noguchi. The ballet was well-received at the 1944 premiere, earning Copland the Pulitzer Prize for Music during its 1945 United States tour. The orchestral suite composed in 1945 was played that year by many symphony orchestras; the suite is among Copland's best-known works, and the ballet remains essential in the Martha Graham Dance Company repertoire.\nGraham was known for creating the \"Graham technique\" of dance; in the 1930s, she began commissioning scores from various composers, often related to American history and culture. Around the same time, Copland incorporated relatable and accessible musical characteristics of the Americana style to increase his music's appeal to the general public; he first implemented this in earlier ballets like Billy the Kid and Rodeo. The initial scenario for Appalachian Spring devised by Graham was revised many times by both her and Copland; the title characters' names were changed numerous times and other characters from the early revisions were cut in the final production. Originally orchestrated for a thirteen-piece chamber orchestra, the score was arranged into various suites by Copland for different purposes; the original ballet featured eight episodes, three of which were cut in the well-known orchestral suite.\nThe ballet takes place in a small settlement in 19th-century Pennsylvania. There are four main characters: the Bride, the Husbandman, the Pioneer Woman, and the Revivalist; the last is accompanied by four Followers. Appalachian Spring follows the Bride and the Husbandman as they get married and celebrate with the community. Themes of war are present throughout the story; it is suggested that the Husbandman leaves for war, causing worry and anxiety among the community.

The central conflict begins in the \"Fear in the Night\" episode, where the Revivalist delivers a haunting sermon. Howard Pollack argued that this scene represented the spirit of John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, something that could cause the Husbandman to be drafted in the Civil War. Furthermore, the subsequent \"Day of Wrath\" episode can be seen as the Husbandman leaving for war, depicted with waves of goodbye. \"Moment of Crisis\" is an expression of anxiety and concern for the Husbandman, and \"The Lord's Day\" is a prayer for peace and safety. When the Husbandman rejoins the Bride at the end, Pollack suggests this is actually in her imagination, further supported by her final gesture of reaching out to the horizon. Mark Franko says that the Civil War themes are possibly a reference to the civil rights movement and ongoing racial inequality in the United States.The opening of the music uses delicately placed dissonances to create a dreamy landscape. In the scripts Copland worked from, this scene was to feature the Pioneer Woman sitting \"terrifyingly still\" and looking over her land. Elizabeth Crist speculates that the entire ballet is the Pioneer Woman's memory; Crist suggests that the dissonances in the music depict the Pioneer Woman reflecting on the hardships she faced, and that the following episodes are entirely her own experiences. Crist continues that when the opening themes are recalled at the end of the ballet, the Bride disconnects from the Pioneer Woman's memory, becoming her own individual memory; the Bride sits where the Pioneer Woman sat at the beginning, the context having shifted to a new time.

It was premiered on 30 September 1863 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique in Paris, and was given 18 performances in its initial run. Set in ancient times on the island of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the opera tells the story of how two men's vow of eternal friendship is threatened by their love for the same woman, whose own dilemma is the conflict between secular love and her sacred oath as a priestess. The friendship duet \"Au fond du temple saint\", generally known as \"The Pearl Fishers Duet\", is one of the best-known in Western opera.\nAt the time of the premiere, Bizet (born on 25 October 1838) was not yet 25 years old: he had yet to establish himself in the Parisian musical world. The commission to write Les p\u00eacheurs arose from his standing as a former winner of the prestigious Prix de Rome. Despite a good reception by the public, press reactions to the work were generally hostile and dismissive, although other composers, notably Hector Berlioz, found considerable merit in the music. The opera was not revived in Bizet's lifetime, but from 1886 onwards it was performed with some regularity in Europe and North America, and from the mid-20th century has entered the repertory of opera houses worldwide. Because the autograph score was lost, post-1886 productions were based on amended versions of the score that contained significant departures from the original. Since the 1970s, efforts have been made to reconstruct the score in accordance with Bizet's intentions.\nModern critical opinion has been kinder than that of Bizet's day. Commentators describe the quality of the music as uneven and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as a work of promise in which Bizet's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen.

In 1857 Bizet was awarded the prestigious Prix de Rome, and as a result spent most of the following three years in Italy, where he wrote Don Procopio, a short opera buffa in the style of Donizetti. By this time Bizet had written several non-stage works, including his Symphony in C, but the poor reception accorded to his 1858 Te Deum, a religious work he composed in Rome, helped convince him that his future lay primarily with the musical theatre. He planned and possibly began several operatic works before his return to Paris in 1860, but none of these projects came to fruition.In Paris, Bizet discovered the difficulties faced by young and relatively unknown composers trying to get their operas performed.

The single was released on May 29, 1995.\n\"Scream\" is an aggressive, retaliatory song directed at the tabloid media and their coverage of the child sexual abuse accusations made against Michael Jackson in 1993. It was written, composed and produced by Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, Michael Jackson, and Janet Jackson; Michael played many of the instruments. It incorporates elements of pop, R&B, electrorock, dance-pop, and funk. Recording for \"Scream\" took place at the Hit Factory in New York City in October 1994 and at Flyte Tyme Studios in Edina, Minnesota in December 1994. The song was leaked to radio stations early, despite Epic Records' attempt to keep it off air until the release date.\nGenerally well received amongst critics, it has been compared favorably to other songs by Michael Jackson. The corresponding music video remains one of his most critically acclaimed; it won three MTV Video Music Awards and the Grammy Award for Best Music Video. At a cost of $7 million, it was listed in the Guinness World Records as the most expensive music video ever made; however, director Mark Romanek has refuted the claim, saying that there were two other music videos from the same era which cost \"millions more\" than the video for \"Scream\".\"Scream\" would become the first single in the 37-year history of Billboard to debut at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked. Elsewhere, it topped the charts in Italy, New Zealand, and Spain while reaching the top five in Australia, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

It remains popular with audiences, though less frequently performed than in the first half of the 20th century. One reason for its survival in the repertoire is the lyrical-dramatic music provided by Giordano for the tenor lead, which gives a talented singer opportunities to demonstrate his skills and flaunt his voice.

The opera is based on T\u00eates Rondes et Cavaliers (Roundheads and Cavaliers), a historical play written by Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Ancelot and Joseph Xavier Saintine and set in the English Civil War, which some sources state was based on Walter Scott's 1816 novel Old Mortality, while others state that there is no connection.When Bellini arrived in Paris in mid-August 1833, he had intended to stay only about three weeks, the main aim being to continue the negotiations with the Paris Op\u00e9ra which had begun on his way to London a few months earlier. These negotiations came to nothing, but by October he had decided to spend the winter in that city, especially as both Il pirata and I Capuleti e i Montecchi were to be given by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien that season. The offer from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre came in January 1834; he accepted because \"the pay was richer than what I had received in Italy up to then, though only by a little; then because of so magnificent a company; and finally so as to remain in Paris at others' expense.\"Taking from April until its premiere the following January, Bellini had time to ensure that the opera was as close to perfection as possible. After the premiere, Bellini reported to his friend Francesco Florimo in Naples that:\n\nThe French had all gone mad; there were such noise and such shouts that they themselves were astonished at being so carried away ... In a word, my dear Florimo, it was an unheard of thing, and since Saturday, Paris has spoken of it in amazement\nIt was to be Bellini's final work; he died in September 1835 at the age of 33.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_52304", "text": "19th century\n\nThe opera became \"the rage of Paris\" and was given 17 performances to end the season on 31 March.\nHerbert Weinstock's chapter on I puritani devotes four pages to details of performances which followed the premiere in Paris, although the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien gave it over 200 times up to 1909.

XXI:2), and considered by many to be one of his masterpieces. The oratorio depicts and celebrates the creation of the world as narrated in the Book of Genesis.\nThe libretto was written by Gottfried van Swieten. The work is structured in three parts and scored for soprano, tenor and bass soloists, chorus and a symphonic orchestra. In parts I and II, depicting the creation, the soloists represent the archangels Raphael (bass), Uriel (tenor) and Gabriel (soprano). In part III, the bass and soprano represent Adam and Eve.\nThe first public performance was held in Vienna at the old Burgtheater on 19 March 1799.

It is likely that Haydn wanted to try to achieve results of comparable weight, using the musical language of the mature classical style. Among the Handel works Haydn heard was Israel in Egypt, which includes various episodes of tone painting, perhaps an inspiration to Haydn's own pervasive use of this device in The Creation.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_52327", "text": "The text of The Creation has a long history. The three sources are Genesis, the Biblical book of Psalms, and John Milton's Paradise Lost. In 1795, when Haydn was leaving England, the impresario Johann Peter Salomon (1745\u20131815) who had arranged his concerts there handed him a new poem entitled The Creation of the World. This original had been offered to Handel, but the old master had not worked on it, as its wordiness meant that it would have been four hours in length when set to music. The libretto was probably passed on to Salomon by Thomas Linley Sr. (1733\u20131795), a Drury Lane oratorio concert director. Linley (sometimes called Lidley or Liddel) himself could have written this original English libretto, but scholarship by Edward Olleson, A. Peter Brown (who prepared a particularly fine \"authentic\" score) and H. C. Robbins Landon, tells us that the original writer remains anonymous.\n\nWhen Haydn returned to Vienna, he turned this libretto over to Baron Gottfried van Swieten, who led a multifaceted career as diplomat, director of the Imperial Library, amateur musician, and patron of musicians including Mozart and Carl Phillip Emanuel Bach. He had already collaborated with Haydn as librettist, editing the text for the oratorio version of The Seven Last Words of Christ, premiered in Vienna in 1786. Swieten recast the English libretto of The Creation in a German translation (Die Sch\u00f6pfung) that Haydn could use to compose. He also made suggestions to Haydn regarding the setting of individual numbers. The work was published bilingually (1800) and is still performed in both languages today.\nFor the quotations from the Bible, Swieten chose to adhere very closely to the English King James Version. According to Nicholas Temperley, \"the German text corresponds to no known German Bible translation. Instead, it is so constructed that the word order, syllabification, and stress patterns are as close as possible to the English. Haydn and Swieten must have realized that English audiences would not easily accept changes in the hallowed text of their Bible; and there were the formidable precedents of Messiah and Israel in Egypt to bear in mind.\"In the final form of the oratorio, the text is structured as recitative passages of the text of Genesis, often set to minimal accompaniment, interspersed with choral and solo passages setting Swieten's original poetry to music.

It is likely that Haydn wanted to try to achieve results of comparable weight, using the musical language of the mature classical style. Among the Handel works Haydn heard was Israel in Egypt, which includes various episodes of tone painting, perhaps an inspiration to Haydn's own pervasive use of this device in The Creation.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "86_52327", "text": "The text of The Creation has a long history. The three sources are Genesis, the Biblical book of Psalms, and John Milton's Paradise Lost. In 1795, when Haydn was leaving England, the impresario Johann Peter Salomon (1745\u20131815) who had arranged his concerts there handed him a new poem entitled The Creation of the World. This original had been offered to Handel, but the old master had not worked on it, as its wordiness meant that it would have been four hours in length when set to music. The libretto was probably passed on to Salomon by Thomas Linley Sr. (1733\u20131795), a Drury Lane oratorio concert director. Linley (sometimes called Lidley or Liddel) himself could have written this original English libretto, but scholarship by Edward Olleson, A. Peter Brown (who prepared a particularly fine \"authentic\" score) and H. C. Robbins Landon, tells us that the original writer remains anonymous.\n\nWhen Haydn returned to Vienna, he turned this libretto over to Baron Gottfried van Swieten, who led a multifaceted career as diplomat, director of the Imperial Library, amateur musician, and patron of musicians including Mozart and Carl Phillip Emanuel Bach. He had already collaborated with Haydn as librettist, editing the text for the oratorio version of The Seven Last Words of Christ, premiered in Vienna in 1786. Swieten recast the English libretto of The Creation in a German translation (Die Sch\u00f6pfung) that Haydn could use to compose. He also made suggestions to Haydn regarding the setting of individual numbers. The work was published bilingually (1800) and is still performed in both languages today.\nFor the quotations from the Bible, Swieten chose to adhere very closely to the English King James Version. According to Nicholas Temperley, \"the German text corresponds to no known German Bible translation. Instead, it is so constructed that the word order, syllabification, and stress patterns are as close as possible to the English. Haydn and Swieten must have realized that English audiences would not easily accept changes in the hallowed text of their Bible; and there were the formidable precedents of Messiah and Israel in Egypt to bear in mind.\"In the final form of the oratorio, the text is structured as recitative passages of the text of Genesis, often set to minimal accompaniment, interspersed with choral and solo passages setting Swieten's original poetry to music.

The composer termed the cycle a \"B\u00fchnenfestspiel\" (stage festival play), structured in three days preceded by a Vorabend (\"preliminary evening\"). It is often referred to as the Ring cycle, Wagner's Ring, or simply The Ring.\nWagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874.

However, Wagner intended them to be performed in series. The first performance as a cycle opened the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, beginning with Das Rheingold on 13 August and ending with G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung on 17 August.

The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy, based on the novella of the same title by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e. The opera was first performed by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalised its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon; the \"Habanera\" from act 1 and the \"Toreador Song\" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.\nThe opera is written in the genre of op\u00e9ra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don Jos\u00e9, a na\u00efve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. Jos\u00e9 abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous torero Escamillo, after which Jos\u00e9 kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.\nAfter the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883. Thereafter, it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of op\u00e9ra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.\nThe music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which the emotions and suffering of the  characters are represented. At his death Bizet was still in the midst of revising his score and because of other later changes (notably the introduction of recitatives composed by Ernest Guiraud in place of the original dialogue) there is still no definitive edition of the opera.

The Italian libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piave based on the 1832 play Le roi s'amuse by Victor Hugo. Despite serious initial problems with the Austrian censors who had control over northern Italian theatres at the time, the opera had a triumphant premiere at La Fenice in Venice on 11 March 1851.\nThe work, Verdi's sixteenth in the genre, is widely considered to be the first of the operatic masterpieces of Verdi's middle-to-late career. Its tragic story revolves around the licentious Duke of Mantua, his hunch-backed court jester Rigoletto, and Rigoletto's daughter Gilda. The opera's original title, La maledizione (The Curse), refers to a curse placed on both the Duke and Rigoletto by the Count Monterone, whose daughter the Duke has seduced with Rigoletto's encouragement. The curse comes to fruition when Gilda falls in love with the Duke and sacrifices her life to save him from the assassin hired by her father.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "86_52377", "text": "La Fenice of Venice commissioned Verdi in 1850 to compose a new opera. He was prominent enough by this time to enjoy some freedom in choosing texts to set to music. He initially asked Francesco Maria Piave (with whom he had already created Ernani, I due Foscari, Macbeth, Il corsaro and Stiffelio) to examine the play Kean by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re, but soon came to believe that they needed to find a more energetic subject.That came in the form of Victor Hugo's controversial five-act play Le roi s'amuse (\"The king amuses himself\"). Verdi later explained that \"The subject is grand, immense, and there is a character that is one of the greatest creations that the theatre can boast of, in any country and in all history.\" However, Hugo's depiction of a venal, cynical, womanizing king (Francis I of France) was considered unacceptably scandalous. The play had been banned in France following its premiere nearly twenty years earlier (not to be staged again until 1882); now it was to come before the Austrian Board of Censors (as Austria at that time directly controlled much of Northern Italy.)\nFrom the beginning, both composer and librettist knew this step would not be easy. As Verdi wrote in a letter to Piave: \"Use four legs, run through the town and find me an influential person who can obtain the permission for making Le Roi s'amuse.\" Guglielmo Brenna, secretary of La Fenice, promised the duo that they would not have problems with the censors. He was wrong, and rumours began to spread in early summer that the production would be forbidden. In August, Verdi and Piave retired to Busseto, Verdi's hometown, to prepare a defensive scheme as they continued work on the opera. Despite their best efforts, including frantic correspondence with La Fenice, the Austrian censor De Gorzkowski emphatically denied consent to the production of \"La Maledizione\" (its working title) in a December 1850 letter, calling the opera \"a repugnant [example of] immorality and obscene triviality.\"\nPiave set to work revising the libretto, eventually pulling from it another opera, Il Duca di Vendome, in which the sovereign was a duke and both the hunchback and the curse disappeared. Verdi was completely against this proposed solution, preferring to negotiate directly with the censors over each and every point of the work. Brenna, La Fenice's sympathetic secretary, mediated the dispute by showing the Austrians some letters and articles depicting the bad character, but great value, of the artist. By January 1851 the parties had settled on a compromise: the action of the opera would be moved, and some of the characters would be renamed. In the new version, the Duke would preside over Mantua and belong to the Gonzaga family. (The House of Gonzaga had long been extinct by the mid-19th century, and the Dukedom of Mantua no longer existed.) The scene in which he retired to Gilda's bedroom would be deleted, and his visit to the Taverna (inn) would no longer be intentional, but the result of a trick. The hunchbacked jester (originally called Triboulet) was renamed Rigoletto (from the French word rigoler) from a parody of a comedy by Jules-\u00c9douard Alboize de Pujol: Rigoletti, ou Le dernier des fous (Rigoletti, or The last of the fools) of 1835. By 14 January, the opera's definitive title had become Rigoletto.Verdi finally completed the composition on 5 February 1851, a little more than a month before the premiere. Piave had already arranged for the sets to be designed while Verdi was still working on the final stages of act 3. The singers were given some of their music to learn on 7 February. However, Verdi kept at least a third of the score at Busseto.

He was prominent enough by this time to enjoy some freedom in choosing texts to set to music. He initially asked Francesco Maria Piave (with whom he had already created Ernani, I due Foscari, Macbeth, Il corsaro and Stiffelio) to examine the play Kean by Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re, but soon came to believe that they needed to find a more energetic subject.That came in the form of Victor Hugo's controversial five-act play Le roi s'amuse (\"The king amuses himself\"). Verdi later explained that \"The subject is grand, immense, and there is a character that is one of the greatest creations that the theatre can boast of, in any country and in all history.\" However, Hugo's depiction of a venal, cynical, womanizing king (Francis I of France) was considered unacceptably scandalous. The play had been banned in France following its premiere nearly twenty years earlier (not to be staged again until 1882); now it was to come before the Austrian Board of Censors (as Austria at that time directly controlled much of Northern Italy.)\nFrom the beginning, both composer and librettist knew this step would not be easy. As Verdi wrote in a letter to Piave: \"Use four legs, run through the town and find me an influential person who can obtain the permission for making Le Roi s'amuse.\" Guglielmo Brenna, secretary of La Fenice, promised the duo that they would not have problems with the censors. He was wrong, and rumours began to spread in early summer that the production would be forbidden. In August, Verdi and Piave retired to Busseto, Verdi's hometown, to prepare a defensive scheme as they continued work on the opera. Despite their best efforts, including frantic correspondence with La Fenice, the Austrian censor De Gorzkowski emphatically denied consent to the production of \"La Maledizione\" (its working title) in a December 1850 letter, calling the opera \"a repugnant [example of] immorality and obscene triviality.\"\nPiave set to work revising the libretto, eventually pulling from it another opera, Il Duca di Vendome, in which the sovereign was a duke and both the hunchback and the curse disappeared. Verdi was completely against this proposed solution, preferring to negotiate directly with the censors over each and every point of the work. Brenna, La Fenice's sympathetic secretary, mediated the dispute by showing the Austrians some letters and articles depicting the bad character, but great value, of the artist. By January 1851 the parties had settled on a compromise: the action of the opera would be moved, and some of the characters would be renamed. In the new version, the Duke would preside over Mantua and belong to the Gonzaga family. (The House of Gonzaga had long been extinct by the mid-19th century, and the Dukedom of Mantua no longer existed.) The scene in which he retired to Gilda's bedroom would be deleted, and his visit to the Taverna (inn) would no longer be intentional, but the result of a trick. The hunchbacked jester (originally called Triboulet) was renamed Rigoletto (from the French word rigoler) from a parody of a comedy by Jules-\u00c9douard Alboize de Pujol: Rigoletti, ou Le dernier des fous (Rigoletti, or The last of the fools) of 1835. By 14 January, the opera's definitive title had become Rigoletto.Verdi finally completed the composition on 5 February 1851, a little more than a month before the premiere. Piave had already arranged for the sets to be designed while Verdi was still working on the final stages of act 3. The singers were given some of their music to learn on 7 February. However, Verdi kept at least a third of the score at Busseto. He brought it with him when he arrived in Venice for the rehearsals on 19 February, and would continue refining the orchestration throughout the rehearsal period. For the premi\u00e8re, La Fenice had cast Felice Varesi as Rigoletto, the tenor Raffaele Mirate as the Duke, and Teresa Brambilla as Gilda (although Verdi would have preferred Teresa De Giuli Borsi).

It was not particularly successful, but was part of Handel's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music.Handel then spent time in Rome, where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples.
