{"id": "184_4", "question": "Who was the doctoral advisor of Adolf Kratzer?", "ctxs": [{"id": "184_65232", "text": "B. Adolf Kratzer (October 16, 1893 \u2013 July 6, 1983) was a German theoretical physicist who made contributions to atomic physics and molecular physics, and was an authority on molecular band spectroscopy. He was born in G\u00fcnzburg and died in M\u00fcnster.\nFrom 1912 to 1914, Kratzer studied physics at the Technische Hochschule M\u00fcnchen (today, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen), and then he spent two years in the army, after which he began studies at the University of Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld.  He was granted his doctor of philosophy in 1920; his thesis was on the band spectra of molecules.  While at Munich, he was Sommerfeld\u2019s assistant; he had been trained by Sommerfeld\u2019s assistant and student Wilhelm Lenz to fill this role.  While at Munich, Kratzer extended the theory of diatomic molecular spectroscopy by including anharmonic forces between the nuclei, which changed the oscillation frequencies.  It was Sommerfeld\u2019s practice to send some of his assistants to be personal assistants for physics to the mathematician David Hilbert, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.  Kratzer was sent to G\u00f6ttingen during the period 1920 to 1921.  Upon his return to Munich, he became a Privatdozent, and it was during this time that he became acquainted with Werner Heisenberg, also a student of Sommerfeld.Based on his work at Munich, it was in 1922 that Kratzer's detailed analysis on the cyanide spectroscopic bands was published.  His analysis resulted in the introduction of half-integral quantum numbers to account for molecular rotation.  During 1922, he was also called as an ordinarius professor of theoretical physics to the University of M\u00fcnster.  Here, Kratzer made contributions to quantum mechanics and became a leading authority in the field of molecular band spectroscopy.At this time, there were three centers of development for quantum mechanics and the interpretation of atomic and molecular structure, based on atomic and molecular spectroscopy, especially the Sommerfeld-Bohr model:  the Theoretical Physics Institute at the University of Munich, under Arnold Sommerfeld, the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, under Max Born, and the Institute of Theoretical Physics, under Niels Bohr.  These three institutes effectively formed a consortium for the exchange of assistants and researchers.  Furthermore, with Sommerfeld educating such capable physicists as Kratzer, and others, when they were called to other facilities, they effectively became extensions of Sommerfeld\u2019s Institute of Theoretical Physics.  This was the case with Kratzer when he went to M\u00fcnster, as was the case of Sommerfeld\u2019s former student Paul Peter Ewald when he went to the Stuttgart Technische Hochschule.Kratzer published a number of physics books, based on his lectures on electrodynamics, mechanics, optics, relativity, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics (wave mechanics).  A book on transcendental functions was written with Walter Franz, also a student of Sommerfeld.\nThe Kratzer potential, a central force in molecular physics, is named in his honor.\nA potential with the same name has also been used in nuclear physics, as it provides an exact solution of the Bohr hamiltonian.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He was born in South Kensington, London, UK. From 1969 to 1971, he was a boarder at Copthorne Preparatory School, Sussex. From 1971 to 1978, he attended the Holland Park School London.In late 1977, he began work at GEC Hirst Research Centre, Wembley, UK, performing research in the area of CCD and microchip design for imaging systems. Whilst working, he graduated in 1982 with a BSc in Physics from Loughborough University. In 1986, he began work as a microchip designer at Austek Microsystems in Adelaide, Australia. In 1987, he joined the University of Adelaide completing his PhD thesis in Electrical & Electronic Engineering in 1995, entitled GaAs MESFET Photodetectors for Imaging Arrays, under Kamran Eshraghian and Bruce R. Davis.He became a fellow of the IEEE in 2005 \"for contributions to analysis of noise and stochastic phenomena in vision systems\".", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "184_65239", "text": "In March 2009 a University of Adelaide team led by Abbott began an attempt to solve the Somerton Man case involving an unidentified man being found dead near Adelaide in 1948. This involves genetic analysis and proposing to exhume the body to test for DNA. His investigations have led to questions concerning the assumptions police had made on the case.  Abbott also tracked down the Barbour waxed cotton of the period and found packaging variations. This may provide clues to the country where it was purchased.Decryption of the \"code\" was being started from scratch. It had been determined the letter frequency was considerably different from letters written down randomly; the frequency was to be further tested to determine if the alcohol level of the writer could alter random distribution. The format of the code also appeared to follow the quatrain format of the Rubaiyat, supporting the theory that the code was a one-time pad encryption algorithm. Copies of the Rubaiyat, as well as the Talmud and Bible, were being compared to the code using computers to get a statistical base for letter frequencies. However, the code's short length meant the investigators would require the exact edition of the book used. With the original copy lost in the 1960s, researchers have been looking for a FitzGerald edition without success.An investigation had shown that the Somerton Man's autopsy reports of 1948 and 1949 are now missing and the Barr Smith Library's collection of Cleland's notes do not contain anything on the case. Maciej Henneberg, professor of anatomy at the University of Adelaide, examined images of the Somerton man's ears and found that his cymba (upper ear hollow) is larger than his cavum (lower ear hollow), a feature possessed by only 1\u20132% of the Caucasian population. In May 2009, Abbott consulted with dental experts who concluded that the Somerton Man had hypodontia (a rare genetic disorder) of both lateral incisors, a feature present in only 2% of the general population. In June 2010, Abbott obtained a photograph of Jessica Thomson's eldest son Robin, which clearly showed that he \u2013 like the unknown man \u2013 had not only a larger cymba than cavum but also hypodontia. The chance that this was a coincidence has been estimated as between one in 10,000,000 and one in 20,000,000.The media have suggested that Robin Thomson, who was 16 months old in 1948 and died in 2009, may have been a child of either Alf Boxall or the Somerton Man and passed off as Prosper Thomson's son. DNA testing would confirm or eliminate this speculation. Abbott believes an exhumation and an autosomal DNA test could link the Somerton man to a shortlist of surnames which, along with existing clues to the man's identity, would be the \"final piece of the puzzle\". However, in October 2011, Attorney General John Rau refused permission to exhume the body, stating: \"There needs to be public interest reasons that go well beyond public curiosity or broad scientific interest.\"\nFeltus said he was still contacted by people in Europe who believed the man was a missing relative but did not believe an exhumation and finding the man's family grouping would provide answers to relatives, as \"during that period so many war criminals changed their names and came to different countries\".In July 2013, Abbott released an artistic impression he commissioned of the Somerton man, believing this might finally lead to an identification. \"All this time we've been publishing the autopsy photo, and it's hard to tell what something looks like from that\", Abbott said.After initially contacting her to seek her DNA, Abbott married Rachel, the daughter of Roma Egan and Robin Thomson, in 2010, and they have three children.In December 2017, Abbott announced three \"excellent\" hairs \"at the right development stage for extracting DNA\" had been found on the plaster cast of the corpse, and had been submitted for analysis to the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide. Processing the results could reportedly take up to a year. In February 2018, the University of Adelaide team obtained a high definition analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from the hair sample from Somerton Man. They found that he and his mother belonged to haplogroup H4a1a1a, which is possessed by only 1% of Europeans.On 26 July 2022, Abbott announced that he and American genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick had used DNA websites such as Ancestry.com to build a family tree of over 4,000 people. In March 2022, they narrowed this to Melbourne man Carl \"Charles\" Webb, an electrical engineer and instrument maker, who had no death record. Abbott said that on 23 July, \"the final pieces of DNA proof were found to fully identify Webb as the Somerton Man.\" South Australian Police and Forensic Science South Australia said they had not verified Abbott's findings, and that further comment would be provided \"when results from the testing are received.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "184_65239", "text": "In March 2009 a University of Adelaide team led by Abbott began an attempt to solve the Somerton Man case involving an unidentified man being found dead near Adelaide in 1948.

In May 2009, Abbott consulted with dental experts who concluded that the Somerton Man had hypodontia (a rare genetic disorder) of both lateral incisors, a feature present in only 2% of the general population. In June 2010, Abbott obtained a photograph of Jessica Thomson's eldest son Robin, which clearly showed that he \u2013 like the unknown man \u2013 had not only a larger cymba than cavum but also hypodontia. The chance that this was a coincidence has been estimated as between one in 10,000,000 and one in 20,000,000.The media have suggested that Robin Thomson, who was 16 months old in 1948 and died in 2009, may have been a child of either Alf Boxall or the Somerton Man and passed off as Prosper Thomson's son. DNA testing would confirm or eliminate this speculation. Abbott believes an exhumation and an autosomal DNA test could link the Somerton man to a shortlist of surnames which, along with existing clues to the man's identity, would be the \"final piece of the puzzle\". However, in October 2011, Attorney General John Rau refused permission to exhume the body, stating: \"There needs to be public interest reasons that go well beyond public curiosity or broad scientific interest.\"\nFeltus said he was still contacted by people in Europe who believed the man was a missing relative but did not believe an exhumation and finding the man's family grouping would provide answers to relatives, as \"during that period so many war criminals changed their names and came to different countries\".In July 2013, Abbott released an artistic impression he commissioned of the Somerton man, believing this might finally lead to an identification. \"All this time we've been publishing the autopsy photo, and it's hard to tell what something looks like from that\", Abbott said.After initially contacting her to seek her DNA, Abbott married Rachel, the daughter of Roma Egan and Robin Thomson, in 2010, and they have three children.In December 2017, Abbott announced three \"excellent\" hairs \"at the right development stage for extracting DNA\" had been found on the plaster cast of the corpse, and had been submitted for analysis to the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide. Processing the results could reportedly take up to a year. In February 2018, the University of Adelaide team obtained a high definition analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from the hair sample from Somerton Man. They found that he and his mother belonged to haplogroup H4a1a1a, which is possessed by only 1% of Europeans.On 26 July 2022, Abbott announced that he and American genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick had used DNA websites such as Ancestry.com to build a family tree of over 4,000 people. In March 2022, they narrowed this to Melbourne man Carl \"Charles\" Webb, an electrical engineer and instrument maker, who had no death record. Abbott said that on 23 July, \"the final pieces of DNA proof were found to fully identify Webb as the Somerton Man.\" South Australian Police and Forensic Science South Australia said they had not verified Abbott's findings, and that further comment would be provided \"when results from the testing are received.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In his mature work, he sought to develop a systematic foundational science based on the so-called phenomenological reduction. Arguing that transcendental consciousness sets the limits of all possible knowledge, Husserl redefined phenomenology as a transcendental-idealist philosophy. Husserl's thought profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy, and he remains a notable figure in contemporary philosophy and beyond.\nHusserl studied mathematics, taught by Karl Weierstrass and Leo K\u00f6nigsberger, and philosophy taught by Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. He taught philosophy as a Privatdozent at Halle from 1887, then as professor, first at G\u00f6ttingen from 1901, then at Freiburg from 1916 until he retired in 1928, after which he remained highly productive.

Phenomenological understanding strives to be rigorously \"presuppositionless\" by means of what Husserl calls \"phenomenological reduction\". This reduction is not conditioned but rather transcendental: in Husserl's terms, pure consciousness of absolute Being. In Husserl's work, consciousness of any given thing calls for discerning its meaning as an \"intentional object\".

Notwithstanding, he did attract philosophers to phenomenology.\nMartin Heidegger is the best known of Husserl's students, the one whom Husserl chose as his successor at Freiburg. Heidegger's magnum opus Being and Time was dedicated to Husserl. They shared their thoughts and worked alongside each other for over a decade at the University of Freiburg, Heidegger being Husserl's assistant during 1920\u20131923. Heidegger's early work followed his teacher, but with time he began to develop new insights distinctively variant. Husserl became increasingly critical of Heidegger's work, especially in 1929, and included pointed criticism of Heidegger in lectures he gave during 1931. Heidegger, while acknowledging his debt to Husserl, followed a political position offensive and harmful to Husserl after the Nazis came to power in 1933, Husserl being of Jewish origin and Heidegger infamously being then a Nazi proponent. Academic discussion of Husserl and Heidegger is extensive.\nAt G\u00f6ttingen in 1913 Adolf Reinach (1884\u20131917) \"was now Husserl's right hand. He was above all the mediator between Husserl and the students, for he understood extremely well how to deal with other persons, whereas Husserl was pretty much helpless in this respect.\" He was an original editor of Husserl's new journal, Jahrbuch; one of his works (giving a phenomenological analysis of the law of obligations) appeared in its first issue. Reinach was widely admired and a remarkable teacher. Husserl, in his 1917 obituary, wrote, \"He wanted to draw only from the deepest sources, he wanted to produce only work of enduring value. And through his wise restraint he succeeded in this.\"Edith Stein was Husserl's student at G\u00f6ttingen and Freiburg while she wrote her doctoral thesis The Empathy Problem as it Developed Historically and Considered Phenomenologically (1916). She then became his assistant at Freiburg in 1916\u201318. She later adapted her phenomenology to the modern school of modern Thomism.Ludwig Landgrebe became assistant to Husserl in 1923. From 1939 he collaborated with Eugen Fink at the Husserl-Archives in Leuven. In 1954 he became leader of the Husserl-Archives. Landgrebe is known as one of Husserl's closest associates, but also for his independent views relating to history, religion and politics as seen from the viewpoints of existentialist philosophy and metaphysics.\nEugen Fink was a close associate of Husserl during the 1920s and 1930s. He wrote the Sixth Cartesian Meditation which Husserl said was the truest expression and continuation of his own work. Fink delivered the eulogy for Husserl in 1938.Roman Ingarden, an early student of Husserl at Freiburg, corresponded with Husserl into the mid-1930s. Ingarden did not accept, however, the later transcendental idealism of Husserl which he thought would lead to relativism. Ingarden has written his work in German and Polish. In his Sp\u00f3r o istnienie \u015bwiata (Ger.: \"Der Streit um die Existenz der Welt\", Eng.: \"Dispute about existence of the world\") he created his own realistic position, which also helped to spread phenomenology in Poland.\nMax Scheler met Husserl in Halle in 1901 and found in his phenomenology a methodological breakthrough for his own philosophy. Scheler, who was at G\u00f6ttingen when Husserl taught there, was one of the original few editors of the journal Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung (1913). Scheler's work Formalism in Ethics and Nonformal Ethics of Value appeared in the new journal (1913 and 1916) and drew acclaim. The personal relationship between the two men, however, became strained, due to Scheler's legal troubles, and Scheler returned to Munich. Although Scheler later criticised Husserl's idealistic logical approach and proposed instead a \"phenomenology of love\", he states that he remained \"deeply indebted\" to Husserl throughout his work.\nNicolai Hartmann was once thought to be at the center of phenomenology, but perhaps no longer. In 1921 the prestige of Hartmann the Neo-Kantian, who was Professor of Philosophy at Marburg, was added to the Movement; he \"publicly declared his solidarity with the actual work of die Ph\u00e4nomenologie.\" Yet Hartmann's connections were with Max Scheler and the Munich circle; Husserl himself evidently did not consider him as a phenomenologist. His philosophy, however, is said to include an innovative use of the method.Emmanuel Levinas in 1929 gave a presentation at one of Husserl's last seminars in Freiburg. Also that year he wrote on Husserl's Ideen (1913) a long review published by a French journal. With Gabrielle Peiffer, Levinas translated into French Husserl's M\u00e9ditations cart\u00e9siennes (1931). He was at first impressed with Heidegger and began a book on him, but broke off the project when Heidegger became involved with the Nazis. After the war he wrote on Jewish spirituality; most of his family had been murdered by the Nazis in Lithuania. Levinas then began to write works that would become widely known and admired.Alfred Schutz's Phenomenology of the Social World seeks to rigorously ground Max Weber's interpretive sociology in Husserl's phenomenology. Husserl was impressed by this work and asked Schutz to be his assistant.Jean-Paul Sartre was also largely influenced by Husserl, although he later came to disagree with key points in his analyses. Sartre rejected Husserl's transcendental interpretations begun in his Ideen (1913) and instead followed Heidegger's ontology.Maurice Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception is influenced by Edmund Husserl's work on perception, intersubjectivity, intentionality, space, and temporality, including Husserl's theory of retention and protention. Merleau-Ponty's description of 'motor intentionality' and sexuality, for example, retain the important structure of the noetic/noematic correlation of Ideen I, yet further concretize what it means for Husserl when consciousness particularizes itself into modes of intuition. Merleau-Ponty's most clearly Husserlian work is, perhaps, \"the Philosopher and His Shadow.\" Depending on the interpretation of Husserl's accounts of eidetic intuition, given in Husserl's Phenomenological Psychology and Experience and Judgment, it may be that Merleau-Ponty did not accept the \"eidetic reduction\" nor the \"pure essence\" said to result. Merleau-Ponty was the first student to study at the Husserl-archives in Leuven.\nGabriel Marcel explicitly rejected existentialism, due to Sartre, but not phenomenology, which has enjoyed a wide following among French Catholics. He appreciated Husserl, Scheler, and (but with apprehension) Heidegger. His expressions like \"ontology of sensability\" when referring to the body, indicate influence by phenomenological thought.Kurt G\u00f6del is known to have read Cartesian Meditations. He expressed very strong appreciation for Husserl's work, especially with regard to \"bracketing\" or \"epoch\u00e9\".\nHermann Weyl's interest in intuitionistic logic and impredicativity appears to have resulted from his reading of Husserl. He was introduced to Husserl's work through his wife, Helene Joseph, herself a student of Husserl at G\u00f6ttingen.\nColin Wilson has used Husserl's ideas extensively in developing his \"New Existentialism,\" particularly in regards to his \"intentionality of consciousness,\" which he mentions in a number of his books.Rudolf Carnap was also influenced by Husserl, not only concerning Husserl's notion of essential insight that Carnap used in his Der Raum, but also his notion of \"formation rules\" and \"transformation rules\" is founded on Husserl's philosophy of logic.\nKarol Wojtyla, who would later become Pope John Paul II, was influenced by Husserl. Phenomenology appears in his major work, The Acting Person (1969). Originally published in Polish, it was translated by Andrzej Potocki and edited by Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka in the Analecta Husserliana. The Acting Person combines phenomenological work with Thomistic ethics.\nPaul Ric\u0153ur has translated many works of Husserl into French and has also written many of his own studies of the philosopher. Among other works, Ric\u0153ur employed phenomenology in his Freud and Philosophy (1965).Jacques Derrida wrote several critical studies of Husserl early in his academic career. These included his dissertation, The Problem of Genesis in Husserl's Philosophy, and also his introduction to The Origin of Geometry. Derrida continued to make reference to Husserl in works such as Of Grammatology.\nStanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz were inspired by Husserl's formal analysis of language. Accordingly, they employed phenomenology in the development of categorial grammar.Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset visited Husserl at Freiburg in 1934. He credited phenomenology for having 'liberated him' from a narrow neo-Kantian thought. While perhaps not a phenomenologist himself, he introduced the philosophy to Iberia and Latin America.Wilfrid Sellars, an influential figure in the so-called \"Pittsburgh School\" (Robert Brandom, John McDowell) had been a student of Marvin Farber, a pupil of Husserl, and was influenced by phenomenology through him:\n\nMarvin Farber led me through my first careful reading of the Critique of Pure Reason and introduced me to Husserl. His combination of utter respect for the structure of Husserl's thought with the equally firm conviction that this structure could be given a naturalistic interpretation was undoubtedly a key influence on my own subsequent philosophical strategy.\nIn his 1942 essay The Myth of Sisyphus, absurdist philosopher Albert Camus acknowledges Husserl as a previous philosopher who described and attempted to deal with the feeling of the absurd, but claims he committed \"philosophical suicide\" by elevating reason and ultimately arriving at ubiquitous Platonic forms and an abstract god.\nHans Blumenberg received his habilitation in 1950, with a dissertation on ontological distance, an inquiry into the crisis of Husserl's phenomenology.\nRoger Scruton, despite some disagreements with Husserl, drew upon his work in Sexual Desire (1986).:\u200a3\u20134\u200aThe influence of the Husserlian phenomenological tradition in the 21st century extends beyond the confines of the European and North American legacies.

The pamphlet argued that comet was a real phenomenon and not an optical illusion or atmospheric effect. The author was the Jesuit Orazio Grassi. There were a number of arguments in this which Galileo wanted to counter, but he decided that it would be wise not to publish his arguments under his own name, so he collaborated with Guiducci to produce a text, Discourse on Comets, which Guiducci read out at the Accademia Fiorentina in May 1619 and published the next month.The Discourse on comets, although formally a response to Grassi, was fundamentally a rebuttal of the arguments made by Tycho Brahe. It argued that the absence of parallax observable with comets meant that they were not real objects, but atmospheric effects, like rainbows.  (In fact the apparent lack of parallax is due immense distance of comets from the earth). Galileo (through Guiducci) also argued against Tycho's case for comets having uniform, circular paths.

The first (1731) was named Elisabeth after his mother, the oldest son (1733) was named Godfried after her father, and the youngest child (1746) was named Maria Theresia after the Empress, who was also her godmother. Their son Godfried (later in Austria spelled Gottfried) became famous in his own right as Austrian ambassador and patron of the great classical composers.November 1742 saw the death of Joannes Baptista Bassand, personal physician of the Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresia and a former student of Boerhaave. As a Catholic and a foremost student of Boerhaave, Van Swieten received an offer to fill this position as well as that of director of the court library in early 1743. He respectfully declined, writing to a friend that he much preferred to remain \"a small republican than to carry a pompous title that simply conceals a slavish existence\". After one-and-a-half years of enticements, Van Swieten finally accepted the offer in October 1744. Before his letter of acceptance had arrived, Van Swieten found himself called to the court in Brussels, where Maria Theresa's younger sister, Maria Anna, Governor of the Austrian Netherlands, was ailing following the birth of a stillborn child. While Maria Anna did not recover and died in early December, Van Swieten's swift response and confident actions had nevertheless endeared him further to Maria Theresa. By May 1745, the Van Swieten family had sold all their belongings in the Netherlands and traveled to Vienna.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He studies the socio-cultural aspects of medieval history in Western Europe and has made important contributions in his use of anthropological and art historical methods to interpret history. His most significant work has dealt with the relationships among elites and laymen in medieval life, particularly in the realm of religious culture, where he has focused on ideas and topics such as superstition, the occult and heresy in order to flesh out the differing world-views of the lay peasantry and the clerical elites who attempted to define religious practice. He has contributed numerous books, articles and encyclopedia entries on these and related topics. He has also written widely on the cult of saints, the idea of adolescence, visions and dreams, and preaching.\nAmong Schmitt's best known works translated in English are The Holy Greyhound (1983), about the strange cult of a holy dog in medieval France, and Ghosts in the Middle Ages (1998) about notions of death, the afterlife and paranormal visions in medieval culture. Both works are considered important examples of \"historical anthropology,\" or the use of methods and approaches borrowed from anthropology and other social sciences to investigate the past. Schmitt has argued that this has helped correct for the tendency among medievalists in the past to focus on elites, political institutions and narrative history to the exclusion of the lower classes and their less well-documented experiences of life.\nUntil 2014 Schmitt was Director of Studies at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales and directed the society of professional historians, Groupe d'Anthropologie Historique de l'Occident M\u00e9di\u00e9val.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Cornwall was a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and from 1963 to 1965 at the Institute for Advanced Study. At the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) he became in 1965 an assistant professor and in 1974 a full professor.\n\nCornwall invented the Pinch Technique for calculating gauge-invariant off-shell Green's functions for QCD and other Yang-Mills theories, showing how a dynamical gauge-invariant mass arises for QCD gluons and how such gluons, with the long-range pure-gauge fields that necessarily accompany gauge-invariant mass generation, lead to confinement and other non-perturbative phenomena. He has also written some 40 papers on space plasmas such as the aurora, the ionosphere, and the magnetospheric ring current, leading among other things to a detailed understanding of the dynamical role of electromagnetic cyclotron instabilities in the magnetosphere.\nCornwall published with Richard E. Norton in 1973 one of the earliest papers on dynamic symmetry breaking in Yang-Mills theories. In the later part of his career he has worked on non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics.He was an advisor to the Space Sciences Laboratory of the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo (1962\u20131993) and to the Institute for Defense Analyses in Alexandria (2002\u20132015), as well as to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

At the invitation of Frederick Alexander Lindemann, he worked for Imperial Chemical Industries at the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford, where he studied hyperfine structure. During the Second World War, he worked on isotope separation for Tube Alloys and the Manhattan Project. He was the first physicist to become a fellow at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1950, and published textbooks on atomic spectra in German in 1934 and English in 1962.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "184_65471", "text": "Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn was born in Breslau, Germany, on 10 March 1904, the second son of Wilhelm Felix Kuhn, a rechtsanwalt (lawyer) and notary public, and his wife Marthe n\u00e9e Hoppe. His older brother Helmut Kuhn became a philosophy professor. His paternal grandmother was Charlotte Kuhn n\u00e9e Henschel, the half-sister of George Henschel, a musician who emigrated to Britain.Much of Kuhn's early life was spent in L\u00fcben, where he went to school and attended the Real-Gymnasium. He passed his abitur in March 1922 and entered the University of Greifswald intending to study chemistry. In 1924, he decided to switch to physics and moved to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where there was a thriving school of physics that had included Nobel Prize winners Max Born, James Franck, Gustav Hertz and Peter Debye. Kuhn's teachers included David Hilbert, Richard Courant and Carl Runge and he joined Franck's research group which included Hertha Sponer, Arthur R. von Hippel, Otto Oldenberg and Fritz Houtermans. Franck had recently published a theory of electron motion and diatomic molecules, and at his suggestion Kuhn studied the absorption spectra of chlorine (Cl2) and bromine (Br2). His results confirmed the Franck\u2013Condon principle and formed his 1926 doctoral thesis on Absorptionspektrum und Dissoziationswarmen von Halogenmolek\u00fcl (Absorption spectra and dissociation warming of halogen molecules).Kuhn became a demonstrator at G\u00f6ttingen in 1926, and then a lecturer in 1931. He continued his studies of the Franck\u2013Condon principle and the Stark effect for his habilitation in February 1931, which allowed him to become a privatdozent. He married Marie Bertha Nohl, the daughter of the G\u00f6ttingen philosophy professor Herman Nohl and cousin of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Paul Wittgenstein. Although his father was Jewish, he had been baptised when he married, and Kuhn was brought up as a Christian. This meant little when the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933. Kuhn was classified as non-Aryan because he had two Jewish grandparents. He was dismissed from his university positions, and his habilitation was revoked. As a decorated veteran of the First World War, Franck was not dismissed from his post, but elected to resign in protest rather than dismiss colleagues for their race or political beliefs.Before leaving Germany, Franck attempted to find positions for his former students and colleagues. He introduced Kuhn to Professor Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell, Scientific Adviser to Winston Churchill, who invited Kuhn to come to the Clarendon laboratory at Oxford University, where he could work on atomic spectra with Derek Jackson. Kuhn and his wife left Germany for Britain in August 1933. They were welcomed by his relatives, the Henschels, and Kuhn received a grant of \u00a3400 per annum from ICI, initially for two years, but it was extended to three, and then six. His two sons, Anselm Thomas and Nicholas John, were born in Britain. They attended Dragon School and St Edward's, and entered Balliol College, Oxford, where they earned doctorates. Kuhn became a naturalised British subject in 1939. At the Clarendon laboratory, Jackson and Kuhn studied the hyperfine structure and Zeeman effects of the light elements such a lithium, sodium and potassium.In 1940, Kuhn joined a team led by Francis Simon that also included Henry Shull Arms, Nicholas Kurti, and Otto Frisch working on the British nuclear weapons project, known as Tube Alloys. Ironically, foreign-born physicists were assigned this work because they could not initially obtain the required security clearance to work on top-secret projects like radar. Simon's team studied the technology of gaseous diffusion. As part of this work, Kuhn visited the United States, travelling in the bomb bay of a Liberator, in December 1943 and January 1944 to work with the Manhattan Project.Jackson left Britain for tax purposes after the war, but Kuhn remained at Oxford, where he continued his research into atomic spectra with G.W. Series and G.K. Woodgate. Kuhn had become a lecturer at University College, Oxford, in 1938, and he began tutoring students in physics in 1941.  In 1950, Balliol College elected him as its first physics fellow, and its only refugee fellow. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954. He became a senior research fellow in 1969, and an emeritus fellow in 1971. He received the Holweck Prize in 1967. Germany restored his habilitation, and he was given the status and pension of a full professor, but he declined offers to return to Germany.Kuhn had published a textbook on atomic spectra in German, Atomspektren, in 1934. In 1962, he published an updated version, Atomic Spectra, in English; it was still widely used two decades later.

Kuhn was classified as non-Aryan because he had two Jewish grandparents. He was dismissed from his university positions, and his habilitation was revoked. As a decorated veteran of the First World War, Franck was not dismissed from his post, but elected to resign in protest rather than dismiss colleagues for their race or political beliefs.Before leaving Germany, Franck attempted to find positions for his former students and colleagues. He introduced Kuhn to Professor Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell, Scientific Adviser to Winston Churchill, who invited Kuhn to come to the Clarendon laboratory at Oxford University, where he could work on atomic spectra with Derek Jackson. Kuhn and his wife left Germany for Britain in August 1933. They were welcomed by his relatives, the Henschels, and Kuhn received a grant of \u00a3400 per annum from ICI, initially for two years, but it was extended to three, and then six. His two sons, Anselm Thomas and Nicholas John, were born in Britain. They attended Dragon School and St Edward's, and entered Balliol College, Oxford, where they earned doctorates. Kuhn became a naturalised British subject in 1939. At the Clarendon laboratory, Jackson and Kuhn studied the hyperfine structure and Zeeman effects of the light elements such a lithium, sodium and potassium.In 1940, Kuhn joined a team led by Francis Simon that also included Henry Shull Arms, Nicholas Kurti, and Otto Frisch working on the British nuclear weapons project, known as Tube Alloys. Ironically, foreign-born physicists were assigned this work because they could not initially obtain the required security clearance to work on top-secret projects like radar. Simon's team studied the technology of gaseous diffusion. As part of this work, Kuhn visited the United States, travelling in the bomb bay of a Liberator, in December 1943 and January 1944 to work with the Manhattan Project.Jackson left Britain for tax purposes after the war, but Kuhn remained at Oxford, where he continued his research into atomic spectra with G.W. Series and G.K. Woodgate. Kuhn had become a lecturer at University College, Oxford, in 1938, and he began tutoring students in physics in 1941.  In 1950, Balliol College elected him as its first physics fellow, and its only refugee fellow. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954. He became a senior research fellow in 1969, and an emeritus fellow in 1971. He received the Holweck Prize in 1967. Germany restored his habilitation, and he was given the status and pension of a full professor, but he declined offers to return to Germany.Kuhn had published a textbook on atomic spectra in German, Atomspektren, in 1934. In 1962, he published an updated version, Atomic Spectra, in English; it was still widely used two decades later. He died in Oxford on 26 August 1994 after a long illness.\n\n\n== Notes ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

Aserinsky, along with his and Dement's adviser Nathaniel Kleitman, had previously noticed the connection but hadn't considered it very interesting.  Dement had an interest in psychiatry, which in those days considered dreams to be important, so he was excited by the discovery and was eager to pursue it. From the University of Chicago, he received an MD in 1955 and a PhD in neurophysiology in 1957 for the thesis Rapid eye movements during sleep in schizophrenics and non-schizophrenics and their relation to dream recall supervised by Kleitman.He began his work in sleep deprivation at Mount Sinai Hospital in the late 1950s \u2013 the early 1960s.

He enrolled in the Hutchins College at the University of Chicago in 1947 at the age of 15, and received his Ph.D. in 1956.  His Ph.D. thesis was on an algebraic abstract formulation of substitution in many-sorted free algebras and its relation to equational definitions of the partial recursive functions.While in graduate school, beginning in 1954, he worked at Professor Walter Bartky's Institute for Air Weapons Research, which did classified work for the US Air Force.  He continued to work there following the completion of his Ph.D., from 1956 to 1957.  In the summer of 1957 he attended the Cornell NSF Summer 1957 Institute in Logic.   In 1958 to 1959 he went to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked with Kurt G\u00f6del.  He also did post-graduate work at University of California, Berkeley.When in 1959 he got an unsolicited offer of a faculty position at Cornell University, he accepted, in part because on his previous visit to the campus he had thought \"it was the prettiest place I'd ever seen\". Nerode is Goldwin Smith Professor of Mathematics at Cornell, having been named to that chair in 1991. His interests are in mathematical logic, the theory of automata, computability and complexity theory, the calculus of variations, and distributed systems. With John Myhill, Nerode proved the Myhill\u2013Nerode theorem specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for a formal language to be regular. With Bakhadyr Khoussainov, Nerode founded the theory of automatic structures, an extension of the theory of automatic groups.\nThe academic year 2019\u201320 saw Nerode's 60th year as an active faculty member at Cornell, which the university said was its longest such tenure ever.  In 2022, the Nerode-90 conference was held online to celebrate his contributions to the field.Nerode is an Editorial Board member of the journals Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, Mathematical and Computer Modelling, Documenta Mathematica and others.\nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Jacobs completed her undergraduate degree at McPherson College. After a year spent teaching high school she was awarded one of the first two fellowships to study graduate-level mathematics at the University of Kansas, where she earned her master's degree in 1916. She earned her Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 1919 under the supervision of Arthur Byron Coble. She became an associate professor at Rockford College and then, in 1920, an instructor at the University of Texas at Austin, where she also edited the Texas Mathematics Teachers' Bulletin. Her tenure at the university, along with that of colleague Goldie Printis Horton, is recognized by an annual lecture series.While at the University of Texas, she met geneticist Hermann Joseph Muller, when he asked her for help modeling the mathematics of mutation in flies. The couple married in 1923. Their son David, who would become a mathematician and computer scientist, was born the following year. Jessie's university appointment was terminated in 1924 against her wishes: her departmental colleagues felt that academia and motherhood were incompatible. Her own teaching career over, Jessie collaborated with her husband in the Drosophila laboratory and co-authored an article with him. Muller would later win a Nobel prize for the research he performed with Jessie's assistance during this period.The marriage had grown strained, but in 1933 Jessie joined Hermann Muller in Berlin and then Leningrad for a portion of his Guggenheim fellowship. She divorced her husband in 1935 (first in the Soviet Union, then in Texas) and within a few months remarried Carlos Alberto Offermann. He had worked in Hermann Muller's Leningrad laboratory from 1933 to 1934. After marrying Jessie in Texas Carlos returned to his position, now relocated to Moscow, though his wife and stepson were unable to join him. So long as his father remained in the Soviet Union, a Texas judge refused to permit David Muller to leave the state. Jessie made a living in Austin by tutoring university students in mathematics, subletting a room, and supervising a Works Progress Administration group writing a history of Travis County.In 1938, Carlos Offermann returned to Austin, and the family soon moved to Chicago. Assisted by his wife, Carlos pursued experimental work necessary for his Ph.D. Jessie was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and in 1940 the family moved to California, where they hoped she could recuperate. In 1942, her health had deteriorated and she was forced to enter a sanitarium, and was institutionalized at the time of her death.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called \"the world's most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word Einstein broadly synonymous with genius.Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Z\u00fcrich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life. In 1903, he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, he became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of Prussia.In 1933, while he was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by the Nazi \"war of extermination\" against his fellow Jews, Einstein decided to remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally viewed the idea of nuclear weapons with great dismay.In 1905, sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity\u2014a theory which addressed the inability of classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field\u2014and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe as a whole. The middle part of his career also saw him making important contributions to statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons. For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately unsuccessful. Firstly, he advocated against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that \"God does not play dice\". Secondly, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism too.

A teacher, experimenter and theorist, he made a lasting contribution to science in his lengthy career, throughout which he sought to encourage specialists in different fields to meet and share insights.\nPaul Weiss was born in Vienna, the son of a Jewish couple, Carl S. Weiss, a businessman, and Rosalie Kohn Weiss. His background favoured music, poetry, and philosophy \u2013 Weiss himself was a violinist \u2013 but an uncle encouraged an interest in science. Weiss received his baccalaureate in 1916.\nAfter the end of the First World War, having served for three years as an officer in the artillery, he commenced studies in mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna, (now Vienna University of Technology). He then shifted his focus to biology with a minor in physics. He absorbed the studies of Edmond B. Wilson, Edwin G. Concklin, and Theodor Boveri and completed his doctoral thesis in 1922 under Hans Leo Przibram, then director of the Biological Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna, on the responses of butterflies to light and gravity.\nAfter completing his thesis he traveled widely in Europe, becoming an assistant director of the Biological Research Institute of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. In 1926 he married Maria Helen Blaschka.\nHis studies of limb regeneration in newts showed that a complete limb could regenerate even if particular tissue forms were removed from the stump: the required types of tissue would reform. He studied cell differentiation and the transplanting and reforming of connections in the nerves of limbs, using newts and frogs for his experiments. He went on to consider neurobiology and morphogenesis. He introduced the idea of the \"natural experiment\" \u2013 the quest for suggestive examples  from nature \u2013 and this became a favourite teaching device.\nIn 1930 a prospective post at the University of Frankfurt was lost due to the depression and Weiss moved to the United States. In 1931, after studying developing cell cultures for some time, Weiss won a Sterling fellowship to work with Ross Granville Harrison at Yale. He took US citizenship in 1939, publishing his Principles of Development the same year. From 1933 to 1954, after working briefly at Yale, he taught at the University of Chicago.\nIn his work on tissue cultures Weiss outlined several features of cell proliferation: he showed how cell-patterns are affected by their substrate and, through grafts, proved that basic neural patterns of coordination were self-differentiating rather than learned, though higher vertebrates can \"retrain\" reflexes.\nDuring World War II he worked with the American government on nerve injury. In 1947 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1953. In 1954 he became one of the first professors at the new Rockefeller University in New York, where he remained for fifteen years. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that same year. Paul Weiss was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. He died at White Plains, New York, on September 8, 1989, at the age of 91.In similarity to Ludwig von Bertalanffy he described organisms in a systems biology approach with concepts like hierarchically organized systems or primary activity.

Today, he is perhaps better recognised for his influence on the latter discipline, particularly with respect to his analyses of topics such as magic, sacrifice and gift exchange in different cultures around the world. Mauss had a significant influence upon Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, the founder of structural anthropology.

Following the death of his grandfather, the Mauss and Durkheim families grew close and at this time Mauss began to feel concerned about his education and took initiatives in order to learn. Mauss obtained a religious education and was bar mitzvahed, yet by the age of eighteen he stopped practicing his religion.Mauss studied philosophy at Bordeaux, where his maternal uncle \u00c9mile Durkheim was teaching at the time. In the 1890s, Mauss began his lifelong study of linguistics, Indology, Sanskrit, Hebrew, and the 'history of religions and uncivilized peoples' at the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes. He passed the agr\u00e9gation in 1893. He was also the first cousin of the much younger Claudette (n\u00e9e Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist. Instead of taking the usual route of teaching at a lyc\u00e9e following college, Mauss moved to Paris and took up the study of comparative religion and Sanskrit.\nHis first publication in 1896 marked the beginning of a prolific career that would produce several landmarks in sociological literature.

He was particularly engaged around the anti-semitic political events of the Dreyfus affair.

The military service was liberating from Mauss's intense academics, as he stated, \"I'm doing wonderfully.

In this work, Mauss and Durkheim attempted to create a French version of the sociology of knowledge, illustrating the various paths of human thought taken by different cultures, in particular how space and time are connected back to societal patterns. They focused their study on tribal societies in order to achieve depth.\nWhile Mauss called himself a Durkheimian, he interpreted the school of Durkheim as his own. His early works reflect the dependence on Durkheim's school, yet as more works, including unpublished texts were read, Mauss preferred to start many projects and often not finish them. Mauss concerned himself more with politics than his uncle, as a member of the Collectivistes, French workers party, and Revolutionary socialist workers party. His political involvement led up to and after World War I.The Gift\nMauss has been credited for his analytic framework which has been characterized as more supple, more appropriate for the application of empirical studies, and more fruitful than his earlier studies with Durkheim. His work fell into two categories, one being major ethnological works on exchange as a symbolic system, body techniques and the category of the person, and the second being social science methodology. In his classic work The Gift [see external links for PDF], Mauss argued that gifts are never truly free, rather, human history is full of examples of gifts bringing about reciprocal exchange. The famous question that drove his inquiry into the anthropology of the gift was: \"What power resides in the object given that causes its recipient to pay it back?\". The answer is simple: the gift is a \"total prestation\" (see law of obligations), imbued with \"spiritual mechanisms\", engaging the honour of both giver and receiver (the term \"total prestation\" or \"total social fact\" (fait social total) was coined by his student Maurice Leenhardt after Durkheim's social fact). Such transactions transcend the divisions between the spiritual and the material in a way that, according to Mauss, is almost \"magical\". The giver does not merely give an object but also part of himself, for the object is indissolubly tied to the giver: \"the objects are never completely separated from the men who exchange them\" (1990:31). \nBecause of this bond between giver and gift, the act of giving creates a social bond with an obligation to reciprocate on the part of the recipient. Not to reciprocate means to lose honour and status, but the spiritual implications can be even worse: in Polynesia, failure to reciprocate means to lose mana, one's spiritual source of authority and wealth. To cite Goldman-Ida's summary, \"Mauss distinguished between three obligations: giving, the necessary initial step for the creation and maintenance of social relationships; receiving, for to refuse to receive is to reject the social bond; and reciprocating in order to demonstrate one's own liberality, honour, and wealth\" (2018:341). Mauss describes how society is blinded by ideology, and therefore a system of prestations survives in societies when regarding the economy. Institutions are founded on the unity of individuals and society, and capitalism rests on an unsustainable influence on an individual's wants. Rather than focusing on money, Mauss describes the need to focus on faits sociaux totaux, total social facts, which are legal, economic, religious, and aesthetic facts which challenge the sociological method.An important notion in Mauss's conceptualization of gift exchange is what Gregory (1982, 1997) refers to as \"inalienability\". In a commodity economy, there is a strong distinction between objects and persons through the notion of private property. Objects are sold, meaning that the ownership rights are fully transferred to the new owner. The object has thereby become \"alienated\" from its original owner. In a gift economy, however, the objects that are given are unalienated from the givers; they are \"loaned rather than sold and ceded\". It is the fact that the identity of the giver is invariably bound up with the object given that causes the gift to have a power which compels the recipient to reciprocate. Because gifts are unalienable they must be returned; the act of giving creates a gift-debt that has to be repaid. Because of this, the notion of an expected return of the gift creates a relationship over time between two individuals. In other words, through gift-giving, a social bond evolves that is assumed to continue through space and time until the future moment of exchange. Gift exchange therefore leads to a mutual interdependence between giver and receiver. According to Mauss, the \"free\" gift that is not returned is a contradiction because it cannot create social ties. Following the Durkheimian quest for understanding social cohesion through the concept of solidarity, Mauss's argument is that solidarity is achieved through the social bonds created by gift exchange. Mauss emphasizes that exchanging gifts resulted from the will of attaching other people \u2013 'to put people under obligations', because \"in theory such gifts are voluntary, but in fact they are given and repaid under obligation\".Mauss and Hubert\nMauss also focused on the topic of sacrifice. The book Sacrifice and its Function which he wrote with Henri Hubert in 1899 argued that sacrifice is a process involving sacralising and desacralising. This was when the \"former directed the holy towards the person or object, and the latter away from a person or object.\" Mauss and Hubert proposed that the body is better understood not as a natural given. Instead, it should be seen as the product of specific training in attributes, deportments, and habits. Furthermore, the body techniques are biological, sociological, and psychological and in doing an analysis of the body, one must apprehend these elements simultaneously. They defined the person as a category of thought, the articulation of particular embodiment of law and morality. Mauss and Hubert believed that a person was constituted by personages (a set of roles) which were executed through the behaviors and exercise of specific body techniques and attributes.\n\nMauss and Hubert wrote another book titled A General Theory of Magic in 1902 [see external links for PDF]. They studied magic in 'primitive' societies and how it has manifested into our thoughts and social actions. They argue that social facts are subjective and therefore should be considered magic, but society is not open to accepting this. In the book, Mauss and Hubert state: \"In magic, we have officers, actions, and representations: we call a person who accomplishes magical actions a magician, even if he is not professional; magical representations are those ideas and beliefs which correspond to magical actions; as for these actions, with regard to which we have defined the other elements of magic, we shall call them magical rites. At this stage it is important to distinguish between these activities and other social practices with which they might be confused.\"They go on to say that only social occurrences can be considered magical.

A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist and political philosopher who made contributions to economics, political philosophy, psychology, intellectual history, and other fields. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for work on money and economic fluctuations, and the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. His account of how prices communicate information is widely regarded as an important contribution to economics that led to him receiving the prize.During his teenage years, Hayek fought in World War I. He later said this experience, coupled with his desire to help avoid the mistakes that led to the war, drew him into economics. He earned doctoral degrees in law in 1921 and political science in 1923 from the University of Vienna. He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany. He became a British citizen in 1938. His academic life was mostly spent at the London School of Economics, later at the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. He is widely considered a major contributor to the Austrian School of Economics.Hayek had considerable influence on a variety of political movements of the 20th century, and his ideas continue to influence thinkers from a variety of political backgrounds today. Although sometimes described as a conservative, Hayek himself was uncomfortable with this label and preferred to be thought of as a classical liberal. As the co-founder of the Mont Pelerin Society he contributed to the revival of classical liberalism in the post-war era. His most popular work, The Road to Serfdom, has been republished many times over the eight decades since its original publication.Hayek was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1984 for his academic contributions to economics. He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush.

Hayek was also instrumental in the founding of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the right-wing libertarian and free-market think tank that inspired Thatcherism. He was in addition a member of the conservative and libertarian Philadelphia Society.Hayek had a long-standing and close friendship with philosopher of science Karl Popper, who was also from Vienna. In a letter to Hayek in 1944, Popper stated: \"I think I have learnt more from you than from any other living thinker, except perhaps Alfred Tarski\". Popper dedicated his Conjectures and Refutations to Hayek.

Popper also participated in the inaugural meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society. Their friendship and mutual admiration do not change the fact that there are important differences between their ideas.\nHayek also played a central role in Milton Friedman's intellectual development. Friedman wrote: My interest in public policy and political philosophy was rather casual before I joined the faculty of the University of Chicago.

He also noted that he admired Hayek only for his political works and disagreed with his technical economics; he called Prices and Production a \"very flawed book\" and The Pure Theory of Capital \"unreadable\".  There were occasional tensions at the Mont Pelerin meetings between the Hayek's and Friedman's followers that sometimes threatened to split the Society.

Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated from King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes\u2013no questions can never be answered by computation. He defined a Turing machine and proved that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he earned his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University.\nDuring the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, Turing was never fully recognised in Britain during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment with DES, a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954, at age 41, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. \nFollowing a public campaign in 2009, British prime minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the government for \"the appalling way [Turing] was treated\". Queen Elizabeth II granted a posthumous pardon in 2013. The term \"Alan Turing law\" is now used informally to refer to a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.Turing has an extensive legacy with statues of him and many things named after him, including an annual award for computer science innovations. He appears on the current Bank of England \u00a350 note, which was released on 23 June 2021 to coincide with his birthday.

Seen by some as \"The Father of Economics\" or \"The Father of Capitalism\", he wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work that treats economics as a comprehensive system and as an academic discipline. Smith refuses to explain the distribution of wealth and power in terms of God's will and instead appeals to natural, political, social, economic, legal, environmental and technological factors and the interactions among them. Among other economic theories, the work introduced Smith's idea of absolute advantage.Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.\nAs a reaction to the common policy of protecting national markets and merchants through minimizing imports and maximizing exports, what came to be known as mercantilism, Smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by writers such as Horace Walpole.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He was the founder of modern functional analysis, and an original member of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics. His major work was the 1932 book, Th\u00e9orie des op\u00e9rations lin\u00e9aires (Theory of Linear Operations), the first monograph on the general theory of functional analysis.Born in Krak\u00f3w to a family of Goral descent, Banach showed a keen interest in mathematics and engaged in solving mathematical problems during school recess. After completing his secondary education, he befriended Hugo Steinhaus, with whom he established the Polish Mathematical Society in 1919 and later published the scientific journal Studia Mathematica. In 1920, he received an assistantship at the Lw\u00f3w Polytechnic, subsequently becoming a professor in 1922 and a member of the Polish Academy of Learning in 1924. Banach was also a co-founder of the Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics, a school of thought comprising some of the most renowned Polish mathematicians of the interwar period (1918\u20131939).\nSome of the notable mathematical concepts that bear Banach's name include Banach spaces, Banach algebras, Banach measures, the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox, the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, the Banach\u2013Steinhaus theorem, the Banach\u2013Mazur game, the Banach\u2013Alaoglu theorem, and the Banach fixed-point theorem.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "184_65642", "text": "Banach's dissertation, completed in 1920 and published in 1922, formally axiomatized the concept of a complete normed vector space and laid the foundations for the area of functional analysis.

The theory of what came to be known as Banach spaces had antecedents in the work of the Hungarian mathematician Frigyes Riesz (published in 1916) and contemporaneous contributions from Hans Hahn and Norbert Wiener. For a brief period in fact, complete normed linear spaces were referred to as \"Banach\u2013Wiener\" spaces in mathematical literature, based on terminology introduced by Wiener himself. However, because Wiener's work on the topic was limited, the established name became just Banach spaces.Likewise, Banach's fixed point theorem, based on earlier methods developed by Charles \u00c9mile Picard, was included in his dissertation, and was later extended by his students (for example in the Banach\u2013Schauder theorem) and other mathematicians (in particular Brouwer and Poincar\u00e9 and Birkhoff).

For a brief period in fact, complete normed linear spaces were referred to as \"Banach\u2013Wiener\" spaces in mathematical literature, based on terminology introduced by Wiener himself. However, because Wiener's work on the topic was limited, the established name became just Banach spaces.Likewise, Banach's fixed point theorem, based on earlier methods developed by Charles \u00c9mile Picard, was included in his dissertation, and was later extended by his students (for example in the Banach\u2013Schauder theorem) and other mathematicians (in particular Brouwer and Poincar\u00e9 and Birkhoff). The theorem did not require linearity of the space, and applied to any complete Cauchy space (in particular to any complete metric space).\nThe Hahn\u2013Banach theorem is one of the fundamental theorems of functional analysis.

Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.\nRamanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. According to Hans Eysenck, \"he tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered\". Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal correspondence with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognising Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that \"defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before\", and some recently proven but highly advanced results.\nDuring his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations). Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired further research. Of his thousands of results, most have been proven correct. The Ramanujan Journal, a scientific journal, was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan, and his notebooks\u2014containing summaries of his published and unpublished results\u2014have been analysed and studied for decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas. As late as 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about \"simple properties\" and \"similar outputs\" for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death. He became one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.\nIn 1919, ill health\u2014now believed to have been hepatic amoebiasis (a complication from episodes of dysentery many years previously)\u2014compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where he died in 1920 at the age of 32. His last letters to Hardy, written in January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new mathematical ideas and theorems.

They lived in a small traditional home on Sarangapani Sannidhi Street in the town of Kumbakonam. The family home is now a museum. When Ramanujan was a year and a half old, his mother gave birth to a son, Sadagopan, who died less than three months later. In December 1889, Ramanujan contracted smallpox, but recovered, unlike the 4,000 others who died in a bad year in the Thanjavur district around this time. He moved with his mother to her parents' house in Kanchipuram, near Madras (now Chennai).

He contributed to the Information Processing Language (1956) and two of the earliest AI programs, the Logic Theorist (1956) and the General Problem Solver (1957) (with Herbert A. Simon).
