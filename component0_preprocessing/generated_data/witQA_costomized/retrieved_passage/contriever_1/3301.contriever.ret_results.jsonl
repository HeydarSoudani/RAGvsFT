The Filmfare ceremony is one of the most famous film events in India. The awards were introduced by the Filmfare magazine of The Times Group in 1954, the same year as the National Film Awards. They were initially referred to as the \"Clare Awards\" or \"The Clares\" after Clare Mendon\u00e7a, the editor of The Times of India and modelled after the Academy Awards.\nA dual voting system was developed in 1956. Under this system, in contrast to the National Film Awards, which are decided by a panel appointed by the Indian Government, the Filmfare Awards are voted on by both the public and a committee of experts. The ceremony has been sponsored by various private organisations in the past as well as in present provisions. During several years in the 1990s, a live ceremony was broadcast to television audiences but was later discontinued due to unknown reasons.\nSince 2001, a recorded and edited version of the awards ceremony was televised on SET a week or two after the ceremony has been held. Since 2018, the ceremony has been televised on Colors. Until 2023, the function was held in Mumbai except for year 2020 when the 65th Filmfare Awards event was held on 16 February 2020 at Sarusajai Stadium, Guwahati.\nUntil the mid-1990s, Filmfare Awards were the preeminent and most-recognised awards in Bollywood until several other awards sprouted up in Mumbai. This has resulted in poor viewership since the 2000s.In addition to the flagship event, Filmfare also has variants for other Indian film industries, such as Filmfare Awards South for South Indian cinema; Filmfare Marathi Awards for Marathi cinema; Filmfare Awards East for Bengali cinema, Assamese cinema, and Odia cinema; Filmfare Awards Punjabi for Punjabi cinema; Filmfare OTT Awards for over-the-top films, Filmfare Short Film Awards for short films; and Filmfare Style & Glamour Awards.", "hasanswer": true}]}
