Originally, finely chopped pre-cooked meat was used as a filling, but later raw ground meat became more common.

In contrast to doughnuts, the hole does not go all the way through, but is only made at the top, such that the filling is visible in the middle. The shape is thus somewhat similar to Russian vatrushka.

The word is originally a compound of the two Proven\u00e7al verbs bolhir ('to boil') and abaissar ('to reduce heat', i.e. 'simmer').\nBouillabaisse was originally a dish made by Marseille fishers, using the bony rockfish which they were unable to sell to restaurants or markets. There are at least three kinds of fish in a traditional bouillabaisse, typically red rascasse (Scorpaena scrofa); sea robin; and European conger. It can also include gilt-head bream, turbot, monkfish, mullet, or European hake.  It usually also includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins, mussels, velvet crabs, spider crab or octopus. More expensive versions may add langoustine (Dublin Bay prawn; Norway lobster), though this was not part of the traditional dish made by Marseille fishers.  Vegetables such as leeks, onions, tomatoes, celery, and potatoes are simmered together with the broth and served with the fish. The broth is traditionally served with a rouille, a mayonnaise made of olive oil, garlic, saffron, and cayenne pepper on grilled slices of bread.\nWhat makes a bouillabaisse different from other fish soups is the selection of Proven\u00e7al herbs and spices in the broth; the use of bony local Mediterranean fish; the way the fish are added one at a time, and brought to a boil; and the method of serving. In Marseille, the broth is served first in a soup plate with slices of bread and rouille, then the fish is served separately on a large platter  (see image at top);  or, more simply,  as Julia Child suggests, the fish and broth are brought to the table separately and served together in large soup plates.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It is common to the cuisines of Central, Northern, Eastern and Southeastern Europe and much of Western Asia, Northern China, as well as parts of North Africa.\nMeat fillings are traditional in Europe, and include beef, lamb, or pork seasoned with garlic, onion, and spices. Grains such as rice and barley, mushrooms, and vegetables are often included as well. Fermented cabbage leaves are used for wrapping, particularly in southeastern Europe. In Asia, seafoods, tofu, and shiitake mushrooms or Vegeta may also be used. Chinese cabbage is often used as a wrapping.\nCabbage leaves are stuffed with the filling which are then baked, simmered, or steamed in a covered pot and generally eaten warm, often accompanied with a sauce. The sauce varies widely by cuisine. In Sweden and Finland, stuffed cabbage is served with lingonberry jam, which is both sweet and tart. In Central and Eastern Europe, tomato-based sauces and sour cream are typical. In Lebanon, the cabbage is stuffed with rice and minced meat and only rolled to the size of a cigar. It is usually served with a side dish of yogurt and a type of lemon and olive oil vinaigrette seasoned with garlic and dried mint.\nThe cabbage roll is a staple in the Romanian cuisine with variations of the recipe and sizing depending on the region, typically taking up to 6 hours to cook. Traditionally made with pork, beef, bacon, rice, spices and aromatics, broiled in a tomato sauce and served with polenta, sour cream and spicy pickled peppers.\nCooking textbook author Nancy Krcek stated that the origins are unclear and that it is possible multiple groups of people invented it at the same time. Another cooking book author Malgorzata Caprari stated it is believed that credit is owed to the poorer inhabitants of Central and Eastern European countries. Due to the widespread cultivation of cabbage in these regions, it is likely that the cultures who inhabited them were the original inventors of this dish.Cabbage rolls have found their way into popular culture, becoming one of the most recognizable dishes in Central and Eastern European cuisine. They often appear in literature and films as a symbol of homey comfort and tradition.\nA version called holishkes is traditionally eaten by Jews on Simchat Torah.

The 80-seat restaurant replaced In Good Taste, a cooking school which occupied the space for eleven years and closed in February 2012. Its name (inspired by Louisiana's administrative divisions) was reflected by the restaurant's \"ecclesiastical\" interior, which included gray and pewter-colored \"cathedral-esque\" arches over the bar and a host stand which was a refurbished Prohibition-era Mississippi church pulpit.The Cajun, Louisiana Creole, and New Orleans-style seafood restaurant served entrees such as andouille, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, frog legs, jambalaya, maque choux, pork belly, and turtle soup, and was best known for its oysters. Its bar, Vieux Carr\u00e9 (French Quarter), served New Orleans cocktails including Bourbon-based drinks, daiquiris, and house infusions. The Parish's 4,000-square-foot (370 m2) interior, designed by Mark Annen, had a shucking station, oak floors, French-blue walls with gray accents, exposed brickwork, subway tiles, and salvaged woodwork.Hogan and Powell reportedly worked at both Eat and The Parish, switching daily.

The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items.
