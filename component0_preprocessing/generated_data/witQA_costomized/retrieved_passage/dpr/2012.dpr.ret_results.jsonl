All of the ingredients in hummus are easily found in gardens, farms and markets, thus adding to the availability and popularity of the dish. Hummus is usually garnished, with olive oil, \"nana\" mint leaves, paprika, and parsley.Hummus is a common part of everyday meals in Israel. It is made from ingredients that, following Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws), can be combined with both meat and dairy meals. Chickpea dishes have long been part of the cuisine of Jews who lived in the Middle East and Northern Africa. The many Mizrahi Jewish immigrants from these countries brought their own unique variations, such as hummus with fried eggplant and boiled eggs prepared by Iraqi Jews. For example, the Yemenite quarter of Tel Aviv is known for its hummus with traditional skhug hot sauce. Israeli versions use large amounts of tahini for a creamier texture. According to Peli-Bronshtein \"Israelis also added a hard-boiled egg next to the hummus. And the large quantities of tahini that are part of the hummus these days also are an Israeli thing.\" Many restaurants, called hummusia, run by Mizrahi Jews and Arabs are dedicated to warm hummus. Those restaurants are largely \"male territory\". It may be served as chick peas softened with baking soda along with garlic, olive oil, cumin and tahini. One of the hummus versions available is msabbaha, made with lemon-spiked tahini garnished with whole chick peas, a sprinkling of paprika and a drizzle of olive oil. Other versions, includes the foul, made with stewed fava beans, the pitryot made with mushrooms or the Jerusalem made with spiced ground beef and pine nuts.One author calls hummus, \"One of the most popular and best-known of all Syrian dishes\" and a \"must on any mezzeh table.\" Syrian and Lebanese in Canada's Arab diaspora prepare and consume hummus along with other dishes like falafel, kibbeh and tabbouleh, even among the third- and fourth-generation offspring of the original immigrants.In Cyprus, hummus is part of the local cuisine in both Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities where it is called \"humoi\" (Greek: \u03c7\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9).

Ninfa Laurenzo drew inspiration from the cooking of her mother, who was a Mexican, and from Laurenzo's own travels to Mexico City. The food had an Italian influence because Laurenzo's deceased husband, Domenic Thomas Laurenzo, was an Italian American. Mozzarella, olive oil, and parmesan were used as ingredients.The signature dish was \"tacos al carbon,\" which later became called \"fajitas.\" The Ninfa's fajitas included chopped, char-grilled beef fillets placed in handmade flour tortillas. Ninfa's used a smoky marinade in the beef fajitas. The restaurant popularized fajitas in the Houston area. This dish was so influential that, by 2001, just about all Tex-Mex restaurants in Houston served a version of the Ninfa's fajitas.\nThe second most popular dish was the \"Green Sauce,\" an avocado and tomatillo sauce. When a customer had asked for \"salsa verde,\" Ninfa Laurenzo created the \"Green Sauce\" at the spur of the moment. Ninfa Laurenzo's son Roland later offered a modified version of this dish at his own restaurant, using pureed avocados, tomatillos, cilantro, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os. Patricia Sharpe of Texas Monthly said that Roland's version was a \"creamier, more luxurious potion\" than his mother's original recipe. Ninfa's also offered stuffed jalape\u00f1os. The stuffed jalape\u00f1os became a menu item at Tony Mandola's Gulf Coast Kitchen, operated by Phyllis Laurenzo Mandola, one of Ninfa Laurenzo's daughters, and her husband Tony.In 2004 Sharpe said that, at the original Ninfa's, the beef fajitas \"still have their old magic\" and that the flour tortillas, still made to order in-house, \"are truly carb-addictive.\" She said that the chicken fajitas \"have lost their luster.\" After Neil Morgan took over the chain in 2006, chef Alex Padilla added some new menu items including crab cakes with poblano sauce and Spanish lobster in tequila butter sauce. Padilla also said that the restaurant would grind its own beef brisket for its crispy tacos and use fresh tomatillo in the green sauce.The original Ninfa's includes several torta sandwiches, including the fajita burger, which consistently is positively reviewed.

Many izakaya offer a choice of both as well as seating by the bar. Some izakaya restaurants are also tachi-nomi style, literally translated as \"drinking while standing\".Usually, customers are given an oshibori (wet towel) to clean their hands; the towels are cold in summer and hot in winter.

It is local custom and usually charged onto the bill in lieu of an entry fee.\nThe menu may be on the table, displayed on walls, or both. Picture menus are common in larger izakaya. Food and drink are ordered throughout the course of the session as desired. They are brought to the table, and the bill is added up at the end of the session. Unlike other Japanese styles of eating, food items are usually shared by everyone at the table, similar to Spanish tapas.\nCommon styles of izakaya dining in Japan are nomi-h\u014ddai (\"all you can drink\") and tabe-h\u014ddai (\"all you can eat\"). For a set price per person, customers can continue ordering as much food and/or drink as they wish, usually with a time limit of two or three hours.\nIzakaya dining can be intimidating to non-Japanese because of the wide variety of menu items and the slow pace. Food is normally ordered slowly over several courses rather than all at once. The kitchen will serve the food when it is ready, rather than in the formal courses of Western restaurants. Typically, a beer is ordered when one is sitting down before perusing the menu.

The word is originally a compound of the two Proven\u00e7al verbs bolhir ('to boil') and abaissar ('to reduce heat', i.e. 'simmer').\nBouillabaisse was originally a dish made by Marseille fishers, using the bony rockfish which they were unable to sell to restaurants or markets. There are at least three kinds of fish in a traditional bouillabaisse, typically red rascasse (Scorpaena scrofa); sea robin; and European conger. It can also include gilt-head bream, turbot, monkfish, mullet, or European hake.  It usually also includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins, mussels, velvet crabs, spider crab or octopus. More expensive versions may add langoustine (Dublin Bay prawn; Norway lobster), though this was not part of the traditional dish made by Marseille fishers.  Vegetables such as leeks, onions, tomatoes, celery, and potatoes are simmered together with the broth and served with the fish. The broth is traditionally served with a rouille, a mayonnaise made of olive oil, garlic, saffron, and cayenne pepper on grilled slices of bread.\nWhat makes a bouillabaisse different from other fish soups is the selection of Proven\u00e7al herbs and spices in the broth; the use of bony local Mediterranean fish; the way the fish are added one at a time, and brought to a boil; and the method of serving. In Marseille, the broth is served first in a soup plate with slices of bread and rouille, then the fish is served separately on a large platter  (see image at top);  or, more simply,  as Julia Child suggests, the fish and broth are brought to the table separately and served together in large soup plates.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It is common to the cuisines of Central, Northern, Eastern and Southeastern Europe and much of Western Asia, Northern China, as well as parts of North Africa.\nMeat fillings are traditional in Europe, and include beef, lamb, or pork seasoned with garlic, onion, and spices. Grains such as rice and barley, mushrooms, and vegetables are often included as well. Fermented cabbage leaves are used for wrapping, particularly in southeastern Europe. In Asia, seafoods, tofu, and shiitake mushrooms or Vegeta may also be used. Chinese cabbage is often used as a wrapping.\nCabbage leaves are stuffed with the filling which are then baked, simmered, or steamed in a covered pot and generally eaten warm, often accompanied with a sauce. The sauce varies widely by cuisine. In Sweden and Finland, stuffed cabbage is served with lingonberry jam, which is both sweet and tart. In Central and Eastern Europe, tomato-based sauces and sour cream are typical. In Lebanon, the cabbage is stuffed with rice and minced meat and only rolled to the size of a cigar. It is usually served with a side dish of yogurt and a type of lemon and olive oil vinaigrette seasoned with garlic and dried mint.\nThe cabbage roll is a staple in the Romanian cuisine with variations of the recipe and sizing depending on the region, typically taking up to 6 hours to cook. Traditionally made with pork, beef, bacon, rice, spices and aromatics, broiled in a tomato sauce and served with polenta, sour cream and spicy pickled peppers.\nCooking textbook author Nancy Krcek stated that the origins are unclear and that it is possible multiple groups of people invented it at the same time. Another cooking book author Malgorzata Caprari stated it is believed that credit is owed to the poorer inhabitants of Central and Eastern European countries. Due to the widespread cultivation of cabbage in these regions, it is likely that the cultures who inhabited them were the original inventors of this dish.Cabbage rolls have found their way into popular culture, becoming one of the most recognizable dishes in Central and Eastern European cuisine. They often appear in literature and films as a symbol of homey comfort and tradition.\nA version called holishkes is traditionally eaten by Jews on Simchat Torah.
