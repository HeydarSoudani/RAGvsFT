It appeared in 107 two- to seven-page episodes in Playboy magazine from October 1962 to September 1988. Little Annie Fanny is a humorous satire of contemporary American society and its sexual mores. Annie Fanny, the title character, is a statuesque, buxom young blonde woman who innocently finds herself nude in every episode. The series is notable for its painted, luminous color artwork and for being the first full-scale, multi-page comics feature in a major American publication.\nHarvey Kurtzman, a cartoonist, created the series at the culmination of his career. He had launched Mad magazine, worked briefly for Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and on a series of solo and collaborative projects, then returned to working for Hefner with Little Annie Fanny. Each episode of the comic strip was designed and written by Kurtzman and rendered in oil, tempera, and watercolor by Elder. Hefner edited each episode, often requiring detailed changes to ensure that the series remained true to the magazine's editorial style. Critical reaction was mixed, with most praising the elaborate, fully painted comic, but some dismissing it as falling short of Kurtzman's full potential. The complete series was collected into two volumes in 2000 and 2001 by Dark Horse Comics.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "1433_69000", "text": "Comics historian Don Markstein said that Little Annie Fanny \"reached a high point seldom achieved by cartoon art\", saying \"Harvey Kurtzman ... strove for most of his life to advance the boundaries of comics, not just in terms of storytelling but also in production values\", concluding that Little Annie Fanny achieved at least the latter. About its venue he said, \"Playboy magazine, whatever you may say about its content, always did a first-rate job of printing color pictures.\" According to comics commentators Randy Duncan and Matthew J. Smith, the series \"reads today as an amusing look at the evolving mores of the sexual revolution\". Comics editor Monte Beauchamp said that Little Annie Fanny was \"the most elaborate comic strip ever created\" and cartoonist-critic R. C. Harvey called it \"a masterpiece ... the most lavish color comic strip of all time\".Not all were as impressed. Noting that Kurtzman was financially strapped before making his living for twenty-six years from Playboy, historian Paul Buhle wrote: \"The strip had many brilliant early moments, but went downhill as the writer and artist bent to editor Hugh Hefner's demands for as much titillation as possible.\" Cartoonist Art Spiegelman said that Little Annie Fanny devolved from the more interesting Goodman Beaver. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, whose career Kurtzman helped launch, scorned Playboy and Annie. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of Help!, said that Little Annie Fanny was not as sharp as Kurtzman's earlier work: \"technically brilliant but ... slightly compromised.\" Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, who handles Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that \"most Kurtzman devotees would not consider Little Annie Fanny genius work ... [and] some would argue the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded\". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who \"was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different ideas about what was funny or satiric\" and insisted that each strip \"had to include Annie disrobing\". Beauchamp agreed: \"Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand.\" Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that \"humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously.\" However, they repeated their respect: \"The eternally innocent Annie performed admirably as a nonjudgmental witness to the changing tides of the sexual revolution.\"American cartoonist Budd Root cited Little Annie Fanny as one of the inspirations for his independent comic book series Cavewoman.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "1433_68998", "text": "Annie Fanny is the feature's lead character. Like other young women in Playboy pictorials, Annie is beautiful, buxom, and often unclothed. She is sexually innocent, oblivious to the worldliness around her. Like her forebear Goodman Beaver, Annie was conceived as a modern Candide, above the story's corruptions and temptations. Unlike Goodman, however, Annie is never shocked or offended; she remains blithe. The authors of Icons of the American Comic Book say Annie \"glides through a changing world with an untiring optimism\" with a \"good-natured lack of desire\". She is insulated from the carnal nature of those around her, who explain the new rules of society to her each episode. Ruthie, Annie's mother hen roommate, appears in the first episode and remains in the strip throughout its run. Wanda Homefree, Annie Fanny's wild and shapely best friend, first appears in an episode-10 beauty contest as Miss Greenwich Village and is often seen at Annie's side throughout the remainder of the series. Ralphie Towzer, Annie's nerdy-but-hip do-gooder boyfriend, has the look of Goodman Beaver (with playwright Arthur Miller's eyeglasses and pipe) and the temperament of a strait-laced, chastising prude. Solly Brass, Annie's huckster agent, is based on actor Phil Silvers.A number of other characters in Little Annie Fanny are derived from Gray's Little Orphan Annie. Sugardaddy Bigbucks, Annie's surrogate father and a powerful, manipulative capitalist, is based on Daddy Warbucks. His mysterious assistant, the Wasp, derives from Warbucks' assistant the Asp, and Punchjab, his bodyguard, comes from the character Punjab. Other supporting characters include ad man Benton Battbarton (whose name is taken from the advertising agencies Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn and Benton & Bowles), Battbarton's rival Huck Buxton (modeled on gap-toothed British actor Terry-Thomas), Duncan Fyfe Hepplewhite (an art plagiarist), and Freddie Flink (who resembles comic actor Fred Gwynne from Car 54, Where Are You?).", "hasanswer": false}]}

With this tune, the hymn has been included in several hymnals, such as Christian Friedrich Witt's Neues Cantional and the Evangelisches Gesangbuch, where it is numbered EG 83. Gerhardt's hymn was however also sung to the tune of \"Herr Gott, erh\u00f6re die Gerechtigkeit\", Zahn No. 7669, and several other melodies were composed for the text: Johannes Zahn lists three 17th-century melodies composed for \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" (Nos. 7681\u20137683), three from the 18th century (Nos. 7684\u20137686, the first of which was composed for a reworked version of the text), and two from the 19th century (Nos. 7687\u20137688).The third part of a Passion setting presented in Rudolstadt in 1688 opens with Gerhardt's \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" in the format of an aria, using the \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" melody.

It is amongst Paterson's most popular works.  A 1973 reprinting of the poem illustrated by Kilmeny & Deborah Niland has been continuously in print since publication and won the 1973 ABPA Book Design Award and the 1974 Visual Arts Board Award.The novel by H. G. Wells on cycling, The Wheels of Chance: A Bicycling Idyll was published in the same year as this poem.Ordinaries- the term \"Penny-Farthings\" is used interchangeably by many- were notoriously dangerous to ride on level ground, but Banjo has Mulga Bill cycling DOWNHILL on a mountain road at which point he gains so much speed that he becomes the Ordinary's PASSENGER, unable to stop or dismount it. On a standard bicycle one's feet could touch the ground to (inelegantly) brake their speed on a dirt road. But this being an Ordinary, once Mulga Bill sets off downhill with no previous experience riding one, he becomes a victim of his own hubris.  There is no escaping his fate and he narrowly escapes death when his ride concludes with him sailing off of a precipice and crashes into a creek. Pride indeed came before Mulga's fall\nThe model for the character of Mulga Bill was William Henry Lewis (1880-1968), who knew Paterson in the vicinity of Bourke, New South Wales. Lewis had bought his bicycle as a result of a drought when there was no feed for horses.Eaglehawk, Victoria\u2014once a rural mining town, now part of greater Bendigo\u2014was given as Mulga Bill's hometown ('Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk ...).

However, around the time of the 20th anniversary of the film in 1996, Cohn revealed that it was actually a work of fiction.\nAfter persuading New York editor Clay Felker to let him write an article about the 1970s disco scene, Cohn, a newcomer to the United States, set about researching the American working-class subculture he was trying to cover. One night he travelled to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to visit the disco 2001 Odyssey. However when he arrived a drunken fight was taking place outside the club, and one of the participants rolled over in the gutter and threw up on Cohn's trouser leg, leading him to return to Manhattan. Despite this brief visit, Cohn did notice that the scene was surveyed by one clubgoer standing in the doorway and calmly watching events. Cohn returned to the club subsequently but the young man was not there.To overcome his lack of familiarity with the New York disco scene, Cohn combined the image of the figure outside the club with people he knew from his youth, including a gang member from the Northern Ireland city of Derry, where Cohn had grown up, and a young man he knew in England. \"My story was a fraud\", he wrote. \"I'd only recently arrived in New York. Far from being steeped in Brooklyn street life, I hardly knew the place. As for Vincent, my story's hero, he was largely inspired by a Shepherd's Bush mod whom I'd known in the Sixties, a one-time king of Goldhawk Road.\" For additional detail Cohn returned to Bay Ridge during the day to get a better feel for the area.\nOn the 40th anniversary of the article\u2019s publication in 2016, Cohn said that he thought that such a fictionalised piece would not be published in the contemporary press:\nIt reads to me as obvious fiction, albeit based on observation and some knowledge of disco culture. No way could it sneak past customs now. In the 60s and 70s, the line between fact and fiction was blurry... Few editors asked tough questions.

Although a state could choose who it gave absentee ballots to, it could not \"unreasonably and arbitrarily discriminate\".On March 30, the District Court granted a temporary order for the inmates to be given ballots, but after a hearing, they granted summary judgment for the Board on December 11. First, it agreed with the Board's interpretation of the state, restricting \"physical incapacity\" to mean incapacity for medical reasons. Then, considering the constitutional question, it compared the Illinois law to three other cases where state laws about absentee ballot had been upheld. In the 1916 case Straughan v. Meyers, a Missouri law was upheld that granted absentee ballots to people traveling for work (e.g. railroad employees, traveling salesmen), but not others. In the 1936 case Lemons v. Noller, a Kansas law was upheld that granted absentee ballots to those who would be outside the state, even though physically disabled person inside the state could not get one.

Mittlebeeler, a Kentucky law was upheld that granted absentee ballots to those absent from their county who were \"in the United States services, or bona fide, full time student[s],\" but not others absent from their county.

In the article, a captain tells how he was dispatched to a remote camp in West Africa to stay in a tumbledown cabin that belonged to a Portuguese trader. On the first night in the cabin, he is awoken by a creaking sound, and sees \"a dark queer-looking thing hanging down through the ventilator above it\". It turns out to be the largest Boa constrictor he has seen (more likely a python because there are no boas in Africa). He is paralysed with fear as the serpent comes down into the room. Unable to cry out for help, the captain spots an old bell that hung from a projecting beam above one of the windows.

The son of a Protestant landowner from East Prussia, he studied at the Munich Art Academy with Gabriel von Hackl from 1903. On 15 September 1910 in Frankfurt Franziska married Albert, who was by then employed as a freelancer at Margarete Steiff GmbH, for which he designed catalogs and numerous dolls and stuffed animals. In 1913, Franziska and Albert moved to Munich and settled in the Schwabing district. In May 1915 their daughter Irmgard Erika was born.\nAfter World War I, Franziska Schlopsnies began designing posters for fashion shows, department stores and exhibitions. One of her earliest surviving designs was made in 1920 for the Tietz department store. After the couple's divorce on 18 December 1922 she often signed her designs with the name \"Slopsnies\". From the mid-1920s, she preferred to draw figurines and costumes. Along with Doris Buscher, Liliane and Margaret von Suttner she was considered among the most important fashion illustrators. Her Art Deco-inspired fashion drawings and caricatures were regularly published in magazines, such as Jugend, Simplicissimus, Eleganten Welt, Berliner Illustrirten Zeitung, Sport im Bild and the monthly Velhagen & Klasings Monatshefte. For the satirical periodicals Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter and Meggendorfer-Bl\u00e4tter, she designed numerous covers in the second half of the 1920s.After Adolf Hitler's rise to power, she produced no known published drawings.

It was serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday from September 1978 to February 1987. Its 366 individual chapters were collected in 34 tank\u014dbon volumes. It tells the story of Ataru Moroboshi, and the alien Lum, who believes she is Ataru's wife after he accidentally proposes to her. The series makes heavy use of Japanese mythology, culture, and puns. It was adapted into an anime television series produced by Kitty Films and broadcast on Fuji TV affiliates from October 1981 to March 1986, with 194 half-hour episodes. Twelve OVAs and six theatrical films followed, and the series was released on various home video formats.\nThe manga series was republished in different formats in Japan. Viz Media released the series in North America in the 1990s under the names Lum * Urusei Yatsura and The Return of Lum, but dropped it after eight issues. They re-licensed the manga and released an omnibus edition under its original title with new translations from 2019 to 2023. The television series, OVAs, and five of the films were released in North America with English subtitles, as well as a dub for the films by AnimEigo. They provided extensive notes on the series to allow people to understand the many cultural references and jokes in the series that would not normally be understood by non-Japanese. The remaining film, Beautiful Dreamer, was released bilingually by Central Park Media. Five of the films, as well as the OVAs, are available from MVM Films in the United Kingdom. The series was released on television in Southeast Asia as Lamu the Invader Girl. The series and films have been license rescued by Discotek Media for a Blu-ray release. A second anime television series adaptation of 46 episodes produced by David Production premiered on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block in October 2022, exactly 41 years after the first premiered. That series is licensed by Sentai Filmworks and streamed on Hidive.\nUrusei Yatsura launched Takahashi's career and received positive reception in and out of Japan from fans and critics alike. The manga has over 35 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 1980, it received the 26th Shogakukan Manga Award in the sh\u014dnen category, as well as the 18th Seiun Award for the Best Comic category in 1987.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "1433_69157", "text": "In 1977, Rumiko Takahashi created the short story Those Selfish Aliens that was nominated for Shogakukan's Best New Comic Artist award. This would serve as the basis for creating Urusei Yatsura which was first published a year later when Takahashi was 21 years old. The series was her first major work, having previously only published short stories and is a combination of romantic comedy, science fiction, suburban life, and Japanese folktales. The title of the series is an untranslatable pun on the word urusai (\u3046\u308b\u3055\u3044), meaning \"noisy\" or \"obnoxious\", but written with the Chinese character for \"planet\"; the title can be translated roughly into English as \"Those Obnoxious Aliens\". The series first appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday in September 1978. At the start of the series it was only scheduled to run for 5 chapters. Ataru was the central character and each chapter would feature a different strange character. The character of Lum was only going to appear in the first chapter and was not in the second chapter; however, Takahashi decided to re-include her in the third chapter. The series was not an instant success and chapters were initially published sporadically. Between May and September 1978 she simultaneously worked on a series called Dust Spot; however, the increasing popularity of Urusei Yatsura caused her to focus on Urusei and the series became a regular serialization from the middle of 1979.Takahashi said that she had been dreaming about the overall universe of Urusei Yatsura since she was very young. She said that the series \"really includes everything I ever wanted to do. I love science fiction because sci-fi has tremendous flexibility. I adopted the science fiction-style for the series because then I could write any way I wanted to\". She wanted the reader to be completely surprised by the next panel and used slapstick comedy to create a reaction in the reader. When Takahashi ran out of ideas she would create new characters. Takahashi shared a small 150-square-foot apartment with her assistants, and slept in a closet due to a lack of space. While writing Urusei Yatsura she also began work on Maison Ikkoku and used this experience as well as her university experience as the basis for the setting of that series. Character names often carry extra meanings used to describe a characters personality or other traits. For example, the name Ataru Moroboshi refers to being hit by a star, a reference to the aliens and other people who gather around him. The name Shinobu suggests a patient character; however, this in contrast to the character's actual personality. In a similar way, the setting for the series is \"Tomobiki\", which means \"friend taking\". Tomobiki is also the name of a superstitious day in the old Japanese calendar system considered to have \"no winners or losers\" and occurred on every sixth day. Funerals rarely took place on this day as it was believed more deaths would soon follow. Lum was named after Agnes Lum, a bikini model during the 1970s. Lum's use of the English word \"Darling\" in reference to Ataru was to emphasize her status as a foreigner, as well as a play on the name Darrin, the husband figure from Bewitched.The characters of Megane, Perm, Kakugari and Chibi are recurring characters throughout the first anime adaptation; however, in the manga they are nameless fans of Lum who appear less after Mendo is introduced. In contrast the character Kosuke Shirai plays a large role in the manga, but does not appear in the first anime series. His role is often performed by Perm. The second half of the first anime adaptation is closer to the manga than the first half. In 2022, Takahashi said that Urusei Yatsura ended because she saw that Shinobu was happy after the character Inaba had been introduced.

My Captain!\" is an extended metaphor poem written by Walt Whitman in 1865 about the death of U.S. president Abraham Lincoln. Well received upon publication, the poem was Whitman's first to be anthologized and the most popular during his lifetime. Together with \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\", \"Hush'd Be the Camps To-day\", and \"This Dust was Once the Man\", it is one of four poems written by Whitman about the death of Lincoln.\nDuring the American Civil War, Whitman moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the government and volunteered at hospitals. Although he never met Lincoln, Whitman felt a connection to him and was greatly moved by Lincoln's assassination. \"My Captain\" was first published in The Saturday Press on November 4, 1865, and appeared in Sequel to Drum-Taps later that year. He later included it in the collection Leaves of Grass and recited the poem at several lectures on Lincoln's death.\nStylistically, the poem is uncharacteristic of Whitman's poetry because of its rhyming, song-like flow, and simple \"ship of state\" metaphor. These elements likely contributed to the poem's initial positive reception and popularity, with many celebrating it as one of the greatest American works of poetry. Critical opinion has shifted since the mid-20th century, with some scholars deriding it as conventional and unoriginal. The poem has made several appearances in popular culture; as it never mentions Lincoln, it has been invoked upon the death of several other heads of state.

She learns that it belongs to an artist named Maara (R. Madhavan) who is responsible for the paintings across the village. Maara is a free spirit and traveller who is often away visiting various places and returning as he pleases. When she starts cleaning up the place, she finds Maara's photo and a sketchbook. The sketches depict the previous New Year's Eve when a small-time thief (Alexander Babu) tried to rob Maara. In a turn-of-events, Maara joins the thief, and they both go on the rooftop of a home with a plan to rob the place. There, they see a woman about to shoot herself. The sketchbook ends there, and the story is left unfinished, which piques Paaru's curiosity about the rest of the story, and Maara as a person.\nIntrigued, Paaru starts finding the people in Maara's sketches.

Jyamao notes the more extreme nature of the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters in comparison to the jokes involving cross-dressing, and that some jokes such as those involving drugs would not be humorous today. Manga commentator Nobunaga Minami lauded Eguchi for being a pioneer in drawing characters with a high fashion sense in Stop!!

Wilder himself has identified \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" as \"a very odd pop song\". The Disney Song Encyclopedia described the song as a \"rhythmic military song.\" Beginning with \"a military-style drum\" introduction, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\", which is immediately preceded by the emotional ballad \"Reflection\" on the film's soundtrack album, \"breaks up the slower pace of the songs,\" according to Filmtracks.com. Similar to the song \"A Girl Worth Fighting For\", the \"ironically titled\" \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" \"play[s] off Mulan's secret\" because Shang is unaware that she is actually a girl, as observed by Jeffrey Gantz of The Phoenix. Johnson Cheu, author of Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability, received the song as a counterpart to the all-female musical number \"Honor to Us All\". Going into the last verse, the song's key shifts up to F minor and later towards the end, \"the backing track falls into silence and [Osmond's] vocals come to the fore.\" Osmond's vocal range spans one octave, from D3 To G#4 Beginning with two verses, followed by a bridge, a refrain, a final verse and repeated choruses, the song is a total of three minutes and twenty-one seconds in length.Entertainment Weekly identified the number as the film's \"rambunctious peak.\" According to Victoria Flanagan, author of Into the Closet: Gender and Cross-dressing in Children's Fiction: Cross-Dressing and the Gendered Body in Children's Literature and Film, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is \"a playful parody of conventional masculinity.\" USA Today's Hannah Yasharoff described the song as \"a tongue-in-cheek comment on sexism\". Lyrically, Zippel described the track as a song about \"hyper-masculinity\" that is disturbed by \"the whole idea of Mulan\", identifying the song as an opportunity \"to have those two issues head-to-head.\" The lyric \"I'll make a man out of you\" is constantly repeated and reinforced by Shang. According to author John Stephens of Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, the song's lyrics \"initially define masculinity in opposition to femininity,\" with its first verse beginning, Let's get down to business \nTo defeat the Huns / Did they send me daughters / When l asked for sons ?\" Its chorus reads, Be a man We must be swift as the coursing  river / Be a man With all the force  of a great typhoon / Be a man With all the strength of a raging fire / Mysterious as the dark side of the moon \" which, according to Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, \"essentializes masculinity by asserting that it embodies the speed, strength and power of the natural world, and yet contains this within an aura of tranquility and mystery.\" According to Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works, these lyrics \"add a hint of darkness as they celebrate male prowess\" by suggesting that one who has \"acquired fiery strength\" is also \"untamed as the moon's dark side.\" According to The Phoenix, Osmond performs the song's lyrics with \"grit.\" Meanwhile, the singer is backed up by a macho-sounding choir repeatedly chanting \"Be a man!\", a call and response preceded by three chords intertwined with lyrics such as \"you must be swift as the coursing river\" and \"with all the force of a great typhoon.\" Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker identified the \"Be a man\" chorus as the song's most iconic moment.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "1433_69272", "text": "\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is a song written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel for Walt Disney Pictures' animated film Mulan (1998). Appearing on the film's soundtrack Mulan: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by American singer Donny Osmond as the singing voice of Captain Li Shang in lieu of American actor BD Wong, who provides the character's speaking voice. The song also features contributions from Lea Salonga as the singing voice of Mulan, Eddie Murphy as Mushu, and Harvey Fierstein, Jerry Tondo and Wilder himself as Yao, Chien-Po and Ling, respectively. In addition, Mushu has a speaking line unlike the other characters in the song.\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written to replace the song \"We'll Make a Man of You\" after the film's original songwriter Stephen Schwartz departed from the project in favor of working on DreamWorks' The Prince of Egypt (1998). Wilder and Zippel were inspired to complete the song after conceiving its ironic title, and the initial draft of the track was immediately approved by Disney. Prior to Mulan, Osmond had auditioned for the role of Hercules in Disney's Hercules (1997), a role for which he was ultimately turned down by the directors because they felt that he sounded too old. Disney eventually cast Osmond as the singing voice of Shang because his singing voice is similar to Wong's speaking voice. An up-tempo military-style song that incorporates both Eastern and Western musical styles, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by Shang during a rigorous training montage in which his young, inexperienced soldiers attempt to justify their worth. The song's title is considered ironic because Mulan, who relies on intelligence, ultimately proves more competent than her male comrades, including Captain Li Shang, who takes a liking to her, while its lyrics explore hyper-masculinity contradicted with Mulan's gender.\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" has received mostly positive reviews from film and music critics, some of whom dubbed it the film's best song, while praising Osmond's performance. Critics have also drawn comparisons between the song and Disney's Hercules, while likening Mulan's role and transformation to actress Demi Moore's performance as Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil in the film G. I. Jane (1997). The song has since appeared on several \"best of\" Disney songs lists, including those of Total Film and the New York Post. Discussed by film critics, film historians, academic journalists and feminists, the song has gone on to be recorded and covered in several different languages\u2014namely Mandarin, Cantonese and Spanish\u2014by entertainers Jackie Chan and Cristian Castro, respectively.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "1433_69273", "text": "\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who were hired to write Mulan's songs because Disney was interested in recruiting songwriters \"that ... would give kind of a different sound to each of the songs.\" While Zippel, a Broadway lyricist, was recruited because the directors were impressed with his work on Disney's Hercules (1997), at the time Wilder, a pop singer, had been best known for his song \"Break My Stride\". Bancroft believes that, although the songwriters \"had two different sensibilities ... the blend [of their styles] worked well together, especially on ['I'll Make a Man Out of You']\".Songwriter Stephen Schwartz was originally slated to write lyrics for Mulan until he was replaced by Zippel \"at the last moment.\" Schwartz had written a song called \"We'll Make a Man of You\" for the scene in which Mulan is training to be a soldier. The song was ultimately replaced with Wilder and Zippel's \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" when Schwartz was forced to resign from Mulan by Disney executives Peter Schneider and Michael Eisner because the songwriter had also agreed to score rival studio DreamWorks' animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998). Wilder and Zippel first conceived the song's title, which then inspired them to write its lyrics and music. Zippel identified determining the song's ironic title as the moment \"he knew he'd hit on something great\" by \"contrasting Mulan's gender with the concept of what it means to be a man.\" The songwriters were hoping to create an original version of a training montage that was funny without being obvious, while remaining in character at all times. In an unlikely situation, the filmmakers universally enjoyed the song from its very first draft.Wilder described himself as using \"an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach\" to composing its music, explaining, \"I knew I wanted it to sound large and I knew what the tempo and the cadence of the piece was.\" Combining Eastern and Western styles, Wilder borrowed \"drum cadences from traditional Chinese drums and then marrying that with military snares\", upon which he continued building until \"it became this cacophonous effect of a Chinese marching American band\". Wilder and Zippel decided to incorporate drums into the track to demonstrate a sense of masculinity and musculature, identifying the song as very odd in structure but appropriate for its lyrics. Zippel's incorporation of \"naturalistic descriptions of masculinity\" into the song's lyrics \u2013 raging fire, coursing river, great typhoon \u2013 was used in an attempt to \"get inside Shang's head space\", elaborating, \"I was just trying to be in character for the captain and how an Asian captain would lead his group differently than how a Western captain would call his troops,\" identifying as an opportunity \"to put some specificity into it.\" Wilder recorded the song's demo himself, which was arranged into a composition featuring a 100-piece orchestra and male choir conducted by musician Paul Buckmaster.Before Mulan, American singer Donny Osmond had auditioned for the lead role in Hercules, a role for which he was ultimately not cast because the directors felt that his voice sounded \"too old\" and \"too deep\" for the character. Osmond later revealed in an interview with People that he was so embarrassed by his Hercules audition that he had nearly considered ending his singing career prematurely. A few months later, Disney contacted Osmond with interest in casting him as the singing voice of Shang after comparing his audition tapes to BD Wong and determining that both actors have \"very similar voices.\" In one scene, Osmond's character, Shang, is hit in the stomach while singing \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\". In order to sound as realistic as possible, Osmond punched himself in the stomach several times while recording the song.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It tells the story of Nausica\u00e4, a princess of a small kingdom on a post-apocalyptic Earth with a toxic ecosystem, who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an environmental disaster threatens humankind.\nPrior to creating Nausica\u00e4, Miyazaki had worked as an animator for Toei Animation, Nippon Animation and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature directorial debut, Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979). After working on an aborted film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf for TMS, he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma Shoten's monthly magazine Animage, initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. The development of Nausica\u00e4 was influenced by the Japanese Heian period tale The Lady who Loved Insects, a similarly-named character from Homer's epic poem Odyssey and the Minamata Bay mercury pollution. The setting and visual style of the manga was influenced by M\u0153bius. It was serialized intermittently in Animage from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven tank\u014dbon volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in North America by Viz Media from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 comic book issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.\nSince its initial serialization, Nausica\u00e4 has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where the series has more than 17 million copies in circulation. The manga and the 1984 film adaptation, written and directed by Miyazaki and released following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters, received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art.

Serialization of the manga resumed for the third time from the August 1984 issue but halted again in the May 1985 issue when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on Castle in the Sky.

By the end Miyazaki had created 59 chapters, of varying length, for publication in the magazine. In an interview, conducted shortly after serialization of the manga had ended, he noted that this amounts to approximately 5 years worth of material.

Their paper was published in a 2014 special edition of the journal Biostatistics along with extended, supporting critiques from other statisticians. Leek summarized the key points of agreement as: when talking about the science-wise false discovery rate one has to bring data; there are different frameworks for estimating the science-wise false discovery rate; and \"it is pretty unlikely that most published research is false\", but that probably varies by one's definition of \"most\" and \"false\".Statistician Ulrich Schimmack reinforced the importance of the empirical basis for models by noting the reported false discovery rate in some scientific fields is not the actual discovery rate because non-significant results are rarely reported.

L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 49\u201390, 24 Stat. 373, later codified at Title 3, Chapter 1) is a United States federal law that added to procedures set out in the Constitution of the United States for the counting of electoral votes following a presidential election.  In its unamended form, it last governed at the time of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count. The Act has since been substantially amended by the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022.\nThe Act was enacted by Congress in 1887, ten years after the disputed 1876 presidential election, in which several states submitted competing slates of electors and a divided Congress was unable to resolve the deadlock for weeks. Close elections in 1880 and 1884 followed, and again raised the possibility that with no formally established counting procedure in place, partisans in Congress might use the counting process to force a desired result.The Act aimed to minimize congressional involvement in election disputes, instead placing the primary responsibility to resolve disputes upon the states. The Act set out procedures and deadlines for the states to follow in resolving disputes, certifying results, and sending the results to Congress. If a state followed these \"safe harbor\" standards and the state's governor properly submitted one set of electoral votes, the Act stated that this \"final\" determination \"shall govern.\" However, making or use of \"any false writing or document\" in the implementation of this procedure was a felony punishable by 5 years imprisonment by 18 U.S. Code 1001 under Chapter 47 Fraud and False Statements. The Act thus relegated Congress to resolving only a narrow class of disputes, such as if a governor had certified two different slates of electors or if a state failed to certify its results under the Act's procedures. Congress could also reject votes under the Act for other specific defects, such as ministerial error, if an elector or candidate was ineligible for office, or if the electoral college votes were not \"regularly given.\"\nThe central provisions of the law were never seriously tested in a disputed election. Since the bill was enacted, some have doubted whether the Act could bind a future Congress. Since the Constitution gives Congress the power to set its own procedural rules, it is possible that simple majorities of the House and Senate could set new rules for the joint session convened to count electoral votes. In the contentious 2000 U.S. presidential election, the law's timing provisions did play a role in court decisions, such as Bush v. Gore. The law has been criticized since it was enacted, with an early commenter describing it as \"very confused, almost unintelligible.\":\u200a643\u200a Modern commenters have stated that the law \"invites misinterpretation\", observing that it is \"turgid and repetitious\", and that \"[i]ts central provisions seem contradictory.\":\u200a543\u200aUnder the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president (as President of the Senate) opens the electoral certificates. The act clarified the vice president's limited role in the count. Both houses could overrule the vice president's decision to include or exclude votes, and under the Act even if the chambers disagree, the governor's certification, not the vice president, broke the tie. On many occasions, the vice president has had the duty of finalizing his party's defeat, and his own on some of those occasions. Richard Nixon, Walter Mondale, Dan Quayle, Al Gore, Dick Cheney, Joe Biden, and Mike Pence all notably presided over counts that handed them, or their party, a loss.The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 made changes to the procedures laid out in the Electoral Count Act, along with adding clarifications on the role of the vice president. The proposal was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which passed during the final days of the 117th United States Congress.

The article was influential in the debate concerning the causes of British imperial expansion in the 19th-century which, since John A. Hobson's Imperialism: A Study (1902), had focused on economic motivation. Instead, Gallagher and Robinson claimed that the New Imperialism \u2013 \"the new spate of imperial expansion that gathered momentum from the 1880s\" \u2013 could be best characterised as a continuation of a longer-term policy begun in the 1850s in which informal empire, based on the principles of free trade, was favoured over formal imperial control unless circumstances made such rule impossible. As well as reigniting scholarly interest in theorizing New Imperialism, the article helped launch the Cambridge School of historiography.\nThe arguments proposed in the article were later developed in a full-length book, Africa and the Victorians (1961), in conjunction with Alice Denny. The book put forward a subtly different explanation for European expansion in Africa, built around geopolitics and a strategy of protecting British India from encroachment by other European powers. The strategic model and its relevance to East Africa was criticised for its limited documentary basis and sequential inconsistencies by John Darwin in 1997, a refutation that was further consolidated and contextualised by Jonas Gjers\u00f8 in 2015.Reviewing the debate from the end of the 20th century, historian  Martin Lynn argues that Gallagher and Robinson exaggerated its impact.

Local impediments to foreign inroads, the inhabitants' low purchasing power, the resilience of local manufacturing, and the capabilities of local entrepreneurs meant that these areas effectively resisted British economic penetration.\nThe idea that free-trade imperial states use informal methods to secure their expanding economic influence has attracted Marxist historiographers to use the theory to describe how the modern economic policies of the United States and the imperialist policies of Great Britain are essentially the same, in both motive and method.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "123_35401", "text": "The Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal covering political economy and the critical analysis of government policy.

He had recently completed the serialization of his romantic comedy Ten de Sh\u014dwaru Cupid in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump. Having felt somewhat intimidated by some of his more popular fellow authors during this manga's run, Togashi realized he would need to create a fighting manga to both gain popularity and write something he enjoyed. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and illustrate a new manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing YuYu Hakusho, he did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title \"How to be a Ghost\" while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed \"YuYu-Ki\" (Poltergeist Chronicles) for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. However, a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, so Togashi quickly created an alternative: \"YuYu Hakusho\" (Poltergeist Report). He commented that he could have used \"Den\" (Legend) or \"Monogatari\" (Story), but \"Hakusho\" (Report) was the first thing that came to his mind. He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. \"Yusuke Urameshi\" is a pun, \"Kazuma Kuwabara\" is a combination of two professional baseball players, and \"Hiei\" and \"Kurama\" are \"just names that popped into [Togashi's] head.\" When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.The manga's shift from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre after Yusuke's death and revival in the early chapters was planned by Togashi from the beginning. He took this idea from the series Kinnikuman, which began largely as a comedy before concentrating more on action. Togashi's intention was to establish the main characters and familiarize the reader with them before placing them in tense, physical conflicts. His editor at the time was nervous of him beginning the manga this way and recommended he transition to a battle-focused plot after about 30 chapters. YuYu Hakusho borrows many elements from Asian folklore, particularly Buddhist beliefs in the afterlife. Togashi came up with the concept of the Ningenkai (Human World), Reikai (Underworld), and Makai (Demon Plane) as being parallel planes of existence in the manga's universe. He thought of them as places that one could not easily travel between using modern technology, but rather as a spirit lacking a material body. However, the idea for the \"territory\" powers from the Sensui story arc was parodied from a separate, unnamed work by Yasutaka Tsutsui. For his drawing materials, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens throughout the creation of the series. While his style of artwork began with screentone, he gradually developed into minimalism. As the series progressed, he would draw figures and faces very detailed or \"cartoony, sketchy and jumping with action\" whenever he desired such effects.During the years he worked on YuYu Hakusho, Togashi would calculate the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own d\u014djinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on YuYu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at the climax of the Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. The editors of the publication tried to make Togashi reconsider cancelling Yu Yu Hakusho, though he justified his decision by stating that it would simply be replaced by another popular series. Togashi was relieved at the conclusion of the manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the YuYu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "1433_69372", "text": "YuYu Hakusho follows Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old street-brawling delinquent who, in an uncharacteristic act of altruism, is hit by a car and killed in an attempt to save a young boy by pushing him out of the way.

Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests. Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara.

Soon Yusuke is off on his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons: Hiei, Kurama, and Goki. Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique, the Rei Gun, a shot of aura or Reiki (\u970a\u6c17, Reiki, lit. \"Spirit Energy\") fired mentally from his index finger. He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged, female martial arts master Genkai.

Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, and a disguised Genkai, traverse through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro's owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win to create a large hole from the Human World to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through. With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process.\nAfter the tournament, Yusuke returns home but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui with the aid of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.\nAs they return to the Human World, Yusuke is stripped of his detective title in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the Human World. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes the initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated. Yusuke hopes a similar competition will be held every few years to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. \nTwo years later, Yusuke returns to the Human World while Hiei stays with Mukuro and protects humans who have accidentally wandered into the Demon Plane. After learning that King Enma was falsifying reports on demon activity against humans in order to justify keeping the two separated, Koenma takes over his father's position and allows access between the Demon Plane and Human World. Genkai dies and leaves her estate to the main characters. The story ends with Yusuke and his friends reuniting at a beach.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In particular it discusses the music of Jewish composers Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer, acknowledging its technical proficiency but criticizing it as lacking genuine artistic passion. According to Wagner, authentic art is rooted in immersion within the organic life of a culture, and Jews, indicated as being outsiders to this culture, are capable of only making artificial or superficial contributions.\nIt was first published under a pseudonym in the Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik (NZM) of Leipzig in September 1850. It was republished in 1869, this time bearing Wagner's name, with expanded commentary on the original publication's purpose, response and the purported negative impact on Wagner and his associate's careers.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "1433_69386", "text": "There is debate over the translation of the title, Das Judenthum in der Musik, into English. The article's first translator, William Ashton Ellis, gave it the title Judaism in Music. \"Judaism\" in modern English tends to refer to the Abrahamic religion of the Jews. \"Judenthum\" however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning, including the culture and social practices of the Jews. It also carried a pejorative sense associating Jews with money-making. Karl Marx in his 1843 essay On the Jewish Question uses the word in this sense, in which he associates Jews intrinsically with capitalist enterprise. Wagner also intended this latter dual meaning, given the context of the essay in which he uses \"Judenthum\" almost synonymously with \"commercialism\"; this usage is also reflected in his personal letters.Wagner's essay primarily attacks Jewish culture, artistic taste, and alleged economic power and commercialism, rather than the Jewish race or religion. In the essay Wagner speaks of the need to emancipate both Jews and non-Jews from \"Judenthum\". For this reason, alternative translations of the title have been given, including Jewishness in Music and Jewry in Music.The essay was written during his exile in Z\u00fcrich after participating in the May Uprising in Dresden, part of the Revolutions of 1848. It follows Art and Revolution and The Artwork of the Future in a series of polemical essays intended to provoke controversy and discussion over the purpose and future direction of European art. Wagner had a radical mindset at the time, and was formulating what would become his magnum opus, the 16-hour long music drama Der Ring des Nibelungen, with which he intended to revitalize German art and society, which he perceived to be in decline.\nIn these previous essays, Wagner criticized the perceived shallowness of the then-popular French grand opera, such as that of the celebrated Jewish composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. Wagner was emboldened to write again on the subject, this time from a fully antisemitic perspective, after learning of the great success of Meyerbeer's 1849 opera Le proph\u00e8te, and reading a series of essays written by his close associate Theodor Uhlig, criticizing Le proph\u00e8t as exemplifying inferior \"Hebrew artistic taste\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "1433_69391", "text": "Das Judenthum would not create the serious controversy Wagner sought to provoke until the 1950s and 1960s, when scholars began researching a possible link between Wagner and his works with the philosophy and policies of Nazi Germany, most notably the Final Solution resulting in the Holocaust.\nHitler was known to be an enthusiastic admirer of Wagner's music, and the music was frequently played during Nazi party rallies (along with the music of other German composers) as exemplifying German cultural supremacy. While Hitler owned several of Wagner's music manuscripts as prized posessions, there is no evidence Hitler and other Nazi leadership members read Das Judenthum or were even aware of its existence. As the essay was largely regarded as an embarrassment to the early Wagnerites, there was just one reprint of the essay in Weimar in 1914, before the Nazis came to power. During the Nazi era there were two further publications: in Berlin in 1934 and in Leipzig in 1939. None of these appear to have been large editions with significant readership.\nDespite the limited impact of the essay's publications on German cultural affairs, it has since served as an important document to understand the nature of Wagner's antisemitic worldview and whether this antisemitism is present in his stage works. Scholars such as Theodor Adorno have asserted that it is present, but this is strongly disputed by others. The topic remains under considerable debate in both academia and amongst the opera-going public. With a few controversial exceptions, Wagner has not been publically performed in what is today the modern state of Israel since 1938.\nSome writers such as Bryan Magee have sought to make a qualified defence of Wagner's originality of thought in Das Judenthum, despite acknowledging its malevolence. However, other scholars argue a more comprehensive consideration of the essay's contents weakens his argument. Music historians have written to debunk the anti-Jewish thesis and arguments appearing in Wagner's essay.", "hasanswer": false}]}

McTaggart (1866\u20131925). In the argument, first published as a journal article in Mind in 1908, McTaggart argues that time is unreal because our descriptions of time are either contradictory, circular, or insufficient. A slightly different version of the argument appeared in 1927 as one of the chapters in the second volume of McTaggart's greatest work, The Nature of Existence.The argument for the unreality of time is popularly treated as a stand-alone argument that does not depend on any significant metaphysical principles (e.g. as argued by C. D. Broad 1933 and L. O. Mink 1960). R. D. Ingthorsson disputes this, and argues that the argument can only be understood as an attempt to draw out certain consequences of the metaphysical system that McTaggart presents in the first volume of The Nature of Existence (Ingthorsson 1998 & 2016).\nIt is helpful to consider the argument as consisting of three parts. In the first part, McTaggart offers a phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time, in terms of the now famous A- and B-series (see below for detail). In the second part, he argues that a conception of time as only forming a B-series but not an A-series is an inadequate conception of time because the B-series does not contain any notion of change. The A-series, on the other hand, appears to contain change and is thus more likely to be an adequate conception of time. In the third and final part, he argues that the conception of time forming an A-series is contradictory and thus nothing can be like an A-series.

Around the time in which Sarrasine was published, Balzac experienced great success with another work, La Peau de Chagrin (1831). As his career began to take off and his publications began to accumulate, Balzac developed increasingly lavish living habits and frequently made impulsive purchases (such as new furniture for his apartment and a hooded white cashmere gown designed to be worn by a monk, which he wore at night while writing), likely to distance himself from his family's prior debt, which had resulted from his business as an editor and printer's liquidation.\nIn 1841, an ill Balzac reached an agreement with Furne & Co., Dubochet, Hetzel and Paulin to publish La Com\u00e9die humaine. In the 10 years that elapsed, Balzac had developed a political career, becoming heavily involved in high society, which influenced much of his writing.

Its chapters have been collected in 37 tank\u014dbon volumes as of November 2022. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\nHunter \u00d7 Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter \u00d7 Hunter.\nThe manga has been licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media since April 2005.

The \"\u00d7\" in the title is silent. As with his previous series, YuYu Hakusho, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens for his illustrations but began using an eMac to color them. Togashi uses few or no assistants in the manga's production; however, fellow manga artist and future wife Naoko Takeuchi assisted Togashi in adding screentone to single-color pages for the first volume. With the birth of their first son early in its publication, Togashi felt that this personal aspect of his life would be a great influence on his work, particularly the manga's theme of a young boy searching for his father.There have been several instances in which Togashi has apologized to readers in Shueisha's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump for low-quality artwork and promised to redraw portions of the chapters for their tank\u014dbon (collected volume) releases. In addition, the publication history of the Hunter \u00d7 Hunter manga has been plagued with hiatuses since 2006, in which serialized chapters would be separated by extended periods of time. After returning from a two-year-long hiatus in June 2014, and joining the English-language Weekly Shonen Jump lineup, the manga went on another just two months later. The series returned from this hiatus on April 18, 2016, however, just over two months later, Hunter \u00d7 Hunter began another hiatus on June 4, 2016. It came back on June 26, 2017, and just over two months later, on August 31, the series went on hiatus again, planning to return by the end of that year. The series came back on January 29, 2018, before going on hiatus again on April 9 of the same year. After a five-month hiatus, the manga resumed publication from September 22 to November 26, 2018, before entering another hiatus for four years, its longest one to date.In May 2022, Togashi created a Twitter account where he teased that the series would resume publication. In July 2022, Togashi revealed that he was unable to sit in a chair for two years due to his back and hip problems, but was able to resume drawing by doing so while laying down; in August of the same year, Togashi posted on Twitter that he decided to increase his staff, adding that chapter 399's background effects were done according to his request and that chapter 400 would move forward after Togashi hands in his specifications for it. The series resumed publication on October 24, 2022, after a three-year-and-eleven-month hiatus. On December 26, 2022, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus. The Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump editorial department published a letter which said that they had consulted with Togashi and decided that the manga should not follow a weekly serialized format going forward, and that once they know concrete details of its return and how it will be serialized, they will reveal the details in the magazine. On March 9, 2023, Togashi tweeted that chapter 401 had been completed, but the form of publication has not been decided at the time. On October 1 of the same year, Togashi made his first tweet in nearly seven months, which contained the phrase \"Start over\" in English, as well as an image depicting the bottom right corner of a page with a ruler below.In November 2023, on TV Asahi's variety show Iwakura and Yoshizumi Show, Togashi announced that he had planned four possible scenarios for the series' finale through a handwritten letter which was read aloud during the program. Only the fourth abandoned ending (\"ending D\") was revealed, stating that it could be considered the ending in case he dies before finishing the manga. This ending takes place after a time skip, years into the future, featuring Gon's granddaughter, Gin. Togashi expressed a desire to create a satisfying enough conclusion so he would not have to resort to endings A, B, or C. Togashi stated that the readers' reactions would be 80% positive on ending A, even split on ending B, and 90% negative on ending C. While acknowledging ending A as a \"safe\", noncontroversial option, Togashi personally preferred ending C, despite expecting significant criticism from fans.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "162_68811", "text": "The soundtrack to The Deer Hunter was released on audio CD on October 25, 1990.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Marcas is a novelette by French author Honor\u00e9 de Balzac first published in 1840. Set in contemporary Paris, it describes the rise and fall of a brilliant political strategist abandoned by the politicians he helps into power. Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France.\nBalzac was inspired to write the story after spotting the name \"Z. Marcas\" on a sign for a tailor's shop in Paris. It was published in July 1840, in the Revue Parisienne, a magazine he had founded that year. One year later, it appeared in a collection from various authors under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux (\"The Death of an Ambitious Man\"). Balzac later placed it in the Sc\u00e8nes de la vie politique section of his vast novel sequence La Com\u00e9die humaine.\nAlthough Z. Marcas features characters from other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism \u2013 both hallmarks of Balzac's style \u2013 it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership had led to mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were in danger of being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.\nThe story also explores Balzac's conviction that a person's name is a powerful indicator of his or her destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "1433_69554", "text": "Although Balzac's Revue Parisienne lasted only three issues, Z.

Marcas has a remarkable appearance which his neighbors notice immediately. The story's first line refers to his \"saisissant\" (\"striking\") appearance.

Ses cheveux ressemblaient \u00e0 une crini\u00e8re, son nez \u00e9tait court, \u00e9cras\u00e9, large et fendu au bout comme celui d'un lion, il avait le front partag\u00e9 comme celui d'un lion par un sillon puissant, divis\u00e9 en deux lobes vigoureux.\" (\"The animal for Marcas was the lion. His hair was like a mane, his nose was short and flat; broad and dented at the tip like a lion's; his brow, like a lion's, was strongly marked with a deep median furrow, dividing two powerful bosses.\")Marcas appears to be destined for greatness; he is described as having tremendous spirit, sound but speedy judgment, and comprehensive knowledge of public manners. His gaze has \"une puissance\" (\"a power\"), which he tries not to use, since it has brought him nothing but misery in the past. Despite these innate proficiencies, however, the political genius living in the students' midst requires their aid to dress himself when official company comes to call.The character of Z. Marcas nonetheless represents a fiery drive to succeed in the world of politics, an acute mind seeking to do good in the public sphere. One critic calls him \"ambition in its pure state\". Like other persons of genius in La Com\u00e9die humaine, Marcas is seen as a reflection of Balzac's own ego and desire. Like Marcas, the author dreamed of fame and positive influence; as Balzac believed himself to be, the character is dismissed and manipulated by mediocre minds.

Politicians, commentators, and activists widely cited the paper in political debates over the effectiveness of austerity in fiscal policy for debt-burdened economies. The paper argues that when \"gross external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP\", a country's annual growth declined by two percent, and \"for levels of external debt in excess of 90 percent\" GDP growth was \"roughly cut in half.\" Appearing in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the evidence for the 90%-debt threshold hypothesis provided support for pro-austerity policies.In 2013, academic critics accused Reinhart and Rogoff of employing methodology that suffered from 3 major errors; they asserted that the underlying data did not support the authors' conclusions. These critics held that the Reinhart\u2013Rogoff paper had led to unjustified adoption of austerity policies for countries with various levels of public debt.Further papers by Rogoff and Reinhart,\nand the International Monetary Fund, which were not found to contain similar errors, reached conclusions similar to the initial paper, though with much lower impact on GDP growth. The threshold hypothesis retains adherents as well as critics, who suggest that the thresholds in the relation between public debt and economic growth lack robustness, so a consensus on the 90%-threshold hypothesis in the relation between public debt and economic growth has been elusive.

Representative Ryan's \"Path to Prosperity\" reports (Ryan 2013 p. 78):\nA well-known study completed by economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart confirms this common-sense conclusion. The study found conclusive empirical evidence that gross debt (meaning all debt that a government owes, including debt held in government trust funds) exceeding 90 percent of the economy has a significant negative effect on economic growth.\nRR have clearly exerted a major influence in recent years on public policy debates over the management of government debt and fiscal policy more broadly. Their findings have provided significant support for the austerity agenda that has been ascendant in Europe and the United States since 2010.\nOlli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs, in his address to the International Labour Organization on April 9, 2013, used the Reinhart\u2013Rogoff paper to argue that \"public debt in Europe is expected to stabilise only by 2014 and to do so at above 90% of GDP. Serious empirical research has shown that at such high levels, public debt acts as a permanent drag on growth.\"British Member of Parliament George Osborne (who became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 2010) relied on the paper to portray excess debt as the universal cause of financial crises: \"As Rogoff and Reinhart demonstrate convincingly, all financial crises ultimately have their origins in one thing.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "1433_69599", "text": "The paper was published in an annual \"Papers and Proceedings\" edition of The American Economic Review that was not subject to the same peer-review standards that other editions use before publication. Reinhart and Rogoff (RR) did not publish the data sample upon which they based their conclusions, but they made it available upon request to Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin (HAP), who then closely examined the data used in the study.\nIn April 2013, HAP released a critique of the RR data analysis in the working paper \"Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff\", later published in the Cambridge Journal of Economics. They contend that the statistical analyses performed on the data in the original RR Excel spreadsheet (which were used to support the conclusions of the paper) were flawed: \"While using RR's working spreadsheet, we identified coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" Using RR's working spreadsheet, but correcting for the claimed errors, HAP found:When properly calculated, the average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not \u22120.1 percent as published in Reinhart and Rogoff. That is, contrary to RR, average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/GDP ratios are lower.\nHAP also argued that the sample was biased, claiming that RR selectively omitted data for Australia, Canada, and New Zealand for the early post-World War II period, which showed high growth despite large public debts, while including data for the United States for the same period that showed negative GDP growth, which Herndon attributed to demobilization of U.S. military personnel. Also, by using only one year's data for New Zealand, a negative 7.6% GDP growth in 1951, a year in which New Zealand's trade suffered from a major strike, the average central tendency of the available 5 years (1946\u20131949 and 1951) shifted from 2.6% to \u22127.6%.HAP concluded that the \"combination of the collapse of the empirical result that high public debt is inevitably associated with greatly reduced GDP growth and the weakness of the theoretical mechanism under current conditions... render the Reinhart and Rogoff point close to irrelevant for current public policy debate.\"RR published a lengthy, detailed response to HAP in The New York Times:\nHerndon, Ash and Pollin accurately point out the coding error that omits several countries from the averages in figure 2. Full stop. HAP are on point.... HAP go on to note some other missing debt data points [New Zealand], which they describe as \"selective omissions.\" This charge, which permeates through their paper, is one we object to in the strongest terms.... Data for New Zealand for the years around WWII had just been incorporated and we had not vetted the comparability and quality data with data for the more recent period.... They argue that we use an \"unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" In particular, for each bucket, we take average growth rates for each country and then take an average of the result. This seems perfectly natural to us, and hardly unconventional.\nEconomics professor L. Randall Wray criticized Reinhart and Rogoff for combining data \"across centuries, exchange rate regimes, public and private debt, and debt denominated in foreign currency as well as domestic currency,\" in addition to \"statistical errors,\" and for lacking a \"theory of sovereign currency\".Other critiques point out that any correspondence between debt levels and insufficient economic growth could just as easily be reversed: it is the weak economic growth that leads to the high debt levels. Others have argued that the relationship between debt and growth varies significantly between countries, meaning that an average \"rule\", such as that suggested by Reinhart and Rogoff, has little meaning or policy relevance.Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote in 2013:\nWhat the Reinhart-Rogoff affair shows is the extent to which austerity has been sold on false pretenses. For three years, the turn to austerity has been presented not as a choice but as a necessity. Economic research, austerity advocates insisted, showed that terrible things happen once debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P. But \"economic research\" showed no such thing; a couple of economists made that assertion, while many others disagreed.

Although the \"paradox of length\" was previously noted by Hugo Steinhaus, the first systematic study of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson, and it was expanded upon by Benoit Mandelbrot.The measured length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it and the degree of cartographic generalization. Since a landmass has features at all scales, from hundreds of kilometers in size to tiny fractions of a millimeter and below, there is no obvious size of the smallest feature that should be taken into consideration when measuring, and hence no single well-defined perimeter to the landmass. Various approximations exist when specific assumptions are made about minimum feature size.\nThe problem is fundamentally different from the measurement of other, simpler edges. It is possible, for example, to accurately measure the length of a straight, idealized metal bar by using a measurement device to determine that the length is less than a certain amount and greater than another amount\u2014that is, to measure it within a certain degree of uncertainty. The more precise the measurement device, the closer results will be to the true length of the edge. When measuring a coastline, however, the closer measurement does not result in an increase in accuracy\u2014the measurement only increases in length; unlike with the metal bar, there is no way to obtain an exact value for the length of the coastline.\nIn three-dimensional space, the coastline paradox is readily extended to the concept of fractal surfaces, whereby the area of a surface varies depending on the measurement resolution.", "hasanswer": true}]}

In 1952, reviewing The Old Man and the Sea\u2014for which Hemingway would win the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature\u2014The New York Times said of \"Big Two-Hearted River\" that it was one of the \"best and happiest of his early short stories\".Carlos Baker views the stories of In Our Time as a remarkable achievement for a young writer. Joseph Flora described \"Big Two-Hearted River\" as \"unquestionably the most brilliant of the collection In Our Time\". The piece has become one of Hemingway's most anthologized stories, and one of a handful subject to serious literary criticism since its publication, and belongs in the canon of 20th-century American literature. Beegel writes that it is considered \"among the best\" American short stories, along with Stephen Crane's \"The Open Boat\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Young Goodman Brown\" and Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\".According to Benson, despite Pound and Joyce's influence, Hemingway \"carried the new form into the position of dominant influence\" for much of the 20th century.

The story explores the destructive qualities of war which is countered by the healing and regenerative powers of nature. When it was published, critics praised Hemingway's sparse writing style and it became an important work in his canon.\nThe story is one of Hemingway's earliest pieces to employ his Iceberg Theory of writing; a modernist approach to prose in which the underlying meaning is hinted at, rather than explicitly stated. \"Big Two-Hearted River\" is almost exclusively descriptive and intentionally devoid of plot. Hemingway was influenced by the visual innovations of C\u00e9zanne's paintings and adapted the painter's idea of presenting background minutiae in lower focus than the main image.

He became friends with and was influenced by modernist writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. The year 1923 saw his first published work, a slim volume titled Three Stories and Ten Poems, followed the next year by another collection of short vignettes, in our time (without capitals).  Hoping to have in our time published in New York, in 1924 he began writing stories to add to the volume with \"Big Two-Hearted River\" planned as the final piece. He started writing the story in May of that year but did not finish until September as he spent the summer helping Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford launch the journal the transatlantic review.\n\"Big Two-Hearted River\" has strong autobiographical elements. During World War I, Hemingway signed on as a member of the Red Cross at age 19,  and was sent to the Italian Front at Fossalta as an ambulance driver. On his first day there, he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion, about which he later wrote in Death in the Afternoon: \"I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments\". A few days later, on July 8, 1918, he was severely wounded when a mortar bomb exploded between his legs. He was sent to a hospital in Milan where he recuperated for six months; after his return home, he went on a week-long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near Seney in Michigan's Upper Peninsula\u2014a trip that became the inspiration for \"Big Two-Hearted River\". The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns, suggesting that in an early version more characters were included, but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed\u2014leaving Nick alone in the woods.Hemingway gave the draft to Stein to read in October 1925; she advised cutting the 11-page section of stream-of-consciousness reminiscences written from Nick's point of view. Hemingway took her advice, reworked the ending, and wrote to his editor: \"I have discovered that the last eleven pages of the last story in the book are crap\". Biographer James Mellow writes that at this early stage in his career Hemingway had not developed his talent enough to fully and capably integrate self-reflections in his writing; Mellow also believes the deleted passage might have been a \"tour-de-force\" had it been written at a more mature period in Hemingway's development.In January 1925, while wintering in Schruns, Austria, waiting for a response from query letters written to friends and publishers in America, Hemingway submitted the story to be published in his friend Ernest Walsh's newly established literary magazine This Quarter. Walsh bought it for 1,000 French francs, the highest payment Hemingway had yet received for a piece of fiction. On October 5, 1925, the expanded edition of In Our Time (with conventional capitalization in the title) was published by Boni & Liveright in New York. The last story in the volume was the two-part \"Big Two-Hearted River\". The piece was later included in Hemingway's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, The Nick Adams Stories (1972) and The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vig\u00eda Edition (1987).

It has a length of three minutes and thirty-four seconds. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the song does not resemble Native American music. Nonetheless, adding a twist of creative license, the sentiment of First Nation Peoples' relationship to the land and its animals, as well as the contrast between colonialist and indigenous mindsets, are strikingly well portrayed, considering the lyricist's non-indigenous background. The song is about animism and having respect for nature. It features lyrics about \"painting with all the colors of the wind\" and listening to \"the voices of the mountains sing.\"Madhurya Gajula of The Odyssey Online opined that the song's lyrics about nature's interconnectivity bears similarity to transcendentalism, specifically the philosophy of Henry David Thoreau; similarly, Justyna Fruzi\u0144ska wrote in Emerson Goes to the Movies: Individualism in Walt Disney Company's Post-1989 Animated Films that the lyrics of \"Colors of the Wind\" are reminiscent of the writings of transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson and New Age spirituality.  The staff of Billboard likened the lyrics of \"Colors of the Wind\" to a public service announcement about embracing diversity. Sonically, Rita Kempley of The Washington Post found \"Colors of the Wind\" akin to music from Busby Berkeley films and The Little Mermaid (1989).The song also features a mention of a \"blue corn moon\"; there is no such thing according to Charisse, although in general the blue-green distinction is ambiguous in many languages. Responding to a fan inquiry, Schwartz admitted that he coined the phrase after reading a Native American love poem which read: \"I will come to you in the moon of green corn\"; Native Americans referred to months as \"moons\" and named them after events that happened seasonally, such as the sprouting of green corn. This system was subsequently appropriated by colonists, and a modified version appears in the Farmers' Almanac. Schwartz disliked the phrase \"green corn moon\" due to the sound of the word \"green\" and because he felt it might evoke the urban legend that the Moon is made of green cheese. Instead, Schwartz used the phrase \"blue corn moon\" as it reminded him of both blue moons and blue corn tortillas. Schwartz thought that the phrase might evoke the Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands rather than the Algonquian people depicted in Pocahontas, but was satisfied with it anyway.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "1433_69748", "text": "Following the death of Howard Ashman, the Walt Disney Company wanted to find another musician to collaborate with Alan Menken on his scores for animated films.

Schwartz had never considered working in the film industry, but agreed to do so nonetheless. Schwartz did not feel he was well-suited to the job.Schwartz wanted to write a song for the film wherein Pocahontas confronts the Eurocentrism of John Smith. \"Colors of the Wind\" was the first song written for Pocahontas. According to Schwartz, the song \"influence[d] the development of the rest of the film.\" Schwartz said that \"a story-board outline was in place before we wrote [the track]. This is often the process in animation, at least as I've experienced it, where everybody works from an outline and each succeeding piece of material, whether it is a song or drawings, influences the next.\" The track was inspired by Native American poetry, music and folklore, as well as a now-debunked  letter that Schwartz believed was sent to the United States Congress by Chief Seattle regarding humanity's relationship with nature but was in fact a fabrication. Part of the letter reads: \"The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also received his last sigh. The wind also gives our children the spirit of life. So if we sell our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow flowers.\" This portion of the letter inspired the song's title, which Schwartz liked because he saw it as paradoxical and thought-provoking.Schwartz also drew inspiration for \"Colors of the Wind\" from the music of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick, as it deals with issues of prejudice. Menken said that while \"Colors of the Wind\" was \"born out of the modality of Native American music...it quickly moved to its own place, which is hard to define.\" Menken has noted that the song lacks humor, which he and Schwartz attempted to inject into Pocahontas and failed. Initially, the final lines of the song were \"For your life's an empty hull/till you get it through your skull/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Menken disapproved of these lyrics and asked Schwartz to rewrite them; Schwartz changed the lines to \"You can own the Earth, and still/all you'll own is earth until/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Schwartz preferred the altered lyrics. Schwartz said that this incident taught him the lesson: \"If your collaborator is unhappy, it's probably because [the song] needs to be better,\" adding that he may not have won an Academy Award if he did not change the lyrics. Menken views \"Colors of the Wind\" as one of the most important songs he has written. Schwartz believed that the Walt Disney Company would reject \"Colors of the Wind\" for being philosophical and different from previous Disney songs. Judy Kuhn sang the song to help \"pitch\" Schwartz's score to Disney, and the studio embraced the track.

It was published originally in The Wall Street Journal on December 13, 1994, as a response to criticism of the book The Bell Curve by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, which appeared earlier the same year. The statement defended Herrnstein and Murray's controversial claims about race and intelligence, including the claim that average intelligence quotient (IQ) differences between racial and ethnic groups may be at least partly genetic in origin. This view is now considered discredited by mainstream science.The statement was drafted by Gottfredsen, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Delaware. It was sent to 131 researchers whom Gottfredsen described as \"experts in intelligence and allied fields\". Of these, 52 signed the statement, 48 returned the request with an explicit refusal to sign, and 31 ignored the request.According to a 1996 response by former American Psychological Association president Donald Campbell, only ten of those who signed were actual experts in intelligence measurement.

It is based on weighted votes from selected musicians, critics, and industry figures. The first list was published in a special issue of the magazine in 2003 and a related book in 2005.Critics have accused the lists of lending disproportionate weight to artists of particular races and genders. In the original list, most of the selections were albums by white male rock musicians, with the top position held by the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). In 2012, Rolling Stone published a revised edition, drawing on the original and a later survey of albums released up until the early 2000s.Another updated edition of the list was published in 2020, with 269 entries not in either of the two previous editions. It was based on a new survey and did not consider the surveys conducted for the 2003 and 2012 lists. The 2020 list featured more artists of color and female artists, topped by Marvin Gaye's What's Going On (1971). It received similar criticisms as the previous lists. Another revision was published in 2023.Since 2020 Rolling Stone has also produced a weekly podcast called Rolling Stone\u2019s 500 Greatest Albums, which, according to magazine, is based on an \"updated version of Rolling Stone\u2019s 500 Greatest Albums list\".

Following the publicity surrounding the list, rock critic Jim DeRogatis, a former Rolling Stone editor, published Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics in 2004. The book featured a number of critics arguing against the high evaluation of various \"great\" albums, many of which had been included in the list.Jonny Sharp, a contributor to NME's own 500 greatest albums list, described the 2012 Rolling Stone list as a \"soulless, canon-centric [list] of the same tired old titles\", adding: \"looking at their 500, when the only album in their top 10 less than 40 years old is London Calling, I think I prefer the NME's less critically-correct approach.\"Responding to the 2020 revision, Consequence of Sound's Alex Young wrote that the lesser representation of white male rock musicians was \"the biggest takeaway\". According to CNN's Leah Asmelash, \"The change represents a massive shift for the magazine, moving to recognize more contemporary albums and a wider range of tastes.\" Conversely, Jonathan McNamara of The Japan Times criticized the list for underrepresenting Asian and non-Anglophone artists, stating that \"It seems a shame then that Rolling Stone's musical brain trust of writers and industry contributors [...] didn't take the opportunity to hold up albums from the world's non-English-speaking artists and bands.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "50_21094", "text": "Larkin, Colin, ed.
