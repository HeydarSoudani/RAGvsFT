Boris Karloff, who delivered a strong performance in the stage play, is recast here as Galloway. This film accelerated his career: though appearing in dozens of pictures during the 1920s, he had mostly been cast in bit parts.\nThe Criminal Code was the first of Hawks' four collaborations with Harry Cohn, the others being Twentieth Century (1934), Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and His Girl Friday (1940). It is Hawks' only picture with Frank Fouce, who produced only five films. Hawks worked with screenwriter Seton Miller several times in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Only Angels Have Wings, Rio Bravo, 1959). This is most apparent in the scene in which Brady starts his first day of work as warden, greeted by a prison yard full of men booing him as if they were but one man.

Francisco Goya is a renowned painter who does portraits as the Official Court Painter to Spain's royalty, among others.\nThe Spanish Inquisition is disturbed by some of Goya's work. Brother Lorenzo Casamares defends him and later hires him to paint his portrait.  Lorenzo says that his works are not evil, but simply depict evil. He recommends that the Church/Inquisition step up against anti-Catholic practices, and he is given power to intensify the Inquisition.\nWhile posing for Goya, Lorenzo sees a painting and asks about the model he uses, In\u00e9s, the daughter of rich merchant Tom\u00e1s Bilbat\u00faa. Later, In\u00e9s is spotted in a tavern by Holy Office spies (trained by Lorenzo) declining a dish of pork.  She is summoned by the Inquisition and arrested on charges of \"Judaizing\" by refusing pork. She is stripped naked and tortured by strappado (put to The Question) into a confession and then imprisoned.\nHer father begs Goya for help, who in turn asks Lorenzo to learn about In\u00e9s's situation. Lorenzo finds her naked in the dungeon, feigning to help her and pass a message to her family. He covers her up and offers to pray with her, but struggles with his desire for her. She prays with him at his request.\nLater, at a dinner in Bilbat\u00faa's home where he and Goya are guests, Lorenzo defends strappado (The Question). He argues that if the accused is innocent, God will give him or her the strength to deny guilt; therefore, a person who confesses under duress must be guilty. Bilbat\u00faa does not agree and argues that people will confess to anything under torture, to which Goya also agrees.\nBilbat\u00faa then draws up a document which says that Lorenzo confesses to being a monkey, and with the help of his sons, tortures Lorenzo in the same manner, causing him to break down and sign it. Bilbat\u00faa promises to destroy the document if In\u00e9s is released. He gives Lorenzo a large gold 'donation' for the Church in the hopes it may persuade the Holy Office to release her.\nLorenzo pleads for In\u00e9s, and the Inquisitor-General Father Gregorio accepts the money, but refuses her release, since she has confessed. Lorenzo again visits In\u00e9s, offering to pray with her, but instead rapes her. Later, her father brings the document to the king, Charles IV who is amused at reading it and promises to look into In\u00e9s' situation. The document is an embarrassment to the Holy Office, and Lorenzo flees when they come to arrest him. His portrait is confiscated and publicly burned in effigy.\nFifteen years pass, and a now deaf Goya is at the height of his creativity. The French army invades Spain, abolishes the Inquisition and sets the prisoners free. Lorenzo had fled to France, and is now a fanatical adherent of the French Revolution. He has become Napoleon's chief prosecutor against his Inquisition ex-colleagues. This twist in Lorenzo's allegiance may have been inspired by Juan Antonio Llorente. A French show trial court convicts and sentences the Inquisitor-General to death.\nLeft in the dungeons over the years, In\u00e9s has been losing her sanity. She gave birth to a daughter who was taken away at birth. Upon returning home and finding her family dead, In\u00e9s turns to Goya for help in finding her child. Lorenzo is the father, which is embarrassing for him, and he sends In\u00e9s to an insane asylum. Lorenzo questions the condemned Inquisitor-General, who tells him that a child born in the dungeon would've been placed at an orphanage. Lorenzo finds her and learns from the nuns that his daughter, Alicia, had run away several years prior.\nWhile sketching in Garden Park, Goya notices a prostitute named Alicia who looks just like In\u00e9s. He goes to Lorenzo and asks for In\u00e9s, so he can reunite her with her daughter. Lorenzo becomes worried and secretly visits Alicia at the park, offering to pay her passage to America if she leaves Spain. She refuses, calling him insane. Meanwhile, Goya visits the asylum where Lorenzo had stashed In\u00e9s and bribes the director to release her. He attempts to bring her to see Alicia at a tavern where prostitutes gather. As he tries to persuade Alicia, soldiers (on Lorenzo's orders) raid the place and arrest all the prostitutes. Goya learns that Lorenzo plans to sell them as slaves to America.\nSoon after, the deluded In\u00e9s wanders into the tavern and finds a baby left by its mother, who was taken in the raid. She is elated and steals the baby away thinking it is her lost child.\nThe British are easily defeating the French with help from the Spanish populace.  They come over a hill and charge the wagons transporting the prostitutes. The French escort abandons the wagons, and Alicia catches the eye of a British officer. Lorenzo is caught fleeing the invasion, and Spain has reinstated the Inquisition.  Lorenzo is sentenced to death, with the Inquisitor-General reversing their earlier roles. He urges Lorenzo to repent as he is taken to the execution wearing a sanbenito with painted flames, indicating that he is sentenced to hell.\nOn the scaffold, Lorenzo sees Alicia, next to the British officer, scoffing at him. He also sees Goya sketching the scene at a distance. In\u00e9s is also in the crowd, and she calls to Lorenzo, showing him the baby she thinks is their daughter. Refusing to repent despite pleas from his former colleagues, Lorenzo is garroted. The film ends with a cart taking Lorenzo's body away, escorted by In\u00e9s still carrying the child, with Goya following behind and calling for her. She glances back with a smile, but continues to accompany Lorenzo's body.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost \"in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they kind of take them, effectively on a deep dive.\" When Sbarge read the script for \"That Still Small Voice\", he was worried about \"treading into people's imaginations,\" but ultimately decided that \"they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell.\"Believing that his character was \"sort of a surrogate father figure\" to Henry, Sbarge admitted that the script \"made me weep because what they came up with is so lovely and magical and delightful.\" Referring to his character's storyline as a hero's journey, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy \u2013 \"what you get to see on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing.\" The episode featured guest stars Harry Groener and Carolyn Hennesy as Jiminy's parents Martin and Myrna. Groener had previously worked with Espenson in the third season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

It is one of The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's favorite episodes of the earlier seasons because he thought it took the show to another level. Meyer said he has a \"deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general,\" which affected the way he wrote the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons since the start of the show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show. Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier. Jean said \"one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough',\" and Reiss added that \"we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this.\"Wes Archer directed \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\", which was one of the first episodes to feature the Simpson family traveling to a real-life location. Because much of the episode takes place outside of Springfield, new background and character designs had to be animated. The Simpson family visits several real-life landmarks in Washington, which the animators were able to draw with the help of photographs from the animation studio's library. The Simpsons director David Silverman grew up in the Washington area so he was able to help out with the designs. Marge's voice actor, Julie Kavner, said she loved the charm of the family \"just being on a trip and experiencing the hotel room they're staying at, and the integrity of Bart's character. You know, you just want to kill him for doing all those tricks and pranks.\" Jean believes this is one of the secrets of the show's success, the fact that it is about a family and the writers can use experiences from their own or their family's life as an inspiration in their writing. He thought \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" was a perfectly constructed episode in that sense. This episode also featured the debut of George H.W. Bush (the then-incumbent U.S. president), voiced by Harry Shearer, who would reappear as a recurring character throughout the years most notably in the season 7 episode \"Two Bad Neighbors\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "58_61063", "text": "\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" is the second episode of the third season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 1991. In the episode, Lisa wins a patriotic essay contest about the United States. She and her family attend the contest finals in Washington, D.C., where she is dismayed after watching a congressman accept a bribe. Lisa loses the contest when she pens a scathing screed condemning the government system, but the corrupt congressman is jailed and removed from office, restoring her faith in government.\nThe episode was written by George Meyer and directed by Wes Archer. It was the first episode for which Al Jean and Mike Reiss served as show runners. It features multiple references to the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the White House, the Watergate Hotel, the Jefferson Memorial, the Washington Monument, the National Air and Space Museum and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\nThe episode acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.9, and was the third highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. It received mostly positive reviews from television critics, who praised the episode for its satire on American politics. The timber industry criticized the scene in which Lisa witnesses a timber industry lobbyist offering a bribe to the congressman to allow loggers to raze the Springfield Forest.

Bitzer also wrote that The Simpsons, through \"skillful\" use of satire, demonstrates with this episode \"insights into the underlying political culture and public opinion of the United States' governing system (and, more broadly, society at large)\". In his book Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, Paul Arthur Cantor said he was amazed by how far the episode was \"willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics\". He said it \"attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions.\" When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims \"The system works!\" Benedict Anderson wrote in the book The Spectre of Comparisons that series creator Matt Groening \"assumes that his tickled audience is confident that the system barely works [...] So why does he need to show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head? Probably because he, too, wishes to be seen as giving America another chance. Mr. Lisa guarantees his good intentions.\"G\u00fcnter Beck, a lecturer for the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) at the Haifa Center for German and European Studies at the University of Haifa in Israel, compared Lisa's role in the episode to the nineteenth-century American poet and philosopher Henry David Thoreau. He writes that Lisa stands up against the public's indifference towards the political system that Thoreau criticized, and comments that the emphasis should be \"on the brave moral decision to stand up for principles and against the broad public. By this courageous act, 'to do what is right', an individual could save the well-being of the whole community. And indeed, Lisa's bravery is the impulse for the state's representatives to carry out their democratic obligations, so she can gladly notice 'The system works!' \u2014 her trust in democracy and its institutions is restored. Thoreau on the other hand, had no lasting trust in the system but only in the people themselves and in the individual's capacity to realize development and democracy.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Blitz had previously directed \"The Convict\" and \"The Negotiation\". The episode was written by B. J. Novak, who plays temporary worker turned corporate manager Ryan Howard. Novak was originally going to name the episode \"Michael Dating\", but the title could have potentially been a spoiler because fans with DVRs would have seen it before \"Dinner Party\" aired and deduced that Michael and Jan's relationship had completely fallen apart. For a while, \"Parking\" was going to be the title, but even that was decided against because that refers to the subplot, and also because it was generic and boring even by the show's no-frills-titles standard. Eventually, someone suggested \"Chair Model\", which was eventually kept as the name. Originally, Novak wrote Jim putting Dwight through a \"phony management training\", but NBC pointed out that it felt like the writers had done it before even though they had not. As a group, the writers tried to think of a new idea for the plot; they considered having Pam move in with Jim, but they thought that first the two should be engaged.There was an auditioning process for both the chair model (Deborah Shoshlefski played by April Eden) and the young blond woman whom Michael sees in the coffee shop. According to Novak, the chair model was supposed to be \"pretty\" and \"perhaps even prettier than your average model\", but more of just an \"average single girl\", because the episode is more about Michael wanting to start dating again than the model herself.  In the scene with the \"Five Families\", one of the actors, Paul Faust was the only first-time actor. Faust is the cousin of writer Paul Lieberstein, and had been on a tour of the set and talked to many of the writers. He made a good impression and so the character of \"Cool Guy Paul\" was based on him. The day before they were scheduled to shoot, the show still had not cast anyone for the role, so they called Paul in New York City and had him read the lines into a camera and e-mail to them. In less than an hour, Faust had landed the part and was flown out to Los Angeles.Although Novak wrote the majority of the episode, Jennifer Celotta and Paul Lieberstein were actually the ones who came up with the graveyard scene in the end. The original song for Michael to sing was going to be a parody of \"Candle in the Wind\" by Elton John. Elton John however, refused to give The Office permission to use the song, because 30 Rock had requested permission for a parody of \"Candle in the Wind\" that offended Elton John, and he did not want to have his song parodied again.

No one in the office wants to set up any of their friends with Michael, but when Michael learns that the chair model had died in a car crash some time ago, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) takes pity and sets him up on a blind date with her landlady (Brooke Dillman).

It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on December 16, 2001.Before returning to work full-time on The Simpsons, Jean had worked on a television series called Teen Angel together with Mike Reiss and Freiberger. While working on Teen Angel, Freiberger suggested that, if Jean was ever to run The Simpsons, he should hire Freiberger as a writer on the series. For the thirteenth season, Jean became show runner and assigned Freiberger to write the episode. Freiberger wrote the first draft as a freelance script at his parents' barn in Pennsylvania, and when he returned to the writing staff to rewrite the story, Freiberger took so many notes that the script became 106 pages long. As a result, Freiberger spent more time editing down the script rather than writing it. The episode's main plot, in which Lisa becomes a Buddhist, was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand Lisa's personality. When he pitched the plot idea to the Simpsons writing staff, they became concerned about the episode's originality. They argued that the series had already explored religious themes in earlier episodes, but Jean assured them that the episode would be about Lisa first-and-foremost, rather than Buddhism. Unlike several other episodes in the series in which a character undergoes a change in their personality, Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode, much like her conversion to vegetarianism in \"Lisa the Vegetarian\".Freiberger pitched the subplot involving the model rockets in the beginning of the episode. He based it on a real-life experience, in which he, as a child, accidentally launched a model rocket into a window in his house. A scene from this subplot was removed from the episode following the September 11 attacks. The scene would show a man named Hassan Jay Salam being arrested by policemen (who tells them to call his cousin Casey Kasem), who think the rocket Bart and Homer launched was launched by him (The rocket bears the abbreviation HJS, which stands for Homer J Simpson). After the attacks, the scene was considered too offensive by the Fox censors, so the scene was removed. Originally, the subplot would involve Marge trying to get Homer to build model rockets with Bart. Homer would not want to at first, but after Marge convinces him, he would soon get more into it than Bart. The plot idea was encouraged by some of the writers who thought that Marge had \"gotten short shrift,\" and, according to Freiberger, Marge would have had a \"really big part motivating the story\" had the subplot remained intact.\nThe renovated church in the episode is built like a mall; several stores and merchandising is located inside, and Reverend Lovejoy plugs products and television programs during his sermons. The scene is used to satirize the so-called \"megachurches\" and the commercialization sometimes associated with these institutions. The episode also argues that, even if Christmas has lost most of its meaning, it is more important to \"keep these thoughts to oneself in order to make the family happy.\" It also comments on what the writers believe to be the \"all or nothing, we're right, you're all going to hell mentality\" of some Christian movements. Even though \"She of Little Faith\" is a Christmas episode, the holiday is not mentioned until the episode's third act. Jean stated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode that the writers did not want to make a conventional Christmas episode, and instead wanted to \"slide into\" the subject.The episode features actor Richard Gere as himself. Gere agreed to guest star under three conditions, the first being that Buddhism should be portrayed accurately, the second, that Lisa remain a Buddhist for the rest of the series, and his third and strongest request being that Lisa should say \"Free Tibet\" in the episode. Jean agreed, but Gere ended up with the line. However, Lisa did yell out \"Free Tibet\" in an episode in the following season. Gere's lines were recorded in New York City by Jean who, in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, stated that Gere was \"great\" and that he \"didn't mind being made fun of\" in the episode.

The series' penultimate episode, it was written by Tony Barwick and first broadcast on 5 May 1968 on ATV London.Set in 2068, the series depicts a \"war of nerves\" between Earth and the Mysterons: a hostile race of Martians with the ability to create functioning copies of destroyed people or objects and use these reconstructions to carry out specific acts of aggression against humanity. Earth is defended by a military organisation called Spectrum, whose top agent, Captain Scarlet, was murdered by the Mysterons and replaced with a reconstruction that later broke free of their control. The double of Scarlet has powers of self-repair that enable him to recover from injuries that would be fatal to any other person, which make him Spectrum's greatest asset in its fight against the Mysterons.\n\"Attack on Cloudbase\" begins with Spectrum fighter pilot Symphony Angel being forced to eject into the Sahara when her aircraft is damaged. Later, a fleet of Mysteron spacecraft enter Earth's atmosphere and launch a devastating assault on Spectrum's airborne headquarters, Cloudbase. Filmed in late 1967, the episode underwent a number of script changes prior to shooting. Gerry Anderson chose Ken Turner to direct due to its unusual nature of the story. The episode presented Century 21's special effects team with several technical challenges, including a scene in which a miniature Angel aircraft overflies the puppet of Symphony Angel in the same shot. For the attack sequence, only a small number of spacecraft models were made; flashing light bulbs were placed in the backdrop as a cost-effective way to create the illusion of a larger fleet. Series composer Barry Gray wrote a full score after Anderson decided that none of the incidental music in Century 21's library suited the episode's grim tone.\nCritical response to \"Attack on Cloudbase\" has been mostly positive, with one commentator naming it the best episode of Captain Scarlet. Some criticism has been directed at its ending plot twist. Anderson, who likened the episode to a black comedy, praised Barwick for his \"humanised\" writing of the puppet characters.

However, in an act of mercy, the Mysterons use their powers to reverse time, leaving Cloudbase and its personnel intact. These changes were poorly received by fans of the original episode.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "58_61232", "text": "\"Attack on Cloudbase\" was one of the last Captain Scarlet episodes to be filmed. It was directed by Ken Turner, whose style Gerry Anderson thought best suited the episode's \"more bizarre\" tone. As originally scripted, Captain Magenta's role was to be played by a Spectrum officer codenamed Captain Sienna. This character was replaced with Magenta to avoid the cost of making a new sienna-coloured Spectrum uniform.Filming began on 25 October 1967, less than three weeks before Joe 90, Century 21's next series, entered production. To avoid overworking the designers, who were busy preparing for the new series, the episode was devised as a bottle show to reduce the number of puppets and sets required: unique among Captain Scarlet episodes, it features no characters other than the regular cast and was filmed mostly on existing sets. The previously unseen Cloudbase Radar Room was created using walls and props that were originally built for Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and earlier Captain Scarlet episodes. \"Attack on Cloudbase\" is also one of only two episodes (the other being \"Flight to Atlantica\") to feature all of the regular cast, though not all of them have speaking parts.\nThe scenes of Symphony Angel in the desert and the Mysterons attacking Cloudbase presented a number of challenges for Century 21's special effects department, headed by Derek Meddings. A scene in which Symphony looks up as Destiny Angel's fighter flies past her required close collaboration between the puppet operators and the effects crew, the former keeping the puppet under control while the latter moved the scale model across the set. The Mysteron spacecraft were modelled on \"flying saucer\" UFOs commonly reported during the 1960s. To make the spacecraft appear to spin in the moonlight, Meddings added \"veins\" to each model to reflect the lighting in the studio. Due to a shortage of model operators on set, the models were flown only in the foreground; flashing light bulbs were fitted to the backdrop to give the impression of a larger fleet.Actress Liz Morgan, who voiced Destiny and Rhapsody Angels, was overcome with emotion at one point during the dialogue-recording session: \"It was a moment when Destiny was very worried about Captain Scarlet and she was making impassioned pleas for him. Well, I started to cry, and immediately a voice came down from the recording booth and [producer] Reg Hill, who was directing that particular week, said, 'No, Liz, love. Do it again, love. Puppets don't cry!'\" Just before Cloudbase hits the ground, Colonel White is shown standing to attention and saluting in a spiralling freeze-frame shot. Anderson based this on maritime tradition, stating that he wanted the audience to see White \"[going] down like the captain of a big ship.\"\"Attack on Cloudbase\" is one of only a few Captain Scarlet episodes to have its own score instead of using incidental music recycled from a track library. Series composer Barry Gray devised the score after Anderson decided that nothing in Century 21's musical archive suited the dark nature of the plot. Performed by a 14-member band, it was the penultimate score to be produced for Captain Scarlet and was recorded on 3 December 1967 in a four-hour studio session. The CD of the series soundtrack includes pieces from \"Attack on Cloudbase\" titled \"Desert Symphony\" and \"The Mysterons Attack!\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Its crew\u2014Captain Miller, second-in-command Lieutenant Starck, pilot Smith, medical technician Peters, engineer Ensign Justin, doctor D.J., and rescue technician Cooper\u2014is joined by Dr. William Weir, the Event Horizon's designer. He briefs them on the ship's experimental gravity drive with a simple visualization of how it folds space-time. The distress signal consists of a series of screams and howls, but D.J. believes he hears the Latin phrase \"Liberate me\" (\"Save me\").\nUpon boarding the Event Horizon, the crew finds evidence of a massacre. As they search for survivors, the ship's gravity drive activates and briefly pulls Justin into a portal while also causing a shock wave that damages the Lewis and Clark. The crew are forced to board the Event Horizon while Justin emerges in a catatonic state. Smith and Cooper are sent on a spacewalk to repair the hull of the Lewis and Clark.\nThe crew begins experiencing hallucinations corresponding to their fears and regrets. Miller sees a subordinate he was forced to abandon to his death; Peters sees her son with his legs covered in bloody lesions; Weir sees an eyeless vision of his late wife urging him to join her. Justin attempts suicide by decompression, but he is saved by Miller. The crew places Justin in stasis. They discover a video log of the Event Horizon's crew fornicating and mutilating each other shortly after first engaging the gravity drive. The log ends with a shot of the Event Horizon's captain, holding his own eyes gouged from their sockets and speaking the Latin phrase from the earlier distress call. D.J. translates the complete phrase as \"Libera te tutemet ex inferis\" (\"Save yourself from hell\").Weir explains that the ship's drive opened a gateway to a hellish dimension (implied to be Hell) outside the known universe, and that the Event Horizon has attained sentience. Miller decides to destroy it. He orders an evacuation while Peters is lured to her death by a hallucination of her son. Weir, who has gouged out his own eyes and is possessed by the evil presence, uses an explosive device to destroy the Lewis and Clark which kills Smith and blasts Cooper into space. Weir kills D.J. by vivisecting him and corners Starck on the bridge. Miller confronts Weir, who overpowers him and initiates a 10-minute countdown to activate the gravity drive and return to the other dimension.\nCooper uses his space suit's oxygen supply to propel himself back to the ship and appears at the bridge window. Weir shoots at him, shattering the window, causing Weir to be blown into space by the decompression. Miller, Starck and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the ship's bridge. With their own ship destroyed, Miller plans to split the Event Horizon in two with explosives and use its forward section as a lifeboat. He is attacked by hallucinations which turn out to be the resurrected and further mutilated Weir. Miller fights him off and detonates the explosives, sacrificing himself.\nThe gravity drive activates, pulling the ship's stern section into a black hole. Starck and Cooper enter stasis beside a comatose Justin and wait to be rescued. Seventy-two days later, the wreckage of the Event Horizon is boarded by a rescue party who discover the survivors in stasis.

It was originally going to be named \"Homer vs. the 8th Commandment\", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast to feel as if all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment (\"thou shall not steal\"), which is one of the Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that \"whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this [episode], where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences.\"The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss feels that episodes such as \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" are his favorite episodes to write because they have a \"solid theme or an issue\" (in this case, religion and theft), that one can \"discuss endlessly and just have it present itself in so many different ways\". Producer Jeff Martin said the writers tried to use a \"very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment,\" considering cable theft to be \"essentially a victimless crime\". \"Homer vs. the 8th Commandment\" was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode \"Homer the Heretic\", in which Homer stops going to church on Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, \"remember the Sabbath and keep it holy\", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, \"We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, so maybe we could look to other commandments?\"The episode marks the debut appearance of the character Troy McClure, voiced by Phil Hartman. McClure was based on the typical \"washed-up\" Hollywood actor, and B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects. According to show creator Matt Groening, Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull \"the maximum amount of humor\" out of any line he was given. McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself. McClure became a recurring character on the show after \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\", but was retired in 1998 after Hartman's death.

The film portrays but exaggerates the difficult conditions during the period making the film's world a dystopia. The worthless counterfeit money created by Mabuse reflects the nearly worthless Deutsche Mark during the hyperinflation resulting from the Weimar Republic printing excessive money to pay war reparations. The stock market swings, gambling parlors and miserable living conditions for poor people depicted in the film were also reflections of conditions in Germany at the time.The character of Dr. Mabuse can also be seen as depiction of \"the power of evil or a distorted inner psyche\". Lang scholar Paul Jensen interpreted Mabuse as \"a symbol to unite all the negative factors in Germany at the time\". The film depicts difficult problems such as rampant crime, worthless money and a volatile stock market as thus being under the control of a single man. Bernd Widdig points out that while Dr. Mabuse is not an anti-Semitic film, aspects of Mabuse's character may have reflected contemporary stereotypes of Jews, especially since he acts in stereotypically Jewish roles such as psychoanalyst, banker, peddler and revolutionary, and consistent with the views on Jews of some contemporary Germans his manipulations were responsible for problems in society. A contemporary Nazi critic wrote that Mabuse is \"a quintessential Jewish figure\" who goes through time with the singular goal of \"mastery of the world\" regardless of the consequences to others and whose descent into insanity caused his crimes to go unpunished in what the Nazi critic described as \"the typical case of the Jewish criminal\". On the other hand, Mabuse with his hypnotic power over the masses in pursuit of evil has also been seen as a foreshadowing of Adolf Hitler. In the sequel The Testament of Dr. Mabuse the link between the Mabuse character and the Nazis is made stronger. Lang stated that he viewed Mabuse as a Nietzschean \u00dcbermensch. Lang also saw Mabuse's character as emblematic of a certain kind of money-accumulator in Weimar Germany referred to as a \"Raffke\". The producer of Dr. Mabuse, Erich Pommer, saw the film as a depiction of the contemporary conflict between the liberal conservatives and the Marxist Spartacists in which the Mabuse character represented the Spartacists, yet another view saw populist themes in the film.Another theme in the film is surveillance and seeing without being seen. Yet another theme is that of being versus seeming, portrayed through Mabuse's disguises and through buildings whose interiors seem inconsistent with their exteriors.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "58_61538", "text": "Production of the first part of Dr. Mabuse the Gambler began while the novel on which it is based, Norbert Jacques' Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler was still being serialized. The film made a number of important changes from the book version. In the book the characters engage in constant soliloquies which would not have adapted well to film, particularly a silent film which would have required many intertitles to make that work. The film also eliminated a subplot in which Mabuse's actions are shown to be motivated by a desire to create his own country within South America. Film historian David Kalat points out that by eliminating reference to Mabuse's motivation Lang starts to dehumanize the character, which helped lead to the character becoming a franchise. But Kalat also notes that this eliminates the irony of the fact that Mabuse was seen by many viewers as a representation of aspects of Adolf Hitler, and many Nazis actually fled to South America after World War II.Lang and von Harbou also added some elements to the film that were not in the novel. One of Mabuse's key skills in the film is as a counterfeiter, but in the novel he never engaged in this. Mabuse's role in counterfeiting money adds to the social subtext and to the themes of the film. The film's opening, a 20-minute tour de force introducing the myth of Mabuse, was also not in the novel. The introduction starts with Mabuse shuffling a deck of photos like playing cards which will determine which disguise he will use that day and culminates with Mabuse manipulating a stock market crash. Kalat traces the inspiration for this sequence to Louis Feuillade's 1913 Fant\u00f4mas II: Juve contre Fant\u00f4mas (Juve vs. Fant\u00f4mas). The ending to the second part of Dr. Mabuse is also unique to the film.The film incorporates a number of special effects such as animation and superimpositions. One aspect that was cheered upon the film's original release was the nighttime scene of the automobile chase in which Wenk chases Mabuse, which David Kalat called the most successful execution of such nighttime photography to that time.It was during the production of this film that Lang and von Harbou began their affair which would ultimately result in their marriage.

Boyd was attached to the project by the end of February, as part of his new deal with Path\u00e9, in which he would only appear in Path\u00e9 \"specials\". Beyond Victory was to be the first film of that new deal. James Gleason was added to the cast in a featured role in March 1930. It was the first film for Gleason under his new exclusive long-term contract with Path\u00e9. At the same time, it was revealed that John Robinson would be helming the film. Robert Armstrong was attached to the picture in early April. Also in early April, it was announced that Mauri Grashin had been signed as screenwriter to a long-term contract by Path\u00e9, and Beyond Victory would be his first project. In June 1930, it was reported that Dorothy Burgess had been signed for a featured role in the film, and Zasu Pitts involvement with the picture as a knife-throwing entertainer was revealed, along with James Gleason's participation. In mid-June, Charles O'Loughlin was announced as the sound engineer on the project, although the final version included work from four sound engineers. The Film Daily reported that the film's producer, E.B. Derr, in conjunction with the director, John Robertson, took an unusual step and had each sequence in the film written by a different screenwriter. The writers included James Seymour, James Gleason, Lynn Riggs, Thomas Lennon, Mauri Grashin, and Garret Fort. The concept was to have five independent stories intertwined around a central theme. In Glason's adaptation, he wrote a role into the final version of the script for himself. By early May pre-production on the film was almost completed.  And production on the film had begun by the middle of May. Also in May, the film was scheduled to be released on July 13, 1930.In early June, Robert Armstrong was replaced by Lew Cody. Armstrong was delayed on the production of Railroad Man.

Brooks was working on the television variety show The Tracey Ullman Show, he decided that he wanted to include short animated wraparounds before and after the commercial breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist Matt Groening's Life in Hell comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series. Groening later realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work. He therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his version of a dysfunctional family that became the Simpsons. He named the characters after his own family members, substituting \"Bart\" for his own name. Bart was modeled after Groening's older brother, Mark, but given a different name which was chosen as an anagram of \"brat\". The stories were written and storyboarded by Matt Groening. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. The animation was produced domestically at Klasky-Csupo, with Wesley Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season. After season one, it would be animated by Archer and Silverman thereafter. Gyorgyi Peluce was the colorist and the person who decided to make the characters yellow.The actors who voiced the characters in the short later reprised their roles in The Simpsons series. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show, as Castellaneta originally tried to impersonate Walter Matthau. Although he would retain this characteristic through the early episodes of the regular series, it was gradually dropped as Homer's personality evolved away from that of a stereotypical sitcom father. The producers of the show were in need of someone to do voiceovers, so rather than hire actors, they asked Castellaneta (who had already done some voice work) and Julie Kavner, both members of the Ullman Show cast, to do it. The kids still needed voices, and Nancy Cartwright, a journeyman voice actress, came in to audition. She recalled that \"I was already doing voicework for eight different shows at the time and thought this would just be another job. They originally wanted me for Lisa's voice, but I thought 'Nah, I don't want to be the boring middle child, I want to be a bratty 10-year old boy.' So as soon as I gave a demonstration, [Brooks and Groening] hired me on the spot.\" Some time later, Yeardley Smith, a 22-year-old B-movie actress whose most notable accomplishment to date was featuring in the notorious 1986 Stephen King film Maximum Overdrive, was brought in to do Lisa's voice. The recording of the shorts was often primitive; according to Cartwright, the dialogue for the Ullman shorts was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio, which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on the Ullman show set. While most of the characters' personalities are similar to what they are in the series, Lisa is simply a clone of Bart and did not have a distinct personality until a few episodes into the regular series.The shorts were featured on the first three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show. By the fourth and last season of The Tracey Ullman Show, the first season of the half-hour show was on the air. In the two first seasons the shorts were divided into three or four parts, but in the third season they were played as a single story. Tracey Ullman later filed a lawsuit, claiming that her show was the source of The Simpsons' success and therefore should receive a share of the show's profit.

The film follows Homer Simpson, who irresponsibly pollutes Springfield's local lake, causing the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to imprison the town under a giant glass dome. After he and his family escape to Alaska, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness and return to Springfield to prevent the town's demolition by Cargill. Homer then works to redeem his folly by returning to Springfield himself in an effort to save it.\nAlthough previous attempts to create a Simpsons film had been made, they failed due to the lack of a script.

They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one adapted. The script was rewritten over a hundred times, also continuing after work on the animation began in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including cameo roles from Erin Brockovich, Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher, Edward Norton, and Kelsey Grammer, who would have reprised his role as Sideshow Bob.

It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of \"Halloween Town\", who stumbles upon \"Christmas Town\" and schemes to take over the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix, and Ed Ivory.\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the critical success of Vincent that same year, Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film or a half-hour television special, to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label  because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids\".The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film, but lost to Jurassic Park. The film has been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010.\nIn 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "58_61663", "text": "The Nightmare Before Christmas was originally going to be released under Walt Disney Pictures as part of the Walt Disney Feature Animation lineup, but Disney decided to release the film under the studio's adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures banner, because the studio thought the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids,\" Selick remembered. \"Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.\" To convey Burton's involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.

It is based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with an impoverished but beguilingly attractive woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).\nPalahniuk's novel was optioned by Fox 2000 Pictures producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. It was filmed in and around Los Angeles from July to December 1998. He and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967), with a theme of conflict between Generation X and the value system of advertising.Studio executives did not like the film, and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses.

The film was perceived as the forerunner of a new mood in American political life. Like other 1999 films Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, and Three Kings, Fight Club was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style, since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology. After Fight Club's theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth, and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen of Newsweek conjectured would enjoy \"perennial\" fame. The film's success also heightened Palahniuk's profile to global renown.Following Fight Club's release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States. A \"Gentleman's Fight Club\" was started in Menlo Park, California, in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate \"Project Mayhem\".Fight Club had a significant impact on evangelical Christianity, in the areas of Christian discipleship and masculinity. A number of churches called their cell groups \"fight clubs\" with a stated purpose of meeting regularly to \"beat up the flesh and believe the gospel of grace\". Some churches, especially Mars Hill Church in Seattle, whose pastor Mark Driscoll was obsessed with the film, picked up the film's emphasis on masculinity, and rejection of self-care. Jessica Johnson suggests that Driscoll even called on \"his brothers-in-arms to foment a movement not unlike Project Mayhem.\"A Fight Club video game was released by Vivendi Universal Games in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and for mobile phones. The game was a critical and commercial failure, and was panned by such publications and websites as GameSpot, Game Informer, and IGN. The video game Jet Set Radio, initially released in 2000 for Sega's Dreamcast console, was inspired by the film's anti-establishment themes.In 2003, Fight Club was listed as one of the \"50 Best Guy Movies of All Time\" by Men's Journal. In 2004 and 2006, Fight Club was voted by Empire readers as the eighth and tenth greatest film of all time, respectively. Total Film ranked Fight Club as \"The Greatest Film of our Lifetime\" in 2007 during the magazine's tenth anniversary. In 2007, Premiere selected Tyler Durden's line, \"The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club,\" as the 27th greatest movie line of all time.

Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten.\nTaking place in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot of Toy Story focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll named Woody and a modern space cadet action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz when he becomes their owner Andy's favorite toy.\nFollowing the success of Tin Toy, a short film that was released in 1988, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film that was told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced Toy Story under minor financial constraints.\nToy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22 of that year. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend, eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 1995. The film received critical acclaim and holds a 100% approval rating on film aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. It was praised for the technical innovation of the 3D animation, script, Newman's score, appeal to all age groups, and voice performances (particularly Hanks and Allen); it is frequently lauded as one of the best animated films ever made and, due to its status as the first computer-animated film, one of the most important films in medium's history and film at large. The film received three Academy Award nominations\u2014Best Original Screenplay (the first animated film to be nominated for the award), Best Original Song for \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", and Best Original Score\u2014in addition to being honored with a non-competitive Special Achievement Academy Award.In 2005, Toy Story was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", one of nine films designated in its first year of eligibility. The success of Toy Story launched a multimedia franchise. It spawned three sequels beginning with Toy Story 2 (1999), a spin-off film Lightyear (2022), numerous short films, and a planned fourth sequel. The film also had a theatrical 3D re-release in 2009 as part of a double feature with the second film.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "1431_17690", "text": "Toy Story 3 is a  2010 American animated comedy-drama film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures.

The script was developed in multiple versions; however, after Disney bought Pixar in early 2006, the Circle Seven version of the film was cancelled as the result of Circle Seven's closure. The production was then transferred to Pixar, where a new script was developed. Randy Newman returned to compose the film's musical score.

The film earned $1.067 billion worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the highest-grossing film of 2010. It is also the first animated film to reach $1 billion at the box-office, and was the highest-grossing animated film of all time until the release of Frozen in 2013 and was Pixar's highest-grossing film until the release of Incredibles 2 in 2018. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Toy Story 3 one of the top-ten films of 2010. Amongst its numerous accolades, Toy Story 3 was nominated for five awards at the 83rd Academy Awards, winning Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian state in the novel on the Soviet Union in the era of Stalinism and Nazi Germany. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.\nThe story takes place in an imagined future in an unspecified year believed to be 1984, when much of the world is in perpetual war. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, which is led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense cult of personality manufactured by the Party's Thought Police. The Party engages in omnipresent government surveillance and, through the Ministry of Truth, historical negationism and constant propaganda to persecute individuality and independent thinking.The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent mid-level worker at the Ministry of Truth who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. Smith keeps a forbidden diary. He begins a relationship with a colleague, Julia, and they learn about a shadowy resistance group called the Brotherhood. However, their contact within the Brotherhood turns out to be a Party agent, and Smith and Julia are arrested. He is subjected to months of psychological manipulation and torture by the Ministry of Love and is released once he has come to love Big Brother.\nNineteen Eighty-Four has become a classic literary example of political and dystopian fiction.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian state in the novel on the Soviet Union in the era of Stalinism and Nazi Germany. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.\nThe story takes place in an imagined future in an unspecified year believed to be 1984, when much of the world is in perpetual war. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, which is led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense cult of personality manufactured by the Party's Thought Police. The Party engages in omnipresent government surveillance and, through the Ministry of Truth, historical negationism and constant propaganda to persecute individuality and independent thinking.The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent mid-level worker at the Ministry of Truth who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. Smith keeps a forbidden diary. He begins a relationship with a colleague, Julia, and they learn about a shadowy resistance group called the Brotherhood. However, their contact within the Brotherhood turns out to be a Party agent, and Smith and Julia are arrested. He is subjected to months of psychological manipulation and torture by the Ministry of Love and is released once he has come to love Big Brother.\nNineteen Eighty-Four has become a classic literary example of political and dystopian fiction.

Ralph Fiennes leads a seventeen-actor ensemble cast as Monsieur Gustave H., famed concierge of a twentieth-century mountainside resort in the fictional Eastern European country of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy dowager (Tilda Swinton), he and his recently befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero (Tony Revolori) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless Renaissance painting amidst the backdrop of an encroaching fascist regime. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with Studio Babelsberg, Fox Searchlight Pictures, and Indian Paintbrush's Scott Rudin and Steven Rales. Fox Searchlight supervised the commercial distribution, and The Grand Budapest Hotel's funding was sourced through Indian Paintbrush and German government-funded tax rebates.\nAnderson and longtime collaborator Hugo Guinness conceived The Grand Budapest Hotel as a fragmented tale following a character inspired by a common friend. They initially struggled in their brainstorming, but the experience touring Europe and researching the literature of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig shaped their vision for the film. The Grand Budapest Hotel draws visually from Europe-set mid-century Hollywood films and the United States Library of Congress's photochrom print collection of alpine resorts. Filming took place in eastern Germany from January to March 2013. French composer Alexandre Desplat composed the symphonic, Russian folk-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson. The film explores themes of fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty, and further studies analyze the function of color as an important storytelling device.\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel premiered in competition at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release on February 26 preceded the film's global rollout, followed by releases in Germany, North America, and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. The Grand Budapest Hotel received critical acclaim, with reviewers singling out its cast and craftsmanship for praise, though occasional criticism centered on the film's approach to subject matter, fragmented storytelling, and characterization. It earned $174 million in box office revenue worldwide, Anderson's highest-grossing feature to date.

There, he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who tells his rags to riches story at dinner.\nIn 1932, Zero is an illegal refugee escaping a war waged by a fascist regime, which killed his entire family. He is hired as a lobby boy supervised by Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's concierge. Gustave strikes up affairs with old, wealthy clients, including dowager Madame C\u00e9line Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis (known as Madame D.), who secretly owns the hotel. She mysteriously dies a month after her last hotel visit so Gustave and Zero visit her estate, where relatives come for the reading of her will. There, her attorney, Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, announces a recent codicil which bequeaths the famous Renaissance painting Boy with Apple to Gustave. Madame D.'s son and an agent of the regime, Dmitri, refuses to let it happen. Gustave and Zero abscond with the painting, hiding it in a safe in the Grand Budapest.\nAfter a testimony by Madame D.'s butler Serge X, Gustave is arrested by Inspector Alfred J. Henckels for Madame D.'s murder; Serge then goes into hiding. Gustave befriends a gang during his imprisonment and provides them with pastries from Mendl's, a well-known bakery. After extensive research of the prison, one of Gustave's cellmates, Ludwig, tells the gang that they can escape via a storm-drain sewage system. Convinced to join the prison break, Gustave has Zero place hammers, chisels, and sawblades inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice of Herr Mendl and Zero's fianc\u00e9e. The guard responsible for checking contraband cannot bring himself to break open the pastries since Mendl's pastries are works of art. During the prison break, the group of convicts runs into guards who secretly gamble at night, and convict Gunther is forced to sacrifice himself to dispatch the guards. The rest of the group manages to escape and disperse. Meanwhile, Dmitri sends his hitman, J. G. Jopling, to kill Kovacs after questioning his loyalty, as well as Serge's sister for hiding his whereabouts.\nWhen Zero and Gustave are reunited, they set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges known as the Society of the Crossed Keys, which locates Serge and facilitates a meeting between him, Gustave and Zero. Serge reveals that he was pressured to implicate Gustave by the real killer, Dmitri, and that Madame D. had a missing second will, which would only take effect should she be murdered. Jopling arrives and kills Serge, leaving Gustave and Zero without a witness, then tries to flee. After a chase through the snow, Gustave is left dangling of a cliff at the mercy of Jopling. Before it is too late, Zero rescues Gustave by pushing Jopling off the cliff, and the two men continue their escape from swarming Zubrowkan troops led by Henckels.\nGustave, Zero, and Agatha return to the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a fascist headquarters by Dmitri. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve the painting but is spotted by Dmitri. Gustave and Zero rush in to save Agatha, but Dmitri shoots at them and initiates a melee with Zubrowkan troops, which Henckels stops. At the back of the painting, Agatha finds Madame D.'s second will, which makes Gustave the hotel owner. He is exonerated in court, while Dmitri becomes the main suspect and flees the country. Over time, Gustave becomes one of the wealthiest Zubrowkans, and Zero and Agatha are wed.

Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a brainwashed somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark, twisted visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique, curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets.\nThe script was inspired by various experiences from the lives of Janowitz and Mayer, both pacifists who were left distrustful of authority after their experiences with the military during World War I. The film makes use of a frame story, with a prologue and epilogue combined with a twist ending. Janowitz said this device was forced upon the writers against their will. The film's design was handled by Hermann Warm, Walter Reimann and Walter R\u00f6hrig, who recommended a fantastic, graphic style over a naturalistic one.\nThe film thematizes brutal and irrational authority. Writers and scholars have argued the film reflects a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, and is an example of Germany's obedience to authority and unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority. Some critics have interpreted Caligari as representing the German war government, with Cesare symbolic of the common man conditioned, like soldiers, to kill.  Other themes of the film include the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity, the subjective perception of reality, and the duality of human nature.\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was released when foreign film industries were easing restrictions on the import of German films after World War I, so it was screened internationally. Accounts differ as to its financial and critical success upon release, but modern film critics and historians have largely praised it as a revolutionary film. The film was voted number 12 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably \"the first true horror film\", and reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films.

It is Antonioni's first entirely English-language film and stars David Hemmings, Vanessa Redgrave and Sarah Miles. Also featured was 1960s model Veruschka. The plot was inspired by Argentine writer Julio Cort\u00e1zar's 1959 short story \"Las babas del diablo\".The story is set within the contemporary mod subculture of Swinging London, and follows a fashion photographer (Hemmings) who believes he has unwittingly captured a murder on film. The screenplay was by Antonioni and Tonino Guerra, with English dialogue by British playwright Edward Bond. The cinematographer was Carlo di Palma. The film's non-diegetic music was scored by American jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, and the English rock group The Yardbirds are seen performing \"Stroll On\".\nIn the main competition section of the 1967 Cannes Film Festival, Blow-Up won the Palme d'Or, the festival's highest honour. The American release of the counterculture-era film with its explicit sexual content defied Hollywood's Production Code, and its subsequent critical and commercial success influenced the abandonment of the code in 1968 in favour of the MPAA film rating system.Blow-Up would influence subsequent films, including Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation (1974) and Brian De Palma's Blow Out (1981).

Nancy Allen stars as Sally Bedina, a young woman involved in the crime. The supporting cast includes John Lithgow and Dennis Franz. The film's tagline in advertisements was, \"Murder has a sound all of its own\".\nDirectly based on Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 film Blowup, the film replaces the medium of photography with one of audio recording.

The sequel to Star Wars (1977), it is the second film in the Star Wars film series and the fifth chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set three years after the events of Star Wars, the film recounts the battle between the malevolent Galactic Empire, led by the Emperor, and the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia. Rebel ally Luke Skywalker trains to master the Force so he can confront the Emperor's powerful disciple, Darth Vader. The ensemble cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.\nFollowing the success of Star Wars, Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel. After she died in 1978, he outlined the whole Star Wars saga and wrote the next draft himself, before hiring Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) writer Kasdan to enhance his work. To avoid the stress he faced directing Star Wars, Lucas handed the responsibility to Kershner and focused on expanding his special effects company Industrial Light & Magic instead. Filmed from March to September 1979 in Finse, Norway, and at Elstree Studios in England, The Empire Strikes Back faced production difficulties, including actor injuries, illnesses, fires, and problems securing additional financing as costs rose. Initially budgeted at $8 million, costs had risen to $30.5 million by the project's conclusion.\nReleased on May 21, 1980, the highly anticipated sequel became the highest-grossing film that year, earning approximately $401.5 million worldwide. Unlike its lighthearted predecessor, Empire met with mixed reviews from critics, and fans were conflicted about its darker and more mature themes. Critics praised the expressive features and characterization of the puppeteered character Yoda, a diminutive creature who serves as Luke's teacher. The film was nominated for various awards and won two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, and a BAFTA, among others. Subsequent releases have raised the film's worldwide gross to $538\u2013549 million and, adjusted for inflation, it is the 13th-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada.\nSince its release, The Empire Strikes Back has been critically reassessed and is now often regarded as the best film in the Star Wars series and among the greatest films ever made. It has had a significant impact on filmmaking and popular culture and is often considered an example of a sequel superior to its predecessor. The climax, in which Vader reveals he is Luke's father, is often ranked as one of the greatest plot twists in cinema. The film spawned a variety of merchandise and adaptations, including video games and a radio play.
