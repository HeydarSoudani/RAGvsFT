Several episodes were adapted for BBC Radio; the series also spawned a 2010 stage play that led to a new television series on Gold in 2013.\nSet principally in the private office of a British cabinet minister in the fictional Department of Administrative Affairs in Whitehall, Yes Minister follows the ministerial career of Jim Hacker, played by Paul Eddington. His various struggles to formulate and enact policy or effect departmental changes are opposed by the British Civil Service, in particular his Permanent Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, played by Nigel Hawthorne. His Principal Private Secretary Bernard Woolley, played by Derek Fowlds, is usually caught between the two. The sequel, Yes, Prime Minister, continued with the same cast and followed Hacker after his unexpected elevation to prime ministerial office.\nThe series received several BAFTAs and in 2004 was voted sixth in the Britain's Best Sitcom poll. It was the favourite television programme of the then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Only three other people were in the studio with Madonna during the recording of the song and album: Orbit, recording engineer Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. The track featured no live instrumentation, and was part of a machinery issue that delayed initial recording as Orbit preferred working with sample loops and synth-based instrumentation. As a result, it took a while to finish production of the song, until the computers were repaired. The song was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Studios in New York, and included background vocals from Donna De Lory and Niki Haris.\n\n\"Nothing Really Matters\" is a mid-tempo EDM song which contains influences of techno, downtempo pop, and house music. It is set in time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of F major, with a moderate tempo of 117 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from the lower octave of F3 to the higher note of A\u266d4. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune labelled the production as a \"worldly, and weary Madonna\". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly noticed that the \"hard-step beats and synth washes make the romantic-physical yearnings (and hooks) of 'Skin' and 'Nothing Really Matters' even tauter [...]\". J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun felt the song was a \"smart, groove-intensive tune\". Chuck Taylor from Billboard compared the composition of \"Nothing Really Matters\" to the \"disco-encrusted\" \"Vogue\" (1990). However, he found that the \"core\" important part of the song was its \"sweetly-spiritual\" and \"simple\" lyrical content.The song begins with a \"strange, electronic, slightly broken noise\" that spans between the start of the song up until 54 seconds. The ambient-influenced beginning gives the impression that \"Nothing Really Matters\" would be a ballad, but in the minute mark, it changes to a mid-tempo dance-pop song. The ambient music becomes restrained, although a cursory bleeping sound can be heard from the right to the left. The background has a number of faint strings in it, which signifies the depth of the stereo field. The chorus starts with a fast-pacing dance sound, over which Madonna sings, \"Nothing really matters / love is all we need / everything I give you / all comes back to me.\" Throughout the entire song, it includes two verses, three choruses, one bridge section, and an outro. The bridge is backed by piano sounds with a descending sequence by a couple of bars. Madonna sings the same lyrics in the outro, but is slowed down and echoed longer until the music fades out.The lyrics are about the birth of Madonna's daughter Lourdes, and the realization of motherhood. In an interview with the Wesleyan University Press, the singer stated: \"There's a song on the album called 'Nothing Really Matters', and it is very much inspired by my daughter. it's just realizing that at the end of the day, the most important thing is loving people and sharing love. The birth of my daughter has been a huge influence. It's different to look at life through the eyes of a child, and suddenly you have a whole new respect for life and you kind of get your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'.\" Based on the lyrical content, Bryan Lark from The Michigan Daily reviewed the parent album, and concluded that as the single \"Ray of Light\" was about confronting the past, \"Nothing Really Matters\" conversely is about \"moving onward.\"", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "162_67758", "text": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" is a song by American singer Madonna for her seventh studio album, Ray of Light (1998). It was written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and was produced by the singer with William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was released as the sixth and final single from the album on February 9, 1999, by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records. An electronic dance track on which Madonna experiments with different musical genres, \"Nothing Really Matters\" includes ambient music and electronic noise frequencies that were added by De Vries. Lyrically, the recording delves on the singer's first daughter Lourdes Leon, having also themes of selfishness, affection, and motherhood.\nThe song was critically appreciated for its lyrical content and composition, and was declared by reviewers as one of Madonna's most personal efforts; however, some critics felt it was tepid and lacklustre compared to other tracks from Ray of Light. In the United States, the song remains Madonna's lowest entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 93. Its low chart peak was due to lack of airplay and the delay in releasing it in CD single formats, to which the singer's fans protested against Warner Bros. The song became her 23rd number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart, reaching the top spot in Hungary and Spain, and entering the top ten in countries including Canada, Finland, Iceland, Italy, Scotland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Swedish director Johan Renck, and was released on February 13, 1999. Inspired by Arthur Golden's 1997 novel Memoirs of a Geisha, the video portrays Madonna as a geisha, dancing in a small room. The red kimono worn by her in the video was designed by French fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier. It was worn by the singer during her performance of the song at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. \"Nothing Really Matters\" is cited as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. The costume and music video has been cited by journalist and academics as one of Madonna's most iconic and best re-inventions.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "162_67759", "text": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" was written by Madonna and American producer and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom she gave birth to in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. \"That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before,\" she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including \"Nothing Really Matters\". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of \"Nothing Really Matters\"'s music. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work for a long time and was pleased with the demo version, which he started to work on.De Vries, who had worked on the demo, asked Orbit to help produce the song, and was enlisted. According to Madonna: Like an Icon writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had originally composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution \"off-putting\", to which the latter confessed, \"On all the collaborations I'd left a lot of space for him, but for this I wanted to put something on the table and say, 'This is what I think'\". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a \"vision on how the song should be finished\". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the \"DAT's broken\". De Vries defended his contribution saying that it was supposed to be \"like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune.\" Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on. In J. Randy Taraborrelli's book Madonna: An Intimate Biography, the singer said that the main inspiration behind \"Nothing Really Matters\" and \"The Power of Good-Bye\" from the same album, was other people judging and dissecting her creative process. Elaborating on the statement, she added,\n\nIn 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I want people to have a visceral and emotional reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I wanted to say that it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't want people to be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was released on 22 November 2004 in the United Kingdom by Island Records and a day later in the United States by Interscope Records. Much like their previous album All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), the record exhibits a more mainstream rock sound after the band experimented with alternative rock and dance music in the 1990s. It was produced by Steve Lillywhite, with additional production from Chris Thomas, Jacknife Lee, Nellee Hooper, Flood, Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Carl Glanville.\nLooking for a more hard-hitting sound than that of their previous album, U2 began recording How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February 2003 with Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results. The group subsequently enlisted Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. U2 lead singer Bono described the album as \"our first rock album. It's taken us twenty years or whatever it is, but this is our first rock album.\" Thematically, the record touches on life, death, love, war, faith, and family.\nHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received generally positive reviews from critics and reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled the band's previous personal best. The album and its singles won all eight Grammy Awards for which they were nominated.

Gray were actors; all also worked in Rawhide.\nChisholm Trail is the classic novel by Borden Chase that inspired the epic motion picture Red River starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift.\nThe diary of trail boss George C. Duffield was written during a cattle drive from San Antonio to Sedalia in 1866. The narrations with which Gil Favor begins each episode are similar in style and breadth to the entries in Duffield's journal, lending the show an extra measure of authenticity.Filming for the first season of Rawhide took place at Universal-International Studios in Hollywood. The extensive railroad scenes in the third season were filmed in one month on the Sierra Railroad in Tuolumne County, California.The premiere episode of Rawhide reached the top 20 in the Nielsen ratings.\nThe show had a grueling production schedule, being mostly weekly with a three- to four-month break between seasons. After the first season of 22 episodes, seasons two to seven were each 30 episodes. Often, the only way the lead actors could get a break was if they were said to be off on business. On rare occasions, the show featured a small number of the actors and some misfortune, maybe in a town, which would give the others time off.\nEric Fleming drowned at the age of 41 when a canoe flipped over on location in Peru six weeks into filming the movie High Jungle in 1966. The picture was abandoned as a result.", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "162_67802", "text": "Set in the 1860s, Rawhide portrays the challenges faced by the drovers of a cattle drive. Most episodes are introduced with a monologue by Gil Favor (Eric Fleming), trail boss. In a typical Rawhide story, the drovers come upon people on the trail and involve themselves in other people's affairs, usually encountering various corrupt individuals. Many times, one or more of the crew venture into a nearby town and encounter some trouble from crooked townspeople or lawless politicians from whom they need to be rescued. Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood) was young and at times impetuous in the earliest episodes, and Favor had to keep a tight rein on him.\nFavor is a savvy and strong leader, who always plays \"square\" with his fellow men \u2013 a tough customer who can handle the challenges and get the job done. (Producer Charles Warren called on the diary written in 1866 by trail boss George C. Duffield to shape the character of Favor.) Although Favor had the respect and loyalty of the men who worked for him, the people, including Yates, are insubordinate to him a few times, after working too hard or after receiving a tongue lashing. Favor has to fight at times and usually wins.\nSome Rawhide stories were easy in production terms, but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its story lines ranged from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and others. A frequent story line was the constant need to find water for the cattle. The scout spent much of his time looking for water, sometimes finding that water holes and even rivers had dried up.\nRawhide frequently dealt with controversial topics. Robert Culp played an ex-soldier on the drive who had become dangerously addicted to morphine. Mexican drover Hey Soos faced racism at times from outside of the crew.\nSeveral shows deal with the aftermath of the American Civil War, which ended four years earlier. The \"Poco Tiempo\" episode reveals that Yates' father's name was Dan, that Yates came from Southwestern Texas, that he joined the Confederate States Army at 16, and that he was later held in a federal prison camp.\nFavor also served in the CSA as a captain. \"Incident on the Edge of Madness\" in season one, guest-starring Lon Chaney Jr., had Favor's old commanding officer attempting to enlist the aid of Favor and his men to start the \"New Confederacy of Panama\" much to Favor's dismay. In that same episode, Favor and Nolan were revealed to have been in the Confederate forces up on Marye's Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and they \"felt shamed\" at killing so many Union soldiers.\nSome American Indians demanded cattle as payment for going through their land. Rough characters were in the shows, and in one episode, Gil Favor is tortured by having his face held near a fire. In \"Incident of the Town in Terror\", people think that a sick Yates has \"the plague\" (anthrax), and they enforce at gunpoint a quarantine of the cattle drovers outside the town. Also, cattle rustlers were around, including Commancheros.\nOn occasions, Rawhide was eerily atmospheric. \"Incident with an Executioner\" featured a mysterious dark rider (Dan Duryea) seen on the hillside following the herd, \"Incident of the Haunted Hills\" featured a sacred Indian burial ground, \"Incident of the Druid Curse\" and season two's \"Incident of the Murder Steer\" (where anyone sighting a rogue steer with \"Murder\" carved on its side soon after dies, based on an actual legend of the Old West). The series also featured episodes with ghost towns, cattle with horns lit up by St. Elmo's fire at dusk, cowboys struck by lightning, plus a strange, totally enclosed gypsy wagon, apparently steering itself, repeatedly turning up, all stand out as curiously \"spooky\" tales for a bustling dusty cattle drive; the show's often stark incidental music suited these stories perfectly.\nIn episode 67, \"Incident Near the Promised Land\" (most episode titles began with \"Incident\" until Bruce Geller and Bernard L. Kowalski became the producers for season six), the cattle drive finally reached Sedalia for the first time in the series. Unusually, episode 68 continues on from that, where the cattle have been sold and the men celebrate in town and decide on their futures with even Favor thinking of leaving the business. Instead of the usual ending, wherein Favor gives the command \"Head 'em up! Move 'em out!\" and the cattle move off, this episode had the end titles over a view of a Sedalia street.\nEpisode 69 has Favor visiting his two daughters, Gillian and Maggie, who live with their aunt Eleanor Bradley in Philadelphia. In episode 70, a number of the men are back together and heading back to San Antonio about 650 miles away, with a herd of horses (used in the titles) instead of cattle. Episode 71 has a new cattle drive ready to go, but the owner of 1600 of the cattle wants to be in charge, so Favor reluctantly signs on as a ramrod, but after problems, Favor becomes boss again at the end of the show. These five episodes made up one storyline instead of the usual single-episode stories, which could have been set anywhere in the West.\nFavor had many bad moments in the series, but none worse than the \"Lost Herd\" episode. Close to drive's finish, Favor wants to beat another herd to town to get the best prices. He takes a narrow shortcut; due to thunder and lightning, the herd stampedes over the cliffs, leaving him just 9 out of 3000 cattle when the drive reaches town. He does not have the money to pay the drovers and has to face the owner (Royal Dano), whose cattle he has lost, knowing that he might never work in the business again.\nFrom the second season, episodes began to feature individual cast members, notably Clint Eastwood's Yates (sole star in \"Incident on the Day of the Dead\", which opens season two); later, both Scout Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley) and even cook G. W. Wishbone (Paul Brinegar) were featured as leads, while Fleming's Gil Favor remained in overall charge.\nPete Nolan (Wooley), the scout, departs as a regular cast member after \"The Deserter's Patrol\" (season four, episode 18, 9 Feb 1962), but returns for a single episode \"Reunion\" (episode 26, 6 April 1962), and for a further nine episodes in season seven from \"Texas Fever\" (episode 18, 5 February 1965).\nCharles H. Gray's character Clay Forester, having played a villain in three episodes of season four (from \"The Inside Man\", episode six), then reforms and replaces Nolan as scout from \"The Greedy Town\" (season four, episode 19). Gray remained in the regular cast for the rest of seasons four and five (though in a number of later episodes, he is credited but not seen).\n\nIn the eighth and final season of Rawhide, Fleming left the series after an apparent disagreement with the producers. Rawhide had fallen in the ratings, from sixth in 1960\u201361 to 13th, 22nd, then 44th. Eric Fleming, who played Favor, was let go. \"They fired me because they were paying me a million dollars a year\" (actually $220,000), Fleming told TV Guide in 1965. Cast members Sheb Wooley, James Murdock, Rocky Shahan, and Robert Cabal were also let go. Eastwood was promoted to series star as Yates finally becomes the trail boss. This outcome was hinted at in earlier episodes when Favor indicates he is training Yates to replace him as trail boss. The impression given is this was a later cattle drive with Yates now in charge, at a time after Favor had either \"retired\" or given up as boss, presumably having made his money or opted for a career change, since no mention is ever made onscreen of him or the reason for his absence in the final season's episodes. In its casting of the series, Robert Carricart was originally cast as George Washington Wishbone, but was replaced by Paul Brinegar. Carricart only played the role for the series unaired pilot.John Ireland as Jed Colby and Raymond St Jacques as Simon Blake also joined the Rawhide cast at this time, plus semiregular minor cast member David Watson as Ian Cabot.

The 10th released in the UK and 12th in the US, it is viewed as a culmination of a string of the band's most critically successful albums, following Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969) and Sticky Fingers (1971). Exile on Main St. is known for its murky, inconsistent sound due to more disjointed musicianship and production, along with a party-like atmosphere heard in several tracks.\nRecording began in 1969 at Olympic Studios in London during sessions for Sticky Fingers, with the main sessions beginning in mid-1971 at a rented villa in the South of France named Nellc\u00f4te after the band became tax exiles. Due to the lack of a professional studio nearby, they worked with a mobile recording studio and recorded in-house. The loose and unorganised Nellc\u00f4te sessions went on for hours into the night, with personnel varying greatly from day to day. Recording was completed with overdub sessions at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles and included additional musicians such as the pianist Nicky Hopkins, the saxophonist Bobby Keys, the drummer and producer Jimmy Miller, and the horn player Jim Price. The results produced enough songs for the Stones' first double album.\nThe band continued a back-to-basics direction heard in Sticky Fingers after the experimental instrumentation of previous albums, yet Exile exhibited a wider range of influences in blues, rock and roll, swing, country and gospel, while the lyrics explored themes related to hedonism, sex and time. The album contains frequently-performed concert staples and topped the charts in six countries, including the UK, US and Canada. It included the singles \"Happy\", which featured lead vocals from Keith Richards, country music ballad \"Sweet Virginia\", and worldwide top-ten hit \"Tumbling Dice\". The album's artwork, a collage of various images, reflected the Rolling Stones' prideful rebellion. After its release, the Stones embarked on an American tour, gaining infamy for riotous audiences and performances.\nExile on Main St. was originally met with mixed reviews before receiving strong reassessments by the end of the 1970s. It has since been recognized as a pivotal hard rock album, viewed by many critics as the Rolling Stones' best work and as one of the greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album number 7 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2003 and 2012, with it dropping to number 14 in the 2020 and 2023 editions, consistently as the highest-ranked Rolling Stones album on the list. In 2012, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the band's fourth album to be inducted. A remastered and expanded version of the album was released in 2010 featuring a bonus disc with 10 new tracks.

It was the band's tenth studio album released in the United Kingdom. Preceded by the UK (number 5) and US (number 7) Top 10 hit \"Tumbling Dice\", Exile on Main St was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 1 worldwide just as the band embarked on their celebrated 1972 American Tour. Their first American tour in three years, it featured many songs from the new album. The Richards-sung \"Happy\" was released as a second single to capitalize on the tour; it would peak at number 22 in the United States in August.After the release of Exile on Main St., Allen Klein sued the Rolling Stones for breach of settlement because five songs on the album were composed while Jagger and Richards were under contract with his company, ABKCO: \"Sweet Virginia\", \"Loving Cup\", \"All Down the Line\", \"Shine a Light\" and \"Stop Breaking Down\" (written by Robert Johnson but re-interpreted by Jagger and Richards). ABKCO acquired publishing rights to the songs, giving it a share of the royalties from Exile on Main St., and was able to release another album of Rolling Stones songs, More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies).Exile on Main St. was not well received by some contemporary critics, who found the quality of the songs inconsistent. Reviewing in July 1972 for Rolling Stone, Lenny Kaye said the record has \"a tight focus on basic components of the Stones' sound as we've always known it,\" including blues-based rock music with a \"pervading feeling of blackness\". However, he added that the uneven quality of songs means \"the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come\". Richard Williams of Melody Maker was more enthusiastic and deemed it the band's best album, writing that it will \"take its place in history\" as the music \"utterly repulses the sneers and arrows of outraged put down artists. Once and for all, it answers any questions about their ability as rock 'n' rollers.\" Geoffrey Cannon of The Guardian agreed, stating: \"Exile On Main Street will go down as [the Stones'] classic album, made at the height of their musical powers and self-confidence.\" The NME's Roy Carr gave additional praise to the tracks, praising the styles present, the performances of the band and the lyrical content. In a year-end list for Newsday, Christgau named it the best album of 1972, stating the \"fagged-out masterpiece\" marks the peak of rock music for the year as it \"explored new depths of record-studio murk, burying Mick's voice under layers of cynicism, angst and ennui\".", "hasanswer": false}, {"id": "162_67811", "text": "According to Bill Janovitz, in his account of the album for the 33\u2153 book series, Exile on Main St. features \"a seemingly infinite amount of subtle (and not so subtle) variations on rock & roll \u2013 a form that had seemed to be severely limited to basic, guitar-driven music.\" Music biographer John Perry writes that the Rolling Stones had developed a style of hard rock for the album that is \"entirely modern yet rooted in 1950s rock & roll and 1930s\u20131940s swing\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, described Exile on Main St. as \"a sprawling, weary double album\" featuring \"a series of dark, dense jams\" that encompass rock and roll, blues, country, and gospel styles. Rolling Stone writer Richard Gehr compares the album to outlaw music and observes a strong influence of music from the American South in its \"loose-limbed\" explorations of 1950s rock, African-American soul, and gospel country.Although Exile is often thought to reflect Richards' vision for a raw, rootsy rock sound, Jagger was already expressing his boredom with rock and roll in several interviews at the time of the album's release. Jagger's stance on Exile's rock and roll sound at the time is interpreted by the music academic Barry J. Faulk to seemingly \"signal the end of the Stones' conscious attempt to revive American-style roots rock\". With Richards' effectiveness seriously undermined by his dependence on heroin, the group's subsequent 1970s releases \u2013 directed largely by Jagger \u2013 would experiment to varying degrees with other musical genres, moving away from the rootsy influences of Exile on Main St.According to Robert Christgau, Exile on Main St. expands on the hedonistic themes the band had explored on previous albums such as Sticky Fingers. As he writes, \"It piled all the old themes \u2013 sex as power, sex as love, sex as pleasure, distance, craziness, release \u2013 on top of an obsession with time that was more than appropriate in men pushing 30 who were still committed to what was once considered youth music.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to the pilot episode, the term \"Mad men\" was coined in the 1950s by advertisers working on Madison Avenue to refer to themselves, \"Mad\" being short for \"Madison\".

The song conveys his dismay at the world's unrealised potential for universal love, which he refers to as \"the love there that's sleeping\".\nThe song also serves as a comment on the disharmony within the Beatles after their return from studying transcendental meditation in India in early 1968. This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band's initial apathy towards the composition, which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator, Eric Clapton, to contribute to the recording. Clapton overdubbed a lead guitar part, although he was not formally credited for his contribution. Harrison first recorded it with a sparse backing of acoustic guitar and harmonium \u2013 a version that appeared on the 1996 Anthology 3 outtakes compilation and, with the addition of a string arrangement by George Martin, on the Love soundtrack album in 2006.

The recording was one of several collaborations between Harrison and Clapton during the late 1960s and was followed by the pair co-writing the song \"Badge\" for Clapton's group Cream.\nOn release, the song received praise from several music critics, and it has since been recognised as an example of Harrison's maturing as a songwriter beside his Beatles bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Rolling Stone ranked \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" 135th on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", seventh on the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\", and at number 10 on its list of \"The Beatles 100 Greatest Songs\". Clapton's performance was ranked 42nd in Guitar World's 2008 list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\". Harrison and Clapton often performed the song together live, during which they shared the lead guitar role over the closing section. Live versions featuring the pair were included on the Concert for Bangladesh album in 1971 and Live in Japan in 1992. Backed by a band that included McCartney and Ringo Starr, Clapton performed the song at the Concert for George in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "162_67912", "text": "Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey covered \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" on his 1990 album Hell to Pay.

The performance appears on the DVD release Party at the Palace. On 29 November the same year, Clapton, backed by a large band that included McCartney, Starr, Dhani Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Marc Mann, performed \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" at the Concert for George in memory of Harrison. Author Ian Inglis writes that while Clapton was already \"permanently associated\" with \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" due to his presence on the White Album recording and the Concert for Bangladesh and Live in Japan versions, his long, closing solo at the Concert for George contained \"perhaps the most expressive\" playing of all those versions.American musician Todd Rundgren covered \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" for the 2003 album Songs from the Material World: A Tribute to George Harrison. Rundgren said of his contribution to the multi-artist tribute: \"[Before the Beatles], I'd never heard the term 'lead guitarist.' George created the job description for my first paying gig, the vocation that I'm still lucky enough to practice today \u2026\" Johnny Loftus of AllMusic views the recording as one of the collection's highlights, saying that Rundgren \"effortlessly replicates the grandeur\" of the Beatles' track. As his personal tribute to Harrison, Peter Frampton released a version of the song on his 2003 album Now.In 2004, when Harrison was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was played in tribute by a large band that included Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Steve Winwood, Marc Mann, Dhani Harrison, Prince and Steve Ferrone. The performance concluded with a highly acclaimed extended guitar solo by Prince, who was also being inducted into the Hall of Fame.Among other cover versions, the song has also been recorded by guitarists such as Marc Ribot, Phish and Charlie Byrd, and on ukulele by Jake Shimabukuro. Toto did a cover version for their album Through the Looking Glass and in a live performance in Live in Amsterdam. Santana did a cover for his twentieth album Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time, in 2010, featuring singer India Arie and cellist Yo-Yo Ma.

Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix, and Ed Ivory.\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the critical success of Vincent that same year, Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film or a half-hour television special, to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label  because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids\".The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time.

The film has been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010.\nIn 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Emil von Behring, whom Dr. Ehrlich meets and befriends while experimenting with his staining techniques, is impressed with Dr. Ehrlich's staining methods and refers to it as 'specific staining,' adding that this optical microscopy  diagnostic technique is one of the greatest achievements in science. \nAfter attending a medical presentation of the eminent Dr. Robert Koch demonstrating that tuberculosis is a bacterial disease, Ehrlich is able to obtain a sample of the isolated bacterium. After an intense time of research and experimentation in his own lab, paired with a portion of luck and thanks to the empathy of his wife, he is able to develop a viable staining process for the microbe. This result is honored by Koch and medical circles as another highly valuable contribution to diagnostics.\nDuring his work Dr. Ehrlich is infected with tuberculosis, then an often-deadly, uncurable disease. To recover, Ehrlich travels with his wife Hedwig to the hot dry climate of Egypt. There he starts to discover the properties of immunity. This discovery helps Ehrlich and colleague Dr. von Behring to fight a diphtheria epidemic that is killing off many children in the country. The two doctors are rewarded for their efforts.\nEhrlich concentrates on work to create \"magic bullets\" - chemicals injected into the blood to fight various diseases, thus pioneering antibiotic chemotherapy for infectious diseases. Ehrlich's laboratory has the help of a number of scientists like Sahachiro Hata. The medical board, headed by Dr. Hans Wolfert, believes much of Ehrlich's work is a waste of money and resources and fight for a reduction, just as Ehrlich begins to work on a cure for syphilis. Ehrlich is financially backed by the widow of Jewish banker Georg Speyer, Franziska Speyer, and after 606 tries he finally discovers the remedy for the disease. This substance, first called \"606\", then Salvarsan, is now known as Arsphenamine.\nThe joy of discovery is short-lived, as 38 patients who receive the treatment die. Dr. Wolfert denounces the cure publicly and accuses Ehrlich of murdering those who died from the cure. As faith in the new cure starts to dwindle, Ehrlich is forced to sue Wolfert for libel and in the process exonerate 606. Dr. von Behring (who had earlier told Ehrlich to give up his pipe dreams of cures by chemicals), is called by the defense to denounce 606. Behring instead states that he believes that 606 is responsible for a 39th death: the death of syphilis itself. Ehrlich is exonerated, but the strain and stress from the trial are too much for his weakened body and he dies shortly thereafter, his final words being counsel to his assistants and colleagues on the risks involved in advancing medicine.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Produced by Bj\u00f6rk, the original version of the song was replaced \"at the last minute\" with a remixed version by Howie B. It was inspired by the spring while producing the album in M\u00e1laga, Spain. After living in the mountains among other people for six months, Bj\u00f6rk felt lonely, but a morning walk in April inspired her to write the track. She had a rough winter and then she realised it was spring after she could hear the birds singing. She wrote and recorded the song in half a day.In keeping with Homogenic's theme as a tribute to Bj\u00f6rk's native Iceland, the track was inspired by Icelandic mythology, such as the Ragnar\u00f6k. The previous track, \"Pluto\", stands for death and destruction, whereas \"All Is Full of Love\" stands for a new beginning. Bj\u00f6rk also called it a song about \"believing in love\" and expressed that \"love isn't just about two persons. It's everywhere around you. Even if you're not getting love from Person A, it doesn't mean there's not love there.\" However, she also described it as \"taking the piss\", considering it the most \"sugary song\" ever. As the song opposes the rest of Homogenic's \"macho\" aesthetic, Bj\u00f6rk has said it could have been included on Vespertine.The lyrics begin with a promise of protection and caretaking: \"You'll be given love / You'll be taken care of / You'll have to trust it\". The song moves towards a more reproachful tone as Bj\u00f6rk sings, \"You just ain't receiving / Your phone is off the hook / Your doors are shut\", tempered by the recognition that you have to \"twist your head around you\" because \"love is all around you\". This is musically effected by Bj\u00f6rk's vocals as she sings the lyric \"All is full of love\" in counterpoint with herself.The album version of the track does not have drum accompaniment. It does not have Homogenic's characteristic electronic beats, focusing instead on \"[creating] an intimacy between the growing dynamics of the instrumentation and Bjork's impressive vocal abilities.\" It uses a long reverb, which results in a wash of sound that suggests a very large space suggestive of the \"heavenly\" environment Bj\u00f6rk envisaged for the track. According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the song has a soft pulse with intervals that build up to an electronic orchestration of industrial beats. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called it a \"moony lullaby\" and compared it to the music of Enya. In his review for Spin, James Hunter wrote that the track is one of the times Bj\u00f6rk \"dips her toe into the warm lake of tradition\" and noted its \"rockish minor-key verses traipse off into her gospel.\"The video version of the song is a midtempo trip hop ballad with soul influences. In opposition to the sonically minimalist mix included on the album, this version has been described as \"lushly produced\" and includes \"fluttering\" harps and \"shivering\" strings. Reportedly the best known and the preferred version by Bj\u00f6rk's fans and herself, it is further known under the names of \"Mark Stent Mix\" and \"Video Mix\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Marlowe is among the most famous of the Elizabethan playwrights. Based upon the \"many imitations\" of his play Tamburlaine, modern scholars consider him to have been the foremost dramatist in London in the years just before his mysterious early death. Some scholars also believe that he greatly influenced William Shakespeare, who was baptised in the same year as Marlowe and later succeeded him as the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright. Marlowe was the first to achieve critical reputation for his use of blank verse, which became the standard for the era. His plays are distinguished by their overreaching protagonists. Themes found within Marlowe's literary works have been noted as humanistic with realistic emotions, which some scholars find difficult to reconcile with Marlowe's \"anti-intellectualism\" and his catering to the prurient tastes of his Elizabethan audiences for generous displays of extreme physical violence, cruelty, and bloodshed.Events in Marlowe's life were sometimes as extreme as those found in his plays. Differing sensational reports of Marlowe's death in 1593 abounded after the event and are contested by scholars today owing to a lack of good documentation. There have been many conjectures as to the nature and reason for his death, including a vicious bar-room fight, blasphemous libel against the church, homosexual intrigue, betrayal by another playwright, and espionage from the highest level: the Privy Council of Elizabeth I. An official coroner's account of Marlowe's death was discovered only in 1925, and it did little to persuade all scholars that it told the whole story, nor did it eliminate the uncertainties present in his biography.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Ball originally planned a production where she would co-star with Mitzi Gaynor as two nuns touring Europe, followed by a French-based production called Lucy in Paris and a Middle Eastern comedy called Lucy in Arabia.  None of those projects gained footing, and instead Ball, through her company Desilu Productions and ITV franchisee ABC Weekend TV, opted to shoot Lucy in London. Impressed by his work, Ball hired Steve Binder to direct the special.\nThe concept for Lucy in London was set up in an episode of The Lucy Show called \"Lucy Flies to London\". Much of that episode, which involved Lucy\u2019s unfamiliarity with air travel, was based on an unsold pilot written and shot in 1960.However Lucy In London was not explicit in its connection to The Lucy Show.  This would accommodate viewers who may not have seen The Lucy Show prior to the standalone special. \nLaurence Olivier was signed to appear in Lucy in London, but withdrew from the production prior to shooting.Ball went through 15 different wigs during the production.  Cleo Smith, Ball's cousin and the executive in charge of this production, later recalled that problems arose in photographing the star on the London locations, where the use of heavy stage make-up and filtered lighting that was employed for her studio-based program could not be repeated.  Ball's biographer Geoffrey Mark Fidelman would later remark that the actress \"looked old\" throughout the show due to difficulties in establishing flattering lighting for the outdoor sequences.Lucy in London was broadcast on October 24, 1966, replacing both The Lucy Show and The Andy Griffith Show for that evening. Viewership was high for the special (finishing as the most-watched telecast of the week) but critical responses were very poor, with Variety complaining: \"What had promised to be one of the season's major specials turned out to be a major disappointment.\"  Ball opted not to pursue the creation of the remaining two specials in her contract and severed ties with director Steve Binder.

Shadows of Their Wings) is a 1942 American war film in Technicolor,  directed by Michael Curtiz and starring James Cagney. It was produced by William Cagney (Cagney's brother), with Hal B. Wallis as executive producer. The screenplay was written by Arthur T. Horman, Richard Macaulay, and Norman Reilly Raine, based on a story by Horman and Roland Gillett. The cinematography was by Wilfred M. Cline and Sol Polito and was notable in that it was the first feature-length Hollywood production filmed entirely in Canada.The film stars James Cagney and Dennis Morgan as Canadian pilots who do their part in the Second World War, and features Brenda Marshall, Alan Hale Sr., George Tobias, Reginald Gardiner, and Reginald Denny in supporting roles. The title of the film came from a phrase used by Billy Bishop, the First World War fighter ace, who played himself in the film.

G. Clark, the public relations director of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, was heavily involved in promoting a film project that was initially identified as \"Bush Pilots\" based on a script submitted by Canadian screenwriters. With RCAF backing, Hal Wallis and Jack Warner were approached in Hollywood to undertake a \"patriotic film.\" Warner was enthusiastic, and began the task of casting a major star to front the project. After considering Raymond Massey, Errol Flynn, and Clark Gable, the decision was made to cast George Brent, but Warner Bros. was unsure whether he could carry the film.Numerous attempts to rewrite the script into a more acceptable form resulted in a final screenplay now titled \"Captains of the Clouds\". The name was borrowed from a Victory Loans speech given by Billy Bishop. The only holdup was casting, which was resolved when Warner persuaded its resident \"cocky guy\" (as producer Jerry Wald had dubbed him), 42-year-old James Cagney, to take on the lead male role.This film was Cagney's first in Technicolor. His participation in the production has been characterized as reluctant, and he accepted only after his brother was taken on as an associate producer. He quipped, \"I didn't like this story the last four times I did it and I don't like it now!\" and feared that he was immersed in one of his trademark Warner Bros. \"potboilers\", playing a role he had reprised numerous times. However, in certain scenes, Cagney improvised. His loose interpretation is evident in a cabin scene when he is playing against his cronies. Cagney veers off the script, reverting to the cocky persona he had cultivated in countless earlier features.Captains of the Clouds was produced with the full cooperation of the Royal Canadian Air Force to promote enlistment in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. (It was also intended as a rousing \"war preparedness\" film for American audiences, but by the time it was released, the U.S. was already at war; nevertheless it did serve as a showcase of the Canadian war effort.) The Warner Bros. principal cast and production crew of over 80 technicians, along with \"half a million dollars of colour cinematography equipment,\" came from Hollywood, crossing into Canada on July 12, 1941. The film was shot from mid-July to mid-October 1941. Scenes filmed in Ottawa include several views of the historic Chateau Laurier hotel, Parliament, the former Ottawa Union Station and the Cenotaph area.Much of the early footage involved a number of bush planes at the Woodcliff Camp on Trout Lake in North Bay, Ontario, and nearby Camp Caribou on Jumping Cariboo Lake in Marten River, Ontario. The aerial sequences were under the direction of Paul Mantz, a long-time Hollywood stunt pilot, who used a Stinson Model A trimotor camera ship. MacLean's aircraft, CF-HGO on-screen, was a Noorduyn Norseman flown by veteran stunt pilot Frank Clarke (who doubled for James Cagney in flying scenes), Johnny Dutton's silver CF-NBP was an actual Fairchild 71C bush plane,  while Laurentian Air Service's Waco EGC-7 and AGC-8 cabin aircraft provided the other float planes. In addition, there was a Waco CJC, registered as CF-AVW (transformed into CF-JPY in the movie), which belonged to Albert Racicot, a Montreal-based plane dealer and aviation mechanics who, at the time, was also one of the several instructors hired by the Canadian government to train military pilots involved in World War II.\nPrincipal photography did not go well; a number of incidents slowed production. One of the huskies that was key to a scene bit Morgan, opening up a gash on his hand. Cagney, in an uncharacteristic move, decided to forgo a stunt double and play the scene himself in which his character is struck by a whirling propeller. At first things proceeded smoothly, but when it came time for him to fall into the lake, he overdid it and suffered a real concussion, putting the 10-day shoot at North Bay, Ontario farther behind schedule. Weather was a constant challenge, and with the need to ensure continuity, small scenes became unnecessarily complex; as a result, a typical shooting day lasted almost into the night. One 30-second scene with all the principals running along the dock took an entire day to complete, with Cagney, Hale, and Tobias barely able to stand at the end of filming. With a Hollywood production in their midst, North Bay residents became such a persistent nuisance that the crew reverted to sending messages out of the location site by homing pigeons. The military background sequences were shot at RCAF Air Stations at Uplands, Trenton, Dartmouth, Jarvis, and Mountain View. The \"Wings Parade\" (officially the \"Presentation of Wings Ceremony\") filmed at the No. 2 Service Training School at RCAF Uplands was an actual graduation service for 110 RCAF cadets. It proved to be the most complex scene of the film. Over 100 Harvard training aircraft flew overhead in a salute to the graduates.The climactic ferry mission was staged out over the Atlantic from RCAF Station Dartmouth using the base's operational Lockheed Hudson bombers, along with a repainted Hawker Hurricane that posed as the German Bf 109. Due to the prominent Luftwaffe markings on the RCAF fighter, special alerts had to be posted in order to prevent \"trigger-happy\" home defence gunners from firing at it.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Set in the American South against the backdrop of the Civil War and the Reconstruction era, the film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, following her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland), and her subsequent marriage to Rhett Butler (Clark Gable).\nThe film had a troubled production. The start of filming was delayed for two years until January 1939 because Selznick was determined to secure Gable for the role of Rhett, and concluded in July. The role of Scarlett was challenging to cast, and 1,400 unknown women were interviewed for the part. Sidney Howard's original screenplay underwent many revisions by several writers to reduce it to a suitable length.

The second installment in the Evil Dead film series, it is considered both a remake and sequel (or \"re-quel\") to The Evil Dead (1981). It stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who vacations with his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods. He discovers an audio tape of recitations from a book of ancient texts, and when the recording is played, it unleashes a number of demons which possess and torment him.\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of Crimewave (1985), Raimi, producer Robert Tapert, and Campbell began work on a sequel to The Evil Dead at the insistence of their publicist Irvin Shapiro. Having endorsed the original film, author Stephen King brought the project to the attention of producer Dino De Laurentiis, with whom he had been making his directorial debut Maximum Overdrive (1986). De Laurentiis agreed to provide financial backing, and assigned the filmmakers a considerably larger budget than they had worked with on the original film. Although Raimi had devised a premise set in the Middle Ages and involving time travel, De Laurentiis requested that the film be similar to its predecessor.\nEvil Dead II was shot in Wadesboro, North Carolina and Detroit, Michigan in 1986, and featured extensive stop-motion animation and prosthetic makeup effects created by a team of artists that included Mark Shostrom, Greg Nicotero, Robert Kurtzman and Tom Sullivan, the latter of whom returned from the original film. The finished film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987; due to its high level of violence, it was released through a pseudonymous distributor to curb an anticipated X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Much like The Evil Dead, it was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its humor, Raimi's direction, and Campbell's performance; many have considered it superior to its predecessor and similarly as \none of the greatest horror films ever made. Despite being given a somewhat limited release, it was a minor box office success, grossing just under $6 million.\nAs with the first film, Evil Dead II has accumulated a large, international cult following. In 1992, it was followed by the direct sequel Army of Darkness, which utilized Raimi's original premise; in 2013, it was followed by the soft reboot and continuation Evil Dead; and in 2015, it was followed by the television series Ash vs Evil Dead.

The edition was prepared from the original 1966 mono master, by Mark Linett, who used Sonic Solutions' No Noise processing to mitigate damage that the physical master had accrued. It became one of the first CDs to sell more than a million copies.\nIn 1995, DCC issued a 20-bit audiophile version that was mastered by engineer Steve Hoffman.

It was initially met with a lukewarm critical and commercial response in the United States, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Top LPs chart. In the United Kingdom, the album was lauded by critics and reached number 2 on the Record Retailer chart, remaining in the top ten for six months. Promoted there as \"the most progressive pop album ever\", Pet Sounds was recognized for its ambitious production, sophisticated music, and emotional lyrics. It is now considered to be among the greatest and most influential albums in music history.The album was produced, arranged, and almost entirely composed by Brian Wilson with guest lyricist Tony Asher. It was recorded largely between January and April 1966, a year after Wilson had quit touring with his bandmates and debuted a more progressive sound with The Beach Boys Today! Wilson viewed Pet Sounds as effectively a solo album and credited part of its inspiration to marijuana and a newfound spiritual enlightenment. Galvanized by the work of his idol Phil Spector and rival group the Beatles, his goal was to create \"the greatest rock album ever made\", one without filler. An early concept album, it consists mainly of introspective and semi-autobiographical songs like \"You Still Believe in Me\", about a lover's unwavering loyalty; \"I Know There's an Answer\", a critique of LSD users; and \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\", about social alienation.\nIncorporating elements of pop, jazz, exotica, classical, and the avant-garde, Wilson's Wall of Sound\u2013based orchestrations mixed conventional rock set-ups with elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, found sounds, and instruments rarely if ever associated with rock, such as bicycle bells, French horn, flutes, Electro-Theremin, string sections, and soda cans. It marked the most complex instrumental and vocal parts of any Beach Boys album, and the first in which studio musicians (such as the Wrecking Crew) replaced the band on most of the instrumental tracks. The album could not be reproduced live and was the first time that any group departed from their usual small-ensemble pop/rock band format for a whole LP. Its unprecedented total production cost exceeded $70,000 (equivalent to $660,000 in 2023). Lead single \"Caroline, No\" was issued as Wilson's official solo debut. It was followed by two singles credited to the group: \"Sloop John B\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (backed with \"God Only Knows\").  A planned successor album, Smile, was never finished.\nPet Sounds revolutionized music production and the role of professional record producers, especially through Wilson's pioneering studio-as-instrument praxis. The record contributed to the cultural legitimization of popular music, a greater public appreciation for albums, the popularity of synthesizers, and the development of psychedelic music and progressive/art rock. It also introduced novel approaches to orchestration, chord voicings, and structural harmonies; for example, most of the compositions feature a weak tonal center, rendering their key signatures ambiguous. Although it had been widely revered by industry insiders, the album was obscure to mass audiences before being reissued in the 1990s, after which it topped several critics' and musicians' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by NME, Mojo, Uncut, and The Times. The album has also been consistently ranked number 2 in all editions of Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". As a solo artist, Wilson embarked on a string of Pet Sounds concert tours in the early 2000s and late 2010s. In 2004, the album was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Pet Sounds is certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), indicating over one million units sold in the United States.

With the voices of Cliff Edwards, Dickie Jones, Christian Rub, Walter Catlett, Charles Judels, Evelyn Venable, and Frankie Darro, the film follows a wooden puppet, Pinocchio, who is created by an old woodcarver, Geppetto, and brought to life by a blue fairy. Wishing to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself to be \"brave, truthful, and unselfish.\" Along his journey, Pinocchio encounters several characters representing the temptations and consequences of wrongdoing, as a cricket named Jiminy, who takes the role of Pinocchio's conscience, attempts to guide him in matters of right and wrong.\nThe film was adapted by several storyboard artists from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske, and the film's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts. Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles and machinery as well as natural elements such as rain, water, lightning, smoke, and shadow. After premiering at the Center Theatre in New York City on February 7, 1940, Pinocchio was released in theatres on February 23, 1940.\nAlthough it received critical acclaim and became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award \u2014 winning two for Best Music, Original Score and for Best Music, Original Song for \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" \u2014 it was initially a commercial failure, mainly due to World War II cutting off the European and Asian markets.

She informs him that if he proves himself to be brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy. When Jiminy reveals himself, the Blue Fairy assigns him to be Pinocchio's conscience. Geppetto awakens upon hearing the commotion from Pinocchio falling, and is overjoyed to discover that he is alive and will become a real boy.\nThe next morning, while walking to school, Pinocchio is led astray by con artist fox Honest John and his sidekick Gideon the Cat. Honest John convinces him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction, but when he tries to go home, Stromboli locks him in a bird cage and leaves to tour the world with Pinocchio. After Jiminy unsuccessfully tries to free his friend, the Blue Fairy appears, and an anxious Pinocchio lies about what happened, causing his nose to grow. The Blue Fairy restores his nose and frees Pinocchio when he promises to make amends, but warns him that she can offer no further help.\nMeanwhile, a mysterious Coachman hires Honest John to find disobedient boys for him to take to Pleasure Island. Though the Coachman's implication of what happens to the boys frightens Honest John and Gideon, the former reluctantly accepts the job and finds Pinocchio, convincing him to take a vacation on Pleasure Island. On the way to the island, Pinocchio befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. At Pleasure Island, without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio, Lampwick, and many other boys soon engage in vices such as vandalism, fighting, smoking and drinking. Jiminy eventually finds Pinocchio in a billiard hall smoking and playing pool with Lampwick, and the two have a falling out after Pinocchio defends Lampwick for his actions. As Jiminy tries to leave Pleasure Island, he discovers that the island hides a horrible curse that turns the boys into donkeys after they make \"jackasses\" of themselves, and they are sold by the Coachman into slave labor. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick transform into a donkey, and with Jiminy's help, he escapes before he can be fully transformed, though he still has a donkey's ears and tail.\nUpon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find Geppetto\u2019s workshop deserted and get a letter from the Blue Fairy in the form of a dove, stating that Geppetto went out looking for Pinocchio and sailed to Pleasure Island.

Pinocchio selflessly pulls Geppetto to safety in a cove just as Monstro crashes into it, but Pinocchio dies in the process.\nBack at home, Geppetto, Jiminy, Figaro, and Cleo mourn Pinocchio. However, having succeeded in proving himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, Pinocchio is revived and turned into a real human boy by the Blue Fairy, much to everyone's joy.

It was released on June 8, 2018, through Wicked Awesome Records and GOOD Music, and distributed by Def Jam Recordings. Prior to the release, West and Cudi had collaborated on each others' work since 2008, although they experienced personal quarrels due to creative differences. The first studio sessions for the album began after the two reunited in late 2016.\nGuest contributions are included on Kids See Ghosts from Pusha T, Yasiin Bey, and Ty Dolla Sign, as well as a vocal sample of Louis Prima, who is credited posthumously as a featured artist. Kids See Ghosts handled the majority of the stylistically fragmented production that includes varying elements, with further contributions by Dot da Genius, Mike Dean, and Plain Pat, among others. The album was the third of five records produced by West in Jackson Hole as a part of the \"Wyoming Sessions\", each being released weekly in the summer of 2018. It succeeded the release of Pusha T's Daytona and West's Ye, while preceded the release of Nas' Nasir and Teyana Taylor's K.T.S.E.\nCommentators noted the genre of Kids See Ghosts as a fusion of psychedelia and hip hop. The lyrical content includes references to mental health issues, which both West and Cudi had suffered from previously. The cover art was designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami; he based it on Hokusai's landscape print series, Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji.

Although sales were modest initially, its commercial performance was aided by two hit singles \u2013 \"Jet\" and \"Band on the Run\" \u2013 such that it became the top-selling studio album of 1974 in the United Kingdom and Australia, in addition to revitalising McCartney's critical standing. It remains McCartney's most successful album and the most celebrated of his post-Beatles works.\nThe album was mostly recorded at EMI's studio in Lagos, Nigeria, as McCartney wanted to make an album in an exotic location. Shortly before departing for Lagos, drummer Denny Seiwell and guitarist Henry McCullough left the group. With no time to recruit replacements, McCartney went into the studio with just his wife Linda and Denny Laine. McCartney therefore played bass, drums, percussion and most of the lead guitar parts. The studio was of poor quality and conditions in Nigeria were tense and difficult; the McCartneys were robbed at knifepoint, losing a bag of song lyrics and demo tapes. After the band's return to England, final overdubs and further recording were carried out in London, mostly at AIR Studios.\nIn 2000, Q magazine placed Band on the Run at number 75 in its list of the \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever\".

On the UK Albums Chart, Band on the Run climbed to number 9 on 22 December, remaining there for a second week before dropping to number 13. On America's Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, it peaked at number 7 on 2 February 1974, and then spent the next six weeks in the lower reaches of the top ten. The album went on to achieve considerable success, however, thanks to the popularity of the two singles culled from it: \"Jet\" and the title track. Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden described Band on the Run as the first Beatles-related release to be \"planned with a marketing strategy\", as Capitol Records now assumed a fully active role in promoting the album following the removal of Klein's ABKCO Industries as managers of Apple. Although McCartney had been reluctant to issue album tracks as singles, the public's apparent lack of interest in Band on the Run led him to agree to the recommendations of Capitol's head of marketing, Al Coury, who had similarly pushed for the inclusion of \"Helen Wheels\" on the album's American release. McCartney therefore authorised single edits of the two A-sides taken from the album.\"Jet\" was issued as a single in America on 28 January with \"Mamunia\" as the B-side, although \"Let Me Roll It\", which was the B-side of the UK release, replaced \"Mamunia\" on 15 February. The single's success provided new impetus for the album, which hit number 2 in the UK at the end of March and topped Billboard's listings on 13 April. Apple issued \"Band on the Run\" as a single in America on 8 April, backed by \"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five\"; the UK release followed on 28 June, with the non-album instrumental \"Zoo Gang\" as the B-side. Due to the popularity of \"Band on the Run\", the album returned to number 1 on the Billboard chart on 8 June, when the single simultaneously topped the Hot 100. In Britain, the album finally hit number 1 on 27 July, and it stayed there for seven consecutive weeks. On the alternative UK listings compiled by Melody Maker, Band on the Run remained in the top ten from 26 January through 23 November 1974. During that time, its chart performance similarly reflected the popularity of the two singles, with the album spending three weeks at number 2 in April, and six weeks at number 1 throughout August and the first week of September.The album topped the Billboard chart on three separate occasions during 1974, and was the top selling album of that year in Australia and Canada. In Britain, it came second in the year-end standings, behind the compilation The Singles: 1969\u20131973 by the Carpenters. Through this success with Wings, McCartney established himself as the most commercially successful of the four former Beatles. Author Robert Rodriguez views the album's arrival at number 1 in America in April 1974 as the moment when McCartney usurped George Harrison as the \"ex-Beatle Most Likely to Succeed\", and the beginning of a period of public acclaim that reached its zenith with the Wings Over America Tour in 1976.Band on the Run was eventually certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and would go on to sell 6 million copies worldwide, becoming EMI's top selling album of the 1970s in the UK. Its continued success through 1974 was also beneficial in allowing Wings to recruit a new guitarist and drummer, and to integrate them into the band before beginning new recordings.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was to be an LP of twelve tracks assembled from modular fragments, the same editing process used for their \"Good Vibrations\" single. Instead, after a year of recording, the album was shelved and the group released a downscaled version, Smiley Smile, in September 1967. Over the next four decades, few of the original Smile tracks were officially released, and the project came to be regarded as the most legendary unreleased album in popular music history.The album was produced and almost entirely composed by Brian Wilson with guest lyricist and assistant arranger Van Dyke Parks, both of whom conceived the project as a riposte to the British sensibilities that had dominated popular music of the era. Wilson touted Smile as a \"teenage symphony to God\" to surpass Pet Sounds. It was a concept album that was planned to feature word paintings, tape manipulation, more elaborate vocal arrangements, experiments with musical acoustics, themes of youth and innocence, and comedic interludes, with influences drawn from mysticism, pre-rock and roll pop, doo-wop, jazz, ragtime, musique concr\u00e8te, classical, American history, poetry, spirituality, and cartoons. Over 50 hours of tape was recorded, ranging from musical and spoken word to sound effects and role-playing. The lead single would have been \"Heroes and Villains\", about the early history of California, or \"Vega-Tables\", a tongue-in-cheek promotion of organic food.\nNumerous issues, including legal entanglements with Capitol Records, Wilson's uncompromising perfectionism and mental instabilities, as well as Parks' withdrawal from the project in early 1967, prevented the album's completion. Most of the tracks were produced between August and December 1966, but few were ever finished, and the album's structure was never finalized. Afraid of the public's reaction to his work, Wilson blocked attempts to release Smile in the subsequent years. After the group issued a truncated version of \"Heroes and Villains\", they reworked some of the material into new songs, such as \"Cool, Cool Water\", and completed only three more tracks, \"Our Prayer\", \"Cabinessence\" and \"Surf's Up\". A mythology grew around the project, and its unfulfilled potential inspired many artists, especially those in indie rock, post-punk, electronic, and chamber pop genres.\n\nSmile had been estimated to be \"50% done\" by mid-1967. Since the 1980s, extensive session recordings have circulated widely on bootlegs, allowing fans to assemble hypothetical versions of a finished album, adding to its legacy as an interactive project. Responding to this, Capitol included a loose reconstruction of the album on the 1993 box set Good Vibrations. In 2004, Wilson, Parks, and Darian Sahanaja arranged a version of Smile for concert performances, billed as Brian Wilson Presents Smile, which Wilson then adapted into a solo album. He stated that this version differed substantially from his original vision. The 2011 compilation The Smile Sessions was the first official package devoted to the original Beach Boys' recordings and included an approximation of the completed album.

The film stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow, and Gunnar Hansen. The plot follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate. Although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by the crimes of murderer Ed Gein, its plot is largely fictional.\nHooper produced the film for less than $140,000 ($900,000 adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, so that he could finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor, but it was eventually acquired by the Bryanston Distributing Company. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally, being banned in several countries, and numerous theaters stopped showing the film in response to complaints about its violence.\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released in the United States on October 11, 1974.  While the film initially received mixed reception from critics, it was highly profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office, equivalent with roughly over $150.8 million as of 2019, selling over 16.5 million tickets in 1974. It has since gained a reputation as one of the best and most influential horror films. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons, the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, masked figure, and the killing of victims. It led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, prequels, a remake, comic books, and video games.", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "162_68680", "text": "Marilyn Burns as Sally Hardesty\nAllen Danziger as Jerry\nPaul A.

After the retirement of BBFC Director James Ferman in 1999, the board passed the film uncut for theatrical and video distribution with an 18 certificate, almost 25 years after the original release. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released on LaserDisc in the United States in November 1993. It was initially released on DVD in October 1998 in the United States, May 2000 in the United Kingdom and 2001 in Australia.\nIn 2005 the film received a 2K scan and full restoration from the original 16mm A/B rolls, which was subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2014, a more extensive 4K restoration, supervised by Hooper, using the original 16mm A/B reversal rolls, was carried out. After a screening in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, this was also released on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide. Dark Sky Films' US 40th Anniversary Edition was nominated for Best DVD/BD Special Edition Release at the 2015 Saturn Awards.In 1982, shortly after The Texas Chain Saw Massacre established itself as a success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls. As one of the first horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.The film has been followed by eight other films to date, including sequels, prequels and remakes. The first sequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), was considerably more graphic and violent than the original and was banned in Australia for 20 years before it was released on DVD in a revised special edition in October 2006. Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) was the second sequel to appear, though Hooper did not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts with another film, Spontaneous Combustion. Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, was released in 1995. While briefly acknowledging the events of the preceding two sequels, its plot makes it a virtual remake of the 1974 original. A straight remake, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was released by Platinum Dunes and New Line Cinema in 2003. It was followed by a prequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, in 2006.

It is loosely based on the 1837 Danish fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. The film was written and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements and produced by Musker and Howard Ashman, who also wrote the film's songs with Alan Menken. Menken also composed the film's score. Featuring the voices of Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jodi Benson, Pat Carroll, Paddi Edwards, Buddy Hackett, Jason Marin, Kenneth Mars, Ben Wright and Samuel E. Wright, The Little Mermaid tells the story of a teenage mermaid princess named Ariel, who dreams of becoming human and falls in love with a human prince named Eric, which leads her to make a magic deal with the sea witch, Ursula, to become human and be with him.\nWalt Disney planned to put the story in a proposed package film containing Andersen's stories, but scrapped the project. In 1985, while working on The Great Mouse Detective (1986), Clements and Musker decided to adapt the fairy tale and proposed it to Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who initially declined due to its similarities to a proposed sequel to the 1984 film Splash, but ultimately approved of it. Ashman became involved and brought in Menken. With supervision from Katzenberg, they made a Broadway-style structure with musical numbers as the staff was working on Oliver & Company (1988). Katzenberg warned that the film would earn less since it appealed to female viewers, but he eventually became convinced that it would be Disney's first blockbuster hit.\nThe Little Mermaid was released to theaters on November 17, 1989, to critical acclaim, earning praise for the animation, music, and characters. It was also a commercial success, garnering $84 million at the domestic box office during its initial release, and $235 million in total lifetime gross worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1989. Along with the major success of both Disney's 1986 animated film The Great Mouse Detective and the 1988 Disney/Amblin live-action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Little Mermaid is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after some films produced by Disney were struggling. It also marked the start of the era known as the Disney Renaissance. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (\"Under the Sea\").\nThe film's success led to a media franchise. A direct-to-video sequel was released in 2000, focusing on Ariel's daughter, Melody. A prequel followed in 2008.

It retells the folktale \"Little Red Riding Hood\" as a police procedural, using backstories to show multiple characters' points of view. It was produced independently by Blue Yonder Films with Kanbar Entertainment, directed and written by Cory Edwards along with Todd Edwards, and Tony Leech, and produced by Katie Hooten, Maurice Kanbar, David K. Lovegren, Sue Bea Montgomery, and Preston Stutzman. The film features the voices of Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, Jim Belushi, Patrick Warburton, Anthony Anderson, David Ogden Stiers, Xzibit, Chazz Palminteri, and Andy Dick.\nHoodwinked! was among the earliest computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's low budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines with a stylized design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until near the end of production, and while the company had several roles recast with higher-profile actors, it otherwise made few changes to the film. Structurally, the film was inspired by non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon and Pulp Fiction. It was released shortly after the first two installments in the successful Shrek series, which accentuated the fairy tale parody genre of which Hoodwinked! is a part. Hoodwinked!, however, intentionally deviated from the Shrek series in its style of humor and in certain plot elements. This was in part based on Cory Edwards' concerns over exposing children to the high level of cynicism often found in the genre.\nThe film was released by the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles, California, and Philadelphia on December 16, 2005, for a one-week engagement before expanding nationwide on January 13, 2006. Critical reception to the film was varied; although its script and voice performances were praised by many reviews, its animation quality was heavily criticized.

Director Cory Edwards explained in a 2009 interview that the film's actual budget was under $8 million. Any of these figures would be significantly lower than is typical for a computer-animated film's budget. At the time of Hoodwinked!'s production, the costs of computer-animation software had only recently decreased to a price that was accessible to more than just major studios, and leading up to the film's release, producer David Lovegren said, \"Six or seven years ago, the idea of doing Hoodwinked! as an independent [animated] feature would have been impossible\".The filmmakers only made the film independently by necessity, and Cory Edwards has said, \"It's not a model to be followed.

When Zero-X suffers a malfunction during re-entry, it is up to life-saving organisation International Rescue, supported by its technologically-advanced Thunderbird machines, to activate the trapped crew's escape pod before the spacecraft hits the ground.\nFilmed between March and June 1966 at Century 21's studios on the Slough Trading Estate and on location in Portugal, Thunderbirds Are Go features guest appearances by puppet versions of Cliff Richard and The Shadows, who also contributed to the film's score. It was the first film to be shot using an early form of video assist called \"Add-a-Vision\". The film's special effects sequences, directed by Derek Meddings, took six months to complete.\nAlthough early reviews praised the film as a successful cinematic transfer of the TV series, Thunderbirds Are Go drew a lukewarm public response and proved to be a box office failure. Later reviews would criticise the film for its minimal characterisation, lengthy effects shots, and inclusion of a fantasy dream sequence centring on Richard and The Shadows. Surprised by the film's underperformance, and confident that Thunderbirds still had cinematic potential, distributors United Artists ordered a sequel, Thunderbird 6. However, this too received a mediocre critical and commercial response and caused the franchise to be abandoned until the early 2000s.

It was released on June 25, 1984, by Warner Bros. Records as the soundtrack album to the 1984 film of the same name. Purple Rain was musically denser than Prince's previous albums, emphasizing full band performances, and multiple layers of guitars, keyboards, electronic synthesizer effects, drum machines, and other instruments.\nMuch of the album had a grandiose, synthesized, and psychedelic sheen to the production and performances. The music on Purple Rain is generally regarded as the most pop-oriented of Prince's career, though a number of elements point towards the more experimental records Prince would release after Purple Rain. The music video for the album's lead single \"When Doves Cry\" sparked controversy among network executives, who thought its sexual nature was too explicit for television. The risqu\u00e9 lyrics of \"Darling Nikki\" raised complaints from Tipper Gore and the Parents Music Resource Center and contributed to the implementation of Parental Advisory stickers and imprints on album covers.\nPurple Rain became Prince's first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. The album spent 24 consecutive weeks atop on the Billboard 200 and was present on the chart for a total of 167 weeks. \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"Purple Rain\" peaked at number two and \"I Would Die 4 U\" peaked at number eight. In May 1996, the album was certified 13\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is Prince's commercial peak, with total sales standing at 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Prince and the Revolution won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, while Prince also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Purple Rain.\nMusic critics noted the innovative and experimental aspects of the soundtrack's music, most famously on the spare, bass-less \"When Doves Cry\". Other aspects of the music, especially its synthesis of electronic elements with organic instrumentation and full-band performances along with its consolidation of rock and R&B, were identified by critics as distinguishing, even experimental factors.

Melody Maker called it \"mixed-up and muddled\", with the exception of \"All Along the Watchtower\", which the magazine called a masterpiece. Reviewing for Rolling Stone in 1968, Tony Glover said Hendrix's original songs sometimes sound unstructured and was somewhat disappointed by the \"heavy handed guitar\" on \"1983...

During its recording, Kramer experimented with innovative studio techniques such as backmasking, chorus effect, echo, and flanging, which AllMusic's Cub Koda said recontextualized Hendrix's psychedelic and funk sounds on the album.Electric Ladyland is a cross-section of Hendrix's wide range of musical talent. It includes examples of several genres and styles of music: the psychedelic \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\", a UK single the previous summer (1967), the extended blues jam \"Voodoo Chile\", the New Orleans-style R&B of Earl King's \"Come On\", the epic studio production of \"1983...

{"id": "162_265", "question": "Who was the producer of the film Fantasia?", "ctxs": [{"id": "162_68969", "text": "Fantasia is a 1940 American animated musical anthology film produced by Walt Disney Productions, with story direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer and production supervision by Walt Disney and Ben Sharpsteen. It consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski, seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film's Master of Ceremonies who introduces each segment in live action.\nDisney settled on the film's concept in 1938 as work neared completion on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, originally an elaborate Silly Symphony cartoon designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs surpassed what the short could earn, Disney decided to include it in a feature-length film of multiple segments set to classical pieces with Stokowski and Taylor as collaborators. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound system developed by Disney and RCA that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereo and a precursor to surround sound.\nFantasia was first released as a theatrical roadshow that was held in 13 cities across the U.S. between 1940 and 1941 by RKO Radio Pictures; the first began at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. While acclaimed by critics, it failed to make a profit owing to World War II's cutting off distribution to the European market, the film's high production costs, and the expense of building Fantasound equipment and leasing theatres for the roadshow presentations. Since 1942, the film has been reissued multiple times by RKO Radio Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution with its original footage and audio being deleted, modified, or restored in each version. When adjusted for inflation, Fantasia is the 23rd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S.\nThe Fantasia franchise has grown to include video games, Disneyland attractions, and a live concert series. A sequel, Fantasia 2000, co-produced by Walt's nephew Roy E. Disney, was released in 1999. Fantasia has grown in reputation over the years and is now widely acclaimed as one of the greatest animated films of all time; in 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their 100 Years...100 Movies and the fifth greatest animated film in their 10 Top 10 list. In 1990, Fantasia was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"", "hasanswer": true}, {"id": "162_68972", "text": "Musical score conducted by Leopold Stokowski.

Recording sessions took place at the Hit Factory in New York City between August and October 1980. The final album features songs from both Lennon and Ono, largely alternating between the two in its track listing. Other tracks recorded by Lennon from the sessions were compiled by Ono for release on Milk and Honey in 1984.\nUpon its release, the album stalled on music charts and received largely negative reviews from music critics, with many focusing on the album's idealisation of Lennon and Ono's marriage. However, following Lennon's murder three weeks after its release, it became a worldwide commercial success and went on to win the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.
