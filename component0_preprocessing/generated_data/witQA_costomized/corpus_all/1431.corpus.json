        "content": "Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme broadcast by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called the Doctor, an extraterrestrial being who appears to be human. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS. The TARDIS exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. With various companions, the Doctor combats foes, works to save civilisations and helps people in need. Beginning with William Hartnell, thirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor; in 2017 Jodie Whittaker became the first woman to officially play the role on television. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation, a plot device in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has gained a cult following. It has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. Fans of the series are sometimes referred to as Whovians. The programme is listed in Guinness World Records as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world, as well as the \"most successful\" science fiction series of all time, based on its overall broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes traffic. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot, in the form of a television film titled Doctor Who. The programme was relaunched in 2005, and since then has been produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. Doctor Who has also spawned numerous spin-offs, including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series Torchwood (2006\u20132011), The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007\u20132011), K-9 (2009\u20132010), and Class (2016). It has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture."

        "content": "Doctor Who follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue Time Lord with somewhat unknown origins who goes by the name \"the Doctor\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey, the planet of the Time Lords, in a stolen TARDIS (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a time machine that travels by materialising into, and dematerialising out of, the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise. Due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British police box. Across time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity, and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile sonic screwdriver. The Doctor rarely travels alone and is often joined by one or more companions on these adventures; these companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force UNIT when Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to regenerate when there is mortal damage to the body. The Doctor's various incarnations have gained numerous recurring enemies during their travels, including the Daleks, their creator Davros, the Cybermen, and the renegade Time Lord the Master."

        "content": "Doctor Who first appeared on the BBC Television Service at 17:16:20 GMT on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, because of coverage of the assassination of John F. Kennedy the previous day. It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama Sydney Newman was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series. The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\". According to Lambert, \"We didn't have a lot of choice\u2014we only had the Dalek serial to go\u00a0... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial\u00a0\u2013 The Daleks (also known as The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom. The BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on BBC 1. Due to his increasingly poor health, the first actor to play the Doctor, William Hartnell, was replaced by the younger Patrick Troughton in 1966. In 1970, Jon Pertwee replaced Troughton and the series at that point moved from black and white to colour. In 1974, Tom Baker was cast as the Doctor. His eccentric style of dress and quirky personality became hugely popular, with viewing figures for the show returning to a level not seen since the height of \"Dalekmania\" a decade earlier. In 1981, after a record seven years in the role, Baker was replaced by Peter Davison, at 29 by far the youngest actor to be cast as the character in the series' first run and, in 1984, Colin Baker replaced Davison. In 1985, the channel's controller Michael Grade attempted to cancel the series, but this became an 18-month hiatus instead. He also had Colin Baker removed from the starring role in 1986. The role was recast with Sylvester McCoy, but falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production ended in 1989 by Peter Cregeen, the BBC's new head of series. Although it was effectively cancelled with the decision not to commission a planned 27th season, which would have been broadcast in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed, over several years, that the series would return. While in-house production had ceased, the BBC hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show. Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th season was still in production. Segal's negotiations eventually led to a Doctor Who television film, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996, as an international co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide. Starring Paul McGann as the Doctor, the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1\u00a0million viewers), but was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series. Licensed media such as novels and audio plays provided new stories, but, as a television programme, Doctor Who remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year, BBC Television announced the in-house production of a new series, after several years of attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The executive producers of the new incarnation of the series were writer Russell T Davies and BBC Cymru Wales head of drama Julie Gardner. Starring Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor, Doctor Who finally returned with the episode \"Rose\" on BBC One on 26 March 2005. Eccleston left after one series and was replaced by David Tennant. There have since been eleven further series in 2006\u20132008, 2010\u20132015, 2017\u20132018, 2020, and Christmas/New Year's Day specials every year since 2005. No full series was broadcast in 2009, although four additional specials starring Tennant were made. Davies left the show in 2010 after the end of series 4 and the David Tennant specials were completed. Steven Moffat, a writer under Davies, was announced as his successor, along with Matt Smith as the new Doctor. Smith decided to leave the role of the Doctor in the 50th anniversary year. He was replaced by Peter Capaldi. In January 2016, Moffat announced that he would step down after the 2017 finale, to be replaced by Chris Chibnall in 2018. The tenth series debuted in April 2017, with a Christmas special preceding it in 2016. Jodie Whittaker was announced as the first female Doctor, and has appeared in two series and is scheduled to reprise her role in a third, shorter series due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Whittaker and Chibnall announced that they would depart the show after a series of 2022 specials following the 13th series. Davies will return as showrunner for the show's 14th series, twelve years after he had left the show previously, at which point Bad Wolf will take over production of the series. Bad Wolf's involvement will see Gardner return to the series alongside Davies, as well as Jane Tranter, who recommissioned the series in 2005. The 2005 version of Doctor Who is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963\u20131989 series and the 1996 telefilm. This is similar to the 1988 continuation of Mission Impossible, but differs from most other series' relaunches of the time which have either been reboots (for example, Battlestar Galactica and Bionic Woman) or set in the same universe as the original, but in a different time period and with different characters (for example, Star Trek: The Next Generation and spin-offs). The programme has been sold to many other countries worldwide (see Viewership)."

        "content": "It has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy the previous day; in fact it went out after a delay of eighty seconds. The BBC believed that coverage of the assassination, as well as a series of power blackouts across the country, had caused many viewers to miss this introduction to a new series, and it was broadcast again on 30 November 1963, just before episode two. The programme soon became a national institution in the United Kingdom, with a large following among the general viewing audience. With popularity came controversy over the show's suitability for children. Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly complained to the BBC over what she saw as the show's violent, frightening and gory content. According to Radio Times, the series \"never had a more implacable foe than Mary Whitehouse\". A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence (\"any act[s] which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental\") Doctor Who was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time. The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as \"very unsuitable\" for family viewing. Responding to the findings of the survey in The Times newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, \"to compare the violence of Dr Who, sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously.\" During Jon Pertwee's second season as the Doctor, in the serial Terror of the Autons (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims, and blank-featured policemen marked the apex of the show's ability to frighten children. Other notable moments in that decade include a disembodied brain falling to the floor in The Brain of Morbius and the Doctor apparently being drowned by a villain in The Deadly Assassin (both 1976). Mary Whitehouse's complaint about the latter incident prompted a change in BBC policy towards the series, with much tighter controls imposed on the production team, and the series' next producer, Graham Williams, was under a directive to take out \"anything graphic in the depiction of violence\". John Nathan-Turner produced the series during the 1980s and said in the documentary More Than Thirty Years in the TARDIS that he looked forward to Whitehouse's comments because the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them. Nevertheless, Nathan-Turner also got into trouble with BBC executives over the violence he allowed to be depicted for season 22 of the series in 1985, which was publicly criticised by controller Michael Grade and given as one of his reasons for suspending the series for 18 months. The phrase \"Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa\" entered British pop culture, signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it. The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme \"Behind the Sofa\". The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time. A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill \"at the center of many people's relationship with the show\", and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the \"scariest TV show of all time\". The image of the TARDIS has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort of Herne Bay, Kent, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine. In 1996, the BBC applied for a trademark to use the TARDIS' blue police box design in merchandising associated with Doctor Who. In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trademark claim; but in 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC. The 21st century revival of the programme became the centrepiece of BBC One's Saturday schedule and \"defined the channel\". Many renowned actors asked for or were offered guest-starring roles in various stories. According to an article in The Daily Telegraph in 2009, the revival of Doctor Who had consistently received high ratings, both in number of viewers and as measured by the Appreciation Index. In 2007, Caitlin Moran, television reviewer for The Times, wrote that Doctor Who is \"quintessential to being British\". According to Steven Moffat, the American film director Steven Spielberg has commented that \"the world would be a poorer place without Doctor Who\". On 4 August 2013, a live programme titled Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor was broadcast on BBC One, during which the actor who was going to play the Twelfth Doctor was revealed. The live show was watched by an average of 6.27\u00a0million in the UK, and was also simulcast in the United States, Canada and Australia."

        "content": "Doctor Who originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or \"serial\")\u2014usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Some notable exceptions were: The Daleks' Master Plan, which aired twelve episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, \"Mission to the Unknown\", featuring none of the regular cast); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the ten-episode serial The War Games; and The Trial of a Time Lord, which ran for fourteen episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23. Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a story-line, such as season 8 focusing on the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called the Master, season 16's quest for the Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian trilogy. The programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. It initially alternated stories set in the past, which taught younger audience members about history, and with those in the future or outer space, focusing on science. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher. However, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme, and the history-orientated episodes, which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after The Highlanders (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: Black Orchid (1982), set in 1920s England. The early stories were serialised in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following The Gunfighters (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, and the individual parts were simply assigned episode numbers. Of the programme's many writers, Robert Holmes was the most prolific, while Douglas Adams became the most well known outside Doctor Who itself, due to the popularity of his Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy works. The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with what was now called a series usually consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended 60-minute episode broadcast on Christmas Day. This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's eighth series, and ten episodes from the  eleventh series. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, often linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale. As in the early \"classic\" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes \"Journey's End\" from 2008 and \"The Eleventh Hour\" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length. Doctor Who instalments have been televised since 1963, ranging between 25-minute episodes (the most common format for the classic era), 45/50-minute episodes (for Resurrection of the Daleks in the 1984 series, a single season in 1985, and the most common format for the revival era since 2005), two feature-length productions (1983's The Five Doctors and the 1996 television film), twelve Christmas specials (most of 60 minutes' duration, one of 72 minutes), and four additional specials ranging from 60 to 75 minutes in 2009, 2010 and 2013. Four mini-episodes, running about eight minutes each, were also produced for the 1993, 2005 and 2007 Children in Need charity appeals, while another mini-episode was produced in 2008 for a Doctor Who\u2013themed edition of The Proms. The 1993 two-part story, entitled Dimensions in Time, was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera EastEnders and was filmed partly on the EastEnders set. A two-part mini-episode was also produced for the 2011 edition of Comic Relief. Starting with the 2009 special \"Planet of the Dead\", the series was filmed in 1080i for HDTV, and broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show, a special 3D episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", was broadcast in 2013. In March 2013, it was announced that Tennant and Piper would be returning, and that the episode would have a limited cinematic release worldwide. In June 2017, it was announced that due to the terms of a deal between BBC Worldwide and SMG Pictures in China, the company has first right of refusal on the purchase for the Chinese market of future series of the programme until and including Series 15."

        "title": "Doctor Who_Missing episodes",
        "content": "Between about 1967 and 1978, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries were either destroyed, or wiped. This included many early episodes of Doctor Who, those stories featuring the first two Doctors: William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton. In all, 97 of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the BBC's archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, and 5, from which 79 episodes are missing). In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC, while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying \"spare\" film copies had been brought to a stop. No 1960s episodes exist on their original videotapes (all surviving prints being film transfers), though some were transferred to film for editing before transmission, and exist in their broadcast form. Some episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought prints for broadcast, or by private individuals who acquired them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed from the television screen onto 8\u00a0mm cine film and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show. Short clips from every story with the exception of Marco Polo (1964), \"Mission to the Unknown\" (1965) and The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve (1966) also exist. In addition to these, there are off-screen photographs made by photographer John Cura, who was hired by various production personnel to document many of their programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including Doctor Who. These have been used in fan reconstructions of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low-quality copies. One of the most sought-after lost episodes is part four of the last William Hartnell serial, The Tenth Planet (1966), which ends with the First Doctor transforming into the Second. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor-quality silent 8\u00a0mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, as it was shown on the children's magazine show Blue Peter. With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material. \"Official\" reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on MP3 CD-ROM, and as special features on DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio Cosgrove Hall, reconstructed the missing episodes 1 and 4 of The Invasion (1968), using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial's DVD release in November 2006. The missing episodes of The Reign of Terror were animated by animation company Theta-Sigma, in collaboration with Big Finish, and became available for purchase in May 2013 through Amazon.com. Subsequent animations made in 2013 include The Tenth Planet, The Ice Warriors (1967) and The Moonbase (1967). In April 2006, Blue Peter launched a challenge to find missing Doctor Who episodes with the promise of a full-scale Dalek model as a reward. In December 2011, it was announced that part 3 of Galaxy 4 (1965) and part 2 of The Underwater Menace (1967) had been returned to the BBC by a fan who had purchased them in the mid-1980s without realising that the BBC did not hold copies of them. On 10 October 2013, the BBC announced that films of eleven episodes, including nine missing episodes, had been found in a Nigerian television relay station in Jos. Six of the eleven films discovered were the six-part serial The Enemy of the World (1968), from which all but the third episode had been missing. The remaining films were from another six-part serial, The Web of Fear (1968), and included the previously missing episodes 2, 4, 5, and 6. Episode 3 of The Web of Fear is still missing."

        "content": "Producers introduced the concept of regeneration to permit the recasting of the main character. This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, William Hartnell. The term \"regeneration\" was not conceived until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration; Hartnell's Doctor merely described undergoing a \"renewal\", and the Second Doctor underwent a \"change of appearance\". The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future. The serials The Deadly Assassin (1976) and Mawdryn Undead (1983) established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time. The episode \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the Twelfth Doctor, due to the Eleventh Doctor being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set. Although the idea of casting a woman as the Doctor had been suggested by the show's writers several times, including by Newman in 1986 and Davies in 2008, until 2017, all official depictions were played by men. Jodie Whittaker took over the role as the Thirteenth Doctor at the end of the 2017 Christmas special, and is the first woman to be cast as the character. Whittaker had previously starred in television series such as Return to Cranford,  Broadchurch alongside David Tennant (Tenth Doctor) and the dystopian anthology Black Mirror. The show introduced the Time Lords' ability to change sex on regeneration in earlier episodes, first in dialogue, then with Michelle Gomez's version of The Master. In addition to those actors who have headlined the series, others have portrayed versions of the Doctor in guest roles. Notably, in 2013, John Hurt guest-starred as a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the War Doctor in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\". He is shown in mini-episode \"The Night of the Doctor\" retroactively inserted into the show's fictional chronology between McGann and Eccleston's Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors. Another example is from the 1986 serial The Trial of a Time Lord, where Michael Jayston portrayed the Valeyard, who is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between the twelfth and final incarnation. On rare occasions, other actors have stood in for the lead. In The Five Doctors, Richard Hurndall played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later David Bradley similarly replaced Hartnell in Twice Upon a Time. In Time and the Rani, Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including Peter Cushing in two films. For more information, see the list of actors who have played the Doctor. The casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's sex (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of Jo Martin in \"Fugitive of the Judoon\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55)."

In subsequent stories, the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In Mawdryn Undead (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special The Five Doctors, the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"The Lodger\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor\", the Eleventh Doctor clarified that he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series. While the Doctor was early on described as from the planet Gallifrey, as first mentioned in The Time Warrior (1973), these origins were retconned in The Timeless Children (2020), and the Doctor was shown as from another unknown dimension or universe. In the same story, it was revealed that First Doctor was not actually the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. During the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the 1996 television film, the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\". The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\", instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage. The programme's first serial, An Unearthly Child, shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman. In the 1967 serial, Tomb of the Cybermen, when Victoria Waterfield doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"The Empty Child\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"Smith and Jones\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"Fear Her\" (2006) and \"The Doctor's Daughter\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father. In \"The Wedding of River Song\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"The Name of the Doctor\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the Great Intelligence to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe."

        "content": "The companion figure\u00a0\u2013 generally a human\u00a0\u2013 has been a constant feature in Doctor Who since the programme's inception in 1963. One of the roles of the companion is to be a reminder for the Doctor's \"moral duty\". The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes\u2014or loves\u2014on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens. Since the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor. The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures. The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs. The tenth series introduced Pearl Mackie as Bill Potts, the Doctor's first openly gay companion. Pearl Mackie said that the increased representation for LGBTQ people is important on a mainstream show. Some companions have gone on to re-appear, either in the main series or in spin-offs. Sarah Jane Smith became the central character in The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007\u20132011) following a return to Doctor Who in 2006. Guest stars in the series included former companions Jo Grant, K9, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney). The character of Jack Harkness also served to launch a spin-off, Torchwood, (2006\u20132011) in which Martha Jones also appeared."

        "content": "When Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the clich\u00e9 of the \"bug-eyed monster\" of science fiction. However, monsters were popular with audiences and so became a staple of Doctor Who almost from the beginning. With the show's 2005 revival, executive producer Russell T Davies stated his intention to reintroduce classic icons of Doctor Who. The Autons with the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks returned in series 1, Cybermen in series 2, the Macra and the Master in series 3, the Sontarans and Davros in series 4, and the Time Lords including Rassilon in the 2009\u20132010 Specials. Davies' successor, Steven Moffat, has continued the trend by reviving the Silurians in series 5, Cybermats in series 6, the Great Intelligence and the Ice Warriors in Series 7, and Zygons in the 50th Anniversary Special. Since its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new recurring aliens: Slitheen (Raxacoricofallapatorians), Ood, Judoon, Weeping Angels and the Silence. Besides infrequent appearances by enemies such as the Ice Warriors, Ogrons, the Rani, and Black Guardian, three adversaries have become particularly iconic: the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master."

        "content": "The Dalek race, which first appeared in the show's second serial in 1963, are Doctor Whos oldest villains. The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopuses with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, their most recent appearance being the 2022 episode \"Eve of the Daleks\". Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in Genesis of the Daleks, although played by several different actors. The Daleks were created by writer Terry Nation (who intended them to be an allegory of the Nazis) and BBC designer Raymond Cusick. The Daleks' d\u00e9but in the programme's second serial, The Daleks (1963\u20131964), made both the Daleks and Doctor Who very popular. A Dalek appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by Lord Snowdon. In \"Victory of the Daleks\" a new set of Daleks were introduced that come in a range of colours; the colour denoting its role within the species."

Conceived as \"Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes\", the character first appeared in 1971. As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was Roger Delgado, who continued in the role until his death in 1973. The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of Doctor Who, and was played by American actor Eric Roberts. Following the series revival in 2005, Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode \"Utopia\". During that story, the role was then assumed by John Simm who returned to the role multiple times through the Tenth Doctor's tenure. As of the 2014 episode \"Dark Water\", it was revealed that the Master had become a female incarnation or \"Time Lady\", going by the name of \"Missy\" (short for Mistress, the feminine equivalent of \"Master\"). This incarnation is played by Michelle Gomez. Simm returned to his role as the Master alongside Gomez in the tenth series. The Master returned for the 2020 twelfth series with Sacha Dhawan in the role. The character had dubbed himself the \"Spy Master\" referencing a role he had taken with MI6."

        "title": "Doctor Who_Theme music",
        "content": "The Doctor Who theme music was one of the first electronic music signature tunes for television, and after more than a half century remains one of the most easily recognised. The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills, and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979\u20131980). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\" She answered \"Most of it.\" Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time. Derbyshire would not receive an on-screen credit until the 50th anniversary story \"The Day of the Doctor\" in 2013. A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 (1980), which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial The Trial of a Time Lord in season 23 (1986). Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor's era which lasted from season 24 (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. American composer John Debney created a new arrangement of Ron Grainer's original theme for Doctor Who in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, Murray Gold provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode \"The Christmas Invasion\". A new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, \"Voyage of the Damned\"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series. He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers. In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special \"The Snowmen\", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\" in November 2013. Versions of the \"Doctor Who Theme\" have also been released as pop music over the years. In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, \"Who Is the Doctor\". In 1978, a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988, the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as The KLF) released the single \"Doctorin' the Tardis\" under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Gary Glitter (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of \"Doctorin' the Tardis\"). Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital, Pink Floyd, the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on The Chaser's War on Everything. The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme. In January 2011, the Mankind version was released as a digital download on the album Gallifrey And Beyond. On 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for series 11 would be provided by Royal Birmingham Conservatoire alumnus Segun Akinola."

        "title": "Doctor Who_Incidental music",
        "content": "Most of the innovative incidental music for Doctor Who has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used stock music, as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or cover versions of songs by popular music acts such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s. The incidental music for the first Doctor Who adventure, An Unearthly Child, was written by Norman Kay. Many of the stories of the William Hartnell period were scored by electronic music pioneer Tristram Cary, whose Doctor Who credits include The Daleks, Marco Polo, The Daleks' Master Plan, The Gunfighters and The Mutants. Other composers in this early period included Richard Rodney Bennett, Carey Blyton and Geoffrey Burgon. The most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was Dudley Simpson, who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for Blake's 7, and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of The Tomorrow People. Simpson's first Doctor Who score was Planet of Giants (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with The Horns of Nimon (1979). He also made a cameo appearance in The Talons of Weng-Chiang (as a Music hall conductor). In 1980 starting with the serial The Leisure Hive the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. Paddy Kingsland and Peter Howell contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included Roger Limb, Malcolm Clarke and Jonathan Gibbs. The Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's The Trial of a Time Lord series, and Keff McCulloch took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with Dominic Glynn and Mark Ayres also contributing scores. From the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode \"Twice Upon a Time\", all incidental music for the series was composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster, and has been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from the 2005 Christmas episode \"The Christmas Invasion\" onwards. A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19 November 2006 to raise money for Children in Need. David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. Murray Gold and Russell T Davies answered questions during the interval and Daleks and Cybermen appeared whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on BBCi on Christmas Day 2006. A Doctor Who Prom was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the annual BBC Proms. The BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir performed Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time. The event was presented by Freema Agyeman and guest-presented by various other stars of the show with numerous monsters participating in the proceedings. It also featured the specially filmed mini-episode \"Music of the Spheres\", written by Russell T Davies and starring David Tennant. On 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for the eleventh series would be provided by Royal Birmingham Conservatoire alumnus Segun Akinola. Six soundtrack releases have been released since 2005. The first featured tracks from the first two series, the second and third featured music from the third and fourth series respectively. The fourth was released on 4 October 2010 as a two disc special edition and contained music from the 2008\u20132010 specials (The Next Doctor to \"End of Time Part 2\"). The soundtrack for Series 5 was released on 8 November 2010. In February 2011, a soundtrack was released for the 2010 Christmas special: \"A Christmas Carol\", and in December 2011 the soundtrack for Series 6 was released, both by Silva Screen Records. In 2013, a 50th-anniversary boxed set of audio CDs was released featuring music and sound effects from Doctor Who's 50-year history. The celebration continued in 2016 with the release of Doctor Who: The 50th Anniversary Collection Four LP Box Set by New York City-based Spacelab9. The company pressed 1,000 copies of the set on \"Metallic Silver\" vinyl, dubbed the \"Cyberman Edition\"."

Doctor Who has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes were also repeated on BBC Three, before its transition to an online-only channel. The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings. The first of these was the \"Dalekmania\" period (), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought Doctor Who ratings of between 9 and 14\u00a0million, even for stories which did not feature them. The second was the mid to late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12\u00a0million. During the ITV network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16\u00a0million. Figures remained respectable into the 1980s, but fell noticeably after the programme's 23rd series was postponed in 1985 and the show was off the air for 18 months. Its late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the soap opera Coronation Street, the most popular show at the time. During Tennant's run (the third notable period of high ratings), the show had consistently high viewership; with the Christmas specials regularly attracting over 10\u00a0million. The BBC One broadcast of \"Rose\", the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81\u00a0million, third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels. The current revival also garners the highest audience Appreciation Index of any drama on television."

In these films, Peter Cushing plays a human scientist named \"Dr. Who\", who travels with his granddaughter, niece and other companions in a time machine he has invented.

Concept art for an animated Doctor Who series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced.

The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of Torchwood aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her Doctor Who role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called Children of Earth which was set largely in London. A fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting. The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007. A second series followed in 2008, notable for (as noted above) featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011\u00a0\u2013 uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011. An animated serial, The Infinite Quest, aired alongside the 2007 series of Doctor Who as part of the children's television series Totally Doctor Who. The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series. A second animated serial, Dreamland, aired in six parts on the BBC Red Button service, and the official Doctor Who website in 2009. Class, featuring students of Coal Hill School, was first aired on-line on BBC Three from 22 October 2016, as a series of eight 45 minute episodes, written by Patrick Ness. Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor appears in the show's first episode. The series was picked up by BBC America on 8 January 2016 and by BBC One a day later. On 7 September 2017, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh confirmed that the series had officially been cancelled. Numerous other spin-off series have been created not by the BBC but by the respective owners of the characters and concepts. Such spin-offs include the novel and audio drama series Faction Paradox, Iris Wildthyme and Bernice Summerfield; as well as the made-for-video series P.R.O.B.E.; the Australian-produced television series K-9, which aired a 26-episode first season on Disney XD; and the audio spin-off Counter-Measures."

        "content": "In 1983, coinciding with the series' 20th anniversary, The Five Doctors was shown as part of the annual BBC Children in Need Appeal, however it was not a charity-based production, simply scheduled within the line-up of Friday 25 November 1983. This was the programme's first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC. At 90 minutes long it was the longest single episode of Doctor Who produced to date. It featured three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker. In 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled Dimensions in Time was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera EastEnders, the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses. In 1999, another special, Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor (Rowan Atkinson) encounters both the Master (Jonathan Pryce) and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series. Since the return of Doctor Who in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an untitled seven-minute scene which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was followed in November 2007 by \"Time Crash\", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor Peter Davison. A set of two mini-episodes, titled \"Space\" and \"Time\" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event. During Children in Need 2011, an exclusively filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need. Children in Need 2012 featured the mini-episode \"The Great Detective\"."

        "content": "Doctor Who has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including Spike Milligan (a Dalek invades his bathroom\u2014Milligan, naked, hurls a soap sponge at it) and Lenny Henry. Jon Culshaw frequently impersonates the Fourth Doctor in the BBC Dead Ringers series. Doctor Who fandom has also been lampooned on programs such as Saturday Night Live, The Chaser's War on Everything, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Family Guy, American Dad!, Futurama, South Park, Community as Inspector Spacetime, The Simpsons and The Big Bang Theory. As part of the 50th anniversary programmes, former Fifth Doctor Peter Davison directed, wrote and co-starred in the parody The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot, which also starred two other former Doctors, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, and cameo appearances from cast and crew involved in the programme, including showrunner Steven Moffat and Doctors Paul McGann, David Tennant and Matt Smith. The Doctor in his fourth incarnation has been represented on several episodes of The Simpsons and Matt Groening's other animated series Futurama. A fan of Doctor Who since childhood, Groening favours Tom Baker's fourth Doctor, with Simpsons writer Ron Hauge stating, \"There are several Doctor Who actors but Tom Baker is the one we always go with.\" There have also been many references to Doctor Who in popular culture and other science fiction, including Star Trek: The Next Generation (\"The Neutral Zone\") and Leverage. In the Channel 4 series Queer as Folk (created by later Doctor Who executive producer Russell T. Davies), the character of Vince was portrayed as an avid Doctor Who fan, with references appearing many times throughout in the form of clips from the programme. In a similar manner, the character of Oliver on Coupling (created and written by Steven Moffat) is portrayed as a Doctor Who collector and enthusiast. References to Doctor Who have also appeared in the young adult fantasy novels Brisingr and High Wizardry, the video game Rock Band, the Adult Swim comedy show Robot Chicken, the Family Guy episodes \"Blue Harvest\" and \"420\", and the game RuneScape. It has also been referenced in Destroy All Humans! 2, by civilians in the game's variation of England, and multiple times throughout the Ace Attorney series. Doctor Who has been a reference in several political cartoons, from a 1964 cartoon in the Daily Mail depicting Charles de Gaulle as a Dalek to a 2008 edition of This Modern World by Tom Tomorrow in which the Tenth Doctor informs an incredulous character from 2003 that the Democratic Party will nominate an African-American as its presidential candidate. The word \"TARDIS\" is an entry in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, and the iOS dictionary."

In 1975, Season 11 of the series won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best Writing in a Children's Serial. In 1996, BBC television held the \"Auntie Awards\" as the culmination of their \"TV60\" series, celebrating 60 years of BBC television broadcasting, where Doctor Who was voted as the \"Best Popular Drama\" the corporation had ever produced, ahead of such ratings heavyweights as EastEnders and Casualty. In 2000, Doctor Who was ranked third in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, produced by the British Film Institute and voted on by industry professionals.

At the reception, Charles becomes smitten with Caroline (Carrie), a beautiful young American, and they spend the night together. In the morning, Carrie jokingly demands that Charles propose to her, observing they may have \"missed a great opportunity\", and then leaves for the U.S. Three months later, at the wedding of Bernard and Lydia in London, who became involved at the previous wedding, Charles meets Carrie again, who is now accompanied by her Scottish fianc\u00e9 Hamish. Charles faces further humiliation from several of his ex-girlfriends, including the distraught Henrietta, and retreats to an empty hotel suite, where he watches Carrie and Hamish depart. He becomes trapped in the room when the newlyweds stumble in to have sex. Later, he is confronted by an angry Henrietta about his habit of \"serial monogamy\" and his fear of letting anyone get too close. Carrie reappears, and she and Charles spend another night together. A month later, Charles receives an invitation to Carrie's wedding. While shopping for a gift, he runs into her and helps select a wedding dress. She recounts her 33 sexual partners; Charles, who was number 32, soon awkwardly confesses his love to her, but is unsuccessful. Another month later, Charles and his friends attend Carrie's wedding in Scotland. The gregarious Gareth instructs the group to seek potential mates; Scarlett hits it off with an American, Chester. As Charles watches Carrie and Hamish dance, Fiona deduces his heartbreak. When he asks Fiona why she is single, she confesses that she has loved Charles since they first met; though sympathetic to her feelings, Charles does not reciprocate them. During the bridegroom's toast, Gareth suddenly dies of a heart attack. At Gareth's funeral, Matthew recites the poem \"Funeral Blues\" by English-American poet W. H. Auden, commemorating his relationship with Gareth and calling Auden \"another splendid bugger\". Afterward, Carrie and Charles share a brief moment, and Charles and Tom ponder the fact that despite their clique's pride in being single, Gareth and Matthew were a \"married\" couple all the while, and whether the search for \"one true love\" is futile. Ten months later, Charles's own wedding day arrives; the bride turns out to be Henrietta. Tom, while seating guests, is struck with love at first sight with his distant cousin Deirdre, who had met 25 years before as children. Shortly before the wedding ceremony, Carrie arrives and tells Charles that she and Hamish have separated. He has a crisis of confidence and is counseled by David and Matthew, but proceeds with the wedding. When the vicar asks for any reason why the couple should not marry, however, the deaf David says in sign language that he suspects the bridegroom loves someone else, which Charles confirms. Henrietta angrily punches him, and the wedding is stopped. Carrie tries to apologise to Charles, who confesses that, at the altar, he realised she was the one person he truly loved, and that he's loved her since the first second he met her. Charles, who fears marriage, proposes a lifelong commitment without marriage to Carrie, and she accepts it by saying \"I do\". As they kiss a thunderbolt flashes across the sky. At the end of the film, Henrietta marries an officer in the Grenadier Guards; David marries his girlfriend Serena, whom he met at the second wedding; Scarlett marries Chester; Tom marries Deirdre; Matthew finds a new male partner; Fiona is shown in a picture with Prince Charles; and Charles and Carrie have a baby."

According to Curtis he began writing the script at age 34, after realising he had attended 65 weddings in an 11-year period. At one wedding he was propositioned by a fellow guest, but he turned her down and forever regretted it; accordingly he based the origin of Charles and Carrie's romance on that situation. It took Curtis 17 drafts to reach the final version. He has commented on director Mike Newell's influence; \"I come from a school where making it funny is what matters. Mike was obsessed with keeping it real. Every character, no matter how small, has a story, not just three funny lines. It's a romantic film about love and friendship that swims in a sea of jokes.\" Curtis chose to omit any mention of the characters' careers, because he didn't think a group of friends would realistically discuss their jobs while together at a wedding."

Alex Jennings was cast as Charles, but funding for the production fell through in mid-1992. Jennings would eventually go on to play a supporting role in Mindy Kaling's 2019 television miniseries adaptation of the film. The team continued holding auditions for over a year, seeing roughly 70 actors for the role of Charles before Hugh Grant. Grant was ready to give up acting as a career when he received the script for Four Weddings and a Funeral; he stated in 2016 that: \"I wasn't really getting any work at all, and then to my great surprise this script came through the letterbox from my agent, and it was really good. And I rang on and said there must be a mistake, you've sent me a good script.\" Initially, writer Richard Curtis, who had modelled the character of Charles after himself, was opposed to casting Grant in the role, because he thought Grant was too handsome. Curtis favored casting Alan Rickman, but Rickman refused to audition. Curtis was eventually persuaded by Newell and the producers to approve Grant's casting. Jeanne Tripplehorn was originally cast as Carrie, but she had to drop out just before filming, when her mother passed away. The role was offered to Marisa Tomei, but she turned it down, because her grandfather was sick at the time. Sarah Jessica Parker was also reportedly considered. Andie MacDowell was in London doing publicity for Groundhog Day when she read the script, and was cast. MacDowell took a 75% cut in her fee to appear, receiving $250,000 upfront, but due to the success of the film, she earned around $3 million. Grant's participation hit another stumbling block when his agent requested a \u00a35,000 rise over the \u00a335,000 salary Grant was offered. The producers initially refused because of the extremely tight budget, but eventually agreed. The supporting cast-members were paid \u00a317,500 apiece."

        "content": "Duncan Kenworthy produced the film while on sabbatical from Jim Henson Productions. Pre-production for the movie was a long process because funding was erratic, falling through in mid-1992 and leading to much uncertainty. Finally in early 1993, Working Title Films stepped in to close the gap. Nonetheless, another $1.2 million was cut just before production began in the summer of 1993, forcing the film to be made in just 36 days with a final budget of \u00a32.7 million (appr. $4.4 million in 1994). Channel Four Films contributed \u00a3800,000. The budget was so tight that extras had to wear their own wedding clothes, while Rowan Atkinson appeared as a vicar at two of the weddings so production wouldn't have to pay another actor. Future Home Secretary and Member of Parliament (MP) Amber Rudd was given the credit of \"Aristocracy Coordinator\" after she arranged for several aristocrats to make uncredited appearances as wedding extras, including Peregrine Cavendish, who was at the time Marquess of Hartington, and the Earl of Woolton, who conveniently wore their own morning suits. To make Grant look more nerdy, the producers styled him with shaggy hair, glasses, and deliberately unflattering, ill-fitting clothes. Grant was encouraged by director Mike Newell to mess up and trip over his lines, written in \"convoluted syntax\" as Grant describes them, in order to give Charles a stammering, nervous quality. Grant, who struggled with hay fever throughout filming, was unsure of Newell's direction and his own performance, which he thought was \"atrocious\"; on Newell he commented that: \"He seemed to be giving direction against what I thought were the natural beats of the comedy. He was making a film with texture, grounding it, playing the truths rather than the gags\". The film was shot mainly in London and the Home Counties, including Hampstead, Islington where the final moments take place on Highbury Terrace, Greenwich Hospital, Betchworth in Surrey, Amersham in Buckinghamshire, St Bartholomew-the-Great (wedding number four) and West Thurrock in Essex. Exterior shots of guests arriving for the funeral were filmed in Thurrock, Essex overlooking the River Thames with the backdrop of the Dartford River Crossing and at stately homes in Bedfordshire (Luton Hoo for wedding two's reception) and Hampshire."

        "content": "According to Hugh Grant, the initial screening of a rough-cut of Four Weddings went very badly. Throughout production, Gramercy Pictures, the U.S. distributor for the film, sent frequent transatlantic faxes objecting to the explicit language and sexual content, fearing the final product would not be suitable for American distribution or television airings. They particularly objected to the opening scene of the movie, in which Charles and Scarlett say the word \"Fuck\" over and over, after an initial screening of the movie in Salt Lake City led the conservative Mormon members of the city council to walk out. Accordingly, Mike Newell and the actors agreed to reshoot the scene with the British swear word \"Bugger\" to be used in the American version. The executives also objected to the title, believing Four Weddings and a Funeral would turn off male viewers from the film. In its place they suggested such titles as True Love and Near Misses, Loitering in Sacred Places, Skulking Around, and Rolling in the Aisles, none of which were accepted."

It opened in the United States on 11 March 1994 in five theatres. The box office receipts from the first five days of the film's general release in the United States so impressed the movie's distributor that it decided to spend lavishly on promotion, buying full-page newspaper ads and TV-spots totalling some $11 million. The movie also benefited from much free publicity because of Grant's reception in the United States, where he became an instant sex symbol and undertook a successful media tour promoting the film. Producer Duncan Kenworthy stated that \"It was the most amazing luck that when Hugh went on the publicity trail he turned out to be incredibly funny, and very like the character of Charles. That doesn't ever happen.\" The film had a wide release in the United States on 15 April 1994. At the UK premiere in Leicester Square on 11 May 1994,  Hugh Grant's then-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley garnered much publicity for the film when she wore a black Versace safety-pin dress which became a sensation in the press. The film opened in the UK on 13 May 1994."

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \"delightful and sly\", and directed with \"light-hearted enchantment\" by Newell. He praised Grant's performance, describing it as a kind of \"endearing awkwardness\". Todd McCarthy of Variety called it a \"truly beguiling romantic comedy\" which was \"frequently hilarious without being sappily sentimental or tiresomely retrograde.\" Producer Duncan Kenworthy later attributed much of the success of Four Weddings at the box office success to McCarthy's review. Writing for the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum called the film \"generic\" and \"standard issue\", stating that the audience shouldn't \"expect to remember it ten minutes later\".  Time magazine writer Richard Corliss was less scathing, but agreed that it was forgettable, saying that people would \"forget all about [the movie] by the time they leave the multiplex,\" even joking at the end of his review that he had forgotten the film's name."

        "content": "The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and society, television, and the human condition. The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to \"simpleton\". The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u20131990). Since its debut on December 17, 1989,  episodes of the show have been broadcast. It is the longest-running American animated series, longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, both in terms of seasons and number of episodes. A feature-length film, The Simpsons Movie, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527\u00a0million, with a sequel in development as of 2018. The series has also spawned numerous comic book series, video games, books, and other related media, as well as a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The Simpsons is a joint production by Gracie Films and 20th Television. On March 3, 2021, the series was announced to have been renewed for seasons 33 and 34, which were later confirmed to have 22 episodes each, increasing the episode count from 706 to 750. Its thirty-third season premiered on September 26, 2021. The Simpsons received acclaim throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered its \"golden age\". Since then, it has been criticized for a perceived decline in quality. Time named it the 20th century's best television series, and Erik Adams of The A.V. Club named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\". On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and 2 Peabody Awards. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase of \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcoms."

        "content": "The Simpsons is known for its wide ensemble of main and supporting characters (ensemble cast). The main characters are the Simpson family, who live in a fictional \"Middle America\" town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Bouvier, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. Homer's dad Grampa Simpson lives in the Springfield Retirement Home after Homer forced his dad to sell his house so that his family could buy theirs. Grampa Simpson has had starring roles in several episodes. The family also owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\". Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. The show includes an array of quirky supporting characters, which include Homer's co-workers (also friends) Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson, the school principal Seymour Skinner and teachers Edna Krabappel and Elizabeth Hoover, neighbor Ned Flanders, friends Barney Gumble, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Moe Szyslak, Milhouse Van Houten, and Nelson Muntz, extended relatives Patty and Selma Bouvier, townspeople such as Mayor Quimby, Chief Clancy Wiggum, local celebrities Krusty the Clown and news reporter Kent Brockman, and tycoon Charles Montgomery Burns, who often serves as the series' antagonist, and his executive assistant Waylon Smithers. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show SCTV."

        "content": "Despite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters never age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a floating timeline in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced even though the characters do not age. Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating relative to the year the episode is produced. For example, in the 1991 episode \"I Married Marge\", Bart (who is always 10 years old) appears to be born in 1980 or 1981. But in the 1995 episode \"And Maggie Makes Three\", Maggie (who always appears to be around 1 year old) appears to be born in 1993 or 1994. In the 1992 episode \"Lisa's First Word\", Lisa (who is always 8) is shown to have been born in 1984. A canon of the show does exist, although Treehouse of Horror episodes and any fictional story told within the series are typically non-canon. However, continuity is inconsistent and limited in The Simpsons. For example, Krusty the Clown may be able to read in one episode, but not in another \u2013 however he is consistently portrayed as being Jewish and that his rabbi father has since died. Lessons learned by the family in one episode may be forgotten in the next. Some examples of limited continuity include Sideshow Bob's appearances where Bart and Lisa flashback at all the crimes he committed in Springfield or when the characters try to remember things that happened in previous episodes."

Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up. The name \"Springfield\" is a common one in America and appears in at least 29 states. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series Father Knows Best.

Brooks was working on the television variety show The Tracey Ullman Show, he decided to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist Matt Groening's Life in Hell comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his Life in Hell series. However, Groening later realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work. He therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his version of a dysfunctional family that became the Simpsons. He named the characters after his own family members, substituting \"Bart\" for his own name, adopting an anagram of the word brat. The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts. The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo, with Wes Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season. Colorist Georgie Peluse was the person who decided to make the characters yellow. In 1989, a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included the Klasky Csupo animation house. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content. Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called \"the mainstream trash\" that they were watching. The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989, with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\". \"Some Enchanted Evening\" was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems. In 1992, Tracey Ullman filed a lawsuit against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series' success. The suit said she should receive a share of the profits of The Simpsons\u2014a claim rejected by the courts."

Newer Simpsons writing teams typically consist of sixteen writers who propose episode ideas at the beginning of each December. The main writer of each episode writes the first draft. Group rewriting sessions develop final scripts by adding or removing jokes, inserting scenes, and calling for re-readings of lines by the show's vocal performers. Until 2004, George Meyer, who had developed the show since the first season, was active in these sessions. According to long-time writer Jon Vitti, Meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode, even though other writers may receive script credits. Each episode takes six months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events. Credited with sixty episodes, John Swartzwelder is the most prolific writer on The Simpsons. One of the best-known former writers is Conan O'Brien, who contributed to several episodes in the early 1990s before replacing David Letterman as host of the talk show Late Night. English comedian Ricky Gervais wrote the episode \"Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife\", becoming the first celebrity to both write and guest star in the same episode. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, writers of the film Superbad, wrote the episode \"Homer the Whopper\", with Rogen voicing a character in it. At the end of 2007, the writers of The Simpsons went on strike together with the other members of the Writers Guild of America, East. The show's writers had joined the guild in 1998."

        "content": "The Simpsons has six main cast members: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer. Castellaneta voices Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Barney Gumble, and other adult, male characters. Julie Kavner voices Marge Simpson and Patty and Selma, as well as several minor characters. Castellaneta and Kavner had been a part of The Tracey Ullman Show cast and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed. Cartwright voices Bart Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum and other children. Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson, is the only cast member who regularly voices only one character, although she occasionally plays other episodic characters. The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high, so she was given the role of Lisa instead. Cartwright was originally brought in to voice Lisa, but upon arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the \"middle child\" and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as \"devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever\". Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot. Cartwright is the only one of the six main Simpsons cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show. Azaria and Shearer do not voice members of the title family, but play a majority of the male townspeople. Azaria, who has been a part of the series' regular voice cast since the second season, voices recurring characters such as Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Professor Frink. Shearer provides voices for Mr. Burns, Mr. Smithers, Principal Skinner, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy and formerly Dr. Hibbert. Every main cast member has won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance. With one exception, episode credits list only the voice actors, and not the characters they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists. However, the network eventually revealed which roles each actor performed in the episode \"Old Money\", because the producers said the voice actors should receive credit for their work. In 2003, the cast appeared in an episode of Inside the Actors Studio, doing live performances of their characters' voices. The six main actors were paid $30,000 per episode until 1998, when they were involved in a pay dispute with Fox. The company threatened to replace them with new actors, even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but series creator Groening supported the actors in their action. The issue was soon resolved and, from 1998 to 2004, they were paid $125,000 per episode. The show's revenue continued to rise through syndication and DVD sales, and in April 2004 the main cast stopped appearing for script readings, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode. The strike was resolved a month later and their salaries were increased to something between $250,000 and $360,000 per episode. In 2008, production for the twentieth season was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a \"healthy bump\" in salary to an amount close to $500,000 per episode. The negotiations were soon completed, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, the cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode. In addition to the main cast, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, and Russi Taylor voice supporting characters. From 1999 to 2002, Roswell's characters were voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven. Karl Wiedergott has also appeared in minor roles, but does not voice any recurring characters. Wiedergott left the show in 2010, and since then Chris Edgerly has appeared regularly to voice minor characters. Repeat \"special guest\" cast members include Albert Brooks, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, Joe Mantegna, Maurice LaMarche, and Kelsey Grammer.  Following Hartman's death in 1998, the characters he voiced (Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz) were retired; Wallace's character of Edna Krabappel was retired as well after her death in 2013. Following Taylor's death in 2019, her characters (including Sherri, Terri, and Martin Prince) are now voiced by Grey Griffin. Episodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode \"Dancin' Homer\". The Simpsons holds the world record for \"Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series\". The Simpsons has been dubbed into several other languages, including Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. It is also one of the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French. The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong Simpsons fans in the area."

        "content": "Several different U.S. and international studios animate The Simpsons. Throughout the run of the animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show, the animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo. With the debut of the series, because of an increased workload, Fox subcontracted production to several local and foreign studios. These are AKOM, Anivision, Rough Draft Studios, USAnimation, and Toonzone Entertainment. For the first three seasons, Klasky Csupo animated The Simpsons in the United States. In 1992, the show's production company, Gracie Films, switched domestic production to Film Roman, who continued to animate the show until 2016. In Season 14, production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint. The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was \"Radioactive Man\" in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the season 12 episode \"Tennis the Menace\", but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later. The already completed \"Tennis the Menace\" was broadcast as made. The production staff at the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draws storyboards, designs new characters, backgrounds, props and draws character and background layouts, which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens, ink and paint, and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox three to four months later. The series began high-definition production in Season 20; the first episode, \"Take My Life, Please\", aired February 15, 2009. The move to HDTV included a new opening sequence. Matt Groening called it a complicated change because it affected the timing and composition of animation."

        "content": "The Simpsons uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle. However, because of its animated nature, The Simpsons scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment. Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of television channels, which enables the producers to make jokes about the entertainment industry and the press. Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias. Al Jean acknowledged in an interview that \"We [the show] are of liberal bent.\" The writers often evince an appreciation for progressive leanings, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum. The show portrays government and large corporations as evil entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are dismissive to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent. Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions."

        "content": "The Simpsons opening sequence is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. The standard opening has gone through three iterations (a replacement of some shots at the start of the second season, and a brand new sequence when the show switched to high-definition in 2009). Each has the same basic sequence of events: the camera zooms through cumulus clouds, through the show's title towards the town of Springfield. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by David Silverman, and was the first task he did when production began on the show. The series' distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career. One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone (or occasionally a different instrument), and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch."

These pieces usually involve the family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres. They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the Treehouse series is meant to be seen on Halloween, this changed by the 2000s (and again in 2020), when new installments have premiered after Halloween due to Fox's current contract with Major League Baseball's World Series.

        "title": "The Simpsons_Humor",
        "content": "The show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history. The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, billboards, and elsewhere. The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show or viewing it in slow motion. Kristin Thompson argues that The Simpsons uses a \"flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show.\" One of Bart's early hallmarks was his prank calls to Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were apparently based on a series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings, though Groening has denied any causal connection. Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis \"Red\" Deutsch, whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side. As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season. The Simpsons also often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting. For example, the episode \"She Used to Be My Girl\" included a scene in which a Fox News Channel van drove down the street while displaying a large \"Bush Cheney 2004\" banner and playing Queen's \"We Are the Champions\", in reference to the 2004 U.S. presidential election and claims of conservative bias in Fox News. The show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each. Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt \"D'oh!\", Mr. Burns' \"Excellent\" and Nelson Muntz's \"Ha-ha!\" Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as \"\u00a1Ay, caramba!\", \"Don't have a cow, man!\" and \"Eat my shorts!\" appeared on T-shirts in the show's early days. However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode \"Bart Gets Famous\" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the Krusty the Clown Show solely for saying \"I didn't do it.\""

        "content": "The Simpsons has gained notoriety for jokes that appeared to become reality. Perhaps the most famous example comes from the episode \"Bart to the Future\", which mentions billionaire Donald Trump having been President of the United States at one time and leaving the nation broke. The episode first aired in 2000, sixteen years before Trump (who at the time was exploring a presidential run) was elected. Another episode, \"When You Dish Upon a Star\", lampooned 20th Century Fox as a division of The Walt Disney Company. Nineteen years later, Disney purchased Fox. Other examples purported as The Simpsons predicting the future include the introduction of the Smartwatch, video chat services, autocorrection technology, and Lady Gaga's acrobatic performance at the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Fact-checking sources such as Snopes have debunked many of these claims, saying that the show's extensive run means \"a lot of jokes, and a lot of opportunities for coincidences to appear\" and \"most of these \u201cpredictions\" have rather simple and mundane explanations\". For example, the device shown on The Simpsons with autocorrection is an Apple Newton, a real 1993 device notorious for its poor handwriting recognition.

Mark Liberman, director of the Linguistic Data Consortium, remarked, \"The Simpsons has apparently taken over from Shakespeare and the Bible as our culture's greatest source of idioms, catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions.\" The most famous catchphrase is Homer's annoyed grunt: \"D'oh!\" So ubiquitous is the expression that it is now listed in the Oxford English Dictionary, but without the apostrophe. Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from James Finlayson, an actor in many Laurel and Hardy comedies, who pronounced it in a more elongated and whining tone. The staff of The Simpsons told Castellaneta to shorten the noise, and it went on to become the well-known exclamation in the television series. Groundskeeper Willie's description of the French as \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\" was used by National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg in 2003, after France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. The phrase quickly spread to other journalists. \"\" and \"embiggen\", words used in \"Lisa the Iconoclast\", have since appeared in the Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon, and scientific journals respectively. \"Kwyjibo\", a fake Scrabble word invented by Bart in \"Bart the Genius\", was used as one of the aliases of the creator of the Melissa worm. \"I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords\", was used by Kent Brockman in \"Deep Space Homer\" and has become a snowclone, with variants of the utterance used to express obsequious submission. It has been used in media, such as New Scientist magazine. The dismissive term \"Meh\", believed to have been popularized by the show, entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008. Other words credited as stemming from the show include \"yoink\" and \"craptacular\". The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations includes several quotations from the show. As well as \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\", Homer's lines, \"Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is never try\", from \"Burns' Heir\" (season five, 1994) as well as \"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all\", from \"Eight Misbehavin' (season 11, 1999), entered the dictionary in August 2007. Many quotes/scenes have become popular Internet memes, including Jasper Beardley's quote \"That's a paddlin from \"The PTA Disbands\" (season 6, 1995) and \"Steamed Hams\" from \"22 Short Films About Springfield\" (season 7, 1996)."

        "content": "The Simpsons was the first successful animated program in American prime time since Wait Till Your Father Gets Home in the 1970s. During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. The Simpsons changed this perception, initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like Capitol Critters, Fish Police, and Family Dog, which were expensive and unsuccessful. The Simpsons use of Korean animation studios for tweening, coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of The Simpsons and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other adult animated series. This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows for adults, such as Beavis and Butt-Head, South Park, Family Guy, King of the Hill, Futurama (which was created by Matt Groening), and The Critic. For Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, \"The Simpsons created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years\u00a0... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways\u2014you could classify it as\u2014a wholly new medium.\" The Simpsons has had crossovers with four other shows. In the episode \"A Star Is Burns\", Marge invites Jay Sherman, the main character of The Critic, to be a judge for a film festival in Springfield. Matt Groening had his name removed from the episode since he had no involvement with The Critic. South Park later paid homage to The Simpsons with the episode \"Simpsons Already Did It\". In \"Simpsorama\", the Planet Express crew from Futurama come to Springfield in the present to prevent the Simpsons from destroying the future. In the Family Guy episode \"The Simpsons Guy\", the Griffins visit Springfield and meet the Simpsons. The Simpsons has also influenced live-action shows like Malcolm in the Middle, which featured the use of sight gags and did not use a laugh track unlike most sitcoms. Malcolm in the Middle debuted January 9, 2000, in the time slot after The Simpsons. Ricky Gervais called The Simpsons an influence on The Office, and fellow British sitcom Spaced was, according to its director Edgar Wright, \"an attempt to do a live-action The Simpsons.\" In Georgia, the animated television sitcom The Samsonadzes, launched in November 2009, has been noted for its very strong resemblance with The Simpsons, which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged."

The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day in the history of the network so far, the ratings more than tripled those of regular prime time programming for FXX.

In 1990, Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed \"Bartmania\". He became the most prevalent Simpsons character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; as many as one million were sold on some days. Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as \"I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?\" and \"Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')\". The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated $2\u00a0billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales. Because of his popularity, Bart was often the most promoted member of the Simpson family in advertisements for the show, even for episodes in which he was not involved in the main plot. Due to the show's success, over the summer of 1990 the Fox Network decided to switch The Simpsons time slot from 8:00\u00a0p.m. ET on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday, where it competed with The Cosby Show on NBC, the number one show at the time. Through the summer, several news outlets published stories about the supposed \"Bill vs. Bart\" rivalry. \"Bart Gets an 'F' (season two, 1990) was the first episode to air against The Cosby Show, and it received a lower Nielsen ratings, tying for eighth behind The Cosby Show, which had an 18.5 rating. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 33.6\u00a0million viewers watched the episode, making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week. At the time, it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network, and it is still the highest rated episode in the history of The Simpsons. The show moved back to its Sunday slot in 1994 and has remained there ever since. The Simpsons has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, and it has been noted for being described as \"the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air.\" In a 1990 review of the show, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described it as \"the American family at its most complicated, drawn as simple cartoons. It's this neat paradox that makes millions of people turn away from the three big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons.\" Tucker also described the show as a \"pop-cultural phenomenon, a prime-time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family.\""

In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a \"threat to learning\" because of his \"underachiever and proud of it\" attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as \"egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited\". In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him \"angry, confused, frustrated\". In response, Matt Groening said, \"That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal [and] he thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do.\" On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply in the form of a short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of \"Stark Raving Dad\" in which Bart replied, \"Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\" Various episodes of the show have generated controversy. The Simpsons visit Australia in \"Bart vs. Australia\" (season six, 1995) and Brazil in \"Blame It on Lisa\" (season 13, 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board\u2014which claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations\u2014went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode \"A Star Is Burns\" (season six, 1995) which featured a crossover with The Critic. He felt that it was just an advertisement for The Critic, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode \"violates the Simpsons' universe.\" In response, Brooks said, \"I am furious with Matt,\u00a0... he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far.\u00a0... his behavior right now is rotten.\" \"The Principal and the Pauper\" (season nine, 1997) is one of the most controversial episodes of The Simpsons. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer, who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, \"That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.\""

China banned it from prime-time television in August 2006, \"in an effort to protect China's struggling animation studios.\" In 2008, Venezuela barred the show from airing on morning television as it was deemed \"unsuitable for children\". The same year, several Russian Pentecostal churches demanded that The Simpsons, South Park and some other Western cartoons be removed from broadcast schedules \"for propaganda of various vices\" and the broadcaster's license to be revoked.

        "content": "Critics' reviews of early Simpsons episodes praised the show for its sassy humor, wit, realism, and intelligence. However, in the late 1990s, around the airing of season 10, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some critics started calling the show \"tired\". By 2000, some long-term fans had become disillusioned with the show, and pointed to its shift from character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics. Jim Schembri of The Sydney Morning Herald attributed the decline in quality to an abandonment of character-driven storylines in favor of celebrity cameo appearances and references to popular culture. Schembri wrote in 2011: \"The central tragedy of The Simpsons is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention-seeking. It began by proving that cartoon characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself. Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk-ons and punchline-hungry dialogue.\" In 2010, the BBC noted \"the common consensus is that The Simpsons golden era ended after season nine\", and Todd Leopold of CNN, in an article looking at its perceived decline, stated \"for many fans\u00a0... the glory days are long past.\" Similarly, Tyler Wilson of Coeur d'Alene Press has referred to seasons one to nine as the show's \"golden age\", and Ian Nathan of Empire described the show's classic era as being \"say, the first ten seasons.\" Jon Heacock of LucidWorks stated that \"for the first ten years [seasons], the show was consistently at the top of its game\", with \"so many moments, quotations, and references \u2013 both epic and obscure \u2013 that helped turn the Simpson family into the cultural icons that they remain to this day.\" Mike Scully, who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve, has been the subject of criticism. Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote that \"under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon\u00a0... Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck. The show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years.\" When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked: \"Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that you can go on forever.\" Al Jean, who was showrunner during seasons thirteen through thirty-three, has also been the subject of criticism, with some arguing that the show has continued to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is \"on auto-pilot\", \"too sentimental\", and the episodes are \"just being cranked out.\" Some critics believe that the show has \"entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny.\" John Ortved, author of The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History, characterized the Jean era as \"toothless\", and criticized what he perceived as the show's increase in social and political commentary. Jean responded: \"Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't.\" In 2004, cast member Harry Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: \"I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now.\" Cast member Dan Castellaneta responded: \"I don't agree,\u00a0... I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh.\" Also in 2004 author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as \"hogwash\", saying \"The Simpsons hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now.\" In an April 2006 interview, Groening said: \"I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will get too financially cumbersome\u00a0... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, the stories do things that we haven't done before, so creatively there's no reason to quit.\" In 2016, popular culture writer Anna Leszkiewicz suggested that even though The Simpsons still holds cultural relevance, \u201ccontemporary appeal\u201d is only for the \u201cfirst ten or so seasons,\u201d with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off, or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters. The series' ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4\u00a0million viewing households per episode in the U.S., the twenty-first season had an average of 7.2\u00a0million viewers. Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz argued in their 2016 book titled TV (The Book) that the peak of The Simpsons are \"roughly seasons [three through twelve]\", and that despite the decline, episodes from the later seasons such as \"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\" and \"Holidays of Future Passed\" could be considered on par with the earlier classic episodes, further stating that \"even if you want to call the show today a thin shadow of its former self, think about how mind-boggingly great its former self had to be for so-diminished a version to be watchable at all.\" In 2020, Uproxx writer Josh Kurp stated that while he agrees with the sentiment that The Simpsons is not as good as it used to be, it is because \"it was working at a level of comedy and characterization that no show ever has.\" He felt there were still many reasons to watch the series, as it was \"still capable of quality television, and even the occasional new classic\" and the fact that the show was willing to experiment, giving examples such as bringing on guest animators like Don Hertzfeldt and Sylvain Chomet to produce couch gags, and guest writers like Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Pete Holmes and Megan Amram to write episodes. In the season 32 episode, \"I, Carumbus\", the show itself makes a nod to these concerns in its credits gag where the god Jupiter notes that \"It definitely feels like they're wrapping it up\u00a0... any day now.\" In a 2021 interview with NME, Jean was quoted as saying, \"To people who say The Simpsons isn't as good as it used to be, I would say I think the world isn't as good as it used to be. But we're declining at a slower rate\"."

Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu stated in his 2017 documentary The Problem with Apu that as a child he was a fan of The Simpsons and liked Apu, but he now finds the character's stereotypical nature troublesome. Defenders of the character responded that the show is built on comical stereotypes, with creator Matt Groening saying, \"that's the nature of cartooning.\" He added that he was \"proud of what we do on the show\", and \"it's a time in our culture where people love to pretend they're offended\". In response to the controversy, Apu's voice actor, Hank Azaria, said he was willing to step aside from his role as Apu: \"The most important thing is to listen to South Asian people, Indian people in this country when they talk about what they feel and how they think about this character.\" In February 2020, he confirmed that he would no longer voice Apu. Groening stated at the same time that the character would remain in the show. The criticisms were referenced in the season 29 episode \"No Good Read Goes Unpunished\", when Lisa breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience by saying, \"Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?\" to which Marge replies, \"Some things will be addressed at a later date.\" Lisa adds, \"If at all.\" This reference was clarified by the fact that there was a framed photo of Apu with the caption on the photo saying \"Don't have a cow, Apu\", a play on Bart's catchphrase \"Don't have a cow, man,\" as well as the fact that Hindus do not eat cows as they are considered sacred. In October 2018, it was reported that Apu would be written out of the show, which Groening denied. On June 26, 2020, in light of the various Black Lives Matter protests, Fox announced that recurring characters of color (such as Carl Carlson and Dr. Hibbert, among others) will no longer be voiced by white actors. Beginning with season 32, Carl, a black character originally voiced by Azaria, is now voiced by black actor Alex D\u00e9sert. In addition, Bumblebee Man, a Spanish-speaking Latino character also originally voiced by Azaria, is now voiced by Mexican-American actor Eric Lopez Dr. Hibbert, a black character originally voiced by Harry Shearer, is now voiced by black actor Kevin Michael Richardson."

There had been talk of a possible feature-length Simpsons film ever since the early seasons of the series. James L. Brooks originally thought that the story of the episode \"Kamp Krusty\" was suitable for a film, but he encountered difficulties in trying to expand the script to feature-length. For a long time, difficulties such as lack of a suitable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project.

Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial Simpsons books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of Chappelle's Show. In particular, seasons one through seventeen were released on DVD for 13 years between September 2001 to December 2014 in the U.S./Canada (Region 1), Europe (Region 2), and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America (Region 4). However, on April 8, 2015, Al Jean announced that the Season 17 DVD would be the last one ever produced, leaving the collection from Seasons 1 to 17, Season 20 (released out of order in 2010), with Seasons 18, 19, and 21 onwards unreleased.

        "content": "The X-Files is an American science fiction drama television series created by Chris Carter. The series revolves around Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who investigate X-Files: marginalized, unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. The original television series aired from September 10, 1993, to May 19, 2002, on Fox. The program spanned nine seasons, with 202 episodes. A short tenth season consisting of six episodes premiered on January 24, 2016, and concluded on February 22, 2016. Following the ratings success of this revival, The X-Files returned for an eleventh season of ten episodes, which premiered on January 3, 2018, and concluded on March 21, 2018. In addition to the television series, two feature films have been released: The 1998 film The X-Files which took place as part of the TV series continuity, and the stand-alone film The X-Files: I Want to Believe, released in 2008, six years after the original television run had ended. At the start of their investigations, Mulder believes in the existence of aliens and the paranormal while Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic, is assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder's discoveries, offer alternate rational theories to his work, and thus return him to mainstream cases. Early in the series, both agents become pawns in a larger conflict and come to trust only each other and a few select people. The agents also discover an agenda of the government to keep  secret the existence of extraterrestrial life. They develop a close relationship which begins as a platonic friendship, but becomes a romance by the end of the series. In addition to the series-spanning story arc, \"monster of the week\" episodes form roughly two-thirds of all episodes. The X-Files was inspired by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Tales from the Darkside, Twin Peaks, and especially Kolchak: The Night Stalker. When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse gender stereotypes by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the eighth and ninth seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), also became a main character. The first five seasons of The X-Files were filmed and produced in Vancouver, British Columbia, before eventually moving to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film The X-Files: I Want to Believe as well as the tenth and eleventh seasons of the series. The X-Files was a hit for the Fox network and received largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, it turned into a pop culture touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced conspiracy theories and spirituality. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple awards and nominations, and by its conclusion the show was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a franchise which includes Millennium and The Lone Gunmen spin-offs, two theatrical films and accompanying merchandise."

Mulder is a talented profiler and strong believer in the supernatural. He is also adamant about the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life and its presence on Earth. This set of beliefs earns him the nickname \"Spooky Mulder\" and an assignment to a little-known department that deals with unsolved cases, known as the X-Files. His belief in the paranormal springs from the claimed abduction of his sister Samantha Mulder by extraterrestrials when Mulder was 12. Her abduction drives Mulder throughout most of the series. Because of this, as well as more nebulous desires for vindication and the revelation of truths kept hidden by human authorities, Mulder struggles to maintain objectivity in his investigations. Agent Scully is a foil for Mulder in this regard. As a medical doctor and natural skeptic, Scully approaches cases with complete detachment even when Mulder, despite his considerable training, loses his objectivity. She is partnered with Mulder initially so that she can debunk Mulder's nonconforming theories, often supplying logical, scientific explanations for the cases' apparently unexplainable phenomena. Although she is frequently able to offer scientific alternatives to Mulder's deductions, she is rarely able to refute them completely. Over the course of the series, she becomes increasingly dissatisfied with her own ability to approach the cases scientifically. After Mulder's abduction at the hands of aliens in the seventh season finale \"Requiem\", Scully becomes a \"reluctant believer\" who manages to explain the paranormal with science. Various episodes also deal with the relationship between Mulder and Scully, originally platonic, but that later develops romantically. Mulder and Scully are joined by John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) late in the series, after Mulder is abducted. Doggett replaces him as Scully's partner and helps her search for him, later involving Reyes, of whom Doggett had professional knowledge. The initial run of The X-Files ends when Mulder is secretly subjected to a military tribunal for breaking into a top secret military facility and viewing plans for alien invasion and colonization of Earth. He is found guilty, but he escapes punishment with the help of the other agents and he and Scully become fugitives."

These episodes, forming the majority of the series, dealt with paranormal phenomena, including: cryptids, mutants, science fiction technology, horror monsters, and religious phenomena. Some of the Monster-of-the-Week episodes even featured satiric elements and comedic story lines. The main story arc involves the agents' efforts to uncover a government conspiracy that covers up the existence of extraterrestrials and their sinister collaboration with said government. Mysterious men constituting a shadow element within the U.S. government, known as \"The Syndicate\", are the major villains in the series; late in the series it is revealed that The Syndicate acts as the only liaison between mankind and a group of extraterrestrials that intends to destroy the human species. They are usually represented by Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis), a ruthless killer, masterful politician, negotiator, failed novelist, and the series' principal antagonist. As the series goes along, Mulder and Scully learn about evidence of the alien invasion piece by piece. It is revealed that the extraterrestrials plan on using a sentient virus, known as the black oil (also known as \"Purity\"), to infect mankind and turn the population of the world into a slave race. The Syndicate\u2014having made a deal to be spared by the aliens\u2014have been working to develop an alien-human hybrid that will be able to withstand the effects of the black oil. The group has also been secretly working on a vaccine to overcome the black oil; this vaccine is revealed in the latter parts of season five, as well as the 1998 film. Counter to the alien colonization effort, another faction of aliens, the faceless rebels, are working to stop alien colonization. Eventually, in the season six episodes \"Two Fathers\"/\"One Son\", the rebels manage to destroy the Syndicate. The colonists, now without human liaisons, dispatch the \"Super Soldiers\": beings that resemble humans, but are biologically alien. In the latter parts of season eight, and the whole of season nine, the Super Soldiers manage to replace key individuals in the government, forcing Mulder and Scully to go into hiding."

Spender is the son of Cigarette Smoking Man and his ex-wife, multiple abductee Cassandra Spender, as well as possibly being the half-brother of Mulder. Initially thought to have been murdered by Cigarette Smoking Man, Spender returned, horribly disfigured, in the ninth season and helped Scully's son William. Alvin Kersh is portrayed by James Pickens Jr. (season 9; recurring seasons 6, 8; guest season 11):As an assistant director (and later deputy director), he temporarily became supervisor to Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully when they were assigned away from the X-Files division. During this time, Cigarette Smoking Man would often visit him in his office. Kersh assigned Mulder and Scully mostly to menial tasks, such as terrorist details and Federal background checks. Kersh was largely antagonistic to Mulder and Scully, but in \"The Truth\" somewhat redeemed himself by helping Mulder escape capital punishment."

        "content": "California native Chris Carter was given the opportunity to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s. As Carter was tired of the comedies he had been working on for Walt Disney Pictures, a report that 3.7\u00a0million Americans may have been abducted by aliens, the Watergate scandal and the 1970s horror series Kolchak: The Night Stalker all contributed to trigger the idea for The X-Files. He wrote the pilot episode in 1992. Carter's initial pitch for The X-Files was rejected by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, whereupon they commissioned the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim to further develop the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line and the British television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration also came from Carter's memories of The Twilight Zone as well as from The Silence of the Lambs, which provided the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was determined to keep the relationship between the two leads strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel and John Steed in The Avengers series. The early 1990s series Twin Peaks was a major influence on the show's dark atmosphere and its often surreal blend of drama and irony. Duchovny had appeared as a transgender DEA agent in Twin Peaks and the Mulder character was seen as a parallel to that show's FBI Agent Dale Cooper. The producers and writers cited All the President's Men, Three Days of the Condor, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Rashomon, The Thing, The Boys from Brazil, The Silence of the Lambs and JFK as other influences. Carter's use of continuous takes in \"Triangle\" was modeled on Hitchcock's Rope. In addition, episodes written by Darin Morgan often referred to or referenced other films."

        "content": "Duchovny had worked in Los Angeles for three years prior to The X-Files; at first he wanted to focus on feature films. In 1993, his manager, Melanie Green, gave him the script for the pilot episode of The X-Files. Green and Duchovny were both convinced it was a good script, so he auditioned for the lead. Duchovny's audition was \"terrific\", though he talked rather slowly. While the casting director of the show was very positive toward him, Carter thought that he was not particularly intelligent. He asked Duchovny if he could \"please\" imagine himself as an FBI agent in \"future\" episodes. Duchovny, however, turned out to be one of the best-read people that Carter knew. Anderson auditioned for the role of Scully in 1993. \"I couldn't put the script down\", she recalled. The network wanted either a more established or a \"taller, leggier, blonder and breastier\" actress for Scully than the 24-year-old Anderson, a theater veteran with minor film experience. After auditions, Carter felt she was the only choice. Carter insisted that Anderson had the kind of \"no-nonsense integrity that the role required.\" For portraying Scully, Anderson won numerous major awards: the Screen Actors Guild Award in 1996 and 1997, an Emmy Award in 1997, and a Golden Globe Award 1997. The character Walter Skinner was played by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for the roles of two or three other characters on The X-Files before getting the part. At first, the fact that he was asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles\u2014Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow. His attitude fit well with Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role. Before the seventh season aired, Duchovny filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox, claiming that Fox had undersold the rights to its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Eventually, the lawsuit was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a settlement of about $20\u00a0million, but the lawsuit put strain on Duchovny's professional relationships. Neither Carter nor Duchovny was contracted to work on the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of that season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided that Mulder would be abducted at the end of the seventh season and would return in 12 episodes the following year. The producers then announced that a new character, John Doggett, would fill Mulder's role. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role of Doggett, but only about ten were seriously considered. Lou Diamond Phillips, Hart Bochner, and Bruce Campbell were among the ten. The producers chose Robert Patrick. Carter believed that the series could continue for another ten years with new leads, and the opening credits were accordingly redesigned in both seasons eight and nine to emphasize the new actors (along with Pileggi, who was finally listed as a main character). Doggett's presence did not give the series the ratings boost the network executives were hoping for. The eighth-season episode \"This is Not Happening\" marked the first appearance of Monica Reyes, played by Gish, who became a main character in season nine. Her character was developed and introduced due to Anderson's possible departure at the end of the eighth season. Although Anderson stayed until the end, Gish became a series regular."

Davis); her mother, Margaret (Sheila Larken); and her sister, Melissa (Melinda McGraw). The conspiracy-inspired trio The Lone Gunmen were also secondary characters. The trio was introduced in the first-season episode \"E.B.E.\" as a way to make Mulder appear more credible. They were originally meant to appear in only that episode, but due to their popularity, they returned in the second-season episode \"Blood\" and became recurring characters.

        "content": "During the early stages of production, Carter founded Ten Thirteen Productions and began to plan for filming the pilot in Los Angeles. However, unable to find suitable locations for many scenes, he decided to \"go where the good forests are\" and moved production to Vancouver. It was soon realized by the production crew that since so much of the first season would require filming on location, rather than on sound stages, a second location manager would be needed. The show remained in Vancouver for the first five seasons; production then shifted to Los Angeles beginning with the sixth season. Duchovny was unhappy over his geographical separation from his wife T\u00e9a Leoni, although his discontent was popularly attributed to frustration with Vancouver's persistent rain. Anderson also wanted to return to the United States and Carter relented following the fifth season. The season ended in May 1998 with \"The End\", the final episode shot in Vancouver and the final episode with the involvement of many of the original crew members, including director and producer R.W. Goodwin and his wife Sheila Larken, who played Margaret Scully and would later return briefly. With the move to Los Angeles, many changes behind the scenes occurred, as much of the original The X-Files crew was gone. New production designer Corey Kaplan, editor Lynne Willingham, writer David Amann and director and producer Michael Watkins joined and stayed for several years. Bill Roe became the show's new director of photography and episodes generally had a drier, brighter look due to California's sunshine and climate, as compared with Vancouver's rain, fog and temperate forests. Early in the sixth season, the producers took advantage of the new location, setting the show in new parts of the country. For example, Vince Gilligan's \"Drive\", about a man subject to an unexplained illness, was a frenetic action episode, unusual for The X-Files largely because it was set in Nevada's stark desert roads. The \"Dreamland\" two-part episode was also set in Nevada, this time in Area 51. The episode was largely filmed at \"Club Ed\", a movie ranch located on the outskirts of Lancaster, California. Although the sixth through ninth seasons were filmed in Los Angeles, the series' second movie, The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008), was filmed in Vancouver, According to Spotnitz, the film script was written for the city and surrounding areas. The 2016 revival was also shot there."

        "content": "The music was composed by Mark Snow, who got involved with The X-Files through his friendship with executive producer Goodwin. Initially Carter had no candidates. A little over a dozen people were considered, but Goodwin continued to press for Snow, who auditioned around three times with no sign from the production staff as to whether they wanted him. One day, however, Snow's agent called him, talking about the \"pilot episode\" and hinting that he had got the job. The theme, \"The X-Files\", used more instrumental sections than most dramas. The theme song's famous whistle effect was inspired by the track \"How Soon Is Now?\" from the US edition of The Smiths' 1985 album Meat Is Murder. After attempting to craft the theme with different sound effects, Snow used a Proteus 2 rackmount sound module with a preset sound called \"Whistling Joe\". After hearing this sound, Carter was \"taken aback\" and noted it was \"going to be good\". According to the \"Behind the Truth\" segment on the first season DVD, Snow created the echo effect on the track by accident. He felt that after several revisions, something still was not right. Carter walked out of the room and Snow put his hand and forearm on his keyboard in frustration. By doing so, he accidentally activated an echo effect setting. The resulting riff pleased Carter; Snow said, \"this sound was in the keyboard. And that was it.\" The second episode, \"Deep Throat\", marked Snow's debut as solo composer for an entire episode. The production crew was determined to limit the music in the early episodes. Likewise, the theme song itself first appeared in \"Deep Throat\". Snow was tasked with composing the score for both The X-Files films. The films marked the first appearance of real orchestral instruments; previous music had been crafted by Snow using digitally sampled instrument sounds. Snow's soundtrack for the first film, The X-Files: Original Motion Picture Score, was released in 1998. For the second film, Snow recorded with the Hollywood Studio Symphony in May 2008 at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox in Century City. UNKLE recorded a new version of the theme music for the end credits. Some of the unusual sounds were created by a variation of silly putty and dimes tucked into piano strings. Snow commented that the fast percussion featured in some tracks was inspired by the track \"Prospectors Quartet\" from the There Will Be Blood soundtrack. The soundtrack score, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, was released in 2008."

Carter sought to make the title an \"impactful opening\" with \"supernatural images\". These scenes notably include a split-screen image of a seed germinating as well as a \"terror-filled, warped face\". The latter was created when Carter found a video operator who was able to create the effect. The sequence was extremely popular and won the show its first Emmy Award, which was for Outstanding Graphic Design and Title Sequences. Producer Paul Rabwin was particularly pleased with the sequence and felt that it was something that had \"never [been] seen on television before\". In 2017, James Charisma of Paste ranked the show's opening sequence #8 on a list of The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time. The premiere episode of season eight, \"Within\", revealed the first major change to the opening credits. Along with Patrick, the sequence used new images and updated photos for Duchovny and Anderson, although Duchovny only appears in the opening credits when he appears in an episode. Carter and the production staff saw Duchovny's departure as a chance to change things. The replacement shows various pictures of Scully's pregnancy. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz, the sequence also features an \"abstract\" way of showing Mulder's absence in the eighth season: he falls into an eye. Season nine featured an entirely new sequence. Since Anderson wanted to move on, the sequence featured Reyes and Skinner. Duchovny's return to the show for the ninth-season finale, \"The Truth\" marked the largest number of cast members to be featured in the opening credits, with five. The revival seasons use the series' original opening credits sequence. The sequence ends with the tagline \"The Truth Is Out There\", which is used for the majority of the episodes. The tagline changes in specific episodes to slogans that are relevant to that episode."

As the season progressed, ratings began to increase and the season finale garnered 14\u00a0million viewers. The first season ranked 105th out of 128 shows during the 199394 television season. The series' second season increased in ratings\u2014a trend that would continue for the next three seasons\u2014and finished 63rd out of 141 shows. These ratings were not spectacular, but the series had attracted enough fans to receive the label \"cult hit\", particularly by Fox standards. Most importantly it made great gains among the 18-to-49 age demographic sought by advertisers. During its third year, the series ranked 55th and was viewed by an average of 15.40\u00a0million viewers, an increase of almost seven percent over the second season, making it Fox's top-rated program in the 1849-year-old demographic. Although the first three episodes of the fourth season aired on Friday night, the fourth episode \"Unruhe\" aired on Sunday night. The show remained on Sunday until its end. The season hit a high with its twelfth episode, \"Leonard Betts\", which was chosen as the lead-out program following Super Bowl XXXI. The episode was viewed by 29.1\u00a0million viewers, the series' highest-rated episode. The fifth season debuted with \"Redux I\" on November 2, 1997, and was viewed by 27.34\u00a0million people, making it the highest-rated non-special broadcast episode of the series. The season ranked as the eleventh-most watched series during the 199798 year, with an average of 19.8\u00a0million viewers. It was the series' highest-rated season as well as Fox' highest-rated program during the 199798 season. The sixth season premiered with \"The Beginning\", watched by 20.24\u00a0million viewers. The show ended season six with lower numbers than the previous season, beginning a decline that would continue for the show's final three years. The X-Files was nevertheless Fox's highest-rated show that year. The seventh season, originally intended as the show's last, ranked as the 29th most-watched show for the 19992000 year, with 14.20\u00a0million viewers. This made it, at the time, the lowest-rated year of the show since the third season. The first episode of season eight, \"Within\", was viewed by 15.87\u00a0million viewers. The episode marked an 11% decrease from the seventh season opener, \"The Sixth Extinction\". The first part of the ninth season opener, \"Nothing Important Happened Today\", only attracted 10.6\u00a0million viewers, the series' lowest-rated season premiere. The original series finale, \"The Truth\", attracted 13.25\u00a0million viewers, the series' lowest rated season finale. The ninth season was the 63rd most-watched show for the 200102 season, tying its season two rank. On May 19, 2002, the finale aired and the Fox network confirmed that The X-Files was over. When talking about the beginning of the ninth season, Carter said \"We lost our audience on the first episode. It's like the audience had gone away and I didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back.\" While news outlets cited declining ratings because of lackluster stories and poor writing, The X-Files production crew blamed September 11 terrorist attacks as the main factor. At the end of 2002, The X-Files had become the longest-running consecutive science fiction series ever on U.S. broadcast television. This record was later surpassed by Stargate SG-1 in 2007 and Smallville in 2011. The debut episode of the 2016 revival, \"My Struggle\", first aired on January 24, 2016, and was watched by 16.19\u00a0million viewers. In terms of viewers, this made it the highest-rated episode of The X-Files to air since the eighth-season episode \"This Is Not Happening\" in 2001, which was watched by 16.9\u00a0million viewers. When DVR and streaming are taken into account, \"My Struggle\" was seen by 21.4\u00a0million viewers, scoring a 7.1 Nielsen rating. The season ended with \"My Struggle II\", which was viewed by 7.60\u00a0million viewers. In total, the season was viewed by an average of 13.6\u00a0million viewers; it ranked as the seventh most-watched television series of the 201516 year, making it the highest-ranked season of The X-Files to ever air. A few years later, the premiere episode of the eleventh season, \"My Struggle III\", was watched by 5.15\u00a0million viewers. This was a decrease from the previous season's debut; it was also the lowest-rated premiere for any season of the show. The season concluded with \"My Struggle IV\", which was seen by 3.43\u00a0million viewers, which was also a decrease from the previous season. \"My Struggle IV\", which became the de facto finale for the series, was also the show's lowest-rated finale. In total, the season was viewed by an average of 5.34\u00a0million viewers, and it ranked as the 91st most-watched television series of the 2018\u201319 year."

He later explained that the main problem was to create a story that would not require the viewer to be familiar with the broadcast series. The movie was filmed in the hiatus between the show's fourth and fifth seasons and re-shoots were conducted during the filming of the show's fifth season. Due to the demands on the actors' schedules, some episodes of the fifth season focused on just one of the two leads. On June 19, 1998, the eponymous The X-Files, also known as The X-Files: Fight the Future was released. The crew intended the movie to be a continuation of the season five finale \"The End\", but was also meant to stand on its own. The season six premiere, \"The Beginning\", began where the film ended. The film was written by Carter and Spotnitz and directed by series regular Rob Bowman. In addition to Mulder, Scully, Skinner and Cigarette Smoking Man, it featured guest appearances by Martin Landau, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Blythe Danner, who appeared only in the film. It also featured the last appearance of John Neville as the Well-Manicured Man. Jeffrey Spender, Diana Fowley, Alex Krycek and Gibson Praise\u2014characters who had been introduced in the fifth-season finale and/or were integral to the television series\u2014do not appear in the film. Although the film had a strong domestic opening and received mostly positive reviews from critics, attendance dropped sharply after the first weekend. Although it failed to make a profit during its theatrical release\u2014due in part to its large promotional budget\u2014The X-Files film was more successful internationally. Eventually, the worldwide theatrical box office total reached $189\u00a0million. The film's production cost and ad budgets were each close to $66\u00a0million. Unlike the series, Anderson and Duchovny received equal pay for the film. In November 2001, Carter decided to pursue a second film adaptation. Production was slated to begin after the ninth season, with a projected release in December 2003. In April 2002, Carter reiterated his desire and the studio's desire to do a sequel film. He planned to write the script over the summer and begin production in spring or summer 2003 for a 2004 release. Carter described the film as independent of the series, saying \"We're looking at the movies as stand-alones. They're not necessarily going to have to deal with the mythology.\" Bowman, who had directed various episodes of The X-Files in the past as well as the 1998 film, expressed an interest in the sequel, but Carter took the job. Spotnitz co-authored the script with Carter. The X-Files: I Want to Believe became the second film based on the series, after 1998's The X-Files: Fight the Future. Filming began in December 2007 in Vancouver and finished on March 11, 2008. The film was released in the United States on July 25, 2008. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Carter said that if I Want to Believe proved successful, he would propose a third movie that would return to the television series' mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. The film grossed $4\u00a0million on its opening day in the United States. It opened fourth on the U.S. weekend box office chart, with a gross of $10.2\u00a0million. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed $20,982,478 domestically and an additional $47,373,805 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $68,369,434. Among 2008 domestic releases, it finished in 114th place. The film's stars both claimed that the timing of the movie's release, a week after the highly popular Batman film The Dark Knight, negatively affected its success. The film received mixed to negative reviews. Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream film critics, reported \"mixed or average\" reviews, with an average score of 47 based on 33 reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 32% of 160 listed film critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.9 out of 10. The website wrote of the critics' consensus stating; \"The chemistry between leads David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson do live up to The X-Files televised legacy, but the roving plot and droning routines make it hard to identify just what we're meant to believe in.\""

Fox chairman Dana Walden told reporters that \"conversations so far have only been logistical and are in very early stages\" and that the series would only go forward if Carter, Anderson, and Duchovny were all on board, and that it was a matter of ensuring all of their timetables are open.

However, seasons six, seven, eight and nine all contained the bonus materials found in the original versions. Episodic DVDs have also been released in Region 2, such as \"Deadalive\", \"Existence\", \"Nothing Important Happened Today\", \"Providence\" and \"The Truth\". Various other episodes were released on DVD and VHS. In 2005, four DVD sets were released containing the main story arc episodes of The X-Files. The four being Volume 1  Abduction, Volume 2  Black Oil, Volume 3  Colonization and Volume 4  Super Soldiers. A boxed set containing all nine seasons and the first film was made available in 2007, which contains all of the special features from the initial releases. The set also includes an additional disc of new bonus features and various collectibles, including a poster for the first film, a comic book, a set of collector cards and a guide to all 202 episodes across all nine seasons and the first film. Due to the fact that the set was released in 2007, the second film, which was released in 2008, is not included. Release of The X-Files seasons on Blu-ray, restored in high-definition, was rumored to begin in late 2013. The German TV channel ProSieben Maxx began airing first-season episodes reformatted in widescreen and in high-definition on January 20, 2014. On April 23, 2015, Netflix began streaming episodes of The X-Files in high definition, marking the first time that the series has been made available in the high resolution format in North America. In October 2015, it was confirmed that the complete series would be reissued on Blu-ray, and the full set was released on December 8, 2015. The set was criticized for using the wrong fonts for the title sequence and season 8 was affected by color balance issues making the picture appear darker in most episodes (an issue known as \"black crush\"). These issues led to Fox offering corrected discs and eventually issuing new sets with the correct color balance."

The series starred the eponymous Lone Gunmen, and was first broadcast in March 2001, during The X-Files's month-long hiatus. Although the debut episode garnered 13.23\u00a0million viewers, its ratings began to steadily drop. The program was cancelled after thirteen episodes. The last episode was broadcast in June 2001 and ended on a cliffhanger which was partially resolved in a ninth-season episode of The X-Files titled \"Jump the Shark\", included in the DVD release of the series."

        "content": "The X-Files was converted into a comic book series published by Topps Comics during the show's third and fourth seasons. The initial comic books were written solely by Stefan Petrucha. According to Petrucha, there were three types of stories: \"those that dealt with the characters, those that dealt with the conspiracy, and the monster-of-the-week sort of stuff\". Petrucha cited the latter as the easiest to write. Petrucha saw Scully as a \"scientist [...] with real world faith\", and that the difference between [Mulder and Scully] is not that Mulder believes and Scully doesn't; it's more a difference in procedure.\" In this manner, Mulder's viewpoint was often written to be just as valid as Scully's, and Scully's science was often portrayed to be just as convincing as Mulder's more outlandish ideas. Petrucha was eventually fired and various other authors took up the job. Topps published 41 regular issues of The X-Files from 199598. A 30 Days of Night/The X-Files cross-over graphic novel was published by WildStorm in 2010. It follows Mulder and Scully to Alaska as they investigate a series of murders that may be linked to vampires. In 2013, it was announced that The X-Files would return to comic book form with \"Season 10\", now published by IDW. The series, which follows Mulder and Scully after the events of The X-Files: I Want to Believe, was released in June 2013. Joe Harris wrote the series, and Michael Walsh and Jordie Bellaire provided the artwork. It was later announced that Carter himself would be the executive producer for the series and would be \"providing feedback to the creative team regarding scripts and outlines to keep the new stories in line with existing and on-going canon.\" The series restarted the series' mythology, and the first arc of the story focused on \"seek[ing] to bring the mythology of the Alien Conspiracy back up to date in a more paranoid, post-terror, post-WikiLeaks society.\" In addition, sequels to popular Monster-of-the-Week episodes were made. The X-Files Season 10 concluded on July 1, 2015, after 25 issues. In August 2015, The X-Files Season 11 comic book began, also published by IDW. The 8-issue series served as a continuation of the TV show.  Chris Carter was the Executive Producer of the comic book series, while the issues were written by Joe Harris and illustrated by Matthew Dow Smith and Jordie Bellaire."

        "content": "The X-Files received positive reviews from television critics, with many calling it one of the best series that aired on American television in the 1990s. Ian Burrell from the British newspaper The Independent called the show \"one of the greatest cult shows in modern television\". Richard Corliss from Time magazine called the show the \"cultural touchstone of\" the 1990s. Hal Boedeker from the Orlando Sentinel said in 1996 that the series had grown from a cult favorite to a television \"classic\". The Evening Herald said the show had \"overwhelming influence\" on television, in front of such shows as The Simpsons. In 2012, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at #4 in the \"25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years\", describing it as \"a paean to oddballs, sci-fi fans, conspiracy theorists and Area 51 pilgrims everywhere. Ratings improved every year for the first five seasons, while Mulder and Scully's believer-versus-skeptic dynamic created a TV template that's still in heavy use today.\" In 2004 and 2007, The X-Files ranked #2 on TV Guides \"Top Cult Shows Ever\". In 2002, the show ranked as the 37th best television show of all time. In 1997, the episodes \"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose\" and \"Small Potatoes\" respectively ranked #10 and #72 on \"TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\". In 2013, TV Guide included it in its list of the \"60 Greatest Dramas of All Time\" and ranked it as the #4 science fiction show and the #25 best series of all time. In 2007, Time included it on a list of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\". In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named it the fourth-best piece of science fiction media, the fourth best TV show in the last 25 years and in 2009, named it the fourth-best piece of science fiction, in their list of the \"20 Greatest Sci-fi TV Shows\" in history. Empire magazine ranked The X-Files ninth best TV show in history, further claiming that the best episode was the third season entry \"Jose Chung's From Outer Space\". In 2015, on The Hollywood Reporter'''s entertainment-industry ranked TV list \"Hollywood's 100 Favorite TV Shows\", The X-Files appeared at #3. According to The Guardian, MediaDNA research discovered that The X-Files was on top of the list of the most innovative TV brands. In 2009, it was announced that the show's catchphrase \"The Truth Is Out There\" was among Britain's top 60 best-known slogans and quotes.The X-Files has been criticized for being unscientific and privileging paranormal and supernatural ideas (e.g. the hypotheses made by Mulder). For instance, in 1998, Richard Dawkins wrote that \"The X-Files systematically purveys an anti-rational view of the world which, by virtue of its recurrent persistence, is insidious.\""

        "content": "The pilot episode was generally well received by fans and critics. Variety criticized the episode for \"using reworked concepts\", but praised the production and noted its potential. Of the acting, Variety said \"Duchovny's delineation of a serious scientist with a sense of humor should win him partisans and Anderson's wavering doubter connects well. They're a solid team...\" Variety praised the writing and direction: \"Mandel's cool direction of Carter's ingenious script and the artful presentation itself give TV sci-fi a boost.\" The magazine concluded, \"Carter's dialogue is fresh without being self-conscious and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV.\" Entertainment Weekly said that Scully \"was set up as a scoffing skeptic\" in the pilot but progressed toward belief throughout the season. After the airing of four episodes, the magazine called The X-Files \"the most paranoid, subversive show on TV\", noting the \"marvelous tension between Anderson\u2014who is dubious about these events\u2014and Duchovny, who has the haunted, imploring look of a true believer\". Virgin Media said the most memorable \"Monster-of-the-Week\" was Eugene Tooms from \"Squeeze\" and \"Tooms\". The following four seasons received similar praise. During the show's second season, Entertainment Weekly named The X-Files the \"Program of the Year\" for 1994, stating \"no other show on television gives off the vibe that The X-Files does\". The DVD Journal gave the second season four out of four stars, calling it a \"memorable season\". The review highlighted \"The Host\", \"Duane Barry\" and \"Ascension\", the cliffhanger finale \"Anasazi\", the \"unforgettable\" \"Humbug\" and meeting Mulder and Scully's families in \"Colony\" and \"One Breath\". IGN gave the season a rating of 9 out of 10, with the reviewer noting it was an improvement upon the first as it had \"started to explore a little\" and the \"evolution of the characters makes the product shine even though the plotlines have begun to seem familiar\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club argued that the third season of The X-Files was the show's \"best season and maybe one of the greatest TV seasons of all time\", noting it was consistent and \"[swung] from strength to strength\" between mythology and stand-alone episodes. Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly gave the fifth season an \"A\", writing that it \"proves the show was\u2014even then\u2014still at its creative peak (if only for another year or so) and full of surprises\". He praised the new additions to the series' mythology and concluded that \"many stand-alone episodes now look like classics\". Francis Dass, writing for the New Straits Times, noted that the season was \"very interesting\" and possessed \"some [...] truly inspiring and hilarious\" episodes. After the 1998 film, the show began to receive increasingly critical reviews. Some longtime fans became alienated during the show's sixth season, due to the different tone taken by most stand-alone episodes after the move to Los Angeles. Rather than adhering to the \"Monsters-of-the-Week\" style, they were often romantic or humorous or both, such as \"Arcadia\" or \"Terms of Endearment\". Some fans felt there was no coherent plan to the main storyline and that Carter was \"making it all up as he goes along\". As for the seventh season, The A.V. Club noted that while most of the first eight seasons of The X-Files was \"good-to-great\", the seventh season of the show was \"flagging\" and possessed \"significant problems\". Despite this, seasons six and seven included several episodes that were lauded by critics, including the sixth season entries \"Triangle\" and \"The Unnatural\", as well as the seventh season installment \"X-Cops\"."

Collin Polonowonski from DVD Times said that the season included \"more hits than misses overall\" but offered a negative word about the mythology episodes, claiming that they were the \"weakest\" episodes in the season. Jesse Hassenger from PopMatters, however, criticized the new season, claiming that Patrick was miscast and calling Duchovny's appearances as Mulder shallow. The ninth season received mixed to negative reviews by critics and garnered negative reaction from many long-time fans and viewers. Sabadino Parker from PopMatters, called the show \"a pale reflection of the show it once was\". Elizabeth Weinbloom from The New York Times concluded, \"shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination of what was once a beautifully complicated friendship\", between Mulder and Scully that ended remaining interest in what was a \"waning phenomenon\". Another The New York Times review stated, \"The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination.\" The A.V. Club listed the ninth season and the 2008 film The X-Files: I Want to Believe as the \"bad apple\" of The X-Files franchise, describing the ninth season as \"clumsy mish-mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'\". Brian Linder from IGN, on the other hand, was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Patrick and Gish's characters."

        "content": "As The X-Files saw its viewership expand from a \"small, but devoted\" group of fans to a worldwide mass cult audience, digital telecommunications were becoming mainstream. According to The New York Times, \"this may have been the first show to find its audience growth tied to the growth of the Internet\". The X-Files incorporated new technologies into storylines beginning in the early seasons: Mulder and Scully communicated on cellular phones, e-mail contact with secret informants provided plot points in episodes such as \"Colony\" and \"Anasazi\", while The Lone Gunmen were portrayed as Internet aficionados as early as 1994. Many X-Files fans also had online access. Fans of the show became commonly known as \"X-Philes\", a term coined from the Greek root \"-phil-\" meaning love or obsession. In addition to watching the show, X-Philes reviewed episodes themselves on unofficial websites, formed communities with other fans through Usenet newsgroups and listservs, and wrote their own fan fiction.The X-Files also \"caught on with viewers who wouldn't ordinarily consider themselves sci-fi fans\". While Carter argued that the show was plot-driven, many fans saw it as character-driven. Duchovny and Anderson were characterized as \"Internet sex symbols\". As the show grew in popularity, subgroups of fans developed, such as \"shippers\" hoping for a romantic or sexual partnership between Mulder and Scully, or those who already perceived one between the lines. Other groups arose to pay tribute to the stars or their characters, while others joined the subculture of \"slash\" fiction. In the summer of 1996, a journalist wrote, \"there are entire forums online devoted to the 'M/S' [Mulder and Scully] relationship\". In addition to \"MOTW\", Internet fans invented acronyms such as \"UST\" meaning \"unresolved sexual tension\" and \"COTR\" standing for \"conversation on the rock\"\u2014referencing a popular scene in the third-season episode \"Quagmire\"\u2014to aid in their discussions of the agents' relationship, which was itself identified as the \"MSR\". The producers did not endorse some fans' readings, according to a study on the subject: \"Not content to allow Shippers to perceive what they wish, Carter has consistently reassured NoRomos [those against the idea of a Mulder/Scully romance] that theirs is the preferred reading. This allows him the plausible deniability to credit the show's success to his original plan even though many watched in anticipation of a romance, thanks, in part, to his strategic polysemy. He can deny that these fans had reason to do so, however, since he has repeatedly stated that a romance was not and would never be.\" The Scully-obsessed writer in Carter's 1999 episode \"Milagro\" was read by some as his alter ego, realizing that by this point \"she has fallen for Mulder despite his authorial intent\". The writers sometimes paid tribute to the more visible fans by naming minor characters after them. The best example is Leyla Harrison. Played by Jolie Jenkins and introduced in the eighth-season episode \"Alone\", Harrison, was created and named in memory of an Internet fan and prolific writer of fan fiction of the same name, who died of cancer on February 10, 2001. Merchandise The X-Files spawned an industry of spin-off products. In 2004, U.S.-based Topps Comics and most recently, DC Comics imprint Wildstorm launched a new series of licensed tie-in comics. During the series' run, the Fox Broadcasting Company published the official The X-Files Magazine. The X-Files Collectible Card Game was released in 1996 and an expansion set was released in 1997. The X-Files has inspired four video games. In 1997, Fox Interactive released The X-Files: Unrestricted Access, a game-style database for Windows and Mac, which allowed users access to every case file. In 1998, The X-Files Game was released for the PC and Macintosh and a year later for the PlayStation. This game is set within the timeline of the second or third season and follows an Agent Craig Willmore in his search for the missing Mulder and Scully. Then, in 2004, The X-Files: Resist or Serve was released. The game is a survival-horror game released for the PlayStation 2 and is an original story set in the seventh season. It allows the player control of both Mulder and Scully. Both games feature acting and voice work from members of the series' cast. In February 2018, a mobile mystery investigation game The X-Files: Deep State was released on iOS, Android and Facebook. The story of the game takes place between seasons 9 and 10 of the show, and follows two FBI agents, Casey Winter and Garret Dale, as they investigate a sinister conspiracy. A 6-player pinball game, called The X-Files, was produced by Sega in 1997. Legacy The X-Files directly inspired other TV series, including Strange World, The Burning Zone, Special Unit 2, Mysterious Ways, Lost, Dark Skies, The Visitor, Fringe, Warehouse 13, Supernatural, and Gravity Falls, with key aspects carried over to more standard crime dramas, such as Eleventh Hour and Bones. The influence can be seen on other levels: television series such as Lost developed their own complex mythologies. In terms of characterization, the role of Dana Scully was seen as innovative, changing \"how women [on television] were not just perceived but behaved\" and perhaps influencing the portrayal of other \"strong women\" investigators. Russell T Davies said The X-Files had been an inspiration on his series Torchwood, describing it as \"dark, wild and sexy... The X-Files meets This Life\". Other shows have been influenced by the tone and mood of The X-Files. For example, Buffy the Vampire Slayer drew from the mood and coloring of The X-Files, as well as from its occasional blend of horror and humor; creator Joss Whedon described his show as \"a cross between The X-Files and My So-Called Life\". It also inspired themes in video games Deus Ex and Perfect Dark. The show's popularity led it to become a major aspect of popular culture. The show is parodied in The Simpsons season eight episode \"The Springfield Files\", which aired on January 12, 1997. In it, Mulder and Scully\u2014voiced by Duchovny and Anderson\u2014are sent to Springfield to investigate an alien sighting by Homer Simpson, but end up finding no evidence other than Homer's word and depart. Cigarette Smoking Man appears in the background when Homer is interviewed and the show's theme plays during one particular scene. Nathan Ditum from Total Film ranked Duchovny and Anderson's performances as the fourth-best guest appearances in The Simpsons history. In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \"Trials and Tribble-ations\", Benjamin Sisko is interviewed by Federation Department of Temporal Investigations agents Dulmer and Lucsly, anagrams of Mulder and Scully, respectively. The pair were later expanded upon in Christopher L. Bennett's book Watching the Clock. The X-Files has also been parodied or referenced in countless other shows, like: 3rd Rock from the Sun, Archer, NewsRadio, American Horror Story, The Big Bang Theory, Bones, Breaking Bad, Californication, Supernatural, Castle, Family Guy, Hey Arnold!, King of the Hill, South Park, and Two and a Half Men. Welsh music act Catatonia released the 1998 single \"Mulder and Scully\", which became a hit in the United Kingdom. American singer and songwriter Bree Sharp wrote a song called \"David Duchovny\" about the actor in 1999 that heavily references the show and its characters. Although never a mainstream hit, the song became popular underground and gained a cult following. Finnish band Sonata Arctica released, in 1999, the song \"Letter to Dana\", in which the title character, Dana O'Hara, is named after Scully. The series has also been referenced in: \"The Bad Touch\" by the Bloodhound Gang, \"A Change\" by Sheryl Crow, \"Year 2000\" by Xzibit, and \"One Week\" by Barenaked Ladies. Carter, Duchovny and Anderson celebrated the 20th anniversary of the series at a July 18, 2013 panel at the San Diego Comic-Con hosted by TV Guide. During the discussion, Anderson discussed Scully's influence on female fans, relating that a number of women have informed her that they entered into careers in physics because of the character. Anderson also indicated that she was not in favor of an X-Files'' miniseries, and Duchovny ruled out working with her on an unrelated project, but both expressed willingness to do a third feature film. Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, \"You need a reason to get excited about going on and doing it again.\" The series attained a degree of historical importance, as well. On July 16, 2008, Carter and Spotnitz donated several props from the series and new film to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Some of the items included the original pilot script and the \"I Want to Believe\" poster from Mulder's office."

        "content": "Back to the Future is a 1985 American science fiction film directed by Robert Zemeckis, with a screenplay by him and Bob Gale. It stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Set in 1985, the story follows Marty McFly (Fox), a teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a time-traveling DeLorean automobile built by his eccentric scientist friend Doctor Emmett \"Doc\" Brown (Lloyd). Trapped in the past, Marty inadvertently prevents his future parents' meeting\u2014threatening his existence\u2014and is forced to reconcile the pair and somehow get back to the future. Back to the Future was conceived of in 1980 by Gale and Zemeckis. They were desperate for a successful film after numerous collaborative failures, but their idea was rejected over 40 times by studios because it was not considered raunchy enough to compete with the successful comedies of the era. A development deal was secured following Zemeckis' success directing Romancing the Stone (1984). Fox was the first choice to portray Marty, but he was unavailable; Eric Stoltz was cast instead. Shortly after principal photography began in November 1984, Zemeckis determined Stoltz was not right for the part and made the concessions necessary to hire Fox. This included re-filming scenes already shot with Stoltz and adding $4million to the budget. Back to the Future was filmed in and around California and on sets at Universal Studios. Filming concluded the following April. Replacing Stoltz delayed production and the film's release date but, following highly successful test screenings, the date was brought forward to July\u00a03, 1985, to give Back to the Future more time in theaters. This resulted in a rushed post-production schedule, and some incomplete special effects. Back to the Future was a critical and commercial success, earning $381.1million to become the highest-grossing film of 1985 worldwide. Critics praised the story, comedy, and the cast\u2014particularly Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. It received multiple award nominations and won an Academy Award, Saturn Awards, and a Hugo Award. Its theme song, \"The Power of Love\" by Huey Lewis and the News, was a significant success globally. In the years since its release, Back to the Future has grown in esteem and is now considered to be among the greatest films of the 1980s, one of the best science-fiction films ever made, and one of the greatest films of all time. In 2007, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry. The film was followed by two sequels, Back to the Future Part\u00a0II (1989) and Back to the Future Part\u00a0III (1990). With its effect on popular culture and a dedicated fan following, Back to the Future launched a multimedia franchise. This includes an animated television series, video games, comic books, board games, clothing, music, books, food, toys, collectibles, and theme park rides. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous books about its production, documentaries, and commercials. Back to the Future has been adapted into a 2020 stage musical."

Doc inputs a destination time of November\u00a05, 1955\u2014the day he first conceived his time travel invention. The terrorists arrive unexpectedly, opening fire and shooting Doc. Marty flees in the DeLorean, inadvertently activating time travel when he reaches . Arriving in 1955, Marty discovers he has no plutonium to return. While exploring a burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters his teenage father and discovers Biff has been bullying him since high school. George falls into the path of an oncoming car while spying on the teenage Lorraine, and Marty is knocked unconscious while saving him. He wakes to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him. Marty tracks down a younger Doc and convinces him he is from the future, but Doc explains the only source available in 1955 capable of generating the power required for time travel is a lightning bolt. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that documents an upcoming lightning strike at the town's courthouse. As Marty's siblings begin to fade from a photo he is carrying with him, Doc realizes Marty's actions are altering the future and jeopardizing his existence; Lorraine was supposed to meet George instead of Marty after the car accident. Early attempts to get his parents acquainted fail, and Lorraine's infatuation with Marty deepens. Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance. He plots to feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to intervene and \"rescue\" her, but the plan goes awry when Biff's gang locks Marty in the trunk of the performing band's car, while Biff forces himself onto Lorraine. George arrives expecting to find Marty but is assaulted by Biff. After Biff hurts Lorraine, an enraged George knocks him unconscious and escorts the grateful Lorraine to the dance. The band frees Marty from their car, but the lead guitarist injures his hand in the process. Marty takes his place and performs while George and Lorraine share their first kiss. With his future no longer in jeopardy, Marty heads to the courthouse to meet Doc. Doc discovers a note from Marty warning him about his future and destroys it, worried about the consequences. To save Doc, Marty re-calibrates the DeLorean to return ten minutes before he left the future. The lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985, but the DeLorean breaks down, forcing Marty to run back to the mall. He arrives as Doc is being shot. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up, revealing he pieced Marty's note back together and wore a bulletproof vest. He takes Marty home and departs to 2015 in the DeLorean. Marty wakes the next morning to discover his father is now a confident and successful science fiction author, his mother is fit and happy, his siblings are successful, and Biff is a servile valet in George's employ. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc suddenly reappears in the DeLorean, insisting they return with him to the future to save their children from terrible fates."

        "content": "Long-time collaborators Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis conceived of Back to the Future in 1980. They wanted to develop a film about time travel but were struggling for a satisfying narrative and they were desperate for a successful project following the critical or commercial failures of their recent efforts. These projects had been collaborations with Zemeckis' mentor Steven Spielberg. Following the release of their comedy Used Cars (1980), Gale visited his parents and came across his father's high school yearbook. Gale questioned whether he and his father would have been friends had they attended school together. He did not think so, but realized he could test his theory if he could travel back to a time when he and his parents were a similar age. He shared the idea with Zemeckis, who recalled his mother's childhood stories were often contradictory. Gale and Zemeckis began a draft in late 1980. They sketched and acted out each scene to help develop the dialogue and actions. They believed many time travel films focused on the past being immutable, and wanted to show the past being changed and the impact those changes would have on the future. In the draft, video pirate Professor Brown builds a time machine that sends his young friend Marty back to the 1950s where he interrupts his parents' first meeting. In September 1980, Gale and Zemeckis pitched their idea to Columbia Pictures president Frank Price. Price had liked Used Cars and was keen to work with the pair. Gale recalled having to rein in Zemeckis' enthusiastic pitch before Price had time to change his mind. Gale and Zemeckis completed the first draft for Price on February\u00a021, 1981. Price believed it needed significant refinement. Some early concepts were abandoned. Originally, the changes to 1955 had a more significant impact on 1985, making it more futuristic, but every person who read the script hated the idea. Marty's father also became a boxer, a result of his knockout punch on Biff. The time machine was a stationary object moved around on the back of a truck. Inspired by the documentary The Atomic Cafe, the drained time machine was written to be powered by Marty driving it into a nuclear explosion, combined with an additional ingredient\u2014Coca-Cola. Gale and Zemeckis took inspiration from tales of legendary scientists, opting to make the time machine's creator an individual instead of a faceless corporation or government. The pair knew the time travel had to be an accident because they did not want the hero to be seeking personal gain. The pair drew humor from the contrasts between 1955 and 1985, such as Marty entering a 1955 soda shop while wearing 1985 clothing. The shop owner asks Marty if he is a sailor because his down vest resembles a life preserver. They also identified conveniences of 1985 that Marty would take for granted but be denied in 1955. The pair struggled as they were in their 30s and did not particularly identify with either era. The All-American aesthetic of films by Frank Capra featuring white picket fences and exaggerated characters like Biff, The Twilight Zone, science-fiction films, and books by Robert Silverberg and Robert A. Heinlein inspired them. The romantic relationship between 1955 Lorraine and her future son was one of the more difficult writing challenges. Gale and Zemeckis attempted to take the concept as far as possible to keep the audience feeling on edge. They knew it had to be Lorraine who stopped the relationship; she remarks that kissing Marty feels like kissing her brother. Gale jokingly said no-one asked how she could make that comparison, but audiences would accept it because they did not want the relationship to happen. The second draft was completed by April\u00a07, 1981."

        "content": "Price opted not to green-light the second draft. He liked it, but he did not think it would impress others. The most successful comedies at the time like Animal House (1978), Porky's (1981), and Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), featured sexual and bawdy elements; Back to the Future was considered too tame in comparison. The project went into turnaround\u2014a process allowing other studios to purchase the idea. The script was rejected approximately 40 times, sometimes multiple times by the same studios. Reasons given included the concept being unappealing to contemporary rebellious youth, and the failures of other time travel films like The Final Countdown (1980) and Time Bandits (1981). Walt Disney Productions turned it down because they considered Marty having to fight off his future mother's advances too risqu\u00e9 for their brand. The only person supportive of the project was Spielberg. However, with their previous collaborations considered relative failures, Gale and Zemeckis feared another misstep would give them a reputation of only getting work because they were friends with Spielberg. Zemeckis opted to accept the next project offered to him, Romancing the Stone (1984). Against pre-release expectations, the film was a significant success, and gave Zemeckis enough credibility to return to Back to the Future. Zemeckis held a grudge against the studios that had failed to support the project and turned to Spielberg, who had set up his own production company, Amblin Entertainment, at Universal Studios, where Price now worked. Spielberg disliked Price because he rejected E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and demanded his involvement in Back to the Future be minimal. Sidney Sheinberg installed himself as chief executive to oversee the studio's investment in the project. Amblin executives Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joined Spielberg as the film's executive producers. However, rights to Back to the Future remained tied to Columbia Pictures. Guy McElwaine\u2014Price's successor at Columbia Pictures\u2014was developing a satire of the Universal-owned noir film Double Indemnity (1944) called Big Trouble (1986). Its similarities to Double Indemnity meant the studio would violate Universal Pictures' copyright. With production imminent, McElwaine asked for the rights from Price; in exchange, Price obtained the rights to Back to the Future. Sheinberg suggested modifications to the film including changing the title to Space Man from Pluto because he believed Back to the Future would not resonate with audiences. Gale and Zemeckis did not know how to reject Sheinberg's suggestions without risking his ire. Spielberg intervened, sending Sheinberg a memo reading: \"Hi Sid, thanks for your most humorous memo, we all got a big laugh out of it, keep 'em coming.\" Spielberg knew Sheinberg would be too embarrassed to admit his memo was to be taken seriously. Sheinberg later claimed the story was \"bullshit\". He also wanted to change the name of Marty's mother from Meg to Lorraine (a tribute to his wife Lorraine Gary), and rename Professor Brown to Doc Brown because he considered it more accessible. A third draft was completed by July 1984. The lengthy development allowed Gale and Zemeckis to refine the script's jokes, especially ones that had become dated since 1980. The joke about former actor Ronald Reagan becoming President of the United States remained following his re-election in 1984."

        "content": "Michael J. Fox was the first choice to portray Marty McFly. Gale and Zemeckis believed his acting timing in the sitcom Family Ties (1982\u20131989) as the sophisticated Alex P. Keaton could be translated to Marty's clumsiness. Spielberg asked the show's producer Gary David Goldberg to have Fox read the script. Concerned Fox's absence would damage Family Ties success\u2014especially with fellow star Meredith Baxter absent for maternity leave\u2014Goldberg did not give Fox the script. Other young stars were considered including: John Cusack, C. Thomas Howell, Johnny Depp, Ralph Macchio, Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, Ben Stiller, Peter DeLuise, Billy Zane, George Newbern, Robert Downey Jr., Christopher Collet, Corey Hart (who declined to audition) and Matthew Modine. Howell was the frontrunner, but Sheinberg wanted Eric Stoltz, who had impressed with his portrayal of Rocky Dennis in an early screening of the drama film Mask (1985). With the filming date approaching, Zemeckis opted to go with Stoltz. Sheinberg promised that if Stoltz did not work out they could reshoot the film. The character's name was derived from Used Cars production assistant Marty Casella. Zemeckis suggested McFly because it sounded \"All-American\". Among others, Jeff Goldblum, John Lithgow, Dudley Moore, Ron Silver, Robin Williams, John Cleese, Mandy Patinkin, Gene Hackman, and James Woods were considered for the role of Doc Brown. Producer Neil Canton suggested Lithgow, having worked with him and Christopher Lloyd on Buckaroo Banzai (1984). Lithgow was unavailable, and the role was offered to Lloyd. He was reluctant to join the production until a friend encouraged him to take the part. Theoretical physicist Albert Einstein and conductor Leopold Stokowski inspired Lloyd's wild, white hair. Lloyd affected a hunched posture to lower his  height closer to the  tall Fox. The filmmakers became aware of Lea Thompson while researching Stoltz in the comedy-drama The Wild Life (1984). Crispin Glover used many of his own mannerisms in portraying George McFly. Gale described his performance as \"nuts\", and Zemeckis was reportedly unhappy with Glover's performance choices and instructed him to be more restrained as the older George. Glover lost his voice during filming and later dubbed in some of his lines. Deluise, Zane, Tim Robbins, and J. J. Cohen were considered to play Biff Tannen. Cohen was not considered intimidating enough against Stoltz, and the role went to Thomas F. Wilson; his first feature starring role. Zane and Cohen were cast as Biff's minions Match and Skinhead instead. Tannen's name was taken from Universal Studios executive Ned Tanen, who had been unpleasant with Gale and Zemeckis. Melora Hardin was cast as Jennifer Parker on a two-film contract. After Stoltz was replaced, the crew were polled about Hardin being taller than Fox; the female crew overwhelmingly voted Marty should not be shorter than his girlfriend. Hardin was replaced by Claudia Wells, who had been earlier offered the role but turned it down because of her commitment to the short-lived television series Off the Rack (1984). Actresses Kyra Sedgwick and Jill Schoelen were also considered; Schoelen was told she looked too \"exotic\" and not All-American enough. Doc Brown's pet dog Einstein was scripted as a chimpanzee named Shemp. Sheinberg insisted films featuring chimps never did well. James Tolkan was the first choice for Principal Strickland after Zemeckis saw him in the crime drama Prince of the City (1981). Singer and soundtrack contributor Huey Lewis cameos as a Battle of the Bands judge. Lewis agreed to appear as long as he was uncredited and could wear a disguise. Gale cameos as the hand in the radiation suit tapping the DeLorean time display."

        "content": "Principal photography began November\u00a026, 1984, on a 14-week schedule set to conclude on February 28, 1985, with an estimated $14million budget. Filming took place mainly at the Universal Studios lot and on location in California. Dean Cundey served as the cinematographer; he and Zemeckis collaborated on Romancing the Stone. Editor Arthur Schmidt was hired after Zemeckis saw his work on Firstborn (1984); Schmidt recommended hiring Harry Keramidas as co-editor. Frank Marshall also served as a second unit director. Owing to the tight schedule, editing occurred alongside the filming process. On December\u00a030, 1984, Zemeckis reviewed the existing scenes with Schmidt and Keramidas. Zemeckis was reluctant to review the footage because he would be self-critical, but he believed Stoltz was not working out and had already listed several scenes he wanted to reshoot. Zemeckis called in Gale and the producers to show them the footage; they agreed Stoltz was not right for the part. Stoltz was performing the role with an intense and serious tone and not providing the \"screwball\" energy they wanted from the character. Gale said Stoltz was a good actor in the wrong role. Stoltz utilized method acting and stayed in character as Marty when not filming, refusing to answer to his own name. This resulted in feuding with some of the cast and crew, including Wilson. Stoltz put his full strength into pushing Wilson rather than imitating doing so, despite Wilson's protests. Spielberg said Zemeckis needed a replacement in place before firing Stoltz, or he risked the production being canceled. Zemeckis and the producers asked Sheinberg for permission to do whatever was necessary to accommodate Fox's participation; Spielberg made another call to Goldberg. On January\u00a03, 1985, Goldberg told Fox about withholding the Back to the Future script from him, and the filmmakers wanted to know if he was interested. Baxter had returned to the show, and they could be more flexible with Fox as long as Family Ties took priority. Fox agreed to join without reading the script. The transition could not take place immediately and filming continued with Stoltz in the lead role, unaware he was to be replaced. On January\u00a010, 1985, Zemeckis informed Stoltz that he was no longer a part of the film. Zemeckis described it as \"the hardest meeting I've ever had in my life and it was all my fault. I broke [Stoltz's] heart.\" Stoltz was reported to have told his make-up artist he was not a comedian and did not understand why he was cast. The producers informed the principal cast and the rest of the crew much of the film would be re-shot. Cundey said most of the crew saw Stoltz's removal as \"good news\". Crew members later said there were obvious signs Stoltz would be replaced; the set designers were told not to change the 1955 set, and a scene involving a discussion between Marty and Doc was filmed only showing Doc. Stoltz had shot numerous key scenes including Marty traveling to 1955 in the DeLorean, it breaking down as he prepares to return to 1985, and his final scene was Marty's return to 1985. Filming fell behind schedule, with 34 days of filming lost and an additional cost of $3.5\u2013$4million, including Stoltz receiving his salary in full. Universal Pictures' marketing team was tasked with mitigating the negative public implications of a project replacing its main star."

        "content": "Fox's first day on set was January15, 1985. He filmed Family Ties during the day before traveling to the Back to the Future filming location. Often, he would not return home until early the following morning, and on weekends, the schedule was pushed back further as Family Ties was filmed in front of a live audience. The teamsters dropping Fox at home regularly had to carry the actor to bed. This continued until April when Family Ties finished filming. Gale said Fox's youth meant he could cope with less sleep than usual. Fox described it as exhausting, but worth the effort. Further into the filming schedule, Fox was energetic during his scenes but struggled to stay awake off set. He ad-libbed some lines when he forgot the intended dialog, and recalled looking for a camcorder on the Family Ties set, before realizing it was a prop on Back to the Future. He also had to learn to mimic playing the guitar and choreographed skateboarding routines taught by Per Welinder and Bob Schmelzer. To compensate for his conflicting schedules and keep the production costs low, some scenes involving Marty were shot without Fox, who filmed his part separately. Re-shooting scenes gave the filmmakers the opportunity to see what had not worked and implement new ideas. To avoid building an additional classroom set, the opening pan across the array of clocks in Doc Brown's laboratory replaced an opening scene where Marty sets off a fire alarm to get out of detention. The height differences between Stoltz and Fox necessitated other changes, such as a scene of Fox teaching George how to punch, because Fox could not reach the necessary prop. According to Gale, once Fox replaced Stoltz, the atmosphere on set improved. Thompson anecdotally said while Stoltz ate lunch alone in his trailer, Fox ate lunch with the cast and crew. The production used many locations in and around Los Angeles. The clock tower is a structure on the Universal Studios Lot in Universal City, California. When filmed from below, Lloyd was positioned on a recreation of the clock tower, but when filmed from above, Lloyd stood atop the tower itself. Production designer Lawrence G. Paull insisted on using the Universal backlot sets because of the difficulties and costs involved in making an on-location area look 1955 appropriate. Whittier High School in the city of Whittier is the Hill Valley high school. Marty's home and the surrounding Lyon estates are in Arleta, Los Angeles. Several of the residential locations were filmed in Pasadena: Lorraine's and George's 1955 homes, and Doc Brown's 1955 home\u2014its exterior is the Gamble House\u2014and interiors were shot at the Blacker House. The Walt Disney Studios-owned Golden Oak Ranch in Newhall, Santa Clarita, California, serves as the Twin Pines ranch where Marty lands in 1955 and Puente Hills Mall in Rowland Heights is the Twin Pines mall that replaces the ranch in 1985. Other locations include the basement of the Hollywood United Methodist Church where the school dance was filmed, and Griffith Park, where Marty begins his drive to the courthouse to return to 1985, crossing by a lamp post, situated outside of the Greek Theatre. Filming concluded after 107 days on April\u00a026, 1985. The final day of filming included pick-up shots of Marty and Einstein the dog in the DeLorean."

Repola served as the post-production supervisor, but he became responsible for many aspects outside of his role, including budgets, storyboarding, and general problem-solving. Those roles belonged to Kennedy and Marshall but both were occupied on other films. Schmidt found editing the film difficult, because he had to imagine where the special effects would later be added; there was no time or budget to re-edit afterward. A rough version of the movie was cut together for a test screening at Century 22 theater in San Jose, California, in mid-May 1985, just three weeks after filming concluded. The audience was seemingly uninterested at the exposition-heavy opening but became engaged after the DeLorean appeared. 94% of the audience at a test screening in Long Beach, California, responded they would definitely recommend the film; 99% rated it very good or excellent. Gale said there was some concern when Doc's dog Einstein was sent through time, as the audience believed he had been killed. The film was re-cut and screened again at the Alfred Hitchcock theater at Universal Studios for executives, including Sheinberg. He was so impressed he moved the scheduled release date forward to July\u00a03, 1985, to give it more time in theaters. This reduced the post-production schedule to just nine weeks for special effects and editing. Zemeckis spent much of June 1985 rushing to finish the film. Several scenes were filmed but did not make it into the finished film: a scene of Doc looking at an issue of Playboy, remarking the future looks better; a scene of 1985 George being coerced into buying a large amount of peanut brittle from a young girl; a scene of George being trapped in a phone booth by the man who interrupts his dance with Lorraine; and the scene of Marty pretending to be \"Darth Vader\" was shortened. Zemeckis considered cutting the \"Johnny B. Goode\" performance because it did not advance the story, but test-audiences reacted well to it. There is a dispute if a shot of Stoltz's hand is in the finished film in the scene where Marty punches Biff. Gale noted it is impossible to tell without checking the original film negative, which would risk damaging it. The final cut was completed on June\u00a023, 1985. It had a runtime of 116minutes. Universal Studios took out a full-page advertisement in Variety magazine, thanking the post-production crew for completing their work on time. The final budget was $19million."

        "content": "Alan Silvestri composed the score for Back to the Future; he had worked with Zemeckis on Romancing the Stone. The only direction Zemeckis gave him was \"it's got to be big\". Silvestri used an orchestral score to create a sound that contrasted with the small-town setting and the significant time-changing events occurring within it. He wanted a heroic theme that would be instantly recognizable in just a few notes. Huey Lewis was approached to write a theme song for the film; he was coming off the success of his recent album Sports. He met with Gale, Spielberg, and Zemeckis, who intended that Huey Lewis and the News be Marty's favorite band. Though flattered, Lewis did not want to participate because he did not know how to write film songs and did not want to write one called \"Back to the Future\". Zemeckis assured Lewis he could write any song he wanted. Lewis agreed to submit the next song he wrote, which was \"The Power of Love\". Lewis maintains \"Power of Love\" was his first submission, but Zemeckis recalled a different first song that was rejected. Lewis later acquiesced to Zemeckis' request for a second song, \"Back in Time\". Musician Eddie Van Halen performed the guitar riff Marty (dressed as \"Darth Vader\") uses to wake George. The filmmakers wanted to use Van Halen's music, but the band refused to take part, so Eddie took part on his own. Mark Campbell provided Marty's singing voice. Campbell did not receive credit as the filmmakers wanted to create the illusion Fox was singing. When music supervisor Bones Howe learned of this, he secured Campbell a small percentage of the soundtrack revenue as compensation. Paul Hanson taught Fox how to use a guitar to play \"Johnny B. Goode\", and choreographer Brad Jeffries spent four weeks teaching Fox to replicate various rock star moves popularized by artists like Pete Townshend, Jimi Hendrix, and Chuck Berry. Berry withheld permission to use \"Johnny B. Goode\" until the day before filming. He was paid $50,000 for the rights. Harry Waters Jr. provided the vocals on \"Earth Angel\"."

        "title": "Back to the Future_Special effects",
        "content": "Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed the film's special effects under the supervision of Ken Ralston and Kevin Pike. It contains approximately 27\u201332 special effects shots, compared to the 300 effects typical in higher-budget films of its time. Despite also working simultaneously on The Goonies and Cocoon, Ralston took on the additional project because it required relatively few effects, and he wanted to realize the planned ending of Marty driving the time machine into a nuclear explosion. The team had a nine-and-a-half week schedule, but this was reduced to eight once Universal Pictures moved up the release date. ILM was working on Back to the Future up to the moment it had to be handed over to print the theatrical film reels. The tight schedule affected the special effects' quality. Ralston was disappointed by the scene where Marty's hand fades away as his future is altered. Fox was filmed separately from his hand and the two were composited together; the hand was filmed with a wide-angle lens, making it appear too large and it had to be scaled down. Zemeckis wanted a subtle fade, but it resulted in a small circle of the hand fading away and there was no time to fix it. In the same scene, Marty and his siblings fade away from a photo. ILM found it difficult to fade the photo's individual aspects, especially as it is moving on the neck of a guitar. A replica of the guitar neck was constructed at four times the normal size; the guitar strings were made of cable up to a quarter-inch thick. An 11x14 inch aluminum plate was attached to hold the enlarged photograph. ILM used a version of the photo without Marty or his siblings and individually pasted each character into the photo. When this failed, four different photos were used: one containing the background, and one for each McFly sibling. A mechanical camera cycled through each photo and printed it to the film. The enlarged guitar was moved around to add to the realism. The original nuclear explosion ending was considered too complicated and expensive, with an estimated cost of $1million. Art director Andrew Probert storyboarded the scene which would have been created using sets and miniatures. With the ending moved to the clock tower, ILM researched storms to achieve the right look. Clouds were constructed from polyester fiberfill, suspended in a net and filmed from above while Ralston shone a powerful light from below. He used a rheostat to rapidly change the lights' intensity to imitate lightning. Developed by Wes Takahashi's animation department, the lightning bolt that strikes the clock tower was described as \"the largest bolt of lightning in cinematic history\". It was intended to originate far in the distance and move towards the camera, but the footage was filmed too close to the clock tower and there was insufficient space between it and the top of the frame for the effect. There was also an issue of showing the bolt onscreen for too long as it made it more obviously animated. The frame count was reduced but the effect did not look erratic enough. Zemeckis picked out a single frame of the bolt in an \"S\" formation and asked that the effect focus on that shape and be reduced to 20 frames. The bolt was drawn in black ink on white paper; a glow and diffusion effects were added by the Optical department."

They intended for the vehicle to look fixed together from common parts. The time machine was conceived as a stationary device; at one point it was a refrigerator. Spielberg vetoed the idea, concerned children might attempt to climb into one. Zemeckis suggested the DeLorean because it offered mobility, a unique design, and the gull-wing doors would appear like an alien UFO to a 1950s family. The Ford Motor Company offered $75,000 to use a Ford Mustang instead; Gale responded \"Doc Brown doesn't drive a fucking Mustang\". Michael Fink was hired as the art department liaison and tasked with realizing Cobb's sketches and overseeing the car's construction. Paull and Canton, who had worked with him on Blade Runner (1982) and Buckaroo Bonzai, respectively, recruited him. Fink had a project lined up but agreed to help in the free weeks he had remaining. Three DeLoreans used were purchased from a collector\u2014one for stunts, one for special effects, and one for normal shots.

The flying DeLorean used a combination of live-action footage, animation, and a 1:5 scale (approximately  long) model built by Steve Gawley and the model shop crew. The act of the DeLorean traveling through time is referred to as the \"time slice\" effect. Zemeckis knew only that he wanted it to be a violent transition. He described it like a \"Neanderthal sitting on the hood of the DeLorean and chipping away the fabric of time in front of him\". The effect is so quick as to be imperceptible. Zemeckis preferred this as he did not want the audience to think too much about how everything worked."

They used modern technologies\u2014such as contemporary fabrics\u2014because they felt the fashions of the time were less interesting. Using actual brand names like Texaco made the sets more realistic. Paull said the producers mandated the inclusion of certain brands who had paid to appear in the film. An unnamed gas company offered a large sum to be included, but Paull used Texaco because it reminded him of a joke from The Milton Berle Show. This led to some disputes. Pepsi's makers, PepsiCo, did not want a joke about Tab in the film as its rival Coca-Cola made it. Twenty clock wranglers were needed for the opening scene to synch up the many clocks. They used pulleys to start the clocks in sync with the scene recording. Drew Struzan produced the film's poster. The producers hoped his in-demand poster artwork would help generate public interest in the film. To represent characters across three decades, the filmmakers did not want to have older actors stand-in for the younger ones, believing the change would be obvious and distracting. Special effects artist Ken Chase was hired for his experience with prosthetics. He performed make-up tests on the young actors to age them; initially, the results were discouraging. Chase created a prosthetic neck and a bald cap with a receding hairline for Glover, but they were considered excessive. Chase found it difficult to balance aging the actors while retaining enough of their natural appearance so they remained recognizable. Casts were made of the actors' faces, from which plaster molds were made. Chase sculpted more subtle effects over the plaster molds using latex. For Lorraine, he crafted jowls and eye bags, plus body padding to reflect her increased weight and alcohol abuse. Instead of a receding hairline, Chase just changed the style of George's hair and used prosthetics to give him a less defined jawline. Biff's character changed more significantly; he was made to look fatter, given sideburns, and a comb over hairstyle to hide a growing bald-spot. Chase wanted him to look \"obnoxious\". The prosthetics were combined with makeup and lighting to further age the characters. Chase found the work frustrating compared to his experiences with more fantastical prostheses that made it easier to hide defects. The rubber latex did not reflect light the same way as natural skin. Chase used a stippling process\u2014creating a pattern with small dots\u2014to add varied colors to the actors' faces to better conceal where the skin and prosthetics met; close-up shots were avoided. Doc's appearance was not altered significantly. Chase used a technique where he painted latex on Lloyd which, when removed, caused crinkles in the skin; other elements like liver spots and shadows were painted on."

        "content": "By June 1985, the theatrical industry had seen a 14% decline in ticket sales over the previous year's $4billion record sales. The summer period (beginning the final week of May) had 45 films scheduled for release, including action film Rambo: First Blood Part\u00a0II, adventure film The Goonies, the comedies Brewster's Millions and Fletch and the latest James Bond film A View to a Kill. This represented a 25% increase over the previous year's releases, leading to concerns among industry professionals the competition would divide audiences and limit financial returns at a time when the average cost of making and marketing a film had increased to $14.5million and $7million respectively. A higher budget to secure a popular cast was considered a suitable risk, as the resulting box office returns were typically higher. Most films scheduled for release were aimed at younger audiences, focusing on fantasy and the supernatural. Reflecting the times, these fantasy elements often employed a technological source instead of a magical one. Only a few films, like Cocoon and Prizzi's Honor, were targeted at adults. Initially, Back to the Future was scheduled to be released in May 1985, but was pushed back to June\u00a021, the earliest Zemeckis could have the film ready. The delay caused by Stoltz's replacement pushed the release back to July\u00a019, and later to August. Sheinberg moved the release date forward to July\u00a03, giving it an extra 16 days of theatrical screen time during the industry's most profitable period of the year. The move offered about 100,000 extra screenings worth an estimated $40million. Sheinberg said he also wanted to avoid the negative perception of films released later in the summer period, instead of early like other blockbuster films. The change required renegotiations with theater owners to secure screens in an already crowded marketplace. In some cities, it was legally required exhibitors be shown a film prior to purchase; an unfinished cut of the film was shown to theater owners and young test audiences. They described it as not at the same level as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial or Ghostbusters, but a guaranteed box office hit. Fox was unavailable for promotional work because he was filming Family Ties Vacation (1985) in London."

        "content": "In North America, Back to the Future received a wide release on July\u00a03, 1985, ahead of Independence Day holiday weekend. The film earned $3.6million during the opening Wednesday and Thursday. During its inaugural weekend, it earned a further $11.3million from 1,420 theaters\u2014an average of $7,853 per theater. Back to the Future finished as the number one film of the weekend ahead of the western Pale Rider ($7million) in its second weekend, and Rambo: First Blood Part\u00a0II ($6.4million) in its seventh. It retained the number one position in its second weekend with a further gross of $10.6million, ahead of the debuting action film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ($7.8million) and Cocoon ($5million). It remained number one in its third weekend, ahead of the re-release of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ($8.8million) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ($5.4million). In its fourth weekend it fell briefly to number two behind the comedy National Lampoon's European Vacation ($12.3million). It returned to number one in its fifth weekend with $8.4\u00a0million, and remained there for the following eight weeks. Recalling the opening weeks, Gale said, \"our second weekend was higher than our first weekend, which is indicative of great word of mouth.\" The film remained a steady success through to September. By October, it had surpassed Rambo: First Blood Part\u00a0IIs $149million box office earnings to become the year's highest-grossing film with $155million. In total, Back to the Future was the number one film for 11 of its 12 first weeks of release. It remained in the top ten highest-grossing films for its first 24 weeks of release. By the end of its theatrical run, Back to the Future earned an approximate box office gross of $210.6million. This figure made it the highest-grossing film of 1985, ahead of Rambo: First Blood Part\u00a0II ($150.4million), the sports drama Rocky\u00a0IV ($127.9million), and the drama The Color Purple ($94.2million). According to estimates by Box Office Mojo, this indicates over 59million tickets were bought to see the film. Industry experts suggest as of 1997, the box office returns to the studio\u2014minus the theaters' share\u2014was $105.5million. The year was considered an unsuccessful one for film. Despite a record number of film releases ticket sales were down 17% compared with 1984. Industry executives blamed the problem, in part, on a lack of original concepts, and a glut of youth-oriented films targeted at those under 18. Only Back to the Future and Rambo: First Blood Part\u00a0II were considered blockbusters, earning more than double the box office of Cocoon. Films offering escapism and pro-America themes also fared well. After years of poor performances, Back to the Future, alongside Fletch, Brewster's Millions, and Mask, reversed Universal Picture's fortunes. Outside North America, the film earned a further estimated $170.5million. This made it the third-highest-grossing film behind the romantic drama Out of Africa ($179.1million) and Rocky IV ($172.6million). Cumulatively, Back to the Future earned a worldwide gross of $381.1million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1985 worldwide, ahead of Rocky\u00a0IV ($300.5million) and Rambo: First Blood Part\u00a0II ($300.4million). Back to the Future has received several theatrical re-releases to celebrate anniversaries, including a remastered version screened in 2010. These releases have raised the film's worldwide total to $388.8million."

        "content": "Back to the Future received generally positive reviews from critics. Janet Maslin called it the \"most sustained and entertaining\" of the summer's films. Richard Corliss said the audiences' kids would love the film over the next 30 years. For Paul Attanasio the film offered a return to a focus on storytelling. He added that even though every facet seemed mechanically designed to create a broadly appealing film, it never felt too safe. Attanasio concluded Back to the Future was a \"wildly pleasurable\" and sweet science-fiction comedy. Several reviewers compared it favorably to the 1946 fantasy drama It's a Wonderful Life. Roger Ebert said Zemeckis had delivered a \"fine comic touch\" and humanity, offering charm, humor, and a lot of surprises that offered the film's \"greatest pleasures\". Kirk Ellis (writing for The Hollywood Reporter) offered a similar sentiment, saying Zemeckis' direction added a comic humanity to the science-fiction setting. Ellis called it the Oedipal version of It's a Wonderful Life. He said that despite Spielberg's role as a producer, Back to the Future was clearly Zemeckis' film, being more subtle, gentler, and less noisy. Gene Siskel said initially Back to the Future seems to be everything wrong with youth-targeted movies of its era; however, it subverted his expectations by avoiding traveling to an unidentifiable future or historical event to focus on the unique perspective through a relatable tale. It offered something for both children and adults. Sheila Benson was more critical; she called the film \"big, cartoonish and empty\". She said Back to the Future had an interesting premise but was overproduced and underdeveloped. Benson believed the film lacked tension because there was never any doubt Marty would succeed, and the ending was left feeling hollow with materialistic rewards. Siskel countered the tension came by defying the expectations of a typical time travel film in making the past mutable and the future uncertain. Dave Kehr remarked Gale and Zemeckis were among the first wave of filmmakers openly influenced by growing up on televised entertainment, and their inspirations are evident throughout Back to the Future. He described it as \"zestfully tasteless\" with a uniquely American vulgarity, crassness and manic energy. Attansio appreciated the film had irreverent humor that was not mean-spirited. He felt the film succeeds by having an emotional core that keeps the audiences' interest among the laughter. Reviewers agreed the exposition-heavy opening leads into a better half. Ray Loynd, writing for Variety, described the opening as \"shaky\", but noted the rest of the film is filled with wit, wonder, and fresh ideas. He appreciated the comparisons between 1955 and 1985, and the \"delicious\" premise of Marty returning to the past only for his mother to fall for him romantically. Corliss agreed the opening was akin to a \"long fuse that explodes into comic epiphany mid way\". Leonard Maltin said it took a while to get to the action, but in describing the ending, he said it was a \"wow\". All the cast performances were generally well received, particularly those of Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. Reviewers were consistent in their praise for Fox's \"appealing\" performance. Several reviewers believed Lloyd's performance stole the show. Ellis said Lloyd was at his \"scene-stealing best\", offering an uncontrolled performance that would redefine movie scientists for the modern audience. Attanasio agreed; he said Lloyd demonstrated his unique \"intensity\" could carry a film. Kehr called Lloyd's character a tribute to every great mad scientist portrayed by the likes of Sid Caesar and John Belushi. Vincent Canby and Loynd said both Fox and Lloyd were good, but it was Glover and Thompson who were the standout performers. Loynd said Glover's bumbling-to-confident George McFly was the highlight, supported by Thompson's \"deceptively passionate\" performance. Some reviewers considered the use of Libyan terrorists, an actual fear at the time, to be in poor taste."

It was the first film to sell 450,000 units at that price point and was also the most rented cassette of the year. A sequel was not planned until after Back to the Futures theatrical release, and a \"To Be Continued...\" graphic was added to the end of the film on VHS to promote awareness of future sequels. When the film was released on DVD in 2002, the graphic was removed because Gale and Zemeckis wanted it to be as experienced in theaters. It has not appeared in releases since. It debuted on Blu-ray in 2010 for the film's 25th anniversary. The release included a six-part documentary including interviews with the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, and associated music videos from all three films. The release was notable for including the first released footage of Stoltz as Marty McFly. For its 35th anniversary in 2020, a remastered 4K Ultra HD version was released on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray. Along with extras included in previous releases, this edition included audition footage and an exploration of the film's props hosted by Gale. Limited edition steelbook cases and a display replicate of the levitating hoverboard from Back to the Future Part\u00a0II were also available. The Back to the Future soundtrack was released in July 1985, on cassette tape, LP record, and Compact disc (CD). The soundtrack's lead single, \"The Power of Love\", peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. Sales were initially slow, but it eventually peaked at number 12 on the Billboard 200, in part because of the success of \"The Power of Love\". Silvestri's score received a limited release in 2009 on CD, containing the film score and unreleased variations. The score was reissued on and LP in 2016 respectively, for the film's 30th anniversary."

As Back to the Future was not specifically aimed at children, there was no significant merchandising at the time of its release. One of the earliest items, a rideable DeLorean for children, was released in 1986. The film and its sequels have since been represented across a wide variety of merchandise including: Playmobil, playing cards, clothing, pottery, posters, board games, sculpted figures, plush toys, Funko POP! figures, action figures, Hot Wheels and die-cast vehicles, books, music albums, and Christmas ornaments. There have been several video game adaptations. Back to the Future was released alongside the film for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. An arcade-adventure game, Back to the Future, was released in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Gale called it one of the worst games ever made and advised people against purchasing it. Back to the Future: The Pinball was released in 1990. Fox refused permission for the game to use his likeness. An episodic graphic adventure game, Back to the Future: The Game, was released in 2010. Gale contributed to the game's narrative, which takes place after the events of the third film in the series. An area in Lego Dimensions is based on Back to the Future and features voice work by Lloyd. Back to the Future: The Ride, a simulator ride, ran from 1991 to 2007 at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida. The ride's development was supervised by Spielberg and featured Doc Brown (Lloyd) chasing down Biff (Wilson) who has stolen the DeLorean. A version of the ride at Universal Studios Japan ran from 2001 to 2016. A Back to the Future-themed Monopoly board-game was released in 2015. A Funko board game was released in 2020. It casts players as one of the main characters from the films to battle different Tannens across history. There have been several books about the making of the film series. We Don't Need Roads: The Making of the Back to the Future Trilogy is an oral history by those involved in the production. Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History\u2014a book chronicling the development of the entire Back to the Future franchise\u2014was released in 2015. The British Film Institute released BFI Film Classics: Back to the Future about the film's background. A novelization by George Gipe was released in 1985. There has also been a crossover between the Back to the Future and Transformers franchises. This included featuring a transforming DeLorean toy and associated comic books."

        "title": "Back to the Future_Thematic analysis",
        "content": "The main theme of Back to the Future concerns taking control and personal responsibility over one's own destiny. A situation can be changed even if it seems otherwise impossible to overcome. Thompson said the film represents how one moment can have a significant and lasting impact on a person's life. Gale believed Doc provided the perfect summary of the series' running theme, when in Back to the Future Part\u00a0III he said: \"Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.\" Even so, Marty's future is enriched at the expense of others. At the start of the film, Marty is rejected at Battle of the Bands and admits he fears his ambitions will remain unrealized. He worries he will end up like his parents and sees direct evidence in 1955 of George, also afraid of rejection, being unable to approach Lorraine; his fears risk Marty's future. Marty sets about manipulating the past to ensure his own survival without concern for what impact his presence in 1955 is having on others. On his return to 1985, he is rewarded with wealthier parents and a nicer car, but he has simultaneously damaged Biff's future, reducing him to a valet for the McFlys. Glover was critical of the film's ending. He believed Marty's reward should be happy parents in love with each other. He considered the ending a result of the film serving a corporate interest, promoting the accumulation of wealth and purchasing material objects. In 2015, Zemeckis said the ending was perfect for its time but would be different if he made it now. Gale disagreed and said he did not apologize for the scene. American audiences largely had no issue with this ending, but some international audiences criticized it. Despite rejection by film studios for not being raunchy enough, Back to the Future alludes to sexual assault, racism, and the Oedipus complex\u2014a psychiatric theory suggesting a child holds an unconscious sexual desire for their opposite-sexed parent. This refers to the relationship between Marty and his future mother Lorraine in 1955. The relationships between parents and children are the basis of many elements of the film. Where most people can only know their parents, Marty is given the opportunity to see his parents as his peers, when they were his age and shared the same ambitions and dreams as him. Justin Chang and Mark Olsen, suggest the film can be seen as promoting Reaganism\u2014the political positions of president Ronald Reagan\u2014promoting the older values of the American dream, self-reliance, initiative, and technological advancement. 1985 is presented as run down and in decay, while 1955 is presented as a more simplistic and seemingly safer time seen through the lens of nostalgia. Marty's future is bettered because he goes back to 1955 and teaches George to be more assertive and self-reliant. This leads to a more prosperous future for Marty with materialistic rewards. The film uses many brand names of the time, ostensibly to make the setting more realistic\u2014like Mountain Dew, Pepsi, and Texaco\u2014but the filmmakers received financial compensation for their inclusion, making them symbols of commercialism and thus materialistic. Sorcha N\u00ed Fhlainn argues many 1980s films resulted from the American public's desire for escapism from cultural anxieties and fears, including nuclear proliferation, unemployment, crime, growing inequality, and the AIDS crisis. Films like those in the Star Wars series and Back to the Future are designed to offer a childlike reassurance of safety and comfort. They emphasize idealized American values and the positive effects of instilling power in a patriarchal figure like George McFly or Darth Vader. Susan Jeffords notes Doc Brown is an analog for Reagan, a man who embraces technological advancement, who is in conflict with Libyan terrorists, and provides the means for a failing family to better themselves. The song \"Johnny B. Goode\" by Chuck Berry is used during the film's final act. Berry initially resisted allowing the song to be used in the film. NPR argued that while this may have been a matter of money for Berry, there are underlying racial issues involved in Marty, a Caucasian male, rewriting history to invent the rock and roll music genre, which was heavily influenced by African American music styles. The 1955 segment also presents a distorted view of America, showing an African American band playing at the high school dance at a time when this would not have been allowed. Similarly, the African American character Goldie Wilson is seemingly inspired to work towards becoming mayor by Marty's intervention, inspiring a Reagan-style initiative and self-reliance. As film fans, Gale's and Zemeckis' influences are seen throughout Back to the Future. There are references to The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Shaggy Dog (1959), Dr. Strangelove (1964), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), the Star Wars film series, and television shows including Mister Peabody, Star Trek: The Original Series, The Outer Limits, and The Twilight Zone. There are also allusions to The Time Machine (1960)\u2014based on the 1895 novella of the same name by H. G. Wells\u2014and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, in which the central character seemingly moves through time. The DeLorean dashboard chronometer uses the same color scheme as the time device of The Time Machine. Ray Loynd opined Doc can be seen as a King Arthur-type, with Marty serving as his knight."

It elevated Fox from financially struggling actor to one of the most in-demand and globally recognized stars in Hollywood. Gale received fan mail for decades after its release. Gale said he understood the continuing appreciation for the film as it was the \"purest\" and \"most complete\" film in the series. Fox compared it to The Wizard of Oz (1939), saying it still appeals to children because they do not think of it as an old film. In 2012, Thompson said her role as Lorraine was the greatest of her career. She suggested Back to the Future had remained relevant to new generations because of its core idea that the viewer's parents were once kids and had the same dreams they do. Dean Cundey believed it resonated with fans because it offers the fantasy of going back in time to change things and make the present better. Glover said he had watched it once and liked parts of it, but disliked the moral message of its ending. As of 2020, Wilson carries around cards containing answers to fan questions he has been asked over the preceding years, to avoid constantly repeating himself. Lloyd described being approached by fans from around the world, who have said the film inspired them to become a scientist. Many of the principal cast have reunited in the years since the film's release. Often these reunions are for charitable purposes, including The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's disease (Fox was diagnosed with the disease at age 29), and Project HOPE. A 2019 reunion for the TCM Classic Film Festival featured the premiere of the film's 4K restored version. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Josh Gad hosted a Back to the Future retrospective featuring many cast and crew. The cast has also appeared in advertisements only loosely related to Back to the Future, trading on their associated popularity. The DeLorean is considered one of the most iconic vehicles in film history. DeLorean's creator John DeLorean was a fan of the film and sent personal letters to Gale and Zemeckis, thanking them for using his vehicle. The DeLorean was not a popular vehicle before the film's release. However, in the years since it has become a popular collectors item, and the DeLorean Motor Company issued kits enabling fans to make their vehicle look more like the DeLorean time machine. $78,500 was crowdfunded to restore one of the original cars used in the film and an associated documentary about the restoration, Out of Time: Saving the DeLorean Time Machine."

In October 2015\u2014the day Doc and Marty travel to at the end of Back to the Future, as depicted in Back to the Future\u00a0II\u2014an estimated 27million social media users discussed the films; the most active users were in the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Brazil. In 2007, the United States Library of Congress selected the film to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. Ronald Reagan was a fan. When he first saw the joke about Doc Brown's incredulous response to Reagan becoming president, he ordered the theater's projectionist to stop the film, roll it back, and run it again. At his 1986 State of the Union Address, he referenced the film to appeal to America's young voters. He said, \"Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement. As they said in the film Back to the Future, 'Where we're going, we don't need roads'.\" Back to the Future is also seen as being responsible for a resurgence in the popularity of skateboarding in the 1980s. It made skateboarding a mainstream pastime acceptable for all, not just rebellious teens. It has been referred to in a variety of media, including television, films, and video games. Doc and Marty, respectively, inspired the eponymous characters of the 2013 animated television show Rick and Morty. The British pop rock band McFly are named for Marty McFly. The 2011 novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline and the 2018 film adaptation (directed by Spielberg) both heavily reference the film, including the central character using a DeLorean for transport. Filmmaker J. J. Abrams has also cited it as an inspiration. The 2015 crowdfunded documentary Back in Time follows various fans of the series and details the impact it has had on their lives, interspersed with interviews from the crew including Fox and Lloyd."

        "content": "The film's success spawned the Back to the Future franchise comprising film sequels, animated television shows, comics, and video games. It is considered one of the most successful film franchises. A sequel was not initially planned; the teaser ending of Doc, Marty, and Jennifer flying off in the DeLorean was suggesting their adventures would continue off-screen. Written by Gale and Zemeckis, the sequel script was so long it was split into two films, Back to the Future Part\u00a0II and Back to the Future Part\u00a0III; both films were shot back to back. Part\u00a0II was released in 1989. In its story, Marty and Doc travel to 2015, inadvertently enabling the now-elderly Biff Tannen to steal the DeLorean and return to 1955, rewriting history in his favor. Wells and Glover did not return for the sequels. Part\u00a0II was a financial success but was criticized for its complex, convoluted narrative. Zemeckis has said Part\u00a0II is his least favorite film in the series. The final film in the trilogy, Part\u00a0III, was released in 1990. Its plot follows Marty as he travels to 1885 to rescue a time-stranded Doc. While the film fared less well financially than the two earlier films, it was more critically well-received than Part\u00a0II. A 2018 poll by The Hollywood Reporter of 2,200 people found 71% of those asked wanted a Back to the Future sequel, ahead of another Toy Story or Indiana Jones film. Gale has said there will never be a fourth film. He likened it to \"selling your kids into prostitution\". He added a Back to the Future film could never happen without Marty McFly, and Fox could not participate because of the effects of his Parkinson's disease. An animated television series, Back to the Future, aired on CBS in 1991\u20131992. It followed Doc's and Marty's adventures through various historical periods, intercut with live-action segments featuring Doc (Lloyd), performing science experiments alongside Bill Nye. The film series' narrative has been expanded in comics and video games detailing Doc's and Marty's adventures before and after the events depicted in the films. A short film, Doc Brown Saves the World, was released in 2015 to celebrate the film's 30th anniversary. Lloyd reprised his role as Doc, who must travel to the future to prevent a nuclear holocaust in 2045. A musical theater production, Back to the Future, was announced in 2014. The musical was written by Gale and Zemeckis, with music written by Silvestri and Glen Ballard. It debuted at the Manchester Opera House, England, in February 2020, to positive critical reviews. Gale said the musical was the best way to give fans more Back to the Future without adding to the film series."

        "content": "The West Wing is an American serial political drama television series created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally broadcast on NBC from September 22, 1999 to May 14, 2006. The series is set primarily in the West Wing of the White House, where the Oval Office and offices of presidential senior personnel are located, during the fictitious Democratic administration of President Josiah Bartlet. The West Wing was produced by Warner Bros. Television and featured an ensemble cast, including Martin Sheen, John Spencer, Allison Janney, Rob Lowe, Bradley Whitford, Richard Schiff, Janel Moloney, Dul\u00e9 Hill, and Stockard Channing. For the first four seasons, there were three executive producers: Sorkin (lead writer of the first four seasons), Thomas Schlamme (primary director), and John Wells. After Sorkin left the series, Wells assumed the role of head writer, with later executive producers being directors Alex Graves and Christopher Misiano (seasons 6\u20137), and writers Lawrence O'Donnell and Peter Noah (season 7). The West Wing has been ranked among the best television shows of all time in publications such as Time,  TV Guide, Empire, Rolling Stone, and the New York Daily News. The Writers Guild of America ranked it no. 10 in its \"101 Best-Written TV Series\" list. It has received praise from critics, political science professors, and former White House staffers and has been the subject of critical analysis.  The West Wing received a multitude of accolades, including two Peabody Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and 26 Primetime Emmy Awards, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series, which it won four consecutive times from 2000 to 2003. The show's ratings waned in later years following the departure of series creator Sorkin after the fourth season (Sorkin wrote or co-wrote 85 of the first 88 episodes), yet it remained popular among high-income viewers, a key demographic for the show and its advertisers, with around 16\u00a0million viewers. A stage version of the season three episode \"Hartsfield's Landing\", \"A West Wing Special to Benefit When We All Vote\", premiered on HBO Max in October 2020, featuring the entire surviving original main cast along with key recurring cast in their original roles."

Rob Lowe left the series in the fourth season reportedly due to not getting a salary increase. Disparities in cast salaries led to very public contract disputes, particularly by Janney, Schiff, Spencer, and Whitford. During contract negotiations in 2001, the four were threatened with breach of contract suits by Warner Bros. However, by banding together, they were able to persuade the studio to more than double their salaries. Two years later, the four again demanded a doubling of their salaries, a few months after Warner Bros had signed new licensing deals with NBC and Bravo. John Spencer died of a heart attack on December 16, 2005, about a year after his character experienced a nearly fatal heart attack on the show. Martin Sheen gave a brief memorial message before \"Running Mates\", the first new episode that aired after Spencer's death. The loss of Spencer's character was addressed beginning with the episode \"Election Day\", which aired on April 2, 2006. In an interview on the first season DVD, Bradley Whitford said that he was originally cast as Sam, even though Aaron Sorkin had created the Josh character specifically for him. In the same interview, Janel Moloney stated she had originally auditioned for the role of C.J. and that Donna, the role for which she was eventually cast, was not meant to be a recurring character. Other actors were seriously considered for other roles, including Alan Alda and Sidney Poitier for the President, Judd Hirsch for Leo, Eugene Levy for Toby, and CCH Pounder for C.J."

        "content": "In The West Wing, as in many serial dramas, multiple story arcs span several episodes and entire seasons. In addition to these long-running narratives, each episode contains smaller storylines that usually begin and end within a single episode. Most episodes follow President Bartlet and his staff through particular legislative or political issues. Plots can range from behind-closed-doors negotiating with Congress to personal problems like post-traumatic stress disorder, from which Josh suffers during the second season. The typical episode loosely follows the President and his staff through their day, generally following several plots connected by some idea or theme. A large, fully connected set of the White House allowed the producers to create shots with very few cuts and long, continuous master shots of staff members conversing as they walk through the hallways. These \"walk and talks\" became a trademark of the show. The final two seasons presented a narrative change, with the focus of the show divided between plots in the West Wing with President Bartlet and his remaining senior staffers and plots revolving around the rest of the main cast on the campaign trail for the 2006 election. In the first season, the Bartlet administration is in its second year and is still having trouble settling in and making progress on legislative issues. The second season covers the aftermath of a shooting at Rosslyn, the 2000 midterm elections and dealings with a new Congress, and sees scandal when the White House is rocked by allegations of criminal conduct and the President must decide whether he will run for a second term. The third and fourth seasons take an in-depth look at the campaign trail and the specter of both foreign and domestic terrorism. In the fifth season, the President begins to encounter more issues on the foreign front, while at home he faces off with the newly elected Speaker of the House, battles controversy over Supreme Court appointments and oversees a daring plan to save Social Security. The sixth season chronicles the quest to replace President Bartlet in the next election, following the primary campaigns of several candidates from both parties, while the President himself attempts to build his legacy, but finds his ability to govern compromised by his illness. In the seventh season, the President must face a leak of confidential information about a secret Department of Defense program from inside the White House, while the Democratic and Republican candidates battle to succeed him in the general election."

        "content": "The series developed following the success of 1995 theatrical film The American President, for which Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay, and in which Martin Sheen played the White House Chief of Staff. Unused plot elements from the film and a suggestion from Akiva Goldsman inspired Sorkin to create The West Wing. According to the DVD commentary, Sorkin intended to center the show on Sam Seaborn and the other senior staff with the President in an unseen or a secondary role. However, Bartlet's screen time gradually increased, and his role expanded as the series progressed. Positive critical and public reaction to Sheen's performance raised his character's profile, decreasing Lowe's perceived significance. In addition, according to Sorkin, the storylines began to focus less on Sam and more on Josh Lyman, the Deputy Chief of Staff. This shift was one of the reasons for Lowe's eventual departure from the show in the fourth season. For the first four seasons, drawing on research materials, scene drafts, and occasionally entire draft scripts from his writing staff, Sorkin wrote almost every episode of the series, occasionally reusing plot elements, episode titles, character names, and actors from his previous work, Sports Night, a sitcom in which he began to develop his signature dialogue style of rhythmic, snappy, and intellectual banter. Fellow executive producer and director Thomas Schlamme championed the walk and talk, a continuous shot tracking in front of the characters as they walk from one place to another that became part of The West Wing signature visual style. Sorkin's hectic writing schedule often led to cost overruns and schedule slips, and he opted to leave the show after the fourth season, following increasing personal problems, including an arrest for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms. Thomas Schlamme also left the show after the fourth season. John Wells, the remaining executive producer, took the helm after their departure. The West Wing aired on Wednesdays at 9:00 pm ET from its debut until the end of its sixth season. NBC elected to move the series to Sundays at 8:00 pm for its seventh season, a move universally regarded as the beginning of the series' end (since NBC and the NFL had reached a deal for Sunday Night Football to return to the network in the fall of 2006), and the series finale aired on May 14, 2006. The West Wing took a large ratings hit with the move, which put it up against ABC's Top 20 hit Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, and CBS' Top 30 hit Cold Case in its timeslot."

However, President Gerald Ford's daughter Susan made the comment \"I can't watch [the show]. They turn left and right where you are not supposed to.\" Some West Wing veterans have said it exaggerates the formality and volume of chatter in the West Wing, under-represents the number of people involved in a decision, and over-idealizes its occupants. Former Senate aide Lawrence O'Donnell and former White House aide and presidential campaign speechwriter Eli Attie were both longtime writers on the show (O'Donnell for seasons 1\u20132 and 5\u20137, Attie for seasons 3\u20137).  Former White House Press Secretaries Dee Dee Myers and Marlin Fitzwater and pollsters Patrick Caddell and Frank Luntz also served as consultants, advising the writing staff for part of the show's run. Other former White House staffers, such as Peggy Noonan and Gene Sperling, served as consultants for brief periods. A documentary special in the third season compared the show's depiction of the West Wing to the real thing. Many former West Wing denizens applauded the show's depiction of the West Wing, including advisor David Gergen, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, and former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton. While critics often praised The West Wing for its writing, others faulted the show as unrealistically optimistic and sentimental. A large part of this criticism came from the perceived naivet\u00e9 of the characters. Television critic Heather Havrilesky asked, \"What rock did these morally pure creatures crawl out from under and, more important, how do you go from innocent millipede to White House staffer without becoming soiled or disillusioned by the dirty realities of politics along the way?\""

In the essay \"The West Wing and the West Wing\", author Myron Levine agreed, stating that the series \"presents an essentially positive view of public service and a healthy corrective to anti-Washington stereotypes and public cynicism.\" Dr. Staci L. Beavers, associate professor of political science at California State University, San Marcos, wrote a short essay, \"The West Wing as a Pedagogical Tool\". She concluded, \"While the series' purpose is for-profit entertainment, The West Wing presents great pedagogical potential.\" The West Wing, in her opinion, gave greater depth to the political process usually espoused only in stilted talking points on shows like Face the Nation and Meet the Press. However, she noted that the merits of a particular argument may be obscured by the viewer's opinion of the character. Beavers also noted that characters with opposing viewpoints were often set up to be \"bad people\" in the viewer's eyes. These characters were assigned undesirable characteristics having nothing to do with their political opinions, such as being romantically involved with a main character's love interest. In Beavers' opinion, a critical analysis of the show's political views can present a worthwhile learning experience to the viewer. While it aired, The West Wing offered viewers an idealist liberal administration that provided a sort of catharsis to those on the left who felt that their political beliefs were largely forgotten or ignored in the era of the Bush administration. Writer H\u00e9di Kaddour remarked that The West Wing \"show[ed] what [liberals] would have liked to have seen and had: a different American administration, closer to our desires as people more or less on the left.\" One of the stranger effects of the show occurred on January 31, 2006, when The West Wing was said to have played a hand in defeating a proposal backed by Tony Blair's government in the British House of Commons, during the so-called \"West Wing Plot\". The plan was allegedly hatched after a Conservative Member of Parliament watched the episode \"A Good Day\", in which Democrats block a bill aimed at limiting stem cell research, by appearing to have left Washington D.C. but actually hiding in a congressional office until the Republican Speaker calls the vote. A number of episodes referred to a practice of the administration having one day each year on which they accepted meetings with people or groups who would not normally receive an audience with high-level White House staffers, referring to the event as \"Big Block of Cheese Day\". The name came from the fact that President Andrew Jackson had a large wheel of cheese placed in the White House from which the public were invited to eat during a reception, while discussing issues of the day with politicians. In 2014, the White House announced that it was to host an online Q&A with Obama administration officials and staff, called a Virtual \"Big Block of Cheese day\", on January 29, 2014. The event was promoted with a video featuring stars from The West Wing. The event was repeated on January 21, 2015, again promoted by stars from the show. On April 29, 2016, Allison Janney appeared in character as C.J. Cregg during a White House press briefing."

Chris Lehmann, former deputy editor and regular reviewer for The Washington Post Book World section, characterized the show as a revisionist look at the Clinton presidency. Other critics have taken issue with the portrayal of conservatives on the show, criticizing The West Wing for a form of liberal elitism, as writer Luke Savage remarked, \"there is a general tenor to The West Wing universe that cannot be called anything other than smug.\" The hosts of socialist podcast Chapo Trap House are frequent critics of Sorkin and have called The West Wing an \"expression of the patronizing self-entitlement of liberals.\" On the other hand, some Republicans have admired the show since its inception, even before the departure of Sorkin and the show's resulting shift toward the center. In his 2001 article \"Real Liberals versus The West Wing,\" Mackubin Thomas Owens wrote, \u2033Although his administration is reliably liberal, President Bartlet possesses virtues even a conservative could admire. He obeys the Constitution and the law. He is devoted to his wife and daughters. Being unfaithful to his wife would never cross his mind.

The others nominated were Martin Sheen (for Lead Actor), Richard Schiff, Dul\u00e9 Hill and Bradley Whitford (for Supporting Actor), and Janel Moloney and Mary-Louise Parker (for Supporting Actress). In addition, that same year Mark Harmon, Tim Matheson and Ron Silver were each nominated in the Guest Actor category (although none won the award). This gave the series an Emmy Award record for most acting nominations overall (including guest performer category) in a single year, with 12 acting nominations. Twenty individual Emmys were awarded to writers, actors, and crew members. Allison Janney is the record holder for most wins by a cast member, with a total of four Emmys. The West Wing won at least one Emmy in each of its seasons except the sixth. In addition to its Emmys, the show won two Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, in 2000 and 2001, Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. Martin Sheen was the only cast member to win a Golden Globe Award, and he and Allison Janney were the only cast members to win SAG Awards. In both 1999 and 2000, The West Wing was awarded the Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting."

        "content": "The West Wing often featured extensive discussion of current or recent political issues. After the real-world election of Republican President George W. Bush in 2000, many wondered whether the liberal show could retain its relevance and topicality. However, by exploring many of the same issues facing the Bush administration from a Democratic point of view, the show continued to appeal to a broad audience of both Democrats and Republicans. In the second-season episode \"The Midterms\", President Bartlet admonishes fictional radio host Dr. Jenna Jacobs for her views regarding homosexuality at a private gathering at the White House. Dr. Jacobs is a caricature of radio personality Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who strongly disapproves of homosexuality.  Many of the President's biblical references in his comments to Dr. Jacobs appear to have come from an open letter to Dr. Schlessinger, circulated online in early May 2000. The Bartlet administration experiences a scandal during the second and third seasons that has been compared to the Monica Lewinsky affair. President Bartlet has known that he has relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) since 1992. The scandal centers on President Bartlet's nondisclosure of his illness to the electorate during the election. He is investigated by an opposition Congress for defrauding the public and eventually accepts Congressional censure. Multiple sclerosis advocacy groups praised the show for its accurate portrayal of the symptoms of MS and stressing that it is not fatal. The National MS Society commented: Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the start of the third season was postponed for a week, as were most American television premieres that year. A script for a special episode was quickly written and began filming on September 21. The episode \"Isaac and Ishmael\" aired on October 3 and addresses the sobering reality of terrorism in America and the wider world, albeit with no specific reference to September 11. While \"Isaac and Ishmael\" received mixed critical reviews, it illustrated the show's flexibility in addressing current events. The cast of the show state during the opening of the episode that it is not part of The West Wing continuity. While the September 11 attacks are not referred to in The West Wing continuity, the country enters into a variation of the War on Terrorism. Al Qaeda, mentioned briefly by Nancy McNally in the beginning of Season 2, plays no role in the longer terrorism story arcs of Seasons 3, 4 and 5. It is only mentioned again in Seasons 6 and 7. The stand-in used instead is the fictional Bahji terror group who first plots to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge. In response, the President orders the assassination of foreign leader Abdul ibn Shareef, one of Bahji's primary backers. This storyline has similarities to the real-world U.S. invasion of Afghanistan as well as U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia, as it brings the Middle East to the forefront of U.S. foreign relations and elevates terrorism as a serious threat. In the middle of the fourth season, Bartlet's White House is confronted with genocide in the fictional African country of Equatorial Kundu, which was compared to the Rwandan genocide of 1994. The result is new foreign policy doctrine for the Bartlet Administration and military intervention to stop the violence, which come after much hesitation and reluctance to call the conflict a genocide. In reality, the Clinton Administration did not intervene in Rwanda. In the sixth and seventh seasons, The West Wing explores a leak of top-secret information by a senior staffer at the White House. This leak has been compared to events surrounding the Valerie Plame affair. In the storyline, the International Space Station is damaged and can no longer produce oxygen for the astronauts to breathe. With no other methods of rescue available, the President is reminded of the existence of a top-secret military space shuttle. Following the President's inaction, the shuttle story is leaked to a White House reporter, Greg Brock (analogous to Judith Miller), who prints the story in The New York Times. Brock will not reveal his source and goes to jail for failing to do so, as did Miller. In order to stop the investigation, in which authorities suspect Chief of Staff C.J. Cregg, Toby Ziegler admits to leaking the information, and the President is forced to dismiss him. In comparison, the Plame affair resulted in the arrest and conviction of \"Scooter\" Libby, the Vice President's chief of staff. However, Libby was convicted of perjury in testimony to a grand jury. No one was convicted for \"blowing the cover\" of Plame. (Richard Armitage, an official in the Bush State Department, acknowledged leaking information about Plame to reporters but was never charged with a crime.) Libby's two and a half-year prison sentence was later commuted by President Bush, though the other facet of his sentence ($250,000 fine) stood until his 2018 pardon by President Donald Trump and was duly paid. In the series finale, President Bartlet, as his last official act, pardons Ziegler."

Real people mentioned in The West Wing include Muammar Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat, Fidel Castro, Queen Elizabeth II, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, King Carl XVI Gustaf, Thabo Mbeki and Osama bin Laden. Entire countries are invented as composite pictures that epitomize many of the problems that plague real nations in certain areas of the world: Qumar is a fictional, oil-rich, powerful, Middle Eastern state. A former British protectorate now ruled by a sultan and his family, it hosts a major US airbase and is frequently a source of trouble for the Bartlet administration. The nation is first introduced in the third season as a close ally of the United States but is criticized for its harsh treatment of women. After the September 11 attacks, it became a major venue for the show's terrorism subplots, including one where convincing evidence is discovered that Qumari Defense Minister Shareef is planning terrorist acts against U.S. infrastructure, including a failed conspiracy to destroy the Golden Gate Bridge, and President Bartlet authorizes his assassination by a covert operations team.  Geographically, as it is depicted on maps, it roughly corresponds to the Hormozgan Province of Iran. Equatorial Kundu is a fictional African nation blighted by AIDS and a civil war, resembling the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Its location, when depicted on maps, is roughly that of Equatorial Guinea. President Bartlet launches a military intervention in Equatorial Kundu during the fourth season in order to put an end to ongoing ethnic cleansing. Equatorial Kundu is also used during the third season of Sorkin's later television series The Newsroom."

        "content": "The West Wing universe diverges from history after Richard Nixon's presidency, although there is occasional overlap; for instance, in the second episode of the series' second season \"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen\" Toby Ziegler speaks to a Secret Service agent outside a building named for Ronald Reagan, although this may have just been a production oversight. Fictional Presidents who are shown to have served between Nixon and Bartlet include one-term Democrat D. Wire Newman (James Cromwell) and two-term Republican Owen Lassiter. Leo McGarry is mentioned as being Labor Secretary in the administration that was in office in 1993 and 1995. In the first season, an outgoing Supreme Court Justice tells Jed Bartlet that he had been wanting to retire for five years, but waited \"for a Democrat\" because he did not want a Republican president to replace him with a conservative justice (the Justice then tells President Bartlet, snidely, \"Instead, I got you.\"). The season four episode \"Debate Camp\" features a flashback to the days just before Bartlet's inauguration, as Donna Moss meets with her Republican predecessor, Jeff Johnson. In season six Leo says that the Republicans have been \"out of power for eight years\", and Republicans at their convention say \"eight (years) is enough\". The passage of time on the show relative to that of the real world is somewhat ambiguous when marked by events of shorter duration (such as votes and campaigns). Sorkin noted in a DVD commentary track for the second-season episode \"18th and Potomac\" that he tried to avoid tying The West Wing to a specific period of time. Despite this, real years are occasionally mentioned, usually in the context of elections and President Bartlet's two-term administration. The show's presidential elections are held in 2002 and 2006, which are the years of the midterm elections in reality (these dates come from the fact that in the season 2 episode \"17 People\", Toby mentions 2002 as the year of the President's reelection campaign). The election timeline in The West Wing matches up with that of the real world until early in the sixth season, when it appears that a year is lost. For example, the filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary, which would normally fall in January 2006, appears in an episode airing in January 2005. In an interview, John Wells stated that the series began one and a half years into Bartlet's first term and that the election to replace Bartlet was being held at the correct time. However, the season 1 episode \"He Shall from Time to Time\" shows the preparations for Bartlet's first regular State of the Union address, which would occur one year into his presidency. In the Season 1 episode \"Let Bartlet Be Bartlet\", Josh Lyman asks Toby Ziegler, \"Our second year isn't going much better than our first year, is it?\" In the season 5 episode \"Access\", it is mentioned that the Casey Creek crisis occurred during Bartlet's first term and got his presidency off to a calamitous start, and network footage of the crisis carries the date of November 2001."

Bartlet is stated to have won the election with 48% of the popular vote, 48 million votes, and a 303\u2013235 margin in the Electoral College. Of three debates between Bartlet and his Republican opponent, it is mentioned that Bartlet won the third and final debate, held eight days before election day in St. Louis, Missouri. Josh Lyman says that in the days prior to the election \"Bartlet punched through a few walls\" as the result seemed too close to call, before the result broke his way. Leo McGarry says the same thing in \"Bartlet for America\" when he says, \"It was eight days to go, and we were too close to call\". The campaign for the Democratic nomination is extensively addressed. In the episodes \"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part I\", \"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part II\" and \"Bartlet for America\", flashbacks are used to show Bartlet defeating Texas Senator John Hoynes (Tim Matheson) and Washington Senator William Wiley for the Democratic nomination and later choosing Hoynes as his running mate. The flashbacks also show Leo McGarry persuading Bartlet, then Governor of New Hampshire, to run for president."

Bartlet faces no known opposition for renomination, though Minnesota Democratic Senator  Howard Stackhouse launches a brief independent campaign for the presidency. Ritchie, not originally expected to contend for the nomination, emerges from a field of seven other Republican candidates by appealing to the party's conservative base with simple, \"homey\" sound bites. Bartlet's staff contemplates replacing Vice President John Hoynes on the ticket with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Percy Fitzwallace (John Amos), among others. After it is clear that Ritchie will be the Republican nominee, Bartlet dismisses the idea, declaring that he wants Hoynes in the number two spot because of \"four words,\" which he writes down and hands to Hoynes and McGarry to read: \"Because I could die.\" Throughout the season it is anticipated that the race will be close, but a stellar performance by Bartlet in the sole debate between the candidates helps give Bartlet a landslide victory in both the popular and electoral vote."

        "content": "A speed-up in The West Wing timeline, in part due to the expiration of many cast members' contracts and a desire to continue the program with lower production costs, resulted in the omission of the 2004 midterm elections and an election during the seventh season. The sixth season extensively details the Democratic and Republican primaries. The seventh season covers the lead-up to the general election, the election, and the transition to a new administration. The timeline slows down to concentrate on the general election race. The election, normally held in November, takes place across two episodes originally broadcast on April 2 and 9, 2006. Congressman Matt Santos (D-TX) (Jimmy Smits) is nominated on the fourth ballot at the Democratic National Convention, during the sixth-season finale. Santos, having planned to leave Congress before being recruited to run for the presidency by Josh Lyman, polls in the low single digits in the Iowa caucus. He is virtually out of the running in the New Hampshire primary before a last-ditch live television commercial vaults him to a third-place finish with 19% of the vote. Josh Lyman, Santos's campaign manager, convinces Leo McGarry to become Santos's running mate. Senator Arnold Vinick (R-CA) (Alan Alda) secures the Republican nomination, defeating Glen Allen Walken (John Goodman) and the Reverend Don Butler (Don S. Davis), among others. Initially, Vinick wants Butler to become his running mate. However, Butler does not want to be considered because of Vinick's stance on abortion. Instead, West Virginia Governor Ray Sullivan (Brett Cullen) is chosen as Vinick's running mate. Vinick is portrayed throughout the sixth season as virtually unbeatable because of his popularity in California, a typically Democratic state, his moderate views, and his wide crossover appeal. Vinick, however, faces difficulty with the anti-abortion members of his party as an abortion rights candidate, and criticism for his support of nuclear power following a serious accident at a Californian nuclear power station. On the evening of the election, Leo McGarry suffers a massive heart attack and is pronounced dead at the hospital, with the polls still open on the West Coast. The Santos campaign releases the information immediately, while Arnold Vinick refuses to use Leo's death as a \"stepstool\" to the presidency. Santos emerges as the winner in his home state of Texas, while Vinick wins his home state of California. The election comes down to Nevada, where both candidates need a victory to secure the presidency. Vinick tells his staff repeatedly that he will not allow his campaign to demand a recount of the votes if Santos is declared the winner. Josh Lyman gives Santos the same advice, although the Santos campaign sends a team of lawyers down to Nevada. Santos is pronounced the winner of the election, having won Nevada by 30,000 votes, with an electoral vote margin of 272\u2013266. According to executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell, Jr., the writers originally intended for Vinick to win the election. However, the death of Spencer forced him and his colleagues to consider the emotional strain that would result from having Santos lose both his running mate and the election. It was eventually decided by John Wells that the last episodes would be rescripted. Other statements from John Wells, however, have contradicted O'Donnell's claims about a previously planned Vinick victory. The script showing Santos winning was written long before the death of John Spencer. In 2008 O'Donnell stated to camera, \"We actually planned at the outset for Jimmy Smits to win, that was our .. just .. plan of how this was all going to work, but the Vinick character came on so strong in the show, and was so effective, it became a real contest ... and it became a real contest in the West Wing writer's room.\""

He has a gruelling but successful primary campaign against a more experienced candidate: Bob Russell on the show, Hillary Clinton in real life. A third candidate has been damaged by claims of infidelity: John Hoynes on the show, John Edwards in real life. The Democratic nominee chooses an experienced Washington insider as his running mate: Leo McGarry on the show, Joe Biden in real life. The Republican contest is determined early in the primary season with an aging \"maverick\" senator of a western state being the nominee: Arnold Vinick of California on the show, John McCain of Arizona in real life. The nominee defeats a staunchly pro-life opponent with pastoral experience, among others: Reverend Don Butler on the show, Mike Huckabee in real life. He then chooses a younger, socially conservative running mate in the midst of their first term as governor of a sparsely populated, resource-rich state: Ray Sullivan of West Virginia on the show, Sarah Palin of Alaska in real life. According to David Remnick's biography of Obama, The Bridge, when writer and former White House aide Eli Attie was tasked with fleshing out the first major Santos storylines, he looked to then-U.S. Senator Obama as a model. Attie called David Axelrod, with whom he had worked in politics, \"and grilled him about Obama.\" While Attie says that he \"drew inspiration from [Obama] in drawing [the Santos] character,\" actor Jimmy Smits also says that Obama \"was one of the people that I looked to draw upon\" for his portrayal of the character. Writer and producer Lawrence O'Donnell says that he partly modeled Vinick after McCain. Obama's former Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, is said to be the basis of the Josh Lyman character, who becomes Santos's Chief of Staff. However, O'Donnell denied this claim."

In need of experienced cabinet members, Santos taps Arnold Vinick as Secretary of State, believing the senior statesman to be one of the best strategists available and respected by foreign leaders. Santos eventually decides on Eric Baker, the Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania and at one point the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, as his choice for vice president, and submits his name to Congress under the terms of the 25th Amendment. While the show ends before he can be confirmed, it is implied he may face little opposition from Republicans due to the backing of Secretary of State Vinick. President Bartlet's final act as President of the United States is pardoning Toby Ziegler, who had violated federal law by leaking classified information about a military space shuttle. The series ends with Bartlet returning to New Hampshire.

Toward the end of a 2016 episode of Mom entitled \"Pure Evil and a Free Piece of Cheesecake\", main character Bonnie Plunkett, played by former West Wing cast member Allison Janney, fantasizes about becoming president of the United States, doing a walk-and-talk scene with former West Wing cast member Richard Schiff."

        "content": "The Adventures of Robin Hood is a 1938 American Technicolor swashbuckler film from Warner Bros. Pictures. It was produced by Hal B. Wallis and Henry Blanke, directed by Michael Curtiz and William Keighley, and stars Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains, Patric Knowles, Eugene Pallette and Alan Hale Sr. The film was written by Norman Reilly Raine and Seton I. Miller. The storyline depicts the legendary Saxon knight Robin Hood who, in King Richard the Lionheart's absence in the Holy Land during the Crusades, fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla band against Prince John and the Norman lords oppressing the Saxon commoners. The Adventures of Robin Hood has been acclaimed by critics since its release. In 1995, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. Alan Hale Sr., who plays Little John, had played the same character in Douglas Fairbanks's 1922 version of the film and went on to play him again in Rogues of Sherwood Forest, released by Columbia in 1950, a 28-year span."

        "content": "Richard, the Norman King of England, is taken captive in 1191 by Duke Leopold while returning from the Third Crusade. Richard's treacherous brother Prince John, aided by fellow Norman Sir Guy of Gisbourne, takes the opportunity to name himself regent of England, and increases the taxes and regulations on the Saxons under the pretense of gathering ransom for Richard. The Normans exploit and oppress the Saxons. Sir Robin of Locksley, a Saxon noble, opposes the brutality and rescues Much the Miller's Son from being executed for poaching, earning Gisbourne's ire. Robin confronts Prince John at Nottingham Castle during a banquet, telling the guests that he regards John's declaring himself regent in Richard's absence as treason. John orders Robin's execution, but he escapes and flees with Much and Will Scarlet into Sherwood Forest. In response, John seizes Robin's lands and names him an outlaw. Much is sent to recruit men to join their band. Robin and Will meet up with John the Little on a log bridge, and after a quarterstaff contest, welcome him into their ranks. Dozens more men join Robin's band by swearing an oath to harm the rich only to aid the poor, to fight injustice, and to show courtesy to all oppressed. They start a guerrilla war against Gisbourne and John, sniping those who abuse their power. Robin's band encounters the rotund Friar Tuck, a renowned swordsman. Tuck joins the band and assists in capturing a company of Normans bringing a shipment of food and taxes. In the company are Gisbourne, the cowardly Sheriff of Nottingham, and King Richard's ward Lady Marian; the men are humiliated at the subsequent woodland banquet, while Marian is given a seat of honor by Robin. Initially scornful, she comes to share his views when he shows her the aftermath of the Norman brutality against the Saxons. Robin sends the convoy back to Nottingham Castle, telling them that they have Marian's presence to thank for their lives being spared. Having noted Robin's fixation on Marian during the woodland banquet, the Sheriff suggests hosting an archery tournament with the Lady Marian giving out the golden arrow prize in order to entrap Robin. Robin enters the tournament, is recognized by his unsurpassed archery skill, and is sentenced to death. Marian aids the Merry Men in a scheme to save Robin. After his escape, he scales the palace walls to thank Marian, and the two pledge their love for one another. Marian declines Robin's offer of marriage, electing to stay and be a Saxon spy in the castle. King Richard returns with some of his knights. The Bishop of the Black Canons sees through Richard's disguise at a roadside inn, and alerts John. John sends disgraced former knight Dickon Malbete to kill Richard, promising Dickon Robin's title and lands. Marian overhears and writes to Robin, but is found out by Gisbourne and sentenced to death. Her nursemaid, Bess, tells Much everything. Much intercepts Dickon and kills him in combat. Richard and his men disguise themselves as Norman monks, travel through Sherwood and (as planned) are stopped by Robin. Assuring Robin they are on the King's business, Richard accepts Robin's offer of hospitality and his condemnation of the Crusades, but does not reveal his identity. Much relays Bess' news. Robin orders his men to find and protect Richard; now sure of Robin's loyalty, Richard reveals himself. He and Robin coerce the Bishop of the Black Canons to allow them to join his monks in disguise so they can enter the castle. Once inside, Richard announces his presence, and a huge melee erupts. Robin duels Gisbourne and kills him, freeing Marian and prompting the rest of John's men to surrender. Back on the throne, King Richard banishes John and restores Robin's rank, promoting him to Baron of Locksley, and Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham. The King also pardons the Merry Men, and commands Robin to take Lady Marian as his wife. Robin exits the castle with Marian."

        "content": "The Adventures of Robin Hood was produced at an estimated cost of $2 million, the most expensive film Warner Bros. had made up to that time. It was also the studio's first film utilizing the three-strip Technicolor process. The film was in fact planned to be shot in black and white for most of its development; the switch to Technicolor happened just three months before production started. It was an unusually extravagant production for the Warner Bros. studio, which had made a name for itself in producing socially-conscious, low-budget gangster films. Producer Hal B. Wallis is generally seen as the film's creative helmsman. The first draft of the script was written by Rowland Lee, but Wallis objected to its heavily archaic and fanciful dialogue (one line he cited was \"Oh my lord, tarry not too long, for I fear that in her remorse she may fling herself from the window. Some harm may befall her, I know.\"). At Wallis's insistence, the script was heavily rewritten to modernize the dialogue, and it is unclear whether any of Lee's work survives in the completed film. The scene in which Robin Hood first meets Prince John, Guy of Gisbourne, and Maid Marian went through several iterations. Initially the scene was to be at a jousting tournament with Robin tilting against Guy of Gisbourne, mimicking the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks production of Robin Hood, but screenwriter Norman Reilly Raine pointed out that a banquet scene would be much less expensive to produce and, so long as Technicolor was employed, would look just as lavish to the average moviegoer. In another draft, instead of a deer, it was a slain villager who Robin Hood brought in and dumped on Prince John's table. Wallis felt the use of a dead villager expended all the tension of the scene in \"a momentary kick\", and preferred the use of a deer from an earlier draft, which allowed the tension to simmer with the threat of an explosion at any moment. James Cagney was originally cast as Robin Hood, but walked out on his Warner Bros. contract, paving the way for the role to go to Errol Flynn. The filming was postponed three years as a result. Though Olivia de Havilland was an early frontrunner for the role of Maid Marian, for a time the studio vacillated between her and Anita Louise for the part. De Havilland was ultimately chosen because the success of Captain Blood established the pairing of Flynn and de Havilland as a safe bet to help ensure box office success. Location work for The Adventures of Robin Hood included Bidwell Park in Chico, California, which substituted for Sherwood Forest, although one major scene was filmed at the California locations \"Lake Sherwood\" and \"Sherwood Forest\", so named because they were the location sites for the Fairbanks production of Robin Hood. Several scenes were shot at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios and the Warner Ranch in Calabasas. The archery tournament was filmed at the former Busch Gardens, now part of Lower Arroyo Park, in Pasadena. Scenes which were filmed but not included in the final cut include the disguised King Richard brawling with Friar Tuck, and Robin riding off with Maid Marian; the latter would have been the concluding scene of the film, and appears in the theatrical trailer despite not appearing in the film itself."

        "content": "All the arrows in the film were shot by professional archer Howard Hill. Those shot with arrows wore clothing padded with balsa wood on protective metal plates; the metal plates prevented injury (though impact was fairly painful), and the arrows lodged into the balsa wood to create the illusion of bodily penetration. Hill, although listed as the archer captain defeated by Robin, was cast as Elwen the Welshman, an archer seen shooting at Robin in his escape from Nottingham castle and, later, defeated by Robin at the archery tournament. To win, Robin splits the arrow of Philip of Arras, a captain of the guard under Gisbourne, who had struck the bullseye. Hill did in fact split one arrow with another during filming (albeit while firing from a much closer range than Robin Hood is portrayed as shooting from), but it did not look good enough on film, so the shot was redone with some effects trickery. Stuntman Buster Wiles, close friend of Errol Flynn and his frequent on-set stand-in, maintained that the arrow-splitting stunt was carried out using an extra large arrow (for the target) and that the second arrow had a wide, flat arrowhead and was fired along a wire. This wire can briefly be seen attached to the fletching of the arrow, in the final film. Wiles discusses the scene in his autobiography, My Days With Errol Flynn. Flynn performed most of his own stunts in the film; exceptions include Robin jumping onto a horse with hands tied behind his back (during the hanging scene), scaling the fortress gate and coming down the other side, and a few select shots in the duel between Robin and Guy of Gisbourne."

        "content": "In 1938, Erich Wolfgang Korngold was conducting opera in Austria when he was asked by Warner Bros. to return to Hollywood and compose a score for The Adventures of Robin Hood. Music historian Laurence E. MacDonald notes that there were many factors which made the film a success, including its cast, its Technicolor photography, and fast-paced direction by Michael Curtiz, but \"most of all, there is Korngold's glorious music\". And film historian Rudy Behlmer describes Korngold's contribution to this and his other films: In reply to Warner Bros.\u2019 request, Korngold told studio head of production Hal B. Wallis that he was a composer of drama and the heart, and felt little connection to what he perceived as \u201ca 90% action picture.\u201d Wallis was persistent, and Korngold finally agreed to begin composing on the condition that he not have a contract, and work on a week-by-week basis so that he could withdraw if he were dissatisfied with the music he composed. However, Korngold later admitted that the real reason he changed his mind was Adolf Hitler's November 1937 meeting with Austrian ministers, which convinced Korngold that it was no longer safe in his home country. As Korngold feared, Austria was annexed by the Nazis, and his home in Vienna was confiscated. This meant that all Jews in Austria were now at risk, so Korngold stayed in America until the end of World War II. Korngold called his film scores \u201cOpern ohne Singen,\u201d operas without singing, but otherwise approached their composition just as he would for the operatic stage. The Adventures of Robin Hood was, therefore, a large-scale symphonic work and, despite the studio music department's providing a team of orchestrators, including future Oscar-winner Hugo Friedhofer, to assist Korngold, the amount of work was immense, especially for the limited time he was given to compose. In describing this dilemma to his father, Julius Korngold, one of Vienna's foremost music critics, the elder Korngold suggested that themes from his 1920 symphonic overture \u201cSursum Corda\u201d (\u201cLift Up Your Hearts\u201d) would serve splendidly for much of the most demanding action-scene music, and Erich agreed. It also gave him his second Academy Award for Best Original Score and established the symphonic style that would later be used in action films during Hollywood's Golden Age. Modern day epics such as the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies similarly included original symphonic scores. Composer John Williams has cited Korngold as his inspiration in scoring the Star Wars series."

        "content": "The film's popularity inextricably linked Errol Flynn's name and image with that of Robin Hood in the public eye, even more so than those of Douglas Fairbanks, who had played the role in 1922. The film became a benchmark for later movie adaptations of Robin Hood. This was the third film to pair Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (after Captain Blood and The Charge of the Light Brigade).  They would ultimately star together in nine films, the aforementioned and Four's a Crowd (1938), The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), Dodge City (1939), Santa Fe Trail (1940), They Died with Their Boots On (1941) and Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943), although they shared no scenes in the last film. Scenes and costumes worn by the characters have been imitated and spoofed endlessly.  For instance, in the Bugs Bunny animated short film, Rabbit Hood, Bugs is continually told by a dim-witted Little John, \"Don't you worry, never fear; Robin Hood will soon be here.\" When Bugs finally meets Robin at the end of the film, he is stunned to find that it is Errol Flynn, in a spliced-in clip from this film (he subsequently shakes his head and declares, \"It couldn't be him!\"). Other parodies were Daffy Duck and Porky Pig in Robin Hood Daffy and Goofy and Black Pete in Goof Troop episode \"Goofin' Hood & His Melancholy Men\". The Court Jester, a musical comedy starring Danny Kaye, is in great measure a spoof of Robin Hood. Basil Rathbone even appears as the villain and has a climactic sword fight with Kaye. Most of the Mel Brooks parody Robin Hood: Men in Tights relied on this film for its aesthetics, although the plot was almost completely a riff on Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, as well as referencing the 1973 Disney version.  Mel Brooks also spoofed the Robin Hood legend in his 1975 television series When Things Were Rotten. A fragment of one of the film's sword fighting scenes was converted to sprites by Jordan Mechner and used for his 1989 platform game Prince of Persia. Errol Flynn's acrobatic swordplay became a crucial touchstone for the light-saber duels choreography in Star Wars movies. In Disney\u2019s 2010 animated film Tangled, the appearance and personality of Flynn Rider are partly inspired by that of Errol Flynn, with his surname also being used in homage."

The film stars Bette Davis and Charles Boyer with Barbara O'Neil, Jeffrey Lynn, Virginia Weidler, Helen Westley, Walter Hampden, Henry Daniell, Harry Davenport, George Coulouris, Montagu Love, Janet Beecher and June Lockhart. Rachel Field's novel is based on the true story of Field's great-aunt, Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, a French governess who fell in love with the Duc de Praslin, her employer. When Praslin's wife was murdered, Henriette was implicated.

She is confronted by the tales and gossip about her that circulate among her pupils and, thus provoked, she decides to tell them her life story. Deluzy-Desportes is governess to the four children of the Duc and Duchesse de Praslin in Paris during the last years of the Orleans monarchy. As a result of the Duchesse's constantly erratic and temperamental behavior, all that remains is an unhappy marriage, but the Duc remains with his wife for sake of their children. Deluzy-Desportes, with her warmth and kindness, wins the love and affection of the children and their father, but also the jealousy and hatred of their mother. She is forced to leave and the Duchess refuses to give her a letter of recommendation to future employers. The Duc confronts his wife and she invents alternative letters taking opposite attitudes, which in fact she has not written and does not intend to write. Her account enrages him and, at the breaking point, he kills her. The Duc de Praslin is in a privileged position; as a peer his case can only be heard by other nobles. He refuses to confess his guilt or openly to admit his love for his employee, knowing that his fellow nobles wish to use such an admission to blame her for the murder by declaring that he was acting at her bidding. Ultimately the Duc takes poison to prevent himself from ever publicly proclaiming his love for Henriette, since he knows that would convict her; however, he lives long enough to reveal it to another of his servants, Pierre, a kindly old man who had warned the governess to leave the de Praslin household. With the Duc's death, the authorities accept that they have no evidence upon which to base a judgment that Henriette solicited the murder and she is released. Deluzy-Desportes had been recommended for the teaching position \"in the land of the free\" by an American minister, Rev. Henry Field, to whom she had expressed a loss of faith while in prison. He proposes marriage, and it is implied that Henriette will accept."

        "content": "Copper is a chemical element with the symbol Cu (from ) and atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement. Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form (native metals). This led to very early human use in several regions, from c. 8000 BC. Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores, c. 5000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC. In the Roman era, copper was mined principally on Cyprus, the origin of the name of the metal, from aes \u0441yprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to \u0441uprum (Latin). Coper (Old English) and copper were derived from this, the later spelling first used around 1530. Commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments. Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives. Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1\u00a0mg of copper per kilogram of body weight."

        "content": "Copper, silver, and gold are in group 11 of the periodic table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms. The softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6\u00d7106\u00a0S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1\u00d7106\u00a0A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively. Copper is one of a few metallic elements with a natural color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells \u2013 the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light. As with other metals, if copper is put in contact with another metal, galvanic corrosion will occur."

The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US. Native copper is a polycrystal, with the largest single crystal ever described measuring 4.4\u00d73.2\u00d73.2\u00a0cm. Copper is the 25th most abundant element in Earth's crust, representing 50 ppm compared with 75 ppm for zinc, and 14 ppm for lead.

Sites include Chuquicamata, in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine, in Utah, United States, and El Chino Mine, in New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey, in 2005, Chile was the top producer of copper with at least one-third of the world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage. An alternative source of copper for collection currently being researched are polymetallic nodules, which are located at the depths of the Pacific Ocean approximately 3000\u20136500 meters below sea level. These nodules contain other valuable metals such as cobalt and nickel."

As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5\u00a0million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil. The price of copper has historically been unstable, and its price increased from the 60-year low of US$0.60/lb (US$1.32/kg) in June 1999 to $3.75 per pound ($8.27/kg) in May 2006. It dropped to $2.40/lb ($5.29/kg) in February 2007, then rebounded to $3.50/lb ($7.71/kg) in April 2007. In February 2009, weakening global demand and a steep fall in commodity prices since the previous year's highs left copper prices at $1.51/lb ($3.32/kg).

Conversely, the average concentration of copper in polymetallic nodules is estimated at 1.3%. The methods of extracting copper as well as other metals found in these nodules include sulphuric leaching, smelting and an application of the Cuprion process. For minerals found in land ores, they are concentrated from crushed ores to the level of 10\u201315% copper by froth flotation or bioleaching. Heating this material with silica in flash smelting removes much of the iron as slag. The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulfides into oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag that floats on top of the heated mass.

Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but can refer to any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze. Copper is one of the most important constituents of silver and karat gold solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals. The alloy of copper and nickel, called cupronickel, is used in low-denomination coins, often for the outer cladding. The US five-cent coin (currently called a nickel) consists of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. Prior to the introduction of cupronickel, which was widely adopted by countries in the latter half of the 20th century, alloys of copper and silver were also used, with the United States using an alloy of 90% silver and 10% copper until 1965, when circulating silver was removed from all coins with the exception of the Half dollar - these were debased to an alloy of 40% silver and 60% copper between 1965 and 1970. The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various objects exposed to seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries. Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and are used in decorations.

The history of copper use dates to 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. Evidence suggests that gold and meteoric iron (but not smelted iron) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to follow this sequence: First, cold working of native copper, then annealing, smelting, and, finally, lost-wax casting. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these techniques appear more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. Copper smelting was independently invented in different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting was invented in 4500\u20134000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. \u00d6tzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300 to 3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC."

In Roman times, it was known as aes Cyprium, aes being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and Cyprium from Cyprus, where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to cuprum, hence the English copper. Aphrodite (Venus in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus, the source of copper, was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper, both because of the connection to the goddess and because Venus was the brightest heavenly body after the Sun and Moon and so corresponded to the most lustrous and desirable metal after gold and silver. Copper was first mined in ancient Britain as early as 2100 BC. Mining at the largest of these mines, the Great Orme, continued into the late Bronze Age. Mining seems to have been largely restricted to supergene ores, which were easier to smelt. The rich copper deposits of Cornwall seem to have been largely untouched, in spite of extensive tin mining in the region, for reasons likely social and political rather than technological. In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century. The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000\u00a0t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe. The gates of the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze treated with depletion gilding. The process was most prevalent in Alexandria, where alchemy is thought to have begun. In ancient India, copper was used in the holistic medical science Ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment. Ancient Egyptians (~2400\u00a0BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later to treat headaches, burns, and itching."

It was referred to as the nation's treasury; Sweden had a copper backed currency. Copper is used in roofing, currency, and for photographic technology known as the daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; copper continues to be used in construction of various types. Copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. During the rise in demand for copper for the Age of Electricity, from the 1880s until the Great Depression of the 1930s, the United States produced one third to half the world's newly mined copper. Major districts included the Keweenaw district of northern Michigan, primarily native copper deposits, which was eclipsed by the vast sulphide deposits of Butte, Montana in the late 1880s, which itself was eclipsed by porphyry deposits of the Souhwest United States, especially at Bingham Canyon, Utah and Morenci, Arizona. Introduction of open pit steam shovel mining and innovations in smelting, refining, flotation concentration and other processing steps led to mass production. Early in the twentieth century, Arizona ranked first, followed by Montana, then Utah and Michigan. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production. The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, formed in 1967 by Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, operated in the copper market as OPEC does in oil, though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was never a member; it was dissolved in 1988."

This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation. For a short period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, copper wiring was replaced by aluminium wiring in many housing construction projects in America. The new wiring was implicated in a number of house fires and the industry returned to copper."

Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability The metal's distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers. The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering. It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. Architectural copper and its alloys can also be 'finished' to take on a particular look, feel, or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings. Copper has excellent brazing and soldering properties and can be welded; the best results are obtained with gas metal arc welding."

Indians have been using copper vessels since ancient times for storing water, even before modern science realized its antimicrobial properties. Some copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as \"antimicrobial materials with public health benefits\"; that approval allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health benefits of products made of registered alloys. In addition, the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys, such as bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, computer keyboards, health club equipment, and shopping cart handles (for a comprehensive list, see: Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces#Approved products). Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease, and Legionnaires' disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems. Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K., Ireland, Japan, Korea, France, Denmark, and Brazil, as well as being called for in the US, and in the subway transit system in Santiago, Chile, where copper-zinc alloy handrails were installed in some 30 stations between 2011 and 2014.

Copper is essential in the aerobic respiration of all eukaryotes. In mitochondria, it is found in cytochrome c oxidase, which is the last protein in oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O2 between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water. Copper is also found in many superoxide dismutases, proteins that catalyze the decomposition of superoxides by converting it (by disproportionation) to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide: Cu2+-SOD + O2\u2212 \u2192 Cu+-SOD + O2 (reduction of copper; oxidation of superoxide) Cu+-SOD + O2\u2212 + 2H+ \u2192 Cu2+-SOD + H2O2 (oxidation of copper; reduction of superoxide) The protein hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods such as the horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus). Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by their role in the formation of lacquers. The biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in earth's atmosphere. Several copper proteins, such as the \"blue copper proteins\", do not interact directly with substrates; hence they are not enzymes. These proteins relay electrons by the process called electron transfer. A unique tetranuclear copper center has been found in nitrous-oxide reductase. Chemical compounds which were developed for treatment of Wilson's disease have been investigated for use in cancer therapy."

The AIs for copper are: 200\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 0\u20136-month-old males and females, and 220\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 7\u201312-month-old males and females. For both sexes, the RDAs for copper are: 340\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 1\u20133 years old, 440\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 4\u20138 years old, 700\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 9\u201313 years old, 890\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for 14\u201318 years old and 900\u00a0\u03bcg of copper for ages 19 years and older. For pregnancy, 1,000\u00a0\u03bcg. For lactation, 1,300\u00a0\u03bcg. As for safety, the IOM also sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of copper the UL is set at 10\u00a0mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 18 and older the AIs are set at 1.3 and 1.6\u00a0mg/day, respectively. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 1.5\u00a0mg/day. For children ages 1\u201317 years the AIs increase with age from 0.7 to 1.3\u00a0mg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 5\u00a0mg/day, which is half the U.S. value. For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For copper labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 2.0\u00a0mg, but  it was revised to 0.9\u00a0mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake."

Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30\u00a0mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3 ppm in the diet. However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency, growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages. Chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis of the liver in persons who have inherited two defective genes. Elevated copper levels have also been linked to worsening symptoms of Alzheimer's disease."

The series was created by Garry Shandling and Dennis Klein and aired from August 1992 to May 1998 on the HBO cable television network. The series stars Shandling, Jeffrey Tambor, and Rip Torn and features celebrities playing exaggerated, parodic versions of themselves. The show has its roots in Shandling's stand-up comedy background, his experience as a guest host on The Tonight Show and his earlier sitcom It's Garry Shandling's Show. The program has had a marked and long-lasting influence on HBO as well as on television shows in the US and UK such as Curb Your Enthusiasm, 30 Rock and The Office.  The supporting cast includes Janeane Garofalo, Wallace Langham, Penny Johnson, Linda Doucett, Scott Thompson and Jeremy Piven. The show received universal acclaim from critics and is often regarded as an influential and landmark series. It ranked 38 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, the only HBO comedy to make the list, and was also included in Time magazine's list of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\". The show won 24 major awards, including three Primetime Emmy Awards, five CableACE Awards, four American Comedy Awards, two British Comedy Awards, two Peabody Awards, a BAFTA Award and a Satellite Award. It also received 86 nominations, including 56 Primetime Emmy Awards nominations, five Directors Guild of America nominations, six Writers' Guild of America nominations, six American Comedy Awards nominations, three Golden Globe nominations, three Satellite Awards nominations and a GLAAD Award nomination."

        "content": "From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, a stream of American stand-up comedians found success in sitcoms on broadcast network television, including Bill Cosby, Roseanne Barr, Richard Lewis, Jerry Seinfeld, Tim Allen, Paul Reiser, Tom Arnold, Brett Butler, Ellen DeGeneres, and Drew Carey. Garry Shandling took a slightly different path with the cable network sitcoms The Larry Sanders Show and its forerunner It's Garry Shandling's Show. In It's Garry Shandling's Show, Shandling makes use of the George Burns technique of directly addressing the audience. He speaks to the studio and home audiences as well as the other actors, often in quick succession. In both shows celebrity guests appear as themselves and Shandling essentially plays himself: a star of a television show and stand-up comedian with a distinctive \"comic persona and rhythm\". Shandling said, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, \"the idea for doing something about a talk show host actually came out of an It\u2019s Garry Shandling's Show episode in which I was the guest on an LA morning show\u00a0... I thought I could make the talk show look very real so the audience would buy that part and then slowly suck them into the realities of life once Larry goes behind the curtain.\" In 1981, Shandling performed a stand-up routine on The Tonight Show and subsequently became a regular guest, particularly at short notice. He also began appearing as a guest host and, in 1986, replaced Joan Rivers as \"permanent guest host.\" He was considered to be a possible, although unlikely, successor to Johnny Carson. After Jay Leno replaced Carson in 1992, Shandling was offered his own late-night (1 a.m.) talk show but preferred instead to create \"a show about a talk-show\", The Larry Sanders Show. The series has similarities to The Player, The King of Comedy and classic Hollywood back-stage musicals with their \"let's put on a show\" theme, but the links to The Tonight Show are so strong it verges on parody. Alex Pareene commented \"Shandling turned down hosting a network late night show to do a brilliant cult hit sitcom about a version of himself who took the deal.\""

It chronicles the daily life of host Larry (Garry Shandling), producer Arthur \"Artie\" (Rip Torn), sidekick Hank Kingsley (Jeffrey Tambor) and their interaction with celebrity guests, the network and others. Episodes focus on the professional and personal lives of the principal characters, with most focusing on Larry. Ancillary characters are also featured, among them the writers Phil (Wallace Langham) and Jerry (Jeremy Piven), talent bookers Paula (Janeane Garofalo) and Mary Lou (Mary Lynn Rajskub) and the personal assistants Beverly, Darlene, and Brian. Larry's wife, ex-wife, and girlfriends are frequent sources of conflict, and his home is a secondary location for the show. Episodes often focus on power dynamics. Supporting characters commonly struggle for status or power, both within the structure of the show's staff as well as within the broader Hollywood community. These struggles almost always end with the character receiving their comeuppance from either Larry, Artie, or one of the episode's guest stars. A typical early episode opens to the titles with the sound of Hank's audience warm-up routine in the background. This is followed by the talk show's titles and an excerpt from Larry's monologue. Episodes vary after this, sometimes continuing with the studio recording, but often cutting to a back-stage shot or to the production offices."

        "content": "The Larry Sanders Show is a satire on show business that mixes fact with fiction. It featured real-life celebrity guests as they performed on the talk show and as they appeared behind the scenes. For example, in the final episode Larry interviews Sean Penn who, once they cut to a commercial break, gossips freely about Shandling's acting, insecurity, and behavior towards Penn's wife (Robin Wright) on the set of Hurlyburly, in which all three appear. The scripts often shocked by appearing to show the guest's malice, or the difference between their public and private personas. Profanities are used on the show, although not gratuitously, with the writers taking advantage of the freedom allowed by HBO as a subscription cable service. It paved the way for subsequent HBO shows such as Oz, The Sopranos, and Deadwood. According to Peter Tolan, early episodes were also recorded with language suitable for broadcast syndication until midway through the second season, when the actors resisted shooting the extra takes. The show used both videotape and film. The behind the scenes footage was shot on film, often using hand-held cameras, in a documentary style. Four video cameras recorded the show-within-a-show which gives a brighter, less grainy picture and helps distinguish the talk show from the back-stage scenes. The talk show was staged with realistic music, lighting and set design. It was recorded in front of an actual live studio audience during the first season and then occasionally during later episodes. The show had a few catchphrases used throughout its entire run. The most common was \"Hey now\", a phrase Hank repeats in the opening credits of the fictional talk show and whenever he greets someone (though it was intellectual property of the network; season 3, episode 1, \"Montana\"). It mirrors the \"Hi-yo\" catchphrase used by Ed McMahon (sidekick on The Tonight Show), upon whom Hank Kingsley was based. In season 1 episode 10, \"The Party\", Hank says: \"No, no, no. You see, when I was a kid, I used to say 'hey,' and then later I said 'now,' but I never put them together until much later.\" In 2007, Nickelodeon's TV Land ranked \"Hey Now\" as the 87th Best Television catchphrase. \"No flipping\" is a phrase Larry uses to go to commercial breaks, encouraging the viewer audience not to change to another channel (which was considered public domain; season 3, episode 1, \"Montana\"). At the end of the season 2,( episode 17, \"New York or LA\"): Larry says: \"You may feel free to flip\" upon deciding at the end of a talk show scene to retire and relocate to Montana. During the series finale, the last thing Larry says on his talk show is, \"You may now flip.\""

Doucett filed a lawsuit against Shandling and producer Brad Grey's company for sexual harassment and wrongful termination, which was settled out of court for $1 million. She was replaced as Hank's assistant by Scott Thompson (Brian). Some of the most popular episodes of the season included: \"Roseanne's Return\", in which Larry has to face Roseanne Barr after their engagement broke off; \"Arthur After Hours\", in which it is revealed what Artie does after an unsuccessful broadcast; \"Jeannie's Visit\", in which Larry's ex-wife visits the talk show; \"Hank's Sex Tape\", in which Hank becomes incensed when Phil circulates a tape of him having sex with two women; and the season finale \"Larry's On Vacation\", in which Sandra Bernhard tries to take over the talk show.

        "content": "The season premiered on March 15, 1998, and ended on May 31, 1998. Shandling decided to make this the final season in part because of his high workload on the show. The main story arc is the increasing pressure from the network to aim for a younger audience that results in Larry deciding to leave the talk show. Most of the changes to the show occurred offscreen this season. All of the show's writers left except Shandling, Tolan, and Apatow, and a new writing staff was hired. Shandling's relationship with his manager, Brad Grey, had broken down and in January 1998, Shandling filed a lawsuit for $100 million against Grey. In an interview with The New York Times, Shandling said \"We had a situation in which the writers were leaving the show for other Brillstein-Grey shows, which became part of the issue of a lawsuit\". (The suit was settled out of court for $10 million.) Todd Holland, who directed more than 48 episodes of the show, only directed two of the sixth season. This season was also markedly less comedic than earlier ones. Sid, the cue card guy at the talk show, commits suicide in the episode \"I Buried Sid\". Some of the most popular episodes of the season were: \"Another List\", in which the network threatens to replace Larry with Jon Stewart unless he makes some changes; \"The Beginning of the End\", in which the talk show gets a new creative consultant who wants to make big changes; \"Adolf Hankler\", in which Hank has to play Adolf Hitler, while Larry is on vacation and Jon Stewart guest hosts; \"Beverly's Secret\", in which Beverly (Penny Johnson) tries to tell the father that she's pregnant; \"Putting the 'Gay' Back in Litigation\", in which Brian sues Phil and the talk show for sexual harassment; and the series finale \"Flip\", in which the cast gets ready for their final broadcast and Larry and Artie deal with Hank and the emotions of the crew. The finale was written by Shandling and Tolan. It was directed by Holland with a running time of 53 minutes. It aired on May 31, 16 days after the finale of Seinfeld, and was watched by 2.5 million viewers, which was a significant number for HBO. The finale got very positive reviews from critics, especially in comparison to Seinfelds series finale. Coincidentally, Jerry Seinfeld appears as himself in the Larry Sanders finale. Other guests in the finale included Warren Beatty, Jim Carrey and Sean Penn. For its final Emmy year, it received 10 nominations and won two awards. Both wins were for the finale: Holland for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series; Shandling and Tolan for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series. It received its sixth nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series, but lost once again to Frasier, for the fifth year in a row. Shandling was nominated Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Torn and Tambor were nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Richard Day, Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck were nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for \"Putting the 'Gay' Back in Litigation.\" It received only one nomination for Directors Guild of America Award: Holland for the episode \"Flip.\""

It helped establish HBO's reputation for quality shows, leading to Sex and the City, The Sopranos, The Wire and Deadwood. The show influenced subsequent series with satirical back-stage show business and celebrity culture themes, such as 30 Rock, My Life on the D-List, The Showbiz Show,  Extras, Action, and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. The show's most significant innovation is in celebrities playing themselves. It was followed in its use of celebrity guests, its lack of laugh track, and its comedy of embarrassment by Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Office and Arrested Development. Shandling's performance is a precursor to Larry David's in Curb Your Enthusiasm and Ricky Gervais (The Office, Extras) as David Brent. Gervais said in Variety that he was heavily influenced by the show and that \"It taught me that flawed characters can be compulsive viewing\u00a0\u2013 seeing them squirm and get their comeuppance.\" Armando Iannucci said that his political satire The Thick of It strove to mix comedy and authenticity in a similar manner to The Larry Sanders Show. Matt Zoller Seitz wrote in Time Out Los Angeles that it introduced to television the cinematic technique of \"walk and talk\" where the camera follows the actors as they move around the offices in conversation. This later became an important part of the style of The West Wing and ER. The show can also be seen as a distorted example of reality television because the portrayal of the talk show production is so convincing. According to Andrew Pulver in The Guardian, \"This is where it all began. The whole postmodernist, self-reflexive fact-fiction sitcom thing.\""

A platoon is typically the smallest military unit led by a commissioned officer. The platoon leader is usually a junior officer\u2014a second or first lieutenant or an equivalent rank. The officer is usually assisted by a platoon sergeant. Rifle platoons normally consist of a small platoon headquarters and three or four sections (Commonwealth) or squads (United States). In some armies, platoon is used throughout the branches of the army. In a few armies, such as the French Army, a platoon is specifically a cavalry unit, and the infantry use \"section\" as the equivalent unit. A unit consisting of several platoons is called a company or a battery."

The meaning was a group of soldiers firing a volley together, while a different platoon reloaded. This suggests an augmentative intention. Since soldiers were often organized in two or three lines, each firing its volley together, this would have normally meant platoons organised so that half or a third of the company is firing at once. The platoon was originally a firing unit rather than an organization. The system is said to have been invented by Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in 1618. In the French Army in the 1670s, a battalion was divided into 18 platoons who were grouped into three \"firings\" with each platoon either firing or reloading at any given time during a fusillade. The system was also used in the British, Austrian, Russian and Dutch armies."

Each section has two fireteams of four men, one led by the corporal and the other by the lance corporal. Each fireteam (also called a \"brick\" by Australian soldiers) has one soldier with an F89 Minimi LSW and the other three armed with F88 Steyr assault rifles. One rifle per fireteam has an attached 40mm grenade launcher; one of the grenadiers is the lance corporal. Fireteam bravo has a HK417 7.62mm for the designated marksman role. More recently, the designated marksman of each Australian fireteam has been issued the HK417 in Afghanistan and possibly afterwards.

It is usually divided into three eight to ten person sections and a heavy weapons detachment which will deploy a GPMG, and a Carl Gustav rifle, depending on mission requirements. Sections are commanded by a sergeant or master corporal with a master corporal or corporal in the second in command position; two members of a section will carry C9 LMGs and the remainder will carry C7 or C8 assault rifles fitted with either optics or a grenade launcher. A section is broken into two assault groups, similar to the British and Australian organization. Three infantry platoons make up a typical infantry company, sometimes with a heavy weapons or support platoon in addition. Specialist platoons, like reconnaissance, or \"recce\" platoons, that may be attached to a battalion may be led by a captain and assisted by a warrant officer. Some very large specialist platoons will actually have a lieutenant as the second-in-command. In many corps, platoon-sized units are called troops instead. Prior to 1940, a platoon might be commanded by either a warrant officer or a lieutenant. An officer was referred to as \"platoon commander\", while a warrant officer in the same position was called a platoon sergeant major."

Almost all smaller formations are based on the designations of those reforms, which originally suggested tactical flexibility by keeping the size of small units in round numbers (10, 20, 100). Battalions and brigades were not affected by that system. It is unknown whether that usage was abandoned in the 1820s or earlier, but in present days a Georgian platoon still called \"Ozeuili\" has a similar size to that of other armies.

The first platoon, until 2013, used to be commanded by an Oberleutnant (\"first lieutenant\") or a Leutnant (\"second lieutenant\"), nowadays it is usually a Hauptmann (\"captain\"), who is also the Kompanie'''s second-in-command. The second Zug is led by an Oberleutnant or a Leutnant, the third Zug is led by experienced NCOs, usually a Hauptfeldwebel (\"master sergeant\"). In the first platoon, the platoon leader's assistant is a Hauptfeldwebel; in the second and third platoons, the assistant is an Oberfeldwebel. Each squad is led by an Oberfeldwebel, and its size corresponds to the typical passenger capacity of its squad vehicle (either wheeled or armoured). Another of these vehicles is used for the Zugtrupp. Sergeants of inferior rank act as assistant squad leaders in the other squads. A Fallschirmj\u00e4gerzug (\"airborne infantry platoon\") has special operations responsibilities and has command positions one rank higher than corresponding positions in a standard infantry platoon. A captain (Hauptmann) is the platoon leader, assisted by a first lieutenant and each squad has a second lieutenant or a master sergeant in charge, often supported by a long-service sergeant or skilled senior corporal."

On 1 October 1913, under a scheme by General Sir Ivor Maxse, the regular battalions of the British Army were reorganised from the previous eight companies to a four-company structure, with each company having four platoons as separate units each commanded by a lieutenant with a platoon sergeant as his deputy. Each platoon was divided into four sections, each commanded by a corporal. Because of a shortage of officers, a non-commissioned officer rank of platoon sergeant major was introduced from 1938 to 1940 for experienced non-commissioned officers who were given command of platoons. In the British Army, a rifle platoon from an infantry company consists of three sections of eight men, plus a signaller (radio operator), a platoon sergeant (a sergeant), the platoon commander (either a second lieutenant or lieutenant) and a mortar man operating a light mortar (full strength of 27 men and one officer). This may not be the case for all British Infantry units, since the 51mm mortars are not always part of a platoons Table of Organization and Equipment, post-Afghanistan. Under Army 2020, a platoon in the Heavy Protected Mobility Regiments consist of around 30 soldiers in four Mastiff/FRES UV vehicles. Each section is commanded by a corporal (lance sergeant in the foot guards), with a lance corporal as second-in-command and six riflemen divided into two four-man fireteams.

        "title": "Platoon_Historical background",
        "content": "From the 16th century until the late 17th century in what would become the United States, an infantry platoon was a \"half company\" commanded by a lieutenant, assisted by two sergeants and two corporals (increased in 1861 to four corporals). The sergeants, assisted by the corporals, led the two sections (half-platoons) and the squads (the terms were often used interchangeably until 1891) of the platoon. An additional senior sergeant serving as the \"platoon sergeant\" (originally designated as \"assistant to platoon commander\" from 1917 until 1940, and as \"platoon leader\" until 1943, when officer platoon commanders were re-designated as \"platoon leaders\") was not authorized until 1943. Depending on the time period, the platoon could include from as few as 20 privates (with two corporals, two sergeants, and a lieutenant) to as many as 44 (with four corporals, two sergeants, and a lieutenant) with 10 to 22 privates per section. The corporals and the sergeant, prior to the increase to two corporals per section, led the two squads of the section. The squads were primarily a non-tactical sub-unit used mainly for drill (marching practice, formations, ceremonies, etc.) and \"house-keeping\" matters, such as interior guard duty, billeting, messing, fatigue details (i.e., working parties), etc. Indeed, the sections, as well as the platoons, were primarily administrative sub-units of the company, since tactically the company seldom employed in other than as a massed formation. The standard procedure, once the company had marched into its position in the line of battle, was for the company to form facing the enemy as two ranks, by platoon, one behind the other. The commanding officer (a captain) and the one to three lieutenants, serving as platoon commanders (not designated as platoon \"leaders\" until 1943) and the executive officer (again depending on the time period, but not officially authorized until 1898) would direct the fighting, leading from the front in the attack and on the flanks in the defense. The executive officer, when assigned, or usually the junior lieutenant and the first sergeant were normally positioned behind the battle line so as to assist the company commander in overseeing the company and managing the rear (company trains, including the wagoner and company supply wagon - under the supervision of the quartermaster sergeant, as well as casualties, enemy prisoners, non-combatants, deserters, etc.). While the officers managed the battle and the staff NCOs (first sergeant and quartermaster sergeant) superintended logistics, the NCOs (sergeants and corporals) served as first-line supervisors and leaders by exhibiting a soldierly example for their privates and encouraging them to maintain proper discipline and to fight effectively. In so doing, the sergeants acted as \"file closers\", working the line by putting men forward to replace casualties in the front rank, exhorting men to fire, reload, move forward, etc. and, if need be, physically assisting or restraining men who refused to move forward or attempted to flee. The corporals physically led by example (much like modern fire team leaders) by taking their place in the line with their privates, fighting alongside them, and by demonstrating proper soldierly attributes. Cavalry platoons had a similar organization to the infantry, but with fewer men; platoons rarely exceeded around 33 men, including the lieutenant, sergeants and corporals. Field artillery platoons, led by a lieutenant (who rode his own horse), with two or three to a battery, normally consisted of two gun sections. Each gun section was led by a sergeant (who also rode his own horse) and consisted of two half sections led by a corporal. One half section contained the gun and its implements, its limber (including one ammunition chest) and four to six horses (depending on gun weight and available horses), and several members of the gun crew. The corporal and one or two privates rode on the horses pulling the limber, while a couple of privates rode on the ammunition chest lid seat. The other half section consisted of the caisson (which carried two ammunition chests, tools, spare parts, baggage, and a spare wheel) with its limber (again with one ammunition chest), pulled by four to six horses, and two spare horses (when available) tethered to the rear of the caisson, and the remainder of the gun crew with the corporal and privates riding the horses or sitting on the several ammunition chests lid seats. In total, the field artillery platoon (at full strength of men, horses, and equipment) consisted of a lieutenant, two sergeants, four corporals, 24 privates, 31 horses, four limbers, two caissons, two field guns, two spare wheels, plus ammunition, implements, tools, spare parts, and baggage. By the end of World War I in 1918, the rifle platoon had expanded to its largest size in U.S. Army history into a unit of 59 soldiers. This platoon organization included one lieutenant, three sergeants, eight corporals, 15 privates first class, and 32 privates. The platoon was organized into a six-man platoon headquarters (including the platoon commander, a sergeant as \"assistant to platoon commander\", and four privates as \"runners\" or messengers) and four sections. The sections were specialized by primary weapon and each contained a different number of men. The \"Riflemen\" and \"Automatic Riflemen\" sections were each led by a sergeant and divided into two squads of eight and seven men each, respectively, including a corporal to lead each squad. The \"Hand Bombers\" (i.e., hand grenade throwers) and \"Rifle Grenadiers\" sections had a total of twelve and nine men each, respectively, including two corporals each, but no sergeant."

Rifle platoons consist of three rifle squads of 13 men each, led by a sergeant (E-5).

An infantry rifle company (3 per infantry battalion) has a weapons platoon. The infantry battalion consists of a headquarters and support company (H&S), three rifle companies, and one weapons company. The weapons company platoon is usually led by a first lieutenant (O-2) and a gunnery sergeant (E-7) because of the generally larger number of Marines (up to 69 in the 81mm mortar platoon) in these platoons (the heavy machine gun platoon being the exception with only 28 members) and the more complex weapon systems employed. A rifle company weapons platoon has a 60mm mortar section of 13 Marines with three M224 LWCMS 60mm mortar squads, an assault section of 13 Marines and six SMAW rocket launchers divided into three squads of two teams each, and a medium machine gun section of 22 Marines and six M240G general-purpose machine guns divided into three squads of two teams each. The infantry battalion weapons company consists of three heavy weapons platoons: 81mm mortar platoon (referred to as \u201c81s platoon or 81s\u201d), heavy machine gun platoon (.50cal HMG and 40mm AGL), and anti armor platoon (Javelin missile and antitank TOW missile launchers).

It was the first collaboration of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and the presentation of some sequences in the style of music videos was an influence on other 1980s films including Footloose, Purple Rain, and Top Gun, Simpson and Bruckheimer's most famous production. It was also one of Lyne's first major film releases, building on television commercials. Alex's elaborate dance sequences were shot using body doubles (Beals' main double was the uncredited French actress Marine Jahan, while a breakdance move was doubled by the male dancer Crazy Legs). The film opened to negative reviews by professional critics, including Roger Ebert, who panned it as \"great sound and flashdance, signifying nothing\" (and eventually placed it on his \"most hated\" list). It was a surprise box-office success, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1983 in the United States. Its worldwide box-office gross exceeded $200 million. The soundtrack, compiled by Giorgio Moroder, spawned several hit songs, including \"Maniac\" (performed by Michael Sembello), and the Academy Award\u2013winning \"Flashdance... What a Feeling\", which was written for the film by Moroder, with lyrics by Keith Forsey and the singer Irene Cara. Flashdance is also often remembered for its film poster featuring Beals sporting a sweatshirt with a large neck hole (according to the actress, her look in the scene came about by accident after she simply cut a large hole at the top of one that had shrunk in the wash)."

Although she aspires to become a professional dancer, she has no formal dance training and works as a nightly cabaret performer by night at Mawby's, a neighborhood bar and grill. Lacking family, Alex forms bonds with her coworkers at Mawby's, some of whom also aspire to greater artistic achievements. Jeanie (Sunny Johnson), a waitress, is training to be a figure skater, while her boyfriend, short-order cook Richie (Kyle T. Heffner), hopes to become a stand-up comic. One night, Alex catches the eye of customer Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), the owner of the steel mill where she works. After learning that Alex is one of his employees, Nick begins to pursue her on the job, though Alex turns down his advances at first. Alex is also approached by Johnny C. (Lee Ving), who wants Alex to dance at his nearby strip club, Zanzibar. After seeking counsel from her mentor, retired ballerina Hanna Long (Lilia Skala), Alex attempts to apply to the Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory. Alex becomes intimidated by the scope of the application process, which includes listing all prior dance experience and education, and she leaves without applying. Leaving Mawby's one evening, Richie and Alex are assaulted by Johnny C. and his bodyguard, Cecil. Nick intervenes, and after taking Alex home, the two begin a relationship. In a skating competition, Jeanie falls twice during her performance and sits defeated on the ice and has to be helped away. Discouraged at the fact that most likely she will never achieve her dreams, and after Richie has left Pittsburgh to try his luck in Los Angeles, Jeanie begins going out with Johnny C. and works for him at Zanzibar as one of his strippers. After finding out from Jake, Alex quickly goes over and drags her out, much to Jeanie's initial anger until she realizes her terrible life decision. After seeing Nick with a woman at the ballet one night, Alex throws a rock through a window of his house, only to discover that it was his ex-wife (Belinda Bauer) whom he was meeting for a charity function. Alex and Nick reconcile, and she gains the courage to apply to the Conservatory. Nick uses his connections with the arts council to get Alex an audition. Alex is furious with Nick, as she did not get the opportunity based on her own merit, and decides not to go through with the audition. Seeing the results of others' failed dreams and after the sudden death of Hanna, Alex becomes despondent about her future, but finally decides to go through with the audition. At the audition, Alex initially falters, but begins again, and she successfully completes a dance number composed of various aspects of dance that she has studied and practiced, including breakdancing, which she has seen on the streets of Pittsburgh. The board responds favorably, and Alex is seen joyously emerging from the Conservatory to find Nick and Grunt waiting for her with a bouquet of roses."

What a Feeling\" was composed by Giorgio Moroder, and the lyrics were written by Cara and Keith Forsey. The song won an Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as a Golden Globe and numerous other awards. It also reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1983. Despite the song's title, the word 'Flashdance' itself is not heard in the lyrics. The song is used in the opening title sequence of the film, and is the music Alex uses in her dance audition routine at the end of the film. Another song used in the film, \"Maniac\", was also nominated for an Academy Award. It was written by Michael Sembello and Dennis Matkosky. A popular urban legend holds that the song was originally written for the 1980 horror film Maniac, and that lyrics about a killer on the loose were rewritten so the song could be used in Flashdance. The legend is discredited in the special features of the film's DVD release, which reveal that the song was written for the film, although only two complete lyrics (\"Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night\" and \"She's a maniac\") were available when filming commenced. Like the title song, it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September 1983. Other songs in the film include \"Lady, Lady, Lady\", performed by Joe Esposito, \"Gloria\" and \"Imagination\" performed by Laura Branigan, and \"I'll Be Here Where the Heart Is\", performed by Kim Carnes. The soundtrack album of Flashdance sold 700,000 copies during its first two weeks on sale and has gone on to sell over six million copies in the U.S. alone.

Adrian Lyne was not the first choice as director of Flashdance. David Cronenberg had turned down an offer to direct the film, as had Brian De Palma, who instead chose to direct Scarface (1983). At the time, Lyne's background was primarily in directing television commercials, such as his 1970s UK commercials for Brutus Jeans (which may conceivably be seen as anticipating the visuals and style of Flashdance). Executives at Paramount were unsure about the film's potential and sold 25% of the rights prior to its release. The film was shot between October 18, 1982 and December 30, 1982. Flashdance is often remembered for the sweatshirt with a large neck hole that Beals wore on the poster advertising the film. Beals said that the look of the sweatshirt came about by accident when it shrank in the wash and she cut out a large hole at the top so that she could wear it again."

        "content": "Three candidates, Jennifer Beals, Demi Moore, and Leslie Wing, were the finalists for the role of Alex Owens. Two different stories exist regarding how Beals was chosen. One states that then-Paramount president Michael Eisner asked women secretaries at the studio to select their favorite after viewing screen tests. The other: the film's scriptwriter Joe Eszterhas claims that Eisner asked \"two hundred of the most macho men on the [Paramount] lot, Teamsters and gaffers and grips ... 'I want to know which of these three young women you'd most want to fuck'\". The role of Nick Hurley was originally offered to Kiss lead man Gene Simmons, who turned it down because it would conflict with his \"demon\" image. Pierce Brosnan, Robert De Niro, Richard Gere, Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks, and John Travolta were also considered for the part. Kevin Costner, a struggling actor at the time, came very close for the role of Nick Hurley, which went to Michael Nouri."

Her main dance double is the French actress Marine Jahan, while the breakdancing that Alex performs in the audition sequence at the end of the film was doubled by the male dancer Crazy Legs. The shot of Alex diving through the air in slow motion during the audition sequence was performed by Sharon Shapiro, who was a professional gymnast. The producers of the film stated they had made no secret of having used a double for Beals, and that Jahan's name did not appear because Paramount Pictures shortened the closing credits. Marine Jahan was told that her involvement was hidden because \"they didn't want to break the magic of the film\"."

Alex's apartment was located in the South Side neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The interior of the apartment was filmed in Los Angeles at what was the Feit Electric Building on Los Angeles Street in downtown LA. Alex is seen riding one of the Duquesne Incline cable cars when she goes to visit Hannah. Hannah's apartment is located at 2100 Sidney Street at the southeast corner of South 21st Street. The entrance to the apartment is from South 21st Street. The opening sequence of scenes with Alex riding her bicycle starts in the Fineview neighborhood of Pittsburgh, at the intersection of Catoma Street and Warren Street. She rides south on Warren Street to Henderson Street, makes a hairpin turn from Henderson Street onto Fountain Street, and is next shown riding south on Middle Street. The last scene of the sequence shows Alex riding east over the Smithfield Street Bridge, which is a continuity error."

The site's consensus is: \"All style and very little substance, Flashdance boasts eye-catching dance sequences\u2014and benefits from an appealing performance from Jennifer Beals\u2014but its narrative is flat-footed\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 39% based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Roger Ebert placed it on his list of Most Hated films, and in giving the film 1.5 out of 4 stars in his review, stated: \"Jennifer Beals shouldn't feel bad. She is a natural talent, she is fresh and engaging here, and only needs to find an agent with a natural talent for turning down scripts\". In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert said \"If Flashdance had spent just a little more effort getting to know the heroine of its story, and a little less time trying to rip off \"Saturday Night Fever,\" it might have been a much better film.\" Variety compared the film to a series of music videos, \"Watching Flashdance is pretty much like looking at MTV for 96 minutes. Virtually plotless, exceedingly thin on characterization and sociologically laughable, pic at least lives up to its title by offering an anthology of extraordinarily flashy dance numbers.\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote: \"With a score by Giorgio Moroder, and with ingenious costumes that are utterly au courant, Flashdance contains such dynamic dance scenes that it's a pity there's a story here to bog them down.\" In a 1984 essay for the journal Jump Cut, critic Kathryn Kalinak questioned the characterization of Alex: \"How could an 18 year-old woman land a skilled labor job as a welder in the unionized steel industry of an economically depressed union town? . . . Not only are any other women missing in the factory, so are employees, male or female, under 30.\""

Its success has been attributed in part to the 1981 launch of the cable channel MTV (Music Television) since it was the first feature film to exploit the new popularity of music videos effectively. By excerpting segments of the film and running them as music videos on MTV, the studio benefited from extensive free promotion, establishing the new medium as an important marketing tool for films. In the mid-1980s, it became almost obligatory to release a music video to promote a major motion picture\u2014even if the film was not especially suited for one."

Like Alex Owens in the film, she aspired to enroll in a prestigious dance school. Tom Hedley wrote the original story outline for Flashdance, and on December 6, 1982, Marder signed a release document giving Paramount Pictures the right to portray her life story on screen, for which she was given a one-off payment of $2,300. Flashdance is estimated to have grossed more than $200 million worldwide. In June 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco affirmed a lower court's ruling that Marder gave up her rights to the film when she signed the release document in 1982. The panel of three judges stated in its ruling: \"Though in hindsight the agreement appears to be unfair to Marder\u2014she only received $2,300 in exchange for a release of all claims relating to a movie that grossed over $150 million\u2014there is simply no evidence that her consent was obtained by fraud, deception, misrepresentation, duress or undue influence.\" The court also noted that Marder's attorney had been present when she signed the document."

The show was created by Darren Star for Fox and executive produced by Aaron Spelling for his company, Spelling Television. It was the second series in the Beverly Hills, 90210 franchise. Season one and season two were broadcast on Wednesday at 9 p.m., after Beverly Hills, 90210. In 1994, for its third-season premiere, the show moved to Monday at 8 p.m. The show had many cast changes during the run.

Williams), an aerobics instructor; and Sandy Harling (Amy Locane), a Southern belle and struggling actress who moonlights as a waitress at a local bar called Shooters, the group's main hangout. Locane was written off after 13 episodes and replaced by Daphne Zuniga as Jo Reynolds, a photographer running away from her abusive husband. Williams was not brought back for the second season, her character having become engaged to a wealthy restaurant entrepreneur. Actress Heather Locklear, who in season one had guest starred as Alison's ambitious and merciless boss Amanda Woodward, was promoted to series regular status in the second season after her character bought and moved into the Melrose Place apartment building. Although she was always billed as a \"special guest star\", Locklear remained with the show for the rest of its run. Guest Laura Leighton, recurring as Jane's trouble-making younger sister Sydney Andrews in the first two seasons, was upgraded to series regular for season three. Marcia Cross, recurring as Dr. Kimberly Shaw in season 1, became a series regular by the end of the second season (though she was not credited in the opening until the start of season four). Janet Carroll appeared in several episodes as Marion Shaw, Kimberly's domineering mother. Beata Pozniak was featured in the second season in 7 episodes as Dr. Katya Petrova Fielding, a doctor with a daughter from a previous marriage who befriends and ultimately marries Matt (for a green card), who becomes an endearing father figure for her child. Season four saw two new regular characters: Peter Burns (Jack Wagner), the ruthless hospital Chief of Staff introduced in season three; and Brooke Armstrong (Kristin Davis), a young, conniving intern at D&D Advertising also recurring the previous season. Davis's character was subsequently killed off in the middle of the fourth season, while Zuniga left the series at the end of the season. Patrick Muldoon also arrived in the third season as the villainous Richard Hart. Although Muldoon was not billed with the main cast (though he appeared in numerous promotional photos with them), he appeared in most of the fourth season's episodes and is also Melrose Places longest recurring character (i.e. not in the opening credits) in terms of number of episodes. The fifth season saw the addition of Rob Estes as restaurateur Kyle McBride, Lisa Rinna as his opportunistic wife Taylor, and Brooke Langton as Samantha Reilly, an artist and a new tenant in the apartment complex. Bissett and Cross left the series towards the end of the fifth season; Kelly Rutherford was brought in as Megan Lewis, a prostitute hired by Kimberly Shaw to have an affair with Michael Mancini, and David Charvet played Craig Field, Amanda's new co-worker and later Sydney's boyfriend. The season finale featured the exits of series regulars Thorne-Smith, Show, and Leighton. The season premiere of season six featured the departure of original cast member Doug Savant while Alyssa Milano (recurring as Michael's sister Jennifer Mancini since season five) was bumped to series regular, with Linden Ashby joining the cast as Dr. Brett Cooper and Jamie Luner as his seductive and rich ex-wife, Lexi Sterling. Charvet was written out in the middle of season 6, and the beginning of season seven saw the departure of Shue, Langton, Rinna, Milano, and Ashby. The show's seventh season introduced John Haymes Newton as Ryan McBride, Kyle's younger brother, and Rena Sofer as Eve Cleary, a woman from Amanda's past who marries Peter. Sofer was not billed with the main cast. Bissett reprised her role as Jane for the seventh season."

The scenes filmed outside reveal the original facade of the building at 4616 Greenwood Place in Los Angeles serving as the main backdrop for Melrose Place. The D&D Advertising building is the same complex where the offices of Spelling Entertainment are located on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. The production was filming two episodes on same time, according to Rolling Stone in 1994. A dozen directors were employed during each season to direct the thirty episodes. Charles Correll is by far the main director of the series with 47 episodes to his credit over the entire production period, far ahead of the 27 episodes directed by Chip Chalmers. Due to the short number of episodes in Season 6, Fox increased the episode order for the final season to 35, making it the show's largest episode order ever. In 1997, the filming of the sixth season was brought forward by two weeks because of Heather Locklear's pregnancy, which was not included in the story. A body liner was used for around ten shots. The actress also doubled her filming time and her screen time was reduced to finish filming in mid-September 1997. Lisa Rinna (Taylor) was also pregnant during filming at the end of the sixth season. Her pregnancy was integrated into the plot. This was also the case for the pregnancy of Josie Bissett (Jane) during the seventh season. Estes and Bissett welcomed their first child, son Mason True, on July 21, 1999."

Conversely, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, gave the first season a B- rating, writing: \"Hey, I make fun of Melrose Place \u2014 but I'm hypnotized by it. As warm-weather escapism, it takes all the issues facing this country, from unemployment to sexual harassment, and turns them into crises that can be solved in an hour.\" During the second season, David Wild of Rolling Stone wrote: \"After debuting in 1992 with a troubled first season that at times rivaled that of the 1962 New York Mets, Melrose Place made a few key trades. The show acquired a journeywoman heavy hitter in the lovely form of Locklear and wisely swapped bothersome Issues and Morals for infinitely more palatable Sex and Villains, emerging as a big winner, particularly with that attractive twentysomething demographic.\" The third season received positive reviews from critics: \"After a couple lukewarm yet entertaining seasons, Melrose Place exploded in season three with the over-the-top, addictive storylines. Remember the crazy Kimberly-Michael-Sydney drama? And then Kimberly tried to keep Jo's baby! Really, this is daytime-soap-drama, heated up for primetime.\" In 1997, Mark Harris, who gave the soap's sixth season a D rating, stated: \"Although the ever-game, deserves-better Heather Locklear still spits out even the worst lines with snappish authority, and the diabolical-doctor duo of Jack Wagner and Thomas Calabro at least try to look interested, they can't sustain a show that has lost its best asset \u2014 a twisted joy in its own trashiness.\""

Tylo sued Spelling on grounds of discrimination for being pregnant and won $4.8 million from a Los Angeles jury. Spelling argued that Tylo's pregnancy rendered her unable to play the character, who was supposed to be a sexy seductress. During the trial, Tylo published pictures of herself while pregnant which showed that she retained a slim figure. Prior to trial, during the discovery phase of the litigation, Tylo's lawyers won a partial victory in an interlocutory appeal challenging a lower court's order compelling her to answer a broad range of personal questions. The Court of Appeal established Tylo's right to refuse to answer questions in her deposition about marital problems and psychological treatment, although the Court sustained the portion of the order which compelled her to answer questions about her efforts to become pregnant, her husband's ability or inability to impregnate her, and communications with her agent with respect to her efforts and ability to become pregnant. The case is widely recognized as an important one in establishing the right of privacy in deposition and the right of female actors to continue to work while pregnant."

GALA artists designed artworks that were used as props by Melrose Place characters in the fourth and fifth seasons, often with hidden political messages: When Alison is pregnant, her quilt is decorated with the molecular structure of RU-486. A bag of Chinese take-out food is emblazoned with two opposing ideograms translated from Chinese as \"Human Rights\" and \"Turmoil\"; both terms were used by the Chinese government to justify a restriction on student protesters of June 4, 1989. Bottles behind the counter at Shooters bar are decorated with ads and documents chronicling the history of alcohol. As Alison quits D&D Advertising, a framed ad in the background features a bombed-out building.  The damage to the structure is in the shape of a liquor bottle, and the words \"Total Proof\" appear on the poster. Chin compared the works to viruses, symbiotic and invisible. The project was called In the Name of the Place, as part of the \"Uncommon Sense\" art show at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA, Los Angeles, California in 1997. A portion of the fifth season was filmed at the Geffen Contemporary where the project was displayed. The artwork was also shown at the 1997 Kwangju Biennale in Kwangju, Korea and at Grand Arts in Kansas City, Missouri in 1998.

        "content": "The show is centered on the life of an Italian-American everyman named Raymond Barone, a sportswriter for Newsday living with his family on Long Island. Beleaguered, diffident and dryly sarcastic, Raymond takes few things seriously, making jokes in nearly every situation, no matter how troubling or serious. He often avoids responsibilities around the house and with his kids, leaving this to his wife,  Debra. Raymond and Debra have a daughter Ally (Alexandra) and twin sons Michael and Geoffrey (originally Matthew and Gregory in the pilot). The Barone children are regular characters but not a major focus. Raymond's parents, Marie and Frank, live across the street with older son Robert (who, later in the series, has his own apartment). All Barone relatives frequently make their presence known to the annoyance of Raymond and Debra; Debra's justifiable complaints about Raymond's overbearing family serve as one of the show's comedic elements. Out of the three unwanted visitors, Debra is particularly intimidated by Marie, an insulting, controlling, manipulative (though ultimately caring) woman who criticizes Debra passive-aggressively and praises Ray, clearly favoring him over other son \"Robbie,\" whose birth necessitated her marriage (a fact revealed in the episode \"Good Girls\"). Raymond typically falls in the middle of family arguments, incapable of taking any decisive stand, especially if it might invoke his mother's disapproval. Robert, a miserable gentle giant, jealous of his younger sibling's position as favorite son and also of the success his brother has achieved both professionally and personally, is Ray's biggest rival. Robert and Raymond frequently argue like overgrown children, focusing much of their energy on picking on or one upping each other, although deep down they love each other dearly. Frank Barone is a fiery retiree prone to directing insults and merciless put-downs at any and all targets. Largely an absentee father when the boys were growing up, Frank buries his feelings and rarely yields to sentiment. As the series progresses, however, several episodes demonstrate that the senior Barone loves his family immensely. Unlike everyone else, Frank has no problem comically criticizing Marie and often comes to Debra's defense whenever Marie comments disparagingly about their daughter-in-law. Raymond and Debra's marriage is fraught with conflicts. Raymond prefers sports television over discussions with Debra on marital matters. Like his father had, Raymond works full-time, leaving most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife; and he is often forced to help around the house. One of the show's recurring elements finds the couple having a long discussion in bed each night before going to sleep."

        "content": "Ray Barone (Ray Romano) is a sportswriter for Newsday. He lives in Lynbrook, Long Island with his wife, Debra, and their three children Alexandra (\"Ally\"), Geoffrey, and Michael. His parents Frank and Marie and brother Robert live across the street. Raymond's character is loosely based on the real-life Romano, as he is the father of twin boys and a girl. Ray is emotionally unable to take any sort of stand on anything, especially if it brings him to any sort of conflict with his mother\u2014the exception is when he protests about sex or some trivial matter. Raymond's mother favors him over Robert. Debra Barone (Patricia Heaton) is Raymond's wife, and mother of Ally, Michael and Geoffrey. As a housewife, Debra claims she is frequently overworked, underappreciated, and stressed out. This leads to her yelling and occasionally attacking inanimate objects, largely because she has to deal with all the housework and her three rambunctious children with almost no assistance or support from Raymond; additionally, she constantly puts up with Marie's intrusiveness and criticism. On frequent occasions this frustration boils over and is vented towards Raymond. While Debra has a fractious relationship with Marie, she is shown to share many tender moments with Robert, and occasionally Frank. Robert Barone (Brad Garrett) is Raymond's older brother and the son of Frank and Marie. Standing at 6'8\u00bd\" (2.04 m), he is the tallest Barone, and has several quirks, the biggest being a nervous habit of touching food to his chin before eating it, once referred to as \"crazy chin.\" Robert is often jealous of the attention that Raymond receives from their mother, to the exclusion of his every achievement. Robert has been a New York City police officer for over 23 years (explicitly stated as 15 years early in season 1) and attains the rank of lieutenant by the end of the series. His height, appearance, and depressed demeanor are the source of much humor. However, despite his imposing size, Robert is a very skilled dancer. Divorced from first wife Joanne prior to the beginning of the series, he is frequently unlucky with women, until his on-off relationship with his girlfriend Amy McDougall finally results in marriage. Also, despite his tough appearance, he appears to be more sensitive, affectionate, tender and open to sharing his emotions compared to the rest of his family. Marie Barone (Doris Roberts) is Raymond and Robert's mother and the wife of Frank. Intrusive, controlling, manipulative, and over-nurturing (at least with Raymond), she is a housewife who excels in cooking, cleaning, and other things dealing with keeping a good home and family. Marie and Frank live across the street from Raymond and Debra in Lynbrook, Long Island, New York which often irritates the latter couple. Marie's meddling tendencies include going through their mail, redoing their laundry, and upstaging Debra in the kitchen. She also goes to great lengths to control Robert's love life and get him to settle down and bring her more grandchildren. Frank Barone (Peter Boyle) is Raymond's father and Marie's husband, a retired bookkeeper, and registered real estate agent, with a stubborn masculine personality and no interest in personal hygiene. A United States Army veteran, Frank served in the Korean War, which he frequently brings up to everyone's annoyance. He mocks his sons' inability to handle their own personal and domestic problems; unlike his sons, he is not intimidated by Marie and disparages her regularly with little to no provocation. Although both he and Marie maintain that he only married her for her cooking, he is shown to care about her genuinely. He is a member of the Order of the Caribou Lodge, and was named Man of the Year by his fellow members. Amy McDougall-Barone (Monica Horan) (recurring seasons 1\u20137, starring seasons 8\u20139) becomes Robert Barone's second wife (in season 7), and is the best friend of Debra, who introduces her to Robert. A recurring character for the first seven seasons of the series, Amy became essentially a regular cast member for the remainder of the show's run. However, Horan's name did not get added to the opening credits until the final season. Many issues cause Amy and Robert to break up in the first six seasons, with one being blamed on Raymond, and another happening because Robert was seeing other women, one of whom was his ex-wife. Quite often, Amy apologizes to someone even if she did not do anything wrong. She was born to very religious parents who, according to Amy, \"wouldn't yell if they were on fire.\" In real life, Horan is the wife of creator/executive producer Philip Rosenthal. Ally Barone (Madylin Sweeten) is the daughter of Raymond and Debra. She is the oldest of the Barone children. She is not seen much, even though she is credited in the main cast. She is said to be a better cook than her mother, and maybe someday her grandmother. In real life, Madylin is the sister of Sawyer and Sullivan Sweeten. Geoffrey Barone (Sawyer Sweeten) and Michael Barone (Sullivan Sweeten) are the twin sons of Raymond and Debra. Their names in the pilot were Gregory and Matthew. In real life, twins Sawyer and Sullivan are brothers of Madylin Sweeten."

        "content": "In the 1990s, several television shows based on work from stand-up comedians, such as Home Improvement (1991\u201399) and Roseanne (1988\u201397), were successful. Ray Romano, a comedian for 12 years by the time Everybody Loves Raymond first aired, was one such comic to get development deals following a five-minute performance on the Late Show with David Letterman (1993\u20132015) in the middle of 1995. David Letterman executive producer Rob Burnett recalled that \"by the end [of the monologue] we already had lawyers lined up to work a deal with him.\" In looking for a show-runner, Romano wanted somebody to share his tastes in humor, avoiding those who were into writing \"devicey\" material. Around a dozen candidates for the show-runner position were considered before Coach writer Philip Rosenthal, who sent a Frasier spec script to Letterman's Worldwide Pants. The company read the spec and sent Rosenthal a tape of Romano asking screenwriters to help him with an upcoming show based on his work; also in the tape, he stated that he had a hard time coming up with new material because of having to raise twin sons, and showcased a \"new bit\" of him shaking keys while saying \"hey.\" Romano's sense of humor intrigued Rosenthal, reminding him of Bill Cosby's early work. After viewing the tape, Rosenthal met with Romano in person at Art's Delicatessen & Restaurant on Ventura Boulevard about being a potential show runner. The encounter consisted of Romano and Rosenthal each discussing their families. Romano told Rosenthal he wanted to do a series about a comedian discussing current issues with friends at a coffee shop, but Rosenthal responded that kind of sitcom already existed and was a hit. Rosenthal, intrigued by Romano's crazy family fables and wanting to work around his lack of previous acting experience, then stated it would be most \"comfortable\" for Romano to have the Raymond character be very close to his real personality and in family circumstances reflective of Romano's home life. Although Romano has a brother named Robert in real life, he based the Robert in Raymond on another one of his brothers, Richard. Rosenthal also incorporated his own family experiences into the show, with his mother and wife serving as the basis for Marie and Debra respectively. Most aspects of Romano's real life are replicated in the series, except for its setting of Long Island instead of Queens; Romano and the writers initially wanted the show to be set in Queens, but CBS executives ultimately chose Long Island due to its broad appeal, as it was a suburb with urban elements. Previous prime-time television series set in Long Island, such as The Hamptons (1983) and The Pruitts of Southampton (1966\u201367), never went beyond one season. Romano also explained, \"There's a lot more kissing on the show than in real life;\" and his wife Anna continued, \"and they talk a lot more in the show than we ever do at home.\" The title Everybody Loves Raymond originated from a response Romano's brother Richard made after Ray won a CableACE stand-up award: \"I had a day where people were shooting at me, and you're bringing home trophies. Everybody loves Raymond, don't they?\" In the show's pilot, Robert states \"Everybody loves Raymond.\" Rosenthal pitched the show to CBS president Les Moonves, CBS comedy vice president David Himelfarb, CBS comedy development executive Wendi Goldstein, and CBS comedy and drama development head Gene Stein. He kept the pitch very simple: \"it's [Romano] and his family, and his parents live across the street with his brother.\" CBS was lukewarm towards the show's low concept, but found it enough of a low-risk investment for the series to be green-lit. Letterman's involvement with Raymond amounted to nothing more than a meeting where he signed Rosenthal's show-runner contract and told him, \"just don't embarrass us.\""

        "content": "For the non-titular lead roles of Everybody Loves Raymond, casting director Lisa Miller chose actors with previous professional experience in acting, such as Patricia Heaton and Brad Garrett, who made several appearances in sitcoms before; and Doris Roberts and Peter Boyle, both film actors. Everybody Loves Raymond was Heaton's fourth lead role in a sitcom after the short-lived Room for Two (1992\u20131993), Some Like Me (1994), and Women of the House (1995). When she read the pilot script during pilot season, she thought it was \"beautifully written\" although found the character of Debra uninteresting. Miller explained that she had to \"Taft-Hartley\" Romano, who didn't have much acting experience before Everybody Loves Raymond, in order to get around legal Screen Actors Guild requirements to star in the show. He also needed trainers to make sure he performed the character of a likable protagonist well. Garrett was the first actor to be cast after Romano, as well as the only actor to audition without Romano in the room. Garrett explained that while CBS initially wanted a small, Danny DeVito-esque character who had a \"bulldog\" attitude towards Raymond, he, a much taller actor, portrayed Robert as more \"beaten-down\" and \"succumb to the fact that he's a loser\" when auditioning. For the auditions of Heaton, Boyle, and Roberts, they were in the moods of the characters in the scenes they performed, and their auditions were very quick. Heaton was in the middle of getting-by doing babysitting work and clipping coupons when auditioning, making her very stressed. Miller chose Heaton for the role of Debra for being \"very focused, real, like Helen Hunt in Mad About You.\" Boyle, an actor recommended for Frank by Moonves, had a troublesome time getting to his audition location due to schedule changes and poor directions, which made him very grumpy and \"in character\" when he arrived. Rosenthal admitted to casting Boyle \"out of fear\" in response to Boyle's bitter attitude. Roberts was called by the casting team for the role of Marie after going through more than 100 actresses. She was initially reluctant to audition due to being busy with directing a 23-character play, but her agents insisted she had time; an \"overwhelmed\" Roberts did zero preparation, which was unusual for her, and performed her audition from her \"gut reaction.\""

A typical writing session started with each of the writers discussing their lives, which served as the basis for episode scripts; as Rosenthal summarized the process, \"talking, talking, talking and then all of a sudden, that's a story.\" Will MacKenzie, who directed for Everybody Loves Raymond on the second, third, and fourth seasons, recalled the writers being so efficient that thirteen episode scripts were completed by the time a season began airing. When shooting episodes, Rosenthal was very stern about the actors sticking to the script and avoiding ad libing, although \"alternative\" lines were put in the script for some episodes. Garrett compared acting in episodes of Raymond to the improvisational methods used by the cast in Seinfeld (1989\u201398). The house used for exterior shots of Ray and Debra's homes is located at 135 Margaret Boulevard in Merrick, New York and was $500,000 as of August 2018; as in the show, it's located across the street from the home used for exteriors of Frank and Marie's house."

        "content": "For Everybody Loves Raymond, Rosenthal went for a classic sitcom style a la The Honeymooners (1955\u201356), avoiding references to current culture in order to give it a timeless quality. Explained Jeremy Stevens, the show differed from most sitcoms of its time for its focus on storytelling and reflection on most people's real lives. Julie Pernworth, a comedy development president at CBS, categorized Everybody Loves Raymond as \"one of the most traditional sitcoms to come along in a long time.\" As Rosenthal put it, Raymond was a \"sophisticated\" version of a family sitcom, which was emphasized via the show's piano-heavy background music and the use of The New Yorker typeface for credits. In composing the show's theme, Terry Trotter and Rick Marotta used the first few measures of a song from Woody Allen's film Manhattan (1979) and improvised the rest of the piece. Episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond are emotionally dynamic presentations of otherwise prosaic premises typical for traditional sitcoms. SUNY Press' book The Sitcom Reader (2016) analyzed Raymond was part of a trend in 1990s television of family sitcoms geared towards older audiences, which resulted in the scripts not focusing so much on the child characters and being entirely about grown-ups bickering at each other. While the second season was in production, Romano expressed the challenge of having to write \"weird\" adult humor within \"parameters\" of a show about a family: \"I want to write a show where I have anxiety attacks, and we're all very concerned about that. Can the star of the show be a father who has anxiety attacks and flips out? Will that sit well with people?\" This involved trying to keep the presence of the child characters as little as possible: \"To be upstaged by toddlers? I get enough of that at home.\" As Romano described the stand-up material the show is based on upon the show's first season airing, \"I don't want to be a spokesman for family values, but that's the way my standup is perceived. My character is a father who loves his family but who would also love a little freedom.\" Explained TV critic Jones Ostrow, Raymond \"explored the tortuous/loving relationships of parents and adult children, of couples, of siblings and the Peter Pan syndrome that attaches to baby boomer males, sports nuts in particular.\""

Although Eyemark planned for the two channels to start the re-runs in fall 2000, it moved the date to fall 2001 to avoid competition with other sitcoms beginning off-network runs in 2000. The deal allowed the two channels to re-run the show for four-and-a-half years. On January 26, 1999, the cable channel TBS paid Everybody Loves Raymond distributor Eyemark Entertainment for four years of syndication rights of the show starting in the fall of 2004. The show reruns in syndication on various channels, such as TBS and TV Land, and in most television markets on local stations. The show is still broadcast regularly in the UK. From 2000 to 2007, King World distributed the show for off-network syndication and Warner Bros. International Television handled international distribution. In 2007, CBS Television Distribution took over King World's distribution. CBS only owns American syndication rights; ancillary rights are controlled by HBO and Warner Bros. Television (WBIT distributes the series outside the US in conjunction with HBO; while HBO Home Entertainment and Warner Home Video own DVD rights worldwide).

It depicts families as dissolute yet inextricably bound together, just like they really are, and finds the humor in those real frictions that threaten, yet never manage, to burst family units apart. Its characterizations are among the most finely defined on TV. Debra, with her vaguely no-nonsense disgust of Raymond's simpleton-ness, is unlike any sitcom mom ever. Doris Roberts' Marie had a sinister streak long before Nancy Marchand's Livia showed up on The Sopranos. Raymond is also one of the few contemporary sitcoms that has figured out how to implement and even exploit the four-camera, live-audience situation, which is no simple feat.\" A 1997 review by Bruce Fretts, which gave the show the same score, said that the show \"may now be the best sitcom on the air.\" Common Sense Media's Betsy Wallace, who awarded the show four out of five stars, wrote: \"the cast is stellar and plotlines shed light on universal human insecurities, such as doubting that your spouse still finds you attractive as you grow older.\" Plugged In said in their review, \"Seven years and a mantle full of Emmys later, Raymond is still smartly scripted, now with new characters added to a maturing, expanding family.\" Reviews named Garrett the show's \"secret weapon\" and responsible for \"the bulk of the show's comic high points.\""

        "content": "Virgil Starkwell's (Woody Allen) story is told in documentary style, using fake stock footage and 'interviews' with people who knew him.  He begins a life of crime at a young age. As a child, Virgil is a frequent target of bullies, who take his glasses and stamp on them on the floor.  As an adult, Virgil is clumsy and socially awkward, and both police and judges discipline him by stamping on Virgil's glasses. Virgil falls in love with a young lady, Louise (Janet Margolin), a laundry worker. They marry and later have a baby. Virgil attempts to rob a bank, but is arrested when he is embroiled in an argument about the handwriting on a demand note he hands to a cashier.  He is sent to prison, but attempts an escape using a bar of soap carved to resemble a gun.  Unfortunately for him, it is raining outside and his gun dissolves. He does escape, but by accident.  Joining a mass breakout plan, Virgil is the only inmate not warned that the scheme had been called off. Outside but unemployed, Virgil finds no way to support himself and his family.  Eventually, he is rearrested and sent to a chain gang, where he is undernourished (the single meal of the day is a bowl of steam) and brutally tortured (consigned to a steam box with an insurance salesman). Virgil again escapes but is eventually captured when attempting to rob a former friend who reveals he is now a cop. He is sentenced to 800 years, but remains optimistic knowing that \"with good behavior, I can get that cut in half\". In the last scene, he is shown carving a bar of soap and asking the interviewer if it is raining outside."

        "content": "This was the second film directed by Woody Allen, and the first with original footage (after What's Up, Tiger Lily?, which consisted of visuals taken from a Japanese James Bond knockoff). He had originally wanted Jerry Lewis to direct, but when that did not work out, Allen decided to direct it himself. Allen's decision to become his own director was partially spurred on by the chaotic and uncontrolled filming of Casino Royale (1967), in which he had appeared two years previously. This film marked the first time Allen would perform the triple duties of writing, directing, and acting in a film. The manic, almost slapstick style is similar to that of Allen's next several films, including Bananas (1971) and Sleeper (1973). Allen discussed the concept of filming a documentary in an interview with Richard Schickel: The film was shot on location in San Francisco, including one scene set in Ernie's restaurant, whose striking red interior was immortalized in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). Other scenes were filmed at San Quentin State Prison, where 100 prisoners were paid a small fee to work on the film. The regular cast and crew were stamped each day with a special ink that glowed under ultra-violet light so the guards could tell who was allowed to leave the prison grounds at the end of the day. (One of the actors in the San Quentin scenes was Micil Murphy, who knew the prison well: he had served five and a half years there, for armed robbery, before being paroled in 1966.) Allen initially filmed a downbeat ending in which he was shot to death, courtesy of special effects from A.D. Flowers. Reputedly the lighter ending is due to the influence of Allen's editor, Ralph Rosenblum, in his first collaboration with Allen."

In his later review of Annie Hall, Canby revised his opinion of Take the Money and Run, stating \"Annie Hall is not terribly far removed from Take the Money and Run, his first work as a triple-threat man, which is not to put down the new movie but to upgrade the earlier one\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times found the film to have many funny moments, but \"in the last analysis it isn't a very funny movie\", with the fault lying with its visual humor and editing. In October 2013, the film was voted by the Guardian readers as the sixth best film directed by Allen. On the review aggregator web site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 91% positive rating from top film critics based on 22 reviews, with one of the two negative reviews coming from Roger Ebert."

It originally aired on five Pacifica Radio stations. Goodman is the program's principal host, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez and Nermeen Shaikh as frequent co-hosts. Jeremy Scahill, an investigative reporter and co-founding editor for The Intercept, has been a frequent contributor since 1997. The show covered the Seattle protests (1999) targeting the World Trade Organization. Democracy Now! partnered with Free Speech TV (FSTV) to cover the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Due to FSTV's satellite broadcast of the convention, the event marked a turning point for Democracy Now!, as in addition to its presence on radio, it became a television show. From then onward, Democracy Now! has had their content promoted and broadcast on FSTV. Democracy Now! began broadcasting on television every weekday shortly after September 11, 2001, and is the only public media in the U.S. that airs simultaneously on satellite and cable television, radio, and the internet. Democracy Now! has been critical of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. After data disclosures by the whistleblower organisation WikiLeaks regarding the TPP in 2010, Democracy Now! has given a significant media platform and extensively covered them since, and like some other news networks cooperated with its leader Julian Assange. Coverage of WikiLeaks by Democracy Now! was sympathetic and without slants, unlike several traditional news networks, including some of its partners. In 2011, reporter Sharif Abdel Kouddous covered the Egyptian revolution for Democracy Now!. On February 19, 2016, Democracy Now! marked 20 years on the air with an hour-long retrospective look back at \"two decades of independent, unembedded news,\" with highlights chosen from over 5,000 episodes. Amy Goodman also published a book entitled \"Democracy Now!: 20 Years Covering the Movements Changing America,\" and launched a 100-city tour across the United States to mark the 20th anniversary of Democracy Now!, with scheduled broadcasts of the show recorded during her travels."

Goodman took the program to the Downtown Community Television Center located in a converted firehouse building in New York City's Chinatown, where the program began to be televised. Only a few days later on September 11, 2001 Democracy Now! was the closest national broadcast to Ground Zero. On that day Goodman and colleagues continued reporting beyond their scheduled hour-long time slot in what became an eight-hour marathon broadcast. Following 9/11, in addition to radio and television, Democracy Now! expanded their multimedia reach to include cable, satellite radio, Internet, and podcasts. In November 2009, Democracy Now!  left their broadcast studio in the converted DCTV firehouse, where they had broadcast for eight years. The studio subsequently moved to a repurposed graphic arts building in the Chelsea District of Manhattan. In 2010, the new 8,500-square-foot Democracy Now! studio became the first radio or television studio in the nation to receive LEED Platinum certification, the highest rating awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council."

Salazar was filming as officers in full riot gear charged her area. As she yelled \"Press!\" she was knocked down and told to put her face in the ground while another officer dragged her backward by her leg across the pavement. The video footage of the incident was immediately posted on the Internet, leading to a large public outcry against her arrest. When a second producer, Kouddous, approached, he too was arrested, and charged with a felony. According to a press release by Democracy Now!, Goodman herself was arrested after confronting officers regarding the arrest of her colleagues. The officers had established a line of \"crowd control,\" and ordered Goodman to move back. Goodman claims she was arrested after being pulled through the police line by an officer, and subsequently (as well as Kouddous) had her press credentials for the convention physically stripped from her by a Secret Service agent. All were held on charges of \"probable cause for riot.\" A statement was later released by the city announcing that all \"misdemeanor charges for presence at an unlawful assembly for journalists\" would be dropped. The felony charges against Salazar and Kouddous were also dropped. Goodman, Salazar, and Kouddous subsequently filed a lawsuit against the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis as well as other defendants. According to Baher Asmy of the Center for Constitutional Rights, \"[a]ll three plaintiffs that are journalists with Democracy Now reached a final settlement with the city of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and the United States Secret Service, that will resolve the claims that they had against them from unlawful and quite violent arrests.\" The settlement includes $100,000 in compensation and a promise of police training."

The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a crazy teenage superhero who battles with an array of supervillains. The show also features mini-episodes of adventures of other bizarre superheroes. The show was produced by Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation. The cartoon was the third animated series produced by the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation during the animation renaissance of the 1990s. Bruce Timm, best known as a major principal of the DC Animated Universe, originally intended it to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but executive producer Steven Spielberg asked series producer and writer Tom Ruegger and the Animaniacs team to turn Freakazoid! into a flat-out comedy. The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as Animaniacs, and the humor is unique in its inclusions of slapstick, fourth wall firings, parody, surreal humor and pop cultural references. The series was one of the first to debut on the new Kids' WB Saturday morning block of The WB, on September 9, 1995. The series lasted for two seasons, finishing with 24 episodes, the final one broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in the ratings, reruns on Cartoon Network and a fan following have elevated the series to become a cult hit. Warner Bros. even flirted with the idea of renewing the series for a third season, but deemed it to be too expensive. The show also ranked #53 on IGN's Top 100 Animated Series list."

His name is an allusion to various superheroes' alliterative names (e.g. Bruce Banner, Peter Parker). Dexter gained his abilities from a computer bug activated by a \"secret key sequence\" that must be typed (a reference to the Pentium FDIV bug). The sequence of keys is \"@[=g3,8d]\\&fbb=-q]/hk%fg\" (the quotes are included), as seen when Roddy MacStew types the combination in \"The Chip (Act 2)\". The bug manifests when the user presses Delete after entering the string, and was first activated when Dexter's cat Mr. Chubbikins crawled onto the keyboard. Becoming absorbed into his computer and instantly gaining all the information on the Internet, Freakazoid has enhanced strength and endurance, extraordinary speed and agility and negligible amounts of sanity. These changes make him a powerful and fearsome force for upholding freedom and righteousness, unless he gets distracted by something like a bear riding a motorcycle. He has a base called the Freakalair, a parody of the Batcave, built by his mute butler Ingmar. The Freakalair contains a \"Hall of Nifty Things to Know\" and even a mad scientist lab. His greatest weakness, as he once explained to Armando Guitierrez, is that he can be imprisoned in a cage with graphite bars charged with negative ions. He also expresses a great aversion to \"poo gas\". Peripheral powers come and go: Freakazoid once developed telekinesis triggered by anger that was never mentioned again after the episode, and once crossed the globe to yell at a Tibetan monk for raking too loudly, but apologizes to him later in the same plot. He also has the ability to assume the form of electricity and cover long distances instantaneously, although he just as often simply sticks his arms forward and runs while making swooshing sounds with his mouth, pretending to fly. Dexter can change into and out of Freakazoid at will with the words \"Freak out!\" and \"Freak in!\". When not in Freakazoid mode, Dexter looks and acts completely normal, and his family is unaware that anything has happened to him. Freakazoid spends this time in an area of Dexter's brain called the Freakazone, where he reflects, has profound thoughts, and watches reruns of The Rat Patrol. While the show's setting is set around Washington, D.C., the locale often varies with the show's humor, taking Freakazoid to locations around the world as needed."

He was once geeky 16-year-old computer ace named Dexter Douglas (voiced by David Kaufman) who became Freakazoid from an overloaded Pinnacle chip inside his computer and hit the delete button after Mr. Chubbikins walked on his keyboard. He attends Harry Connick High School. To transform into Freakazoid, Dexter says \"Freak out!\" To change back into Dexter, Freakazoid says \"Freak in!\" Dexter and Freakazoid sometimes identify as separate identities, and other times consider themselves to be the same person. Catchphrase: \"Aw, nut bunnies!\" His image and \"Freak Out!\" superpower are parodies of the comic book superhero Shazam (Captain Marvel)."

When Dexter becomes Freakazoid, Duncan is usually the victim of his mischief. Debbie Douglas (voiced by Tress MacNeille)\u00a0\u2013 Dexter's mother. She has no clue that her son is Freakazoid and is in general blithe and clueless. Douglas Douglas (voiced by John P. McCann)\u00a0\u2013 Dexter's father. An automobile dealer who thinks a goblin lives in the gas tank of his car. Occasionally used for laughs as a stereotypical technologically inept father figure who tries to keep Dexter and Duncan in line. Mr. Chubbikins (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker)\u00a0\u2013 The Douglas' morbidly obese cat that was formerly named Mr. Chubbskins. He jumped on Dexter's keyboard while chasing a butterfly, accidentally typing in the key sequence which activated the Pinnacle chip's flaw, turning Dexter into Freakazoid."

        "content": "Sgt. Mike Cosgrove (voiced by Edward Asner)\u00a0\u2013 A heavyset, gruff police sergeant with a heart of gold, who is friends with Freakazoid and several other characters. He speaks in a gruff monotone and shows very little enthusiasm for anything. By pointing at something and saying \"Cut it out\", he has the almost supernatural ability to get people to stop whatever they are doing on command, no matter what they may be doing at the time, be it panicking at the sight of a villain, stealing a television, or attempting to capture Cosgrove and Freakazoid (in the Animaniacs comic series, he even once managed to get Yakko, Wakko, and Dot to \"Cut it out\", something that many others had tried, and failed, to do). Cosgrove also possesses the odd power of finding Freakazoid no matter where he is by driving his police car to that particular location. He often interrupts Freakazoid's heroic endeavors to ask him to visit various entertainments, such as the \"Honey Harvest Festival\" or \"a bear riding a motorcycle\" which Freakazoid always enthusiastically agrees to, no matter what else he is doing at the time. During this visit, Cosgrove inevitably reveals important information about the plot of the episode, including the villain's location or evil deeds. Freakazoid then rushes off to foil the villain's scheme, leaving Cosgrove to enjoy the attraction for himself. Sgt. Cosgrove also resembles his voice actor. Roddy MacStew (voiced by Craig Ferguson)\u00a0\u2013 Freakazoid's mentor, and expositionist; an ill-tempered Scotsman who once worked for Guitierrez. He first found that the Pinnacle chip was flawed. In the continuation of \"The Chip\" (detailing how Freakazoid gained his powers), he was trapped in the Internet. Roddy was later kicked out of the Internet by Guitierrez and resumed his mentor role. His favorite word is \"Crud!\" Steff (voiced by Tracy Rowe)\u00a0\u2013 Freakazoid's perky blonde girlfriend; her real name is Stephanie. She discovers Freakazoid's secret identity when Cosgrove accidentally points it out aloud in \"Mission: Freakazoid\". Hans (voiced by Larry Cedar)\u00a0\u2013 A mysterious agent with a Western European accent who takes Freakazoid to Professor Heiney's lab. Professor Heiney (voiced by Ed Gilbert)\u00a0\u2013 A scientist, with a lab in the mountains, who Freakazoid often goes to for help. He does research on monsters, zaps them, and is often attacked by them at his lab. Ingmar\u00a0\u2013 Freakazoid's mute butler in charge of the maintenance of the Freakalair (according to Freakazoid, he constructed it himself from scratch). He quit in \"Mission: Freakazoid\" to become a rodeo clown and was replaced by Professor Jones. A take-off on Bernardo, the mute manservant of Zorro and Batman's butler Alfred Pennyworth. Professor Jones (voiced by Jonathan Harris)\u00a0\u2013 A snooty, cowardly manservant, essentially recreating his role as Doctor Zachary Smith from Lost in Space (every time Jones appears in a scene, someone asks him if he was \"on a TV show with a robot\"). He is the replacement to the Freakalair's previous butler and old friends with him. Jones does not get along with Cosgrove well and gets little respect from Freakazoid, or anyone else. Joe Leahy (voiced by himself)\u00a0\u2013 The show's very vocal announcer, who sometimes gets more involved than the job usually requires. Freakazette\u00a0\u2013 Only mentioned in the first episode for a brief verse during the \"Freakazoid and Friends\" theme song (which plays to the same theme as Animaniacs). Foamy the Freakadog (vocal effects provide by Frank Welker)\u00a0\u2013 A vicious, rabid dog which Freakazoid had freed from the dogcatcher's van. Foamy is painted blue, has a Freakazoid costume (complete with hair), and is prone to maul and/or beat Freakazoid to a pulp, even on their missions, due to his rabid condition. Handman (voiced by Paul Rugg)\u00a0\u2013 Freakazoid's brief \"right hand man\". He is quite literally just a painted face on Freakazoid's right hand who has great difficulty pronouncing Freakazoid's name correctly. He fell in love with and married Handgirl, a painted face on Freakazoid's left hand. Expendable Lad\u00a0\u2013 Freakazoid's brief sidekick from the start of \"And Fanboy Is His Name\". He was taken to the hospital due to injuries sustained from Milk Man's attack that gave him a bruised clavicle. Expendable Lad was subsequently released from the service of Freakazoid. Leonard Maltin (voiced by himself)\u00a0\u2013 He was kidnapped by Dr. Mystico during the episode \"Island of Dr. Mystico\", while Maltin was giving his opinion of the same episode. Freakazoid points out that Mystico's prisoners all have superpowers, and Mr. Maltin's is that he knows every movie ever made. Maltin provided his own voice for the episode. Henry Kissinger (voiced by Maurice LaMarche)\u00a0\u2013 A politician who was kidnapped by Dr. Mystico's \"orangu-men\". In the show, he speaks in a low, groggy, incomprehensible mumble. He is briefly mentioned in one episode after his only appearance. Norm Abram (voiced by himself)\u00a0\u2013 He was kidnapped by the Lobe to make a wooden instrument to destroy Freakazoid, but got free and helped turn the tables against the Lobe and his villain allies. Abram supplied his own voice and trademark line for the episode."

        "content": "The Lobe (voiced by David Warner)\u00a0\u2013 Freakazoid's archenemy. He is an evil genius whose entire head is a giant brain. Despite his high intellect, he has very low self-esteem, once even having a scheme foiled by Freakazoid simply insulting the plan, despite actually being impressed by it. No background information of any kind is given for the Lobe; even his real name is never revealed. The Cobra Queen (voiced by Tress MacNeille)\u00a0\u2013 Audrey Manatee is a former shoplifter whose encounter with an experimental cosmetic left in the sun too long transformed her into a cobra woman, with command over snakes and other reptiles. In later episodes, Cave Guy and the Cobra Queen are a couple. She has a lair in the sewers and often complained about the lack of light until Freakazoid suggested getting Japanese lanterns. He defeated her when she faints while trying to say \"Silly Sally sells sappy seashells in Seattle\" (he later wonders how that actually worked). The Cobra Queen also shows up as part of the team in \"Mission: Freakazoid!\" She seems to be offended when compared to Sylvester the Cat. Cave Guy (voiced by Jeff Bennett impersonating Jim Backus)\u00a0\u2013 Royce Mumphry is a thuggish blue-skinned caveman with upperclass diction, education, and taste who speaks in a stereotypical WASP tone (see Locust Valley lockjaw). He subscribes to The New Yorker. Cave Guy also seems to have an odd fear of Klingons (possibly because of the made-up language they use). Longhorn (voiced by Maurice LaMarche)\u00a0\u2013 Jubal \"Bull\" Nixon was once an employee of the Johnny Cat cat litter company until he turned to a life of crime. Because he was searched for by law enforcement so frequently, he had plastic surgery to turn himself into a humanoid Texas Longhorn bull. Freakazoid pointed out that this did not prevent him from showing up on America's Most Wanted every week. He loves country music and despite being a lousy songwriter, he is determined to get a recording contract in Nashville. Longhorn also owns a massive truck, nicknamed \"Bessie Mae\", which is outfitted with all kinds of devices. Turk (voiced by Hal Rayle)\u00a0\u2013 Longhorn's henchman. Armando Guitierrez (voiced by Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n)\u00a0\u2013 The eyepatch-wearing man whose company Apex Microchips (not to be confused with Apex Digital) designed the faulty Pinnacle chip responsible for Freakazoid's creation as well as him being Freakazoid's first enemy. Physically, Guitierrez resembles his voice actor Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n. At times, he shows similarities to Khan Noonien Singh from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan; who was also played by Montalb\u00e1n. One of his recurring jokes is demanding others to laugh along with him. When he fell to his supposed doom, he asked Freakazoid to scream with him. Originally a normal human being, he briefly gains powers similar to Freakazoid's by exploiting the Pinnacle chip's flaw. By \"Hero Boy\", he appears in a hooded robe to cover the cybernetic side of his head, which was caused by Freakazoid knocking him into a cyber-pit. Guitierrez hates being called a weenie, to which he will angrily respond \"I am not a weenie! It is YOU who are the weenie!\". In \"Normadeus\", Guitierrez is among the villains invited by the Lobe to witness the destruction of Freakazoid. The Lobe commented that he never got an opportunity to be in the same room as Guitierrez before. Jocko (voiced by Paul Rugg) \u2013 Armando Guitierrez's henchman who is completely inarticulate. Candle Jack (voiced by Jeff Bennett)\u00a0\u2013 A supernatural villain with a burlap sack over his head called \"the Boogeyman, the for-real one\" in the series. He abducts anyone who says his name and ties them up with rope, apparently because \"he's a nut.\" Although he prides himself on being scary, he has a weakness for pie and also seems to enjoy watching F Troop. During \"Island of Dr. Mystico\", Freakazoid and Cosgrove have him chase around and scare Professor Jones. Waylon Jeepers (voiced by Jeff Bennett)\u00a0\u2013 A creepy little man originally from Venice Beach, California who created the Medusa Watch, which has the power to turn people (and pigeons) into stone. He has also created a similar device that turned beavers into gold. In one episode, Jeepers once summoned the demon Vorn the Unspeakable with the help of a book entitled How to Summon Monsters the E-Z Way. His schemes seem to deeply infuriate Freakazoid and Jeepers is shown to be the only villain that Freakazoid genuinely does not like (whereas the rest of the villains appear to have a friendly relationship with Freakazoid off-battle), once going on a long (and unscripted) rant. His name is a play on the name of famous country guitarist Waylon Jennings. Invisibo (voiced by Corey Burton impersonating Vincent Price)\u00a0\u2013 Ahmon Kor-Unch is an invisible, smart-mouthed pharaoh who is only visible via the Anubis staff he carries. While he was sealed away inside a sarcophagus, Duncan pushing Dexter into his sarcophagus resulted in the sarcophagus' seal being broken, enabling Invisibo to be free to resume his crime spree. Freakazoid gave Invisibo his name because \"you're invisible and it's my show and we already had a title card made up and it makes me happy!\" Invisibo accepts the name saying it has a \"somewhat sinister ring to it.\" Freakazoid defeated Invisibo by destroying his staff and locking him back into his sarcophagus, which is then taken away by the authorities. In \"Normadeus\", Invisibo regained his invisibility powers and is among the villains invited by the Lobe to witness the destruction of Freakazoid where the Lobe gave him a party hat in order for him to be visible. Booger Beast (voiced by Frank Welker)\u00a0- A slimy monster who attacks Steff in the cold opening of episode 9. The Nerdator (voiced by Aron Kincaid)\u00a0\u2013 A man who planned to kidnap all of the nerds in the world (which also included Steven Spielberg) and absorb their knowledge to become a \"Super-Nerd\". His plan succeeded until Freakazoid convinced him of the downside of being a nerd. The Nerdator then discontinued his plot. Nerdator was last seen kidnapping \"good-looking, but vapid airheads\". His character design is a parody of the Predator. Vorn the Unspeakable (voiced by Richard Moll)\u00a0\u2013 A demon summoned by Waylon Jeepers, who bears a resemblance to H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu. Arms Akimbo (voiced by John Schuck impersonating Edward G. Robinson)\u00a0\u2013 A spoiled model turned extortionist who, after years of posing, was left with his arms frozen in a jaunty pose with his hands on his hips. When fighting, he strikes with his oversized elbows. His first appearance is in a local shop selling \"oops insurance\", a form of protection racketeering which mainly consists of him breaking something of value (or causing a building to detonate spectacularly), before comically following it up with a small \"Oops.\" The Milk Man\u00a0\u2013 Only shown/mentioned in the episode \"And Fanboy Is His Name\". He is shown on a news report in a pitched battle with Freakazoid and his then-sidekick Expendable Lad. As the name implies, he uses milk as his theme as he wields a milk gun in battle. Deadpan (voiced by Bebe Neuwirth)\u00a0\u2013 A plain-looking (almost blank-faced) female supervillain with a monotonous voice. She is a shapeshifter who once tried to conquer Washington by transforming into Freakazoid, but this plan was quickly foiled when the real Freakazoid appeared immediately afterward and nonchalantly pointed her out. She had only one appearance in the cold opening for \"The Wrath of Guitierrez\". Mary Beth (voiced by Tress MacNeille)\u00a0\u2013 Cosgrove's former girlfriend, a cosmetics executive and a monster. She is short-tempered and when angered turns green, develops a deep raspy voice, and often lights candles by shooting fire from her nose. Her plan to steal Freakazoid's hero essence to remain immortal is foiled and, as a result, she shrivels, dies and becomes a pile of dust. Her name is a play off of the cosmetics giant Mary Kay. Janos Ivnovels (voiced by Jim Cummings)\u00a0\u2013 The ruthless dictator of Vuka Nova and its Minister of State Security. He is responsible for capturing Freakazoid's family (and a mime who was apparently from Animaniacs) and imprisoning them in the High-Security Wing of Chesky Beresch Prison, the toughest prison in Europe. He and his subordinate Colonel Anton Mohans were defeated after Freakazoid and his friends rescued the Douglas family (and the mime). Janos and Anton were last seen being tortured by the mime and his pals. He is a one-time villain, having only appeared in \"Mission: Freakazoid\". Colonel Anton Mohans (voiced by Larry Cedar)\u00a0\u2013 A vicious thug who finds it relaxing when Janos tortures his prisoners. Dr. Mystico (voiced by Tim Curry)\u00a0\u2013 A mad scientist who turns orangutans into human-like beings (and vice versa) in \"Island of Dr. Mystico\" after being kicked out of the university where he worked at. Dr. Mystico set up his laboratory on an island to continue his experiments. He seeks to take over the world, though he always seems to say Cleveland instead. He has a white cat similar to Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Dr. Mystico's first name may actually be Wendell, since he once says, \"They called me mad, insane, Wendell!\". He also bears a striking resemblance to his voice actor. Sparkles - Dr. Mystico's pet white cat. Orangu-Men (vocal effects provided by Jim Cummings) - A group of creatures created by Dr. Mystico by splicing the DNA of humans and the orangutans that are native to his island. Fatima, Ackbar, and Ringo are three of Dr. Mystico's henchmen. Kid Carrion (voiced by Jeff Bennett)\u00a0\u2013 A zombie cowboy who was never named and only appeared in \"Relax-o-Vision\" and \"The Lobe\". He can be seen in the opening credits standing next to Candle Jack. Kid Carrion bears a passing resemblance to the revamped version of the Scarecrow from Bruce Timm's The New Batman Adventures, yet seems to be a parody of the villain Tex Hex from the 1987 Filmation cartoon series Bravestarr. Eye-of-Newt\u00a0\u2013 A strange one-eyed creature with a hairstyle resembling Newt Gingrich's; his name is a reference to Shakespeare's Macbeth (\"Eye of newt and toe of frog...\"). He has no dialogue and is a background villain, although it seems that he is frequently recaptured by heroes like Freakazoid or the Huntsman."

        "title": "Freakazoid!_Other characters",
        "content": "A few characters fall somewhere in the space between \"allies\" and \"enemies\" to land squarely in the category of \"nuisances\". Mo-Ron/Bo-Ron (voiced by Stan Freberg) \u2013 An obese and dimwitted alien from the planet Barone's. His name was later changed to Bo-Ron, to appease network censors' concerns that use of the word moron might be offensive. In \"Freak-a-Panel\", Mo-Ron/Bo-Ron was among the dropped Freakazoid characters that confront Freakazoid following Cave Guy's defeat. Lord Bravery refers to him as \"Mo-Ron or...Bo-Ron, whatever.\" He is a parody of Ro-Man, the ridiculous-looking alien monster from the notoriously bad science fiction film Robot Monster. His first appearance was when he tried to deliver Earth an \u201dimportant message\u201d, only to forget what it was. This message turned out to be a comet heading towards Earth, which caused everyone to flee the area. He also appeared in an episode that was a parody of E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. Fanboy (voiced by Stephen Furst)\u00a0\u2013 An obese, acne-stricken, socially awkward fanboy (hence his name) and would-be sidekick to Freakazoid who obsesses about numerous comic books, TV shows, and movies from The Black Hole to Star Wars Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope. Fanboy's age is never specified; he could be anywhere between his late teens and early 30s. He bumped into George Takei at a comic book shop and gave chase, causing Takei to run into traffic and nearly get hit by three cars. Despite his different obsessions, Fanboy has never heard of Stan Lee. In \"Freak-a-Panel\", Fanboy is among the dropped characters that confront Freakazoid following Cave Guy's defeat. Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton (voiced by Frank Welker and Tress MacNeille) make frequent cameos in the show, partly because Dexter Douglas lives in Washington, D.C. Barbra Streisand (voiced by Tress MacNeille) also makes a number of appearances, most notably in the episode \"Dexter's Date\", which features a parody of Hello, Dolly!. Hero Boy (voiced by John P. McCann) \u2013 The title character from Freakazoid's favorite TV show that is first shown in the episode of the same name. Hero Boy has no powers (save for flying) and his black and white show is a parody of the animated series Astro Boy. Hero Boy has the catchphrase \"I must succeed!\", though he is invariably shrugged off by the monsters he fights, including the giant ones, when his pathetic fighting techniques (consisting of weakly pounding on his enemies) always fail miserably. Steven Spielberg (voiced by Frank Welker) \u2013 The show's executive producer. His most notable appearance was in part of an episode where Freakazoid, the Brain from Pinky and the Brain, and Wakko Warner from Animaniacs get into a disagreement over which of their shows he likes best (only for Spielberg to ask them \"Who are you people?\"). In \"The Nerdator\", Steven Spielberg is among the nerds that are captured by the Nerdator. During this time, he was directing a sequel to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial called E.T. Returns. Paul Harvey (voiced by Paul Rugg) \u2013 A loud, obnoxious man who often interrupts the story to give background information on a villain (as seen in episodes introducing the Cobra Queen and Longhorn), or to describe, rather than show, the ending of an episode (demonstrated in \"Candle Jack\"). He is a parody of the radio personality of the same name, and even borrows the catchphrase \"the rest of the story\" from the real Harvey. Lonnie Tallbutt (voiced by Mitch Schauer in human form, Jim Cummings in werewolf form) \u2013 A werewolf that begs Dexter for help. His name is a combination of that of Lon Chaney, Jr. and Lawrence Talbot, the character Chaney played in the 1941 movie The Wolf Man. He is prone to grabbing people's shirt collars and yelling \"You don't understand!\" Emmitt Nervend \u2013 A short, hunchbacked man with straw-like hair and a frozen grimace who usually shows up at least once an episode, always in the opening credits, but usually in the background. He stands looking at the camera (as pictured), never saying a word. Sometimes things happen to him directly, like him standing outside a restaurant collecting donations while dressed as Santa Claus and ringing a bell, birds pecking his head, or laser beams shooting just above his head. The end credits will often contain a credit revealing how many times Emmitt can be found in a particular episode. His appearance was drawn by Mitch Schauer. Weena Mercator as The Hopping Woman \u2013 A person acknowledged whenever credits are used in an episode. However, no episode or sketch has ever featured a hopping woman in it. Her name also appears with multiple spellings: \"Mercator\" in \"Dance of Doom\" and \"Mercatur\" in \"The Cloud\". Yakko Warner (voiced by Rob Paulsen) \u2013 The oldest brother of the Animaniacs. Wakko Warner (voiced by Jess Harnell) \u2013 The younger brother of the Animaniacs. Dot Warner (voiced by Tress MacNeille) \u2013 The youngest sister of the Animaniacs. The Brain (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) \u2013 A megalomaniacal genius and a genetically-altered laboratory mouse from the TV series Pinky and the Brain."

        "title": "Freakazoid!_Mini-segments",
        "content": "Freakazoid! also features several mini-segments, primarily during the first season. Each of these have their own theme songs, title cards and cast, and only rarely \"cross over\" into the continuity of the main show. These segments include: Lord Bravery\u00a0\u2013 Nigel Skunkthorpe (voiced by Jeff Bennett impersonating John Cleese) is a superhero from the United Kingdom in an outfit slightly resembling that of a Roman soldier. He does not do much in the way of superheroics; in fact, he is very snooty, cynical and unwilling to do unpleasant tasks in the course of his duties, such as entering a sewer to perform a rescue. Likewise, he gets little respect and recognition as a superhero from the general public and even from his wife and mother-in-law, with whom he lives, and is generally the laughing stock of the superhero community. At one point, he loses his name due to a trademark dispute with a bakery of the same name, after which he changes it to Lord Smoked Meats and Fishes. He has been mistaken for a party clown. His theme song is delivered in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan's song \"A British Tar\". In \"Freak-A-Panel\", Lord Bravery is among the dropped characters that confront Freakazoid following Cave Guy's defeat where he is the one who mentioned their diminished roles after the first season. This caused Freakazoid to give them jobs washing the Freakmobile. The Huntsman\u00a0\u2013 The Huntsman (voiced by Jeff Bennett impersonating Charlton Heston) is an imagining of what Robin Hood would be like if he was portrayed by Charlton Heston. He can never find enough crime to fight and secretly suspects that the police are hiding crimes from him because they do not trust him. It is also possible that he was so good at being a superhero that his villains simply gave up trying. He was once a hunter called Marty Feeb who saved a chunky elf from being eaten by a crow. The elf rewarded Marty Feeb with a magic sack of corn. Upon eating it, he was granted strength, speed, and shining teeth, and became the Huntsman. He also has a brother called Hector Feeb, who he claims lives in a townhouse. The Huntsman can be summoned by a police officer blowing into the Horn of Urgency on top of the local police station, and his battle cry is \"Into action!\". When he appears before the police lieutenant Artie King (voiced by Dorian Harewood), the Huntsman is told in those two episodes that either a rookie mistakenly blew the horn or the blowing of the horn was a false alarm. After walking out while making a claim that the police are hiding crimes from him, he would often kick the water dispenser. His trademark phrase is \"Darn the luck, darn!\" His sketches are often themed around beginning with a lengthy, overly heroic opener, with a title that would indicate an action-oriented episode, that ends up being a short anticlimactic skit of the Huntsman not being needed after all. In one of his episodes, it was mentioned that he had fought the Lobe and Cave Guy and he is shown fighting Cave Guy and Candle Jack in his opening. The Huntsman was once seen as the umpire during the Superheroes/Villain All-Star Benefit Softball Game. When Freakazoid, Arms Akimbo, and Cave Guy both asked his opinion on a play, he responded that he had looked away to have some berry water and did not see if the play was an out or a safe. In \"The Freakazoid\", the Huntsman gives a request to Freakazoid to help him find work and also lost the address to the superhero convention that was being held on some moon. In \"Freak-A-Panel\", the Huntsman is among the dropped characters that confront Freakazoid following Cave Guy's defeat where he was the one who asked him why they were kicked off the show after the first season. When Freakzoid told him, Lord Bravery, Fanboy, and Mo-Ron/Bo-Ron that they should've gotten the memos from the producers, the Huntsman stated that he can't get mail as he lives in the woods. Freakazoid does get them jobs washing the Freakmobile. The Lawn Gnomes\u00a0\u2013 Baffeardin (voiced by Clive Revill), Huska (voiced by Carl Ballantine), Honna (voiced by Rose Marie), and Quist (voiced by Larry Gelman) are a group of gnomes-turned-lawn gnomes that come to life at night in a parody of Gargoyles. Infamous for their mischief back in 995 AD, they were advised by the Great Mystic Gnome (voiced by Roscoe Lee Browne) to change their ways before it gets worse for them. After planning to do so in a week, the four gnomes were cursed to become stone by day by the powerful wizard Rathgar (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) after they tripped him and previously attacked his younger Viking brother Erik the Large (also voiced by LaMarche). They would revert at night during which time they were given the opportunity to mend their ways to fight evil alongside mankind, after which the curse would be lifted. During this one-time sketch, Freakazoid did his commentary on it. Toby Danger\u00a0\u2013 A (somewhat) loving parody of Jonny Quest, featuring the voices of Scott Menville, Don Messick (in his last role before he died), and Granville Van Dusen (all of whom provided voices for JQ), that was originally written by Tom Minton as a 12-minute stand-alone short for Animaniacs, but slotted into Freakazoid! after that series was greenlighted and had an eight-minute opening. The completed 12-minute Toby Danger storyboard was trimmed by director Eric Radomski to fit into the available Freakazoid! time slot. Fatman and Boy Blubber\u00a0\u2013 The misadventures of two morbidly obese superheroes (voiced by Marc Drotman and Paul Rugg, respectively), in a parody of the Batman TV series. Their only segment involves them coming to the aid of Louis, an overweight boy who loves sweet buns and is being tormented by bullies. After attempting to capture the bullies, and failing due to their extreme lack of physical fitness, Fatman and Boy Blubber deliver a pseudo-inspirational speech to Louis about their own struggles with being overweight, and how they often end up eating fast food and snacks instead of having sensible meals. When Louis asks what the point of the speech is, Fatman changes the subject to ask if Louis has any more sweet buns in his lunchbox; the hero then tries to confiscate the food (it is unclear whether he is attempting to prevent Louis from gaining more weight, or simply wants the sweet buns for himself), and begins beating Louis up with Boy Blubber when the boy refuses to give the sweet buns to them and starts to evade them. Fatman and Boy Blubber also make an appearance during the episode \"Hero Boy\" where it is revealed the episode is actually a storybook being read by Fatman to some children. When he asks a kid if he is going to eat the food the kid has, Fatman is given a no gesture. When Fatman asks if he can have it, the kid gives it to him."

Then they played it for Steven Spielberg and he said 'Yep! Fine, sure, great,' and then I panicked ... and I had to do it.\" Rugg played the role of Freakazoid through the entire series run."

        "title": "Freakazoid!_Humor",
        "content": "The humor in Freakazoid! relied heavily on slapstick, parody and pop cultural references. Due to the series being metafiction, much of the series was self-aware humor (i.e. breaking the fourth wall); for instance, after the first appearance of the Freakmobile, the show goes immediately into an impromptu commercial for a toy version, and later in the episode, Freakazoid addresses an audience, congratulating the staff on how hard they have worked to make the show toyetic. A typically strange running gag involves a repeated credit for \"Weena Mercator as the Hopping Woman\", though no such character appears in any episode. Her credit is usually preceded by a number of other fictional names and followed by a fictional director. The show also incorporated humor aimed at the then-newly founded WB Network, such as questioning the meaning of the initials \"WB\", e.g., \"Weird Butt\" or \"Wet Bananas\" instead of Warner Bros. Freakazoid! made frequent use of stock footage, including the peaceful scene of a field of flowers (\"Relax-O-Vision\"), numerous people screaming (\"Scream-O-Vision\"), traditionally dressed Bavarians dancing and slapping each other, a man being shot in the belly with a cannonball and a man wrestling a bear. Cameo appearances were also a major element of the show's humor. At various times, Freakazoid! hosted appearances by characters from other Warner Bros. Cartoons such as Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and even an insinuation appearance of the Batman from Bruce Timm's animated version, which has a similar drawing style (its concept of old movie-style title cards at the beginning of each episode was also replicated in Freakazoid!). Portrayals of many celebrities (including producer Steven Spielberg) and guest appearances by such figures as Jack Valenti, Leonard Maltin and Mark Hamill as themselves were also commonplace. Norm Abram had an entire episode, \"Normadeus\", built around him. One original character, a bizarre-looking man named Emmitt Nervend, plays no role whatsoever other than enabling a Where's Waldo-esque hunt for his constant cameos (complete with the number of his appearances announced in the closing credits). One of the show's longest cameo appearances was when Wakko (from Animaniacs) and the Brain (from Pinky and the Brain) appeared in a scene in which they argue with Freakazoid over which of their shows is Steven Spielberg's favorite, with Freakazoid arguing that his show was the favorite because \"we got a memo\" (Tiny Toon Adventures was not represented in the discussion as it was on Nickelodeon at the time, while the others were on Kids' WB). However, when the trio confronts Steven over the issue, he simply replies: \"Who are you people?\"."

        "content": "Freakazoid! was created by animator Bruce Timm, who had previously produced Batman: The Animated Series, and Paul Dini, who was a story editor for Tiny Toon Adventures. Timm was called upon by Steven Spielberg, who Timm said \"liked\" Timm's Batman series, to help create a new superhero show. After a meeting with Spielberg, Timm said that Spielberg had \"really liked\" the idea for the series, after which Timm and Dini created the character Freakazoid, an edgy superhero with a manic personality. Timm came up with the name for the character naturally, as he recalled, \"The name 'Freakazoid' just kind of jumped out of me, I don't even know where from. I said 'Oh, yeah, 'Freakazoid', that might be an interesting name.'\" Timm originally created Freakazoid! to be a serious \"adventure show\" with some comedic undertones. However, his initial idea for the series did not come to be, as he stated: After Timm left the series, Tom Ruegger, who developed the other Spielberg series Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs, was brought in to re-develop the series Timm had created \"from the ground up\". Ruegger's version of the series used some of Timm's designs and concepts, but Timm said that the series was \"radically altered\" to become the comedy series that was more to Spielberg's liking. Ruegger then began writing stories for the series, and came up with a pile of very short segments. Spielberg liked what Ruegger had written, but wanted longer stories for the series as well. Ruegger then asked writers John McCann and Paul Rugg to come onto the series to write longer, more elaborate stories for the series and, according to Rugg, \"(...) figure out what this [Freakazoid!] was going to be, and the answer was like, 'We didn't know', and still don't\"."

Tom Ruegger said that Freakazoid! had done poorly in ratings because the audience that the series gathered was older than the target audience. Also, Freakazoid ran into timeslot problems. Writer John McCann said that the time slot of the series changed frequently: \"They put it at eight o' clock in the morning, 3:30 in the afternoon, they shifted it all around; we couldn't even find it, and we wrote the thing\". The series ran on Kids' WB until February 14, 1997, when it was cancelled due to poor ratings, airing only one complete season and part of a second season. Rugg said the series' demise was the result of a combination of people not understanding the series, time slot changes, appealing to the wrong demographics, and that \"(...) there aren't a lot of Nielsen boxes in federal prisons. Had there been, I'm telling you, we'd still be on the air today\". However, the show was later picked up by Cartoon Network and was rebroadcast from April 5, 1997, until March 29, 2003. The series had a total number of 24 episodes. In 2006, Freakazoid! was one of the shows scheduled to be broadcast on the AOL broadband channel, In2TV. In Italy, Freakazoid! along with Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain, was shown on RAI and later Mediaset.

Fuller left the show five episodes into Season 1 because of creative differences; creative direction was taken over by executive producers John Masius and Stephen Godchaux.

Eighteen-year-old Georgia \"George\" Lass (Ellen Muth) is the show's protagonist and narrator. George dies early in the pilot episode and becomes one of the \"undead\", a \"grim reaper\". George soon learns that a reaper's job is to remove the souls of people, preferably just before they die, and escort them until they move on into their afterlife. George's death leaves behind her mother (Cynthia Stevenson) and the rest of her family at a point when her relationships with them were on shaky ground.

After dropping out of college, she takes a temp job through Happy Time Temporary Services. During her lunch break on her first day, she is hit and killed by a toilet seat falling from the deorbiting Mir space station. She is soon informed that, rather than moving on to the \"great beyond\", she will become a grim reaper in the External Influence Division, collecting souls of people who die in accidents (many of which have a Rube Goldberg-style complexity), and homicides. Each reaper has a secret quota of souls; once the quota is met, the reaper moves on to another realm and the last soul reaped then takes his or her job collecting souls. In Season 1, George has trouble adjusting to her circumstances\u00a0\u2013 collecting souls while holding down a day job. By Season 2, she has mostly adjusted to her new role, with few unresolved issues with her life and her afterlife. George's family is struggling to deal with her death. Her father, Clancy (Greg Kean), has an affair that affects his marriage to Joy (Cynthia Stevenson). Her sister, Reggie (Britt McKillip), acts out\u00a0\u2013 stealing toilet seats from neighbors and school and hanging them on a tree\u00a0\u2013 until her mother sends her to therapy. Reggie clings to the belief that George visits her, but she is starting to lie to cover this up. At the start of Season 2, the family begins to break apart as Joy and Clancy divorce. All of the main characters have issues with their life after death, but they cope with it in different ways: Mason (Callum Blue) resorts to alcohol and drugs; Daisy (Laura Harris) puts on a veneer of perkiness; and Roxy (Jasmine Guy) is physically and verbally aggressive. Rube (Mandy Patinkin) and George are more straightforward about their sadness."

        "content": "Georgia \"George\" Lass (Ellen Muth): (1985\u20132003) The show's protagonist, an 18-year-old college dropout. In addition to being a grim reaper she has a day job at Happy Time Temporary Services, under the assumed name \"Millie Hagen.\" She was killed on June 27, 2003, when a toilet seat from the de-orbiting Mir space station fell on her. Because of this, she is known among the reapers as \"Toilet Seat Girl,\" a fact which earns her instant recognition/respect for dying in such a bizarre way. Rube John Sofer (Mandy Patinkin): (1876 \u2013 c. 1926) The head of the group of reapers. He is responsible for passing out reaping assignments, nearly always on yellow post-it notes. He becomes a father figure for George (whom he calls \"Peanut\") in her grim-reaping afterlife, and had a daughter named Rose (\"Rosie\"), whom he had also called \"Peanut\". The manner of his death was not revealed, but in one episode his name and picture are seen on an old \"Wanted\" poster alleging that he was a bank robber. Because of this, it is believed that he died at the hands of the police (i.e. shoot-out or execution). He looks the same as he did while alive, possibly because his time of death was nearly one hundred years earlier and everyone who could possibly identify him has died, including his daughter Rosie (Rose Anne Sofer, born March 19, 1925; lived at 243 Georgian Lane, Englewood, New Jersey) and his Czechoslovakian wife Lucy Sonia Sofer (n\u00e9e Debrowski), born in 1901. Mason (Callum Blue): (1939\u20131966) A British drug addict, alcoholic and thief, but a likable person. He acts as an \"older brother\" figure to George, and is attracted to Daisy. He is originally from London, and died in 1966 by drilling a hole in his head to achieve a \"permanent high\". He's considered the least responsible of \"Rube's Post-it Crew\" and often makes gaffes, cuts his reaps close, or is drunk or high much of the time. Roxy Harvey (Jasmine Guy): (before 1960\u20131982) A strong-willed, sassy, independent woman. Her day job is initially as a meter maid, but she later becomes a police officer. She was strangled to death by a jealous roommate in 1982 with leg warmers, which Roxy had invented. Although she is generally seen as tough and no-nonsense, she has a softer side, shown in \"Reapercussions\" after saving the life of J. H. Arnold. Betty Rhomer (Rebecca Gayheart): (1899\u20131926) A confident, well-adjusted reaper in the first five episodes. She keeps Polaroids of each of the souls she reaps, in department store shopping bags organized by personality type. She refers to this as her signature, as a way to separate herself from \"the whole cloak and sickle thing.\" George begins to bond with her early in the first season, but she \"hitches a ride\" into the afterlife with one of the souls George had reaped and is never seen again. She died in 1926 while cliff-diving with her fianc\u00e9. In a similar fashion to the reaping of George, though Rube did not personally reap Betty, he did collect her soul, as shown in the season 1 episode \"Reaping Havoc\". (Though she refers later to having been alive in 1927, that is presumably an error in her memory since we are shown her tombstone.) Daisy Adair (Laura Harris): (before 1915\u20131938) A spoiled actress who often tells stories about her (alleged) sexual escapades with classic film stars. She died on December 13, 1938, of asphyxiation/smoke inhalation in Marietta, Georgia, though she originally claimed this occurred on the set of Gone with the Wind. Her last thought before she died was, \"Why has no one ever loved me?\" Daisy is sent from New York City to Seattle in episode six as a replacement when Betty leaves. She is traumatically affected by the violent deaths of defenseless women by abusive men, and although Roxy yelled at her for tampering with a crime scene after such a reap, Daisy then revealed to Mason that she had a sister who (presumably) died that way. At the end of Season 2, Daisy begins to acquire a reputation as a \"bad luck charm\" when Ray accuses her of killing people. When Ray's soul is transformed into a graveling, she enigmatically states in that and the next episode that she has \"seen it before\" and that it's \"happening again.\" Daisy is recognized in the last episode by an elderly man in Der Waffle Haus while she is dressed as a police officer for Halloween; as stated in that episode, on Halloween, all reapers look as they did when alive."

Due to her eccentric, seemingly pathological way of grieving her sister's death, Reggie is placed in psychiatric therapy. Joy Lass (Cynthia Stevenson): George's mother. She is a Virgo who has a pathological fear of balloons and who hates the word 'moist' because she thinks \"it sounds pornographic\". She likes to have order, rules, and control in her life.  Other characters in the show, such as Joy's own mother, believe that her obsession with control is how she copes with denial of her own out-of-control life, her daughter George's death, her younger daughter's rather unconventional style of grieving over George's death, and her divorce from her husband. In the episode where her mother comes to visit, however, it becomes clear that Joy's problems stem more from the chaotic lifestyle and abandonment issues of her own childhood. Clancy Lass (Greg Kean): George's father. He is an English Professor at the University of Washington. His relationship with Joy begins to deteriorate seriously after George's death. He has an affair with one of his Shakespeare-class students (A.J. Cook), which becomes the final death knell to the marriage. In the Pilot it was suggested, by an overly-long hug, that his affair was with a young man but this homosexual thread was dropped and the student confirmed to be female in later episodes."

        "content": "In the world of Dead Like Me, grim reapers do not wear black cloaks or carry scythes (cloaks and scythes are only featured during the opening credits, for humorous effect), but their role remains traditional: they remove the souls of the living shortly before death and escort them into their afterlife. One becomes a reaper by being the last soul collected when one's own reaper meets his or her secret quota. In the series, Death has a list of who is scheduled to die and when. This list is delivered to the head of each group by a shadowy figure (when the delivery is made to Rube's apartment; it is shown that the delivery is made by an actual shadow, with the list of names becoming corporeal only when it is delivered). The head of each group then gives each reaper a non-transferable assignment to collect a particular soul or souls. Completing that assignment is often difficult for the reapers, who receive only the first (and sometimes middle) initial and last name of the person about to die, the location, and estimated time of death (ETD). If a reaper refuses to take a soul at their place of death and the person somehow survives their appointed time, the soul will \"wither and die and rot inside\" them. If a reaper does not take a soul and the person does die, the soul remains trapped in the body and is subject to extremely traumatic experiences such as witnessing the autopsy of their own body. Deaths can be at least temporarily postponed without risk to the soul's well-being by interfering well in advance of the time of death; thus reapers would not be interfering with the events that lead to the death. However, this may have unintended consequences, such as other people dying because of actions taken by the person who should have died. Reapers have a physical body and may interact with the living and the dead. Besides collecting souls, reapers have powers to remain ageless, heal extremely quickly (George once severed her middle finger, but was able to reattach it by just putting it back in place, while Mason has sustained what should have been fatal damage on multiple occasions, such as being shot and hit by a car), drink alcohol without suffering a hangover (see \"Gravelings\"), and forcibly pull a soul from a living body and put it back (as seen done by Roxy in Episode 9 \"Sunday Mornings\"). When seen by the living, reapers' physical appearances are different from when they were alive to those who knew them, except on Halloween when the living see them as they were in life, and fellow reapers always see their original appearances. Although George is seen by her family and Delores as \"Millie,\" Rube's image was recognizable by a records clerk in a wanted poster seen while Rube and the clerk were doing some research into his past life. Laura Boddington portrays lead character George's undead appearance in the TV series, with Jennifer Rae Westley playing her in the later film. The passage into the afterlife is shown as a brightly lit scene towards which the newly deceased is drawn. The portal is unique to each soul: for a child, it may be a wonderful carnival, but for a yoga master, it may be a Deva beckoning from within a Divine Lotus. Souls cannot be forced to enter the portals, so part of the reapers' job is to convince them to do so. Groups of reapers are organized into \"divisions\" according to various causes of death. Generally, reapers are assigned to a division based upon their own cause of death; Mason tells George in a deleted scene that most of the members of the Plague Division died because of the Plague. In addition to Rube's \"external influence\" team, the three other divisions mentioned in the series are Circulatory Systems Division, the very uneventful and bored reapers of the Plague Division (who spend much of their time playing bocce ball) and the Natural Causes (Old Age) Division mentioned in the 27th and 28th episodes (according to the running order). (In the pilot episode, the viewer is led to believe that the Plague Division members have been reapers for centuries and will be unable to meet their quota, as plague deaths have become so rare.) While the members of Rube's team of reapers are instructed to never reap animals, George (and Reggie) do meet a child reaper who reaps the souls of animals \u2014 suggesting that there may be a fourth division that exists for this purpose. The teams are organized into jurisdictions of geographical areas, with several teams associated with different causes of death operating within one area. It is not known how much geographical area a single division covers, but the reapers in the series seem to cover only a limited area in Seattle and King County, Washington; with reaper Daisy Adair transferring from the SoHo area of New York City."

        "content": "In the show, reapers do not actually kill the living. Instead, deaths are arranged by \"gravelings\". Gravelings are mischievous gremlin-like creatures that cause the accidents and mishaps (in the form of Rube Goldberg machine scenarios) that kill people. The living generally cannot see them, though in the episode \"Reaper Madness\", a schizophrenic was able to, although Rube refused to believe that was possible. Reapers can see and interact with them to some extent: Daisy once shushed a graveling; Rube yelled, \"Get outta here!\" once when seeing gravelings desecrating a cemetery statue; and George once chased several angry gravelings around her apartment. Although gravelings seem to be self-aware and recognize the reapers, they do not communicate verbally with them, and talk to each other in a hushed and unintelligible babble; other times they growl or hiss. According to the episode \"Vacation\", gravelings are given one day off every few years. Despite the holiday, most reapers are disturbed by their lack of manners and behavior. During this time they display the odd habit of stacking objects into precarious, humanoid towers. In the episode \"Reapercussions\" (Season 1 Episode 4), it is noted that if a reaper interferes with and prevents a scheduled death, a \"hunting season\" will be declared by the gravelings, who will pester the reaper until that soul is taken and order is restored. Some of the reapers, including George, Roxy, Mason, and Daisy, are plagued by the wrath of gravelings throughout the series. A graveling rose from the body of Ray in \"Forget Me Not\" (Season 2, Episode 12) following his murder at the hands of a reaper. This graveling retained Ray's mind or some other connection to his life, as it stayed close to Daisy and George's house (where Ray was killed) and expressed anger toward Daisy and Mason for Ray's death. It was also responsible for an unscheduled death at one of Daisy's reaps. Later, in the episode \"Always\" (Season 2 Episode 14), the graveling was reaped by George, upon which it turned to dust. In the episode \"The Shallow End\" (Season 2, Episode 4) a child George in a flashback sees gravelings as she sinks into a swimming pool, with the gravelings appearing to hesitate from claiming her life (although it is not clear whether she actually saw the gravelings), and again in \"Haunted\" (Season 2, Episode 15) George recalls a Halloween afternoon when as a young girl she saw a graveling scurrying around in the background behind a man who, after she became a reaper, she realizes is a serial killer."

        "content": "The Prince of Egypt is a 1998 American animated musical drama film produced by DreamWorks Animation and released by DreamWorks Pictures. The first feature film from DreamWorks to be traditionally animated, it is an adaptation of the Book of Exodus and follows the life of Moses from being a prince of Egypt to his ultimate destiny to lead the Jews out of Egypt. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells (in Chapman and Hickner's feature directorial debuts), the film features songs written by Stephen Schwartz and a score composed by Hans Zimmer. The voice cast consists of Val Kilmer in a dual role, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, and Martin Short. Jeffrey Katzenberg had frequently suggested an animated adaptation of the 1956 film The Ten Commandments while working for The Walt Disney Company, and he decided to put the idea into production after co-founding DreamWorks Pictures in 1994. To make this inaugural project, DreamWorks employed artists who had worked for Walt Disney Feature Animation and Amblimation, totaling a crew of 350 people from 34 different countries. The film has a blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery, created using software from Toon Boom Animation and Silicon Graphics. The film was released in theaters on December 18, 1998, and on home video on September 14, 1999. Reviews were generally positive; critics particularly praised the visuals, songs, and voice acting. The film grossed $218 million worldwide in theaters, which made it the most successful non-Disney animated feature at the time. The film's success led to the direct-to-video prequel and spin-off Joseph: King of Dreams (2000), and a stage musical adaptation which opened in London's West End in 2020. The song \"When You Believe\" became a commercially successful single in a pop version performed by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and went on to win Best Original Song at the 71st Academy Awards, making it the first animated film independently outside of Disney and Pixar films, as well as the first Dreamworks Animation film to receive two nominations and win one by the Academy Awards, succeeded by Shrek (2001) and Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005)."

        "content": "In Ancient Egypt, the enslaved Hebrew people pray to God for deliverance. Pharaoh Seti, fearing that the growing numbers of Hebrew slaves could lead to rebellion, orders a mass infanticide of all newborn Hebrew boys. Fearing for her newborn son's safety, Yocheved and her other two children, Miriam and Aaron, rush to the Nile River, where she places the infant in a basket on the water, after bidding him farewell with a final lullaby. Miriam follows the basket as it sails to the Pharaoh's palace and witnesses her baby brother safely adopted by Seti's wife, Queen Tuya, who names him Moses. Before leaving, Miriam prays that Moses will come back to them and set their people free. Years later, Moses and his adoptive brother Rameses, heir to the throne of Egypt, are scolded by Seti for accidentally destroying a temple during a chariot race. After Moses suggests that Rameses be given the opportunity to prove his responsibility, Seti names Rameses Prince Regent and gives him authority over Egypt's temples. As a tribute, high priests Hotep and Huy offer Rameses a beautiful but rebellious young Midianite woman, Tzipporah. Rameses, uninterested in her stubbornness, gives Tzipporah to Moses instead and appoints him Royal Chief Architect. During the banquet, Moses humiliates Tzipporah by letting her fall into a pond after she refuses to submit, appeasing the crowd but disappointing Tuya. Later that night, Moses follows Tzipporah as she escapes from the palace, and runs into the now-adult Miriam and Aaron, whom he does not recognize. He refuses to  believe their claims and opts to have them arrested until Miriam sings their mother's lullaby, triggering Moses's memory. He flees in denial, but learns the truth of Seti's genocide from a nightmare, then from Seti himself, who disturbs Moses by claiming the Hebrews were \"only slaves\". The next day, Moses tries to stop an Egyptian slave driver from flogging an elderly Hebrew slave, accidentally pushing the guard to his death. Horrified and ashamed, Moses flees into the desert in exile, despite Rameses's pleas that he stay. Arriving at an oasis, Moses defends three young girls from brigands, only to find out their older sister is Tzipporah. Moses is welcomed by Jethro, Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian. Over time, Moses becomes a shepherd, falls in love with Tzipporah, marries her, and grows adjusted to life in Midian. One day, while chasing a stray lamb, Moses discovers a burning bush, through which God tells him to return to Egypt and guide the Hebrews to freedom. God bestows Moses's shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. When Moses tells Tzipporah of his task, she decides to join him. Arriving in Egypt, Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh with a wife and son. Moses requests the Hebrews' release and transforms his staff into a snake to demonstrate God's power. Hotep and Huy deceptively recreate this transformation, only to have their snakes eaten by Moses's. Not wanting to have his actions cause the empire's collapse and feeling betrayed by Moses's motives for his return, Rameses doubles the Hebrews' workload. The Hebrews, including Aaron, blame Moses for their increased workload, disheartening Moses. However, Miriam inspires Moses to persevere. Moses casts the first of the Ten Plagues of Egypt, turning the water of the Nile into blood, but Rameses remains unmoved. Moses inflicts eight more plagues onto Egypt, but still Rameses refuses to relent, vowing never to release the Hebrews, even after banishing Hotep and Huy from the palace for their deceptions. Disheartened, Moses prepares the Hebrews for the tenth plague, instructing them to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood. That night, the final plague kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, including Rameses's son, while sparing those of the Hebrews. Grief-stricken, Rameses gives the Hebrews permission to leave. After leaving the palace, Moses collapses in grief at the pain he has caused his brother and Egypt. The following morning, Moses, Miriam, Aaron and Tzipporah lead the Hebrews out of Egypt. At the Red Sea, the Hebrews discover that a vengeful Rameses is pursuing them with his army, intent on killing them. However, a pillar of fire blocks the army's way, while Moses uses his staff to part the sea. The Hebrews cross the open sea bottom; the fire vanishes and the army gives chase, but the sea closes over and drowns the Egyptian soldiers, sparing Rameses alone. Moses sadly bids his brother farewell and leads the Hebrews to Mount Sinai, where he receives the Ten Commandments."

While working for the Walt Disney Company, Katzenberg suggested this idea to Michael Eisner, but he refused. The idea for the film was brought back at the formation of DreamWorks Pictures in 1994, when Katzenberg's partners, Amblin Entertainment founder Steven Spielberg, and music producer David Geffen, were meeting in Spielberg's living room. Katzenberg recalls that Spielberg looked at him during the meeting and said, \"You ought to do The Ten Commandments.\" The Prince of Egypt was \"written\" throughout the story process. Beginning with a starting outline, story supervisors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook led a team of fourteen storyboard artists and writers as they sketched out the entire film\u00a0\u2014 sequence by sequence. Once the storyboards were approved, they were put into the Avid Media Composer digital editing system by editor Nick Fletcher to create a \"story reel\" or animatic. The story reel allowed the filmmakers to view and edit the entire film in continuity before production began, and also helped the layout and animation departments understand what is happening in each sequence of the film.  After casting of the voice talent concluded, dialogue recording sessions began. For the film, the actors record individually in a studio under guidance by one of the three directors. The voice tracks were to become the primary aspect as to which the animators built their performances. Because DreamWorks was concerned about theological accuracy, Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to call in Biblical scholars, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim theologians, and Arab American leaders to help his film be more accurate and faithful to the original story. After previewing the developing film, all these leaders noted that the studio executives listened and responded to their ideas, and praised the studio for reaching out for comment from outside sources."

        "content": "Art directors Kathy Altieri and Richard Chavez and production designer Darek Gogol led a team of nine visual development artists in setting a visual style for the film that was representative of the time, the scale and the architectural style of Ancient Egypt. Part of the process also included the research and collection of artwork from various artists, as well as taking part in trips such as a two-week journey across Egypt by the filmmakers before the film's production began. Character designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nico Marlet worked on setting the design and overall look of the characters. Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters, the team of character designers worked on designs that had a more realistic feel than the usual animated characters up to that time. Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments. The backgrounds department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts. Within the film, approximately 934 hand-painted backgrounds were created. The animation team for The Prince of Egypt, including 350 artists from 34 different nations, was primarily recruited both from Walt Disney Feature Animation, which had fallen under Katzenberg's auspices while at the Walt Disney Company, and from Amblimation, a defunct division of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. As at Disney's, character animators were grouped into teams by character: for example, Kristof Serrand, as the supervising animator of Older Moses, set the acting style of the character and assigned scenes to his team. Consideration was given to depicting the ethnicities of the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and Nubians properly. There are 1,192 scenes in the film, and 1,180 contain work done by the special effects department, which animates everything in an animated scene which is not a character: blowing wind, dust, rainwater, shadows, etc. A blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery was used in the depictions of the ten plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. The characters were animated with the digital paint software Animo by Cambridge Animation (now merged with Toon Boom Technologies), and the compositing of the 2D and 3D elements was done using the \"Exposure Tool\", a digital solution developed for Alias Research by Silicon Graphics. Additional final line animation was outsourced to Bardel Entertainment, Fox Animation Studios and Heart of Texas Productions."

The songs were either voiced over by professional singers, such as Salisbury Cathedral Choir, or sung by the film's voice actors, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Ofra Haza.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised the film in his review saying, \"The Prince of Egypt is one of the best-looking animated films ever made. It employs computer-generated animation as an aid to traditional techniques, rather than as a substitute for them, and we sense the touch of human artists in the vision behind the Egyptian monuments, the lonely desert vistas, the thrill of the chariot race, the personalities of the characters. This is a film that shows animation growing up and embracing more complex themes, instead of chaining itself in the category of children's entertainment.\" Richard Corliss of Time magazine gave a negative review of the film saying, \"The film lacks creative exuberance, any side pockets of joy.\" Stephen Hunter from The Washington Post praised the film saying, \"The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable, more humanly knowable.\" Lisa Alspector from the Chicago Reader praised the film and wrote, \"The blend of animation techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly, while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent.\" Houston Chronicle Jeff Millar reviewed by saying, \"The handsomely animated Prince of Egypt is an amalgam of Hollywood biblical epic, Broadway supermusical and nice Sunday school lesson.\" James Berardinelli from Reelviews highly praised the film saying, \"The animation in The Prince of Egypt is truly top-notch, and is easily a match for anything Disney has turned out in the last decade\", and also wrote \"this impressive achievement uncovers yet another chink in Disney's once-impregnable animation armor.\" Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave a somewhat negative review and wrote, \"Prince of Egypt is spectacular but takes itself too seriously.\" MovieGuide also reviewed the film favorably, saying that \"The Prince of Egypt takes animated movies to a new level of entertainment. Magnificent art, music, story, and realization combine to make The Prince of Egypt one of the most entertaining masterpieces of all time.\" When the film reached its 20th anniversary, SyFy made a retrospective review of The Prince of Egypt, calling it the greatest animated film of all time, predominantly due to its voice cast, animation, characters, cinematography, and most importantly, its musical score. The film is also regarded as one of the best Biblical film adaptations of all time, alongside films like The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and The Passion of the Christ."

The rights were moved to Universal Pictures in 2018 after the buyout of DreamWorks Animation by Comcast/NBCUniversal. During the production of The Prince of Egypt, DreamWorks had hoped that the film would be a box office success, so they had been pressuring employees to work on the film, but if they were unable to work on the film, they were then forced to work on Shrek, which was expected to flop. Despite this, Shrek was the victor in the box office, as The Prince of Egypt was only a moderate success."

        "content": "Eight years after Chucky's second demise, the Play Pals company has recovered from the bad publicity of Chucky's murder sprees and resumes manufacturing Good Guy dolls. The company restores the abandoned factory.  A splash of blood from Chucky's corpse is inadvertently mixed in with the plastic being used to produce the dolls, reviving him in a new body. Chucky is given to Play Pals CEO Mr. Sullivan. Chucky tortures and strangles him to death with a yo-yo, then uses computer records to locate Andy Barclay. Now aged 16, Andy has been sent to Kent Military Academy after failing to cope in several foster homes. Colonel Cochrane, the school's commandant, begrudgingly enrolls Andy but advises him to forget his \"fantasies\" about the doll. Andy befriends cadets Harold Aubrey Whitehurst; Ronald Tyler, an 8-year-old cadet he met while waiting for a haircut at Kent; and Kristin DeSilva, for whom he develops romantic feelings. He also meets Brett C. Shelton, a sadistic lieutenant colonel who routinely bullies the cadets. Shortly after Andy arrives, Tyler is asked to deliver a package to his room. Tyler realizes that the package contains a Good Guy doll and takes it to the cellar to open it, only to have Chucky burst free from the package. Chucky is incensed to find Tyler instead of Andy, but remembering that he can possess the first person who learns his true identity, tells Tyler his secret. Before Chucky can enact the ritual, Cochrane interrupts them and confiscates the doll, throwing it into a garbage truck. However, Chucky escapes by luring the driver into the truck's compactor and crushing him. That night, Chucky attacks Andy and tells him his plans for taking over Tyler's body instead of his. Before Andy can fight back, Shelton comes in and takes the doll from him. Andy then sneaks into Shelton's room to recover it but Sheldon awakens to confront him, only to find that Chucky has vanished. Suspecting the doll was stolen, Sheldon forces all the cadets to do exercises as punishment. Tyler and Chucky play \"hide the soul\" in Cochrane's office, where Chucky attempts to possess Tyler again. However, they are interrupted by DeSilva and fellow cadet Ivers, before Cochrane himself enters a little later. The cadets sneak out undetected, but a knife-wielding Chucky surprises Cochrane, unintentionally shocking him into suffering a fatal heart attack. The next morning, Andy tries to convince Tyler that Chucky is evil, but Tyler refuses to believe him. Meanwhile, Chucky kills the camp barber Sergeant Botnick by slashing his throat with a razor after Botnick tries to give Chucky a haircut. Whitehurst witnesses this and flees. Despite Cochrane's death, the school's annual war games are ordered to proceed as planned, with Andy and Shelton on the same team. However, Chucky has secretly replaced the paint bullets of the Red team with live ammunition. When the simulation begins, Chucky gets Tyler away from his team. Finally realizing that Andy was telling the truth, Tyler stabs Chucky with a pocket knife and flees to find Andy. Chucky then attacks Kristin and holds her hostage, attempting to lure the teams into fighting each other to save her. Chucky forces Andy to exchange Kristin for Tyler.The Blue team shows up and discovers the situation with Chucky, and Shelton thinks that Andy had gone awol to join the Red team, without realizing there is a bigger situation at hand. Suddenly, the Red team descends upon the area and obliviously opens fire with their live rounds; Shelton is killed in the crossfire. Tyler escapes amidst the chaos, but before giving chase, Chucky tosses a fragmentation grenade at the quarrelling cadets. Whitehurst leaps on top of the grenade and sacrifices himself to save the others. Andy and Kristin pursue Chucky and Tyler into a haunted house roller-coaster at a nearby carnival. Chucky kills a security guard, kidnaps Tyler, and shoots Kristin in the leg, leaving Andy to fight Chucky alone. When Tyler is inadvertently knocked out, Chucky seizes the opportunity to possess him, but Andy intervenes by shooting Chucky several times. Enraged, Chucky attempts to strangle Andy, but he uses Tyler's knife to cut off Chucky's hand. Chucky is thrown into a giant metal fan below and is shredded to pieces, killing him. Afterwards, the police take Andy into custody and Kristin is rushed to the hospital."

        "content": "Universal Studios had Don Mancini begin writing the third installment for the series before Child's Play 2 was released, causing pressure to him to draft a storyline on such a tight schedule. The film was formally greenlit after the successful release of its predecessor with a release date nine months away. Mancini initially wanted to introduce the concept of \"multiple Chuckys\" in the movie, but due to budget constraints the idea was eventually scrapped. Mancini later used this concept for the 2017 sequel Cult of Chucky. It also was intended to open with a scene of a security guard portrayed by John Ritter frightening off a group of trespassing children at the Good Guys factory by telling them scary stories about Chucky. After Mancini decided to make Andy Barclay 16 years old, he considered recasting the role with Jonathan Brandis before hiring Justin Whalin. Before Jack Bender became director, Mancini wanted to hire Peter Jackson. Principal photography began on February 4, 1991, at the Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri. Further filming took place in California at Los Angeles and the Universal Studios Lot in Universal City. The carnival scenes were filmed in Valencia, California. The puppeteers made the doll speak using computer technology to control its mouth movements to align with Dourif's prerecorded dialogue. N. Brock Winkless IV returned to work as one of Chucky's puppeteers."

On Metacritic it has a score of 27% based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Chris Hicks of the Deseret News called it \"perverse\" and criticized the film's plot.  Caryn James of The New York Times called the Chucky doll \"an impressive technological achievement\" but said the film \"misses the sharpness and dark humor\" of the original film.  Variety called it a \"noisy, mindless sequel\" with good acting. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post wrote, \"Chucky himself is an animatronic delight, but one suspects the film's energies and budget have all been devoted to what is essentially a one-trick pony.\"  Stephen Wigle of The Baltimore Sun called it \"fun for any fan of the slasher genre\". Series creator Don Mancini said that this was his least favorite entry in the series, adding that he ran out of ideas after the second film. He elaborated further in 2013 stating that he was not pleased with the casting, feeling Jeremy Sylvers was too old for the role of Tyler and Dakin Matthews was not the \"R. Lee Ermey\" archetype he was looking for in Colonel Cochrane. Mancini would not make another entry in the Chucky series until seven years later, with Bride of Chucky. In a 2017 interview, director Jack Bender also dismissed the film by calling it \"kinda silly\"."

        "content": "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is a 2000 American romantic comedy film directed by Brian Levant, written by Jim Cash, Harry Elfont, Deborah Kaplan, and Jack Epps, Jr., and is the prequel to Levant's The Flintstones (1994), based on the 1960\u201366 animated television series of the same name. It is set before the events of both the series and the first film, showing how Fred and Barney meet Wilma and Betty. The title is a play on the Elvis Presley song, Viva Las Vegas, also used as the title of an MGM musical film. None of the original cast from the first film reprise their roles in this film. The film stars Mark Addy as Fred Flintstone, Stephen Baldwin as Barney Rubble, Kristen Johnston as Wilma Slaghoople, and Jane Krakowski as Betty O'Shale, replacing John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, and Rosie O'Donnell respectively. The supporting cast features Joan Collins, Thomas Gibson, Harvey Korman (in his final film performance), and Alan Cumming as both The Great Gazoo and Mick Jagged, a parody of Mick Jagger. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who created the original cartoon series, make cameo appearances at the end of the film. The film was a box office bomb, grossing only $59.5 million against its $83 million budget. Like its predecessor, Viva Rock Vegas also received negative reviews, though some critics considered it an improvement over the first film. It is considered to the be one of the worst films ever made. As a result of this, Hanna-Barbera was merged into Warner Bros. Animation in 2001."

        "content": "Young bachelors and best friends Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble have recently qualified as crane operators at Slate & Company. Soon to be employed, now they want dates, and a little green alien The Great Gazoo, exiled to Earth by his species, offers to help, although only they can see him. Meanwhile, Wilma Slaghoople wants a normal life and activities, like bowling, though her controlling mother Pearl wants her to marry smooth casino-owner Chip Rockefeller.  After Wilma angrily escapes to Bronto King in Bedrock, waitress Betty O'Shale, mistaking her as \"caveless\", offers to share her apartment and gets her a job. Smitten with the waitresses, the two men invite them to a carnival, with Fred dating Betty and Barney taking Wilma. However, the couples do not really connect until both men switch dates. Fred wins an egg in a carnival game which hatches into a baby dinosaur, which he names \"Dino\". Wilma invites her new friends home to a birthday party for her father, Colonel Slaghoople, where all are shocked by her wealth. Intending to propose, Fred changes his mind after meeting Chip, who berates his low-level job at Slate & Company. Pearl dislikes the three new friends, but the Colonel, glad for Wilma's happiness, accepts them and privately gives Wilma a valuable pearl necklace that his great-grandmother once wore. After the boys disgrace themselves at dinner, Wilma nevertheless proclaims her pride and follows them out. Chip congratulates Fred on attracting Wilma, apologizes for mocking Fred's job, and invites the group to his Rock Vegas resort as a peace offering. However, unbeknownst to the group, Chip plots to hope Fred gambles so Wilma dumps him, whereas Fred sees it as a chance to win big so he can impress Wilma with money like Chip's. Gangsters Big Rocko and Little Rocko visit Chip and his girlfriend Roxie to collect a lot of money that Chip owes their boss. Gazoo overhears Chip claiming his upcoming marriage to Wilma will allow him to access the Slaghoople fortune. Considering that plan creditable, the gangsters agree to suspend collections until after the wedding. When Barney tries to keep Fred from high-stakes poker, Chip sends Roxie to seduce and escort Barney to an all-you-can-eat buffet. Chip keeps Fred gambling to miss his dinner date with the others. Betty sees Barney wipe cream from Roxie's chest, misinterpreting the move as a pass. Mick Jagged comforts the weeping girl, and they go on a date. Wilma breaks up with Fred over not spending any time with her. Chip warns her of burglaries and arranges that Fred loses everything before slipping Wilma's pearls in Fred's pocket and asking him to empty them. Hotel security arrests Fred for robbery, but when Barney protests that Fred is incapable of robbery and would not even be able to crack his own knuckles without help, Chip accuses Barney of being Fred's accomplice and also has him arrested. Angered that the two stole from her, Wilma goes back to Chip. Gazoo visits the men in prison, revealing that Chip is severely indebted to the mob and hopes to solve both his problems by framing Fred for the robbery and marrying Wilma to get the Slaghooples' money. Barney slips through the bars, steals the keys, and unlocks the cell. Disguised in drag as dancers, they accidentally run into Jagged's dressing room. Barney tells Betty he loves her, and they reconcile after the misunderstanding involving Roxie at the buffet is cleared up, and Barney knocks out Jagged. Fred plans to disguise himself as Jagged in an attempt to reconcile with Wilma. Meanwhile, in the audience, Chip proposes to an unresponsive Wilma. Fred then comes on stage disguised as Jagged and briefly sings to Wilma, apologizing for his behavior earlier before proposing to her. Knowing that she still loves Fred, Wilma happily accepts, rejecting Chip, and they marry in the Rock Vegas Chapel of Love. After the pastor proclaims them husband and wife, everyone sings \"Meet the Flintstones\". When Jagged sings \"Viva Rock Vegas\" at a party, Betty catches Wilma's tossed bouquet and kisses Barney. The newlyweds drive away with Dino and Gazoo to goodbye waves from their friends, family, and even a handcuffed Chip and Roxie."

In the episode, George and Renee Corliss (played by Paul Dooley and Rita Moreno), were introduced as the Girls' neighbors, a middle-aged couple suffering from empty nest syndrome. Their teenage daughter Jenny (Jane Harnick), who had left for college, and Renee's brother Chuck (Geoffrey Lewis), also appeared. The Corlisses also had an annoying neighbor played by David Leisure (although in this version his character was named Oliver). Rita Moreno later criticized the Empty Nest pilot, calling it a \"very, very bad show.\" She explained that the script desperately needed rewrites from creator Susan Harris, but she was very sick the week of shooting so it was left to other writers to fix. According to Moreno, \"every day they kept changing my character, to the extent that by the time we got to do it in front of an audience I couldn't remember Line 1 because the attitudes had changed so many times. That was the most embarrassing experience...we must have done, I would guess, about 15 takes in front of an audience.\" Ultimately, the series did not go ahead as planned and the premise was later extensively revamped with a new cast before Empty Nest debuted in 1988. The set of the Corlisses' house, however, was exactly the same as the one that later became the Weston residence."

        "content": "The show revolved around middle-aged Miami pediatrician Dr. Harry Weston (Richard Mulligan), whose life was turned upside down when his wife, Libby (Judith-Marie Bergan), died and two of his adult daughters moved back into the family home. Early episodes established that the Golden Girls characters were neighbors of the Westons. Bea Arthur, Rue McClanahan, Betty White and Estelle Getty all guest-starred as their Golden Girls characters, and Mulligan appeared occasionally on The Golden Girls. Eldest daughter Carol (Dinah Manoff) was a neurotic, high-strung recent divorc\u00e9e, while middle daughter Barbara (Kristy McNichol) was a tough undercover police officer. The two sisters frequently bickered and vied for the attention of their father, whom they called \"Daddy.\" (Harry occasionally expressed regret at never having had a son.) The Westons' large dog Dreyfuss was also prominently featured. In 1992, McNichol left the show and the youngest Weston daughter, Emily (Lisa Rieffel), joined the cast. Her character had not been seen before, but had been mentioned as being away at college. Rieffel left after one season, and for the show's final two seasons only Carol remained of the Weston children. McNichol returned for the series finale in 1995. Another main character was the Westons' neighbor and best friend, Charley Dietz (David Leisure), a womanizing cruise ship employee who frequently barged into the house unannounced to borrow food or make sexist comments. Charley had a father-son relationship with Harry and a love-hate relationship with Carol. Harry's job was another major focus for the show. For the first five seasons he worked at a hospital, where he was assisted by wisecracking Southern nurse Laverne (Park Overall). Laverne and Harry are good friends. The origin of Laverne and Harry becoming best friends was when they met in a sandwich shop and started an argument over who would get the last Samms Sammich. The \u201cSamms Sammich\u201d is a sandwich that consists of Turkey, Roast Beef, Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Grilled Chicken, Veggie Patty, Tuna, Meatballs and Fake Crab Meat. The Samms Sammich became the number one selling sandwich in Tacoma after the airing of this episode. In season six Harry retired, eventually going to work for a struggling inner-city medical clinic run by the tough-talking Dr. Maxine Douglas (Marsha Warfield). Laverne, having been fired by Dr. Weston's replacement, came to work there as well. Other characters who later joined the cast were Carol's boyfriend, Patrick (Paul Provenza), an artist who was almost as eccentric as she. Patrick convinced the Westons to let him use their empty garage as his new painting studio and, when his relationship with Carol became serious, he eventually moved in altogether. Their romantic bliss was short-lived, as they broke up at the beginning of season six. However, this was not before Carol became pregnant with Patrick's child; their son, Scotty, was born in November 1993, and Carol chose to raise the baby on her own. Estelle Getty reprised her Golden Girls character Sophia Petrillo during Empty Nests final two seasons (after the cancellation of The Golden Palace). It was explained that Sophia had moved back into the nearby Shady Pines retirement home."

Don Rafael Montero, the corrupt governor of the region, sets a trap for Zorro at a public execution of three innocent peasants. Zorro stops the execution, and Montero's soldiers are thwarted by two young brothers, Alejandro and Joaquin Murrieta. Zorro fights the remaining Spanish soldiers and thanks the Murrieta brothers by giving Joaquin a silver medallion. Don Montero suspects de la Vega of being Zorro and attempts to arrest him at his home. A sword fight begins, a fire breaks out, and de la Vega's wife Esperanza, whom Montero was in love with, is shot and killed during the ensuing scuffle. While Diego's home burns, Montero takes his infant daughter, Elena, as his own before sending de la Vega to prison and returning to Spain. Twenty years later, Alejandro and Joaquin are bandits, running a scam with Three-Fingered Jack to collect the bounty on their heads and steal a strongbox. Before they can escape with the money, they are caught by Captain Harrison Love, Montero's right-hand man. Jack and Joaquin are captured while Alejandro escapes, and Joaquin shoots himself rather than be executed by Captain Love. Love then beheads Joaquin's corpse and takes the head. Montero returns to California as a civilian, alongside Elena, who has grown into a beautiful woman and resembles her late mother. Montero's reappearance motivates de la Vega to escape from prison. He encounters Alejandro Murietta getting drunk and recognizes the silver medallion he gave his brother as a boy. De la Vega learns Murietta is on a similar quest for vengeance on Captain Love for his brother's death, and agrees to make Alejandro his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, recruiting him to be the new Zorro. Alejandro agrees to undergo de la Vega's training regimen in Zorro's secret cave underneath the ruins of his family estate in order to be able to take revenge. While still being trained, Alejandro steals a black stallion resembling Zorro's steed Tornado from the local garrison. De la Vega scolds Alejandro, claiming that Zorro was a servant of the people, not a thief and adventurer. He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero's trust instead. Alejandro poses as a visiting nobleman named Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garc\u00eda, with de la Vega as his servant \"Bernardo\", and attends a party at Montero's hacienda. At the party, he gains Elena's admiration and enough of Montero's trust to be invited to a secret meeting where several other noblemen are present. Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons and proclaim it as an independent republic by buying it from General Santa Anna, who needs money for the upcoming Mexican\u2013American War. Montero takes Alejandro and the noblemen to a secret gold mine known as \"El Dorado\", where peasants and prisoners are used for slave labor. Montero plans to buy California from Santa Anna using gold mined from Santa Anna's own land. De la Vega, as the servant \"Bernardo\", uses this opportunity to become closer to Elena, and learns that Montero told Elena that her mother died in childbirth. While walking in a market, Elena meets the woman who was her nanny who tells Elena her parents' real identity. De la Vega sends Alejandro, now officially wearing the mantle of Zorro, to steal Montero's map leading to the gold mine. Zorro duels Montero, Love, and their guards at the hacienda. When Zorro escapes, Elena attempts to retrieve Montero's map from the swordsman. A brief but erotic sword duel ensues, and Zorro gives her a passionate kiss before he flees. Terrified of Santa Anna's retribution if he discovers that he is being paid with his own gold, Montero, at Love's urging, decides to destroy the mine and kill the workers. De la Vega tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so that de la Vega can reclaim Elena. Alejandro sets off, feeling betrayed by Diego's vendetta. De la Vega corners Montero at the hacienda and reveals his identity, but Montero captures him by threatening to shoot him in front of Elena. As he is taken away, de la Vega tells Elena the name of the flowers, romneya, that she recognized upon her arrival in California, convincing her that he is her father. She releases de la Vega from his cell and they proceed to the mine, where Alejandro and de la Vega respectively defeat and slay Love and Montero, avenging both Joaquin and Esperanza. Elena and Alejandro free the workers before the explosives go off and then find the mortally wounded de la Vega. He makes peace with Alejandro and Elena and gives his blessings for Alejandro to marry his daughter before dying. Some time later, Alejandro and Elena are married, and Alejandro tells stories to their infant son, Joaquin, whom he named after his brother, of his grandfather's heroic deeds and legacy as Zorro."

        "content": "Antonio Banderas as Alejandro Murrieta / Zorro:Banderas was paid $5 million for the role. The character of Alejandro Murrieta was conceived as the fictional brother of the real-life Joaquin Murrieta, making the character either Mexican or Chilean. To prepare for his role, Banderas practiced with the Olympic fencing team in Spain for four months, before studying additional fencing and swordsmanship with Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The three were trained by Bob Anderson during pre-production in Mexico, spending 10 hours a day for two months specifically on fight scenes from the film. \"We used to call him Grumpy Bob on the set, he was such a perfectionist,\" director Martin Campbell reflected. \"He was incredibly inventive, and also refused to treat any of the actors as stars. They would complain about the intensity of the training, but having worked with him there's nobody I'd rather use.\" During interviews for The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Anderson rated Banderas the best natural talent he had worked with. Before Banderas was chosen for the role,  Benicio Del Toro, Andy Garc\u00eda, Marc Anthony, Joaquim de Almeida, and Chayanne were considered. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Tavira portrays a young Alejandro Murrieta. Anthony Hopkins as Don Diego de la Vega / Zorro:Hopkins was cast in December 1996, one month before filming began. Hopkins, known for his dramatic acting, took up the role because of his enthusiasm to be in an action film. For the role of Diego de la Vega, actors Sean Connery and Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1, who died before he could take the role, were also considered. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Elena Montero:The actress signed on in November 1996, when Spielberg saw her performance in the Titanic miniseries and recommended her to Campbell. Despite being a Welsh actress portraying a Spanish character, Zeta-Jones discovered similarities between her \"volatile\" Celtic temper and the Latin temperament of El\u00e9na. Izabella Scorupco, who worked with Campbell on GoldenEye, Judith Godr\u00e8che, Salma Hayek, Shakira and Jennifer Lopez screen tested for the part. Zeta-Jones credits The Mask of Zorro as her breakthrough in entering A-list recognition. Mar\u00eda and M\u00f3nica Fern\u00e1ndez Cruz portray Elena de la Vega (infant). Stuart Wilson as Don Rafael Montero:Armand Assante had initially been cast in the role, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts with The Odyssey. Stuart Wilson, who Campbell previously directed in No Escape, was cast in Assante's place four months after. Actors Sam Shepard, Lance Henriksen, Edward James Olmos, Scott Glenn and Giancarlo Giannini were also considered for the role."

        "content": "In October 1992, TriStar Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment were planning to start production on Zorro the following year, and hired Joel Gross to rewrite the script after they were impressed with his adaptation of The Three Musketeers. At the time, Spielberg was producing Zorro with the potential to direct. Gross completed his rewrite in March 1993, and TriStar entered pre-production, creating early promotion for the film that same month at the ShoWest trade show. By December 1993, Branko Lustig was producing the film with Spielberg, and Mikael Salomon was attached as director. In August 1994, Sean Connery was cast as Don Diego de la Vega, while Salomon stated that the rest of the major cast would be Hispanic or Latino. The first chosen for the role of Zorro in his young version was Andy Garc\u00eda, a fashionable Latin actor at the time. Colombian singer Shakira was also initially considered to play Elena but turned it down due to her limited acting experience (despite having co-starred in the Colombian TV series El Oasis) and poor English skills at the time. Pre-production proceeded even further in August when Salomon compiled test footage for a planned April 1995 start date. Connery and Salomon eventually dropped out, and in September 1995, Robert Rodriguez, fresh from the success of Desperado, signed to direct with Antonio Banderas, who had also starred in Desperado, playing the title role. TriStar and Amblin had been surprised by Rodriguez's low-budget filming techniques for his action films, El Mariachi and Desperado, and shifted away from their initial plans with Salomon to make a big-budget version of Zorro. Spielberg had hoped Rodriguez would start filming in January 1996 for a Christmas release date, but the start date was pushed back to July. The release date was later moved to Easter 1997. Rodriguez pulled out of the film in June 1996 over difficulties coming to terms with TriStar on the budget. The studio projected a range of $35 million, while Rodriguez wanted $45 million. They both attempted to compromise when Rodriguez lowered it to $42 million, but the studio refused and set $41 million as their highest mark. Banderas remained with the production, and Martin Campbell signed on later that month, turning down the chance to direct Tomorrow Never Dies. The finished screenplay would be written by John Eskow, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, based on a story by Elliott, Rossio, and Randall Jahnson."

Production stalled for four days in February when the director, Martin Campbell, was hospitalized for bronchitis. Filming resumed in Tlaxcala, three hours east of Mexico City, where the production crew constructed the Montero hacienda and town set pieces. Sony sent David Foster to join the project as a producer to help fill the void left by Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald, who were busy running DreamWorks. Foster and David S. Ward, who went uncredited, re-wrote some scenes; the troubled production caused The Mask of Zorro to go $10 million over its budget. In December, the producers were frustrated by customs agents when some props and other items, including Zorro's plastic sword, were held for nine days. Rossio and Elliott originally planned to have Don Rafael Montero be introduced by arriving on shore in a boat while sitting on a horse standing in the boat, but the scene was cut for being deemed too expensive. The idea was ultimately revisited by the duo for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. During the post-production phase, Spielberg and Campbell decided that Diego de la Vega's death in the arms of his daughter was too depressing. The ending, where Alejandro and El\u00e9na are happily married with their infant son, was added three months after filming had ended."

The confrontation in the film takes place more than a decade earlier, in 1841. The capture of Murrieta's right-hand man Three-Fingered Jack by Love was also historical; however, the real person was a Mexican named Manuel Garcia rather than an Anglo-American.

There was speculation within the media about whether TriStar changed the date in an attempt to avoid competition with Titanic. In reality Zorro had encountered production problems that extended its shooting schedule. In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment, TriStar's parent company, wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998. The release date was once again pushed back, this time to July 1998, when pick-ups were commissioned. The delay from March to July added $3 million in interest costs. To market The Mask of Zorro, TriStar purchased a 30-second advertising spot at Super Bowl XXXII for $1.3 million. Sony, who had been known for their low-key presence at the ShoWest trade show, showed clips from the film, while actors Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins presented a panel at the conference on May 10, 1998. The studio also attached the film's trailer to prints of Godzilla. Sony launched an official website in June 1998. Internet marketing was an emerging concept in the late-1990s, and Zorro was Sony's first film to use VRML. The Mask of Zorro caught the attention of European Royalty with the film's foreign premieres. Spain's King Juan Carlos I, Queen Sophia, and Princess Elena attended the first Royal premiere in Madrid in seven years. On December 10, 1998, a Royal Command Performance for Zorro was toplined by Prince Charles and his sons."

The site's consensus states: \"Banderas returns as an aging Zorro in this surprisingly nimble, entertaining swashbuckler.\" Metacritic gave the film an average score of 63/100, based on 22 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale. Richard Schickel of Time magazine praised The Mask of Zorro as a summer blockbuster which paid tribute to the classical Hollywood swashbuckler films. \"The action in this movie, most of which takes the form of spectacular stunt work performed by real, as opposed to digitized, people,\" Schickel stated, \"is motivated by simple, powerful emotions of an old-fashioned and rather melodramatic nature.\" Zorro exceeded the expectations of Roger Ebert, who was surprised by the screenplay's display of traditional film craftsmanship. \"It's a reminder of the time when stunts and special effects were integrated into stories, rather than the other way around.\" Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, calling The Mask of Zorro \"probably the best Zorro movie ever made.\" Mick LaSalle, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle gave credit to Anthony Hopkins for his masculine portrayal of an older Zorro, adding that the actor's \"performance presents a slight problem: The film asks us to believe that no one has figured out that Zorro and his real-life persona are the same person, even though they are the only guys in Mexico who talk with a British accent.\" Todd McCarthy of Variety found the film's length to be \"somewhat overlong\" and lacking \"the snap and concision that would have put it over the top as a bang-up entertainment, but it's closer in spirit to a vintage Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power swashbuckler than anything that's come out of Hollywood in quite some time.\" In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Travers criticized the casting choices for the Mexican roles, which included Banderas, a Spaniard, as well as Hopkins and Zeta-Jones, who are both Welsh. Disappointed with the film's entertainment value, Travers also expected the film to be a failure with audiences. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli compared the tone and style of The Mask of Zorro to producer Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark. \"While The Mask of Zorro isn't on the same level, it's not an altogether ridiculous comparison. Even though Zorro doesn't feature the non-stop cliffhanger adventure of Raiders,\" Berardinelli continued, \"there's still plenty of action, tumult, and derring-do.\" He was undecided whether the film would be a box office success, and that it would depend on the on-screen chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones. In one of the film's most popular scenes, Alejandro renders El\u00e9na topless with a flurry of sword slashes. One critic placed it on his list of \"Erotic [Film] Scenes in the 90s\"."

        "content": "The Iron Giant is a 1999 American animated science fiction film produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation and directed by Brad Bird in his directorial debut. It is based on the 1968 novel The Iron Man by Ted Hughes (which was published in the United States as The Iron Giant) and was scripted by Tim McCanlies from a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, John Mahoney, Eli Marienthal, Christopher McDonald, and M. Emmet Walsh. Set during the Cold War in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot. With the help of a beatnik artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant. The film's development began in 1994 as a musical with the involvement of the Who's Pete Townshend, though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using traditional animation, with computer-generated imagery used to animate the titular character and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. Michael Kamen composed the film's score, which was performed by the Czech Philharmonic. The Iron Giant premiered at Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, and was released in the United States on August 6. The film significantly underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million, which was blamed on Warner Bros.' unusually poor marketing campaign and skepticism towards animated film production following the mixed critical reception and box office failure of Quest for Camelot in the preceding year. Despite this, the film was praised for its story, animation, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick Jr., Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine Annie Awards out of 15 nominations. Through home video releases and television syndication, the film gathered a cult following and is widely regarded as a modern animated classic. In 2015, an extended, remastered version of the film was re-released theatrically, and on home video the following year."

        "content": "During the Cold War, shortly after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 in October 1957, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. The following night, nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a 50-foot tall alien robot attempting to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When he eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the area, discovering that he can self-repair. While there, Hogarth shows the Giant comic books, and compares him to the hero Superman. The incidents lead a xenophobic U.S. government agent named Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother Annie (Hogarth's father was a U.S. Air Force pilot who died during the Korean War), and rents a room in their house to keep an eye on him. Hogarth evades Mansley and leads the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant, but is compelled to explain the concept of death to the Giant after he witnesses hunters killing a deer. That night, the Giant has a vision of his past life, being one of many alien extermination weapons, which Dean sees through the TV. Hogarth is interrogated by Mansley when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and brings a U.S. Army contingent led by General Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence, but Dean (having been warned by Hogarth earlier) tricks them by pretending that the Giant is one of his art pieces. Upset by the apparent false alarm, Rogard prepares to leave with his forces after berating Mansley for his actions. Hogarth then continues to have fun with the Giant by playing with a toy gun, but inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system; Dean yells at him for nearly killing Hogarth, and the saddened Giant runs away with Hogarth giving chase. Dean quickly realizes that the Giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant. The Giant saves two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Mansley spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell, and stops the Army, sending them to attack the Giant after he has picked up Hogarth, forcing the two to flee together. They initially evade the military by using the Giant's flight system, but the Giant is then shot down and crashes to the ground. Hogarth is knocked unconscious, but the Giant, thinking that Hogarth is dead, completely gives in to his defensive system in a fit of rage and grief and attacks the military in retaliation, transforming into a war machine and making its way back to Rockwell. Mansley convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the USS Nautilus, as conventional weapons prove to be ineffective. Hogarth awakens and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard. The General is ready to stand down and order the Nautilus to deactivate its primed nuke, when Mansley impulsively orders the missile launch in a fit of paranoia, causing the missile to head towards Rockwell, where it will destroy the town and its population upon impact in the resulting nuclear detonation. Mansley attempts to escape after being given a furious scolding by Rogard, but the Giant stops him, and Rogard has Mansley arrested and orders his men to \"make sure he stays there like a good soldier\". In order to save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. As he soars directly into the path of the missile, the Giant remembers Hogarth's words \"You are who you choose to be\", smiles contentedly and says \"Superman\" as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the atmosphere, saving Rockwell, its population, and the military forces nearby, while the Giant is presumably destroyed, leaving Hogarth devastated. Months later, a memorial of the Giant stands in Rockwell. Dean and Annie begin a relationship. Hogarth is given a package from Rogard, containing a screw from the Giant which is the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave. The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland, and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself."

Jennifer Aniston as Annie Hughes, Hogarth's mother, the widow of a military pilot, and a diner waitress. Before Aniston was cast, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Meg Ryan, Jodi Benson, Julianne Moore, Joan Cusack and Nicole Kidman were all considered. Harry Connick Jr. as Dean McCoppin, a beatnik artist and junkyard owner. Bird felt it appropriate to make the character a member of the beat generation, as they were viewed as mildly threatening to small-town values during that time. An outsider himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat. Before Connick was cast, Matthew Broderick, Steve Martin, John Cusack and Robin Williams were all considered. Vin Diesel as the Iron Giant, a 50\u00a0ft., metal-eating robot. Of unknown origin and created for an unknown purpose, the Giant involuntarily reacts defensively if he recognizes anything as a weapon, immediately attempting to destroy it. The Giant's voice was originally going to be electronically modulated but the filmmakers decided they \"needed a deep, resonant and expressive voice to start with,\" so they hired Diesel. James Gammon as Foreman Marv Loach, a power station employee who follows the robot's trail after it destroys the station. Gammon also voices Floyd Toubeaux. Cloris Leachman as Karen Tensedge, Hogarth's schoolteacher. Christopher McDonald as Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal government agent sent to investigate sightings of the Iron Giant. The logo on his official government car says he is from the \"Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena\". Before McDonald was cast, Tommy Lee Jones, Alec Baldwin, Burt Reynolds, Kevin Spacey, James Woods, Dennis Hopper, Patrick McGoohan and Patrick Stewart were all considered.

M. Emmet Walsh as Earl Stutz, a sailor and the first man to see the robot. In addition, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas voice the train's engineer and fireman, briefly seen near the start of the film. Johnston and Thomas, who were animators and members of Disney's Nine Old Men, were cited by Bird as inspirations for his career, which he honored by incorporating their voices, likenesses, and even first names into the film."

        "content": "The origins of the film lie in the book The Iron Man (1968), by poet Ted Hughes, who wrote the novel for his children to comfort them in the wake of their mother Sylvia Plath's suicide. In the 1980s, rock musician Pete Townshend chose to adapt the book for a concept album; it was released as The Iron Man: A Musical in 1989. In 1991, Richard Bazley, who later became the film's lead animator, pitched a version of The Iron Man to Don Bluth while working at his studio in Ireland. He created a story outline and character designs but Bluth passed on the project. After a stage musical was mounted in London, Des McAnuff, who had adapted Tommy with Townshend for the stage, believed that The Iron Man could translate to the screen, and the project was ultimately acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment. In late 1996, while developing the project on its way through, the studio saw the film as a perfect vehicle for Brad Bird, who at the time was working for Turner Feature Animation developing Ray Gunn. Turner Broadcasting had recently merged with Warner Bros. parent company Time Warner, and Bird was allowed to transfer to the Warner Bros. Animation studio to direct The Iron Giant. After reading the original Iron Man book by Hughes, Bird was impressed with the mythology of the story and in addition, was given an unusual amount of creative control by Warner Bros. This creative control involved introducing two new characters not present in the original book, Dean and Kent, setting the film in America, and discarding Townshend's musical ambitions (who did not care either way, reportedly remarking, \"Well, whatever, I got paid\"). Bird would expand upon his desire to set the film in America in the 1950s in a later interview: Ted Hughes, the original story's author, died before the film's release. His daughter, Frieda Hughes, did see the finished film on his behalf and loved it. Pete Townshend, who this project originally started with and who stayed on as the film's executive producer, enjoyed the final film as well."

He later changed his mind after reading McCanlies' then-unproduced screenplay for Secondhand Lions. In Bird's original story treatment, America and the USSR were at war at the end, with the Giant dying. McCanlies decided to have a brief scene displaying his survival, stating, \"You can't kill E.T. and then not bring him back.\" McCanlies finished the script within two months. McCanlies was given a three-month schedule to complete a script, and it was by way of the film's tight schedule that Warner Bros. \"didn't have time to mess with us\" as McCanlies said. The question of the Giant's backstory was purposefully ignored as to keep the story focused on his relationship with Hogarth. Bird considered the story difficult to develop due to its combination of unusual elements, such as \"paranoid fifties sci-fi movies with the innocence of something like The Yearling.\" Hughes himself was sent a copy of McCanlies' script and sent a letter back, saying how pleased he was with the version. In the letter, Hughes stated, \"I want to tell you how much I like what Brad Bird has done. He\u2019s made something all of a piece, with terrific sinister gathering momentum and the ending came to me as a glorious piece of amazement. He\u2019s made a terrific dramatic situation out of the way he\u2019s developed The Iron Giant. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\" Bird combined his knowledge from his years in television to direct his first feature. He credited his time working on Family Dog as essential to team-building, and his tenure on The Simpsons as an example of working under strict deadlines. He was open to others on his staff to help develop the film; he would often ask crew members their opinions on scenes and change things accordingly. One of his priorities was to emphasize softer, character-based moments, as opposed to more frenetic scenes\u2014something Bird thought was a problem with modern filmmaking. \"There has to be activity or sound effects or cuts or music blaring. It's almost as if the audience has the remote and they're going to change channels,\" he commented at the time. Storyboard artist Teddy Newton played an important role in shaping the film's story. Newton's first assignment on staff involved being asked by Bird to create a film within a film to reflect the \"hygiene-type movies that everyone saw when the bomb scare was happening.\" Newton came to the conclusion that a musical number would be the catchiest alternative, and the \"Duck and Cover\" sequence came to become one of the crew members' favorites of the film. Nicknamed \"The X-Factor\" by story department head Jeffery Lynch, the producers gave him artistic freedom on various pieces of the film's script."

        "content": "The financial failure of Warner's previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, which made the studio reconsider animated films, helped shape The Iron Giants production considerably. \"Three-quarters\" of the animation team on that team helped craft The Iron Giant. By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff that there would be a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented \"They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.\" Bird regarded the trade-off as having \"one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule,\" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as \"fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.\" A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; \"we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees,\" said production designer Mark Whiting. Bird stuck to elaborate scene planning, such as detailed animatics, to make sure there were no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team\u2014dubbed \"Macro\" early on\u2014to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that \"We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources.\" The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. \"People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something,\" he recalled. He opted to give the film's animators portions to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in a throwback to the way Disney's first features were created. The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using computer-generated imagery due to the difficulty of creating a metal object \"in a fluid-like manner.\" They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion. The Giant was designed by filmmaker Joe Johnston, which was refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant. Using software, the team would animate the Giant \"on twos\" (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model. Bird brought in students from CalArts to assist in minor animation work due to the film's busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, \"You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments].\" Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film's CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including Alias Systems Corporation's Maya, Alias' PowerAnimator, a modified version of Pixar's RenderMan, Softimage 3D, Cambridge Animation's Animo (now part of Toon Boom Technologies), Avid Elastic Reality, and Adobe Photoshop. The art of Norman Rockwell, Edward Hopper and N.C. Wyeth inspired the design. Whiting strove for colors both evocative of the time period in which the film is set and also representative of its emotional tone; for example, Hogarth's room is designed to reflect his \"youth and sense of wonder.\" That was blended with a style reminiscent of 1950s illustration. Animators studied Chuck Jones, Hank Ketcham, Al Hirschfeld and Disney films from that era, such as 101 Dalmatians, for inspiration in the film's animation."

Bird's original temp score, \"a collection of Bernard Herrmann cues from '50s and '60s sci-fi films,\" initially scared Kamen. Believing the sound of the orchestra is important to the feeling of the film, Kamen \"decided to comb eastern Europe for an \"old-fashioned\" sounding orchestra and went to Prague to hear Vladimir Ashkenazy conduct the Czech Philharmonic in Strauss's An Alpine Symphony.\" Eventually, the Czech Philharmonic was the orchestra used for the film's score, with Bird describing the symphony orchestra as \"an amazing collection of musicians.\" The score for The Iron Giant was recorded in a rather unconventional manner, compared to most films: recorded over one week at the Rudolfinum in Prague, the music was recorded without conventional uses of syncing the music, in a method Kamen described in a 1999 interview as \"[being able to] play the music as if it were a piece of classical repertoire.\" Kamen's score for The Iron Giant won the Annie Award for Music in an Animated Feature Production on November 6, 1999."

He felt it was appropriate to use the format, as many films from the late 1950s were produced in such widescreen formats. He hoped to include the CinemaScope logo on a poster, partially as a joke, but 20th Century Fox, owner of the trademark, refused. Bird later recalled that he clashed with executives who wished to add characters, such as a sidekick dog, set the film in the present day, and include a soundtrack of hip hop. This was due to concerns that the film was not merchandisable, to which Bird responded, \"If they were interested in telling the story, they should let it be what it wants to be.\" The film was also initially going to be released under the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment banner, the logo which features mascot Bugs Bunny in a tuxedo eating a carrot as seen in the film's teaser trailer. Bird was against this for a multitude of reasons, and eventually got confirmation that executives Bob Daley and Terry Semel agreed. Instead, Bird and his team developed another version of the logo to resemble the classic studio logo in a circle, famously employed in Looney Tunes shorts. He credited executives Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Courtney Vallenti with helping him achieve his vision, noting that they were open to his opinion. According to a report from the time of its release, The Iron Giant cost $50 million to produce with an additional $30 million going towards marketing, though Box Office Mojo later reported its budget as $70 million. It was regarded as a lower-budget film, in comparison to the films distributed by Walt Disney Pictures."

In researching its source material, he learned that Hughes wrote The Iron Man as a means of comforting his children after his wife, Sylvia Plath, died by suicide, specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re-assemble itself after being damaged. These experiences formed the basis of Bird's pitch to Warner Bros., which was based around the idea \"What if a gun had a soul, and didn't want to be a gun?\"; the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan. McCanlies commented that \"At a certain point, there are deciding moments when we pick who we want to be. And that plays out for the rest of your life,\" adding that films can provide viewers with a sense of right and wrong, and expressed a wish that The Iron Giant would \"make us feel like we're all part of humanity [which] is something we need to feel.\" When some critics compared the film to E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Bird responded by saying \"E.T. doesn't go kicking ass. He doesn't make the Army pay. Certainly you risk having your hip credentials taken away if you want to evoke anything sad or genuinely heartfelt.\""

        "content": "The Iron Giant was a commercial failure during its theatrical release; consensus among critics was that its failure was, in part, due to poor promotion from Warner Bros. This was largely attributable to the reception of Quest for Camelot; after its release, Warner would not give Bird and his team a release date for their film until April 1999. After wildly successful test screenings, the studio was shocked by the response: the test scores were their highest for a film in 15 years, according to Bird. They had neglected to prepare a successful marketing strategy for the film\u2014such as cereal and fast food tie-ins\u2014with little time left before its scheduled release. Bird remembered that the studio produced only one teaser poster for the film, which became its eventual poster. Brad Ball, who had been assigned the role of marketing the film, was candid after its release, noting that the studio did not commit to a planned Burger King toy plan. IGN stated that \"In a mis-marketing campaign of epic proportions at the hands of Warner Bros., they simply didn't realize what they had on their hands.\" The studio needed an $8 million opening to ensure success, but they were unable to properly promote it preceding the release. They nearly delayed the film by several months to better prepare. \"They said, 'we should delay it and properly lead up to its release,' and I said 'you guys have had two and a half years to get ready for this,'\" recalled Bird. Press outlets took note of its absence of marketing, with some reporting that the studio had spent more money on marketing for the intended summer blockbuster Wild Wild West instead. Warner Bros. scheduled Sunday sneak preview screenings for the film prior to its release, as well as a preview of the film on the online platform Webcastsneak."

Awareness of the film was increased by its February 2000 release as a pay-per-view title, which also increased traffic to the film's website. The Iron Giant was released on VHS and DVD on November 23, 1999, with a Laserdisc release following on December 6. Warner Bros. spent $35 million to market the home video release of the film. The VHS edition came in three versions\u2014pan and scan, pan and scan with an affixed Giant toy to the clamshell case, and a widescreen version. All of the initial widescreen home video releases were in 1.85:1, the incorrect aspect ratio for the film. In 2000, television rights to the film were sold to Cartoon Network and TNT for $3 million. Cartoon Network showed the film continuously for 24 consecutive hours in the early 2000s for such holidays as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving. The Special Edition DVD was released on November 16, 2004. In 2014, Bird entered discussions with Warner Bros. regarding the possibility of releasing The Iron Giant on Blu-ray. On April 23, he wrote on Twitter that \"WB & I have been talking. But they want a bare-bones disc. I want better,\" and encouraged fans to send tweets to Warner Home Video in favor of a Special Edition Blu-ray of the film. The film was ultimately released on Blu-ray on September 6, 2016, and included both the theatrical and 2015 Signature Edition cuts, as well as a documentary entitled The Giant's Dream that covered the making of the film.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. The Reel Source forecasting service calculated that \"96\u201397%\" of audiences that attended recommended the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it \"straight-arrow and subversive, [and] made with simplicity as well as sophistication,\" writing, \"it feels like a classic even though it's just out of the box.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and compared it, both in story and animation, to the works of Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki, summarizing the film as \"not just a cute romp but an involving story that has something to say.\" The New Yorker reviewer Michael Sragow dubbed it a \"modern fairy tale,\" writing, \"The movie provides a master class in the use of scale and perspective\u2014and in its power to open up a viewer\u2019s heart and mind.\" Time Richard Schickel deemed it \"a smart live-and-let-live parable, full of glancing, acute observations on all kinds of big subjects\u2014life, death, the military-industrial complex.\" Lawrence Van Gelder, writing for The New York Times, deemed it a \"smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking.\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal felt it \"beautiful, oh so beautiful, as a work of coherent art,\" noting, \"be assured that the film is, before anything else, deliciously funny and deeply affecting.\" Both Hollywood trade publications were positive: David Hunter of The Hollywood Reporter predicted it to be a sleeper hit and called it \"outstanding,\" while Lael Loewenstein of Variety called it \"a visually appealing, well-crafted film [...] an unalloyed success.\" Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly commented, \"I have long thought that I was born without the gene that would allow me to be emotionally drawn in by drawings. That is, until I saw The Iron Giant.\" Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed that the storytelling was far superior to other animated films, and cited the characters as plausible and noted the richness of moral themes. Jeff Millar of the Houston Chronicle agreed with the basic techniques as well, and concluded the voice cast excelled with a great script by Tim McCanlies. The Washington Post Stephen Hunter, while giving the film 4 out of 5 stars, opined, \"The movie \u2014 as beautifully drawn, as sleek and engaging as it is \u2014 has the annoyance of incredible smugness.\""

Using the slogan \"For Real\", Tanner emerges from a wide field of contenders to battle for the nomination against two high-profile and better-funded candidates: Jesse Jackson and eventual nominee Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. With Tanner are his college-aged daughter Alexandra (Cynthia Nixon), whose illness was why he earlier left politics and who has left college for the duration of the campaign, and his girlfriend Joanna Buckley (Wendy Crewson), Dukakis' deputy campaign manager. Others who appear on camera are Emile Berkoff (Jim Fyfe), a compulsive statistician with a crush on Alexandra; Deke Conners (Matt Malloy), an East Village filmmaker hired to produce Tanner campaign ads; and Andrea Spinelli (Ilana Levine), T.J.'s innocent and ditzy but well-meaning assistant. The candidate's father, General John Tanner (E.G. Marshall), who has a contentious relationship with his son, also occasionally appears. Although Tanner does not win the nomination, he does run a serious and credible race.

        "content": "The Muppet Christmas Carol is a 1992 American Christmas film directed by Brian Henson (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Jerry Juhl. Adapted from the 1843 novella A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, it stars Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge, alongside Muppet performers Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Jerry Nelson, and Frank Oz. Although artistic license is taken to suit the aesthetic of the Muppets, The Muppet Christmas Carol otherwise follows Dickens's original story closely. It is the fourth theatrical film in The Muppets franchise, and the first to be produced following the deaths of the Muppets creator Jim Henson and the performer Richard Hunt; the film is dedicated to both. The film was released in the United States on December 11, 1992, by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. It was a modest box office success and received mostly positive reviews. It is the first Muppets film to be produced by Walt Disney Pictures, whose parent company would later acquire the Muppets franchise in 2004."

        "content": "On Christmas Eve, in nineteenth century London, Charles Dickens (played by The Great Gonzo) and his friend Rizzo addresses the audience as narrators. Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine), a cold-hearted, bad-tempered and selfish moneylender, does not share the merriment of Christmas. He rejects his nephew Fred's invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen (played by Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker) collecting money for charity, and tosses a wreath at a carol-singing Bean Bunny. His loyal employee Bob Cratchit (played by Kermit the Frog) and the other bookkeepers request to take Christmas Day off, since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees. Scrooge leaves for home while the bookkeepers celebrate Christmas. In his house, Scrooge encounters the shackled ghosts of his late business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley (played by Statler and Waldorf), who warn him to repent his wicked ways or be condemned to suffer in the afterlife as they do. They inform him that three spirits will visit him during the night. At one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past, who takes him back in time to his childhood and early adult life, with Dickens and Rizzo hitching a ride too. They visit his lonely school days and then his time as an employee under Fozziwig (Mr. Fezziwig in the original story, played by Fozzie Bear), who owned a rubber chicken factory. Fozziwig and his mother throw a Christmas party, where Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, with whom he falls in love. However, the Ghost shows Scrooge how Belle left him after he chose money over her. A tearful Scrooge dismisses the Ghost as he returns to his bedroom. At two o'clock, Scrooge meets the gigantic, merry Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Fred's house, where Scrooge is made fun of for his stinginess and general ill will toward all. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchit's house, learning his family (Mrs. Cratchit is played by Miss Piggy) is content with their small dinner. Scrooge also takes pity on Bob's ill son Tiny Tim (played by Robin the Frog). The Ghost of Christmas Present abruptly ages, commenting that Tiny Tim will likely die before next Christmas. Scrooge and the Ghost go to a cemetery, where the latter fades away. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appears to Scrooge, as a tall, silent, cloaked figure, and takes Scrooge into the future. Scrooge and the Ghost witness a group of businessmen discussing the death of an unnamed colleague, saying they would only attend the funeral if lunch was provided. In a den, Scrooge sees a charwoman, a laundress, and the local undertaker trading several stolen possessions of the deceased to a fence named Old Joe. The Ghost then transports Scrooge to Bob's house, revealing Tiny Tim has died and the Crachits are mourning him. Scrooge is escorted back to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out the wretched man\u2019s neglected grave, revealing Scrooge as the man who died. Overcome with emotion, Scrooge tearfully vows to change his ways and embraces the ghost\u2019s robes before finding himself back in his bedroom. Discovering it is Christmas Day, Scrooge decides to surprise Bob's family with a turkey dinner and ventures out with Bean, Dickens, Rizzo, and the charity workers to spread happiness and joy around London, reconciling with Fred and Fozziwig. Scrooge goes to the Cratchit house, at first putting on a cold demeanor before revealing he intends to raise Bob's salary and pay off his mortgage. Scrooge, the Cratchits, Fred and the neighborhood celebrate Christmas, as Dickens narrates how Scrooge became a second father to Tiny Tim, who escaped death."

        "content": "Following Jim Henson's death in May 1990, the talent agent Bill Haber approached Henson's son Brian with the idea of filming an adaptation. Haber told Henson that \"Christmas Carol is the greatest story of all time, you should do that\" and later informed Henson that he had sold the idea to ABC as a television film. The longtime Muppets writer Jerry Juhl was hired to write the script and decided to insert Charles Dickens as the stand-in narrator in order to remain faithful to the original prose of the written material. Henson stated that Gonzo was chosen because he was the least likely choice to play Charles Dickens, while Rizzo the Rat was added to inject some humor and serve as a Greek chorus. Established Muppet characters were initially written to portray the ghosts, with various accounts stating Robin the Frog or Scooter was to be the Ghost of Christmas Past, Miss Piggy to be the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Gonzo (before he was written to portray Dickens) or Animal as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. However, the idea was scrapped in favor of new Muppet characters that would better underline the ominous nature. After the script was submitted for approval to ABC, the executives of Walt Disney Pictures offered to purchase the script for a feature film instead of a television release. The English actors David Hemmings, Ron Moody, and David Warner and the American comedian George Carlin were considered to portray Ebenezer Scrooge. Henson later offered the role to Michael Caine, who replied: \"I'm going to play this movie like I'm working with the Royal Shakespeare Company. I will never wink, I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me.\" He took inspiration for the role from \"Wall Street cheats and embezzlers, I thought they represented a very good picture of meanness and greed.\" Production took place at the Shepperton Studios, England. During filming, in order to allow for the Muppets and the human actors to be in the shot, floors had to be removed and re-inserted, with Michael Caine having to walk across narrow planks between the Muppets and their performers. Additionally, the buildings in the London street scenes were constructed by hand but diminished in size in order to achieve the appearance that the streets were relatively longer. When the musical sequence \"It Feels Like Christmas\" ends with a crane shot, the short buildings became visibly seen in the background; Brian Henson explained on the DVD audio commentary that they were aware of the problem during shooting, but eventually decided that the closing shot was worth it as they believed not many people would notice the error."

The site's consensus states, \"It may not be the finest version of Charles Dickens' tale to grace the screen, but The Muppet Christmas Carol is funny and heartwarming, and serves as a good introduction to the story for young viewers.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Janet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, summarized the film as not a \"great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. But there is a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand.\" The Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film three stars out of four, praised the technical achievements, but felt it \"could have done with a few more songs than it has, and the merrymaking at the end might have been carried on a little longer, just to offset the gloom of most of Scrooge's tour through his lifetime spent spreading misery.\" On the television program Siskel & Ebert, his partner Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel gave the film a Thumbs Down although he was favorable towards Michael Caine's performance. Also from The Chicago Tribune, Dave Kehr reviewed the film as \"a talky, plodding film that seems likely to bore children and adults in equal measure.\" Nevertheless, Kehr praised Val Strazovec's production design and John Fenner's cinematography believing its \"shadowy, naturalistic lighting creates a new look for a puppet film,\" but derided Paul Williams's songs as unmemorable. Likewise, Variety praised the production design and criticized Williams's songs, writing Muppets Christmas Carol is \"not as enchanting or amusing as the previous entries in the Muppet series. But nothing can really diminish the late Jim Henson's irresistibly appealing characters.\u201d Giving the film three stars out of five, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote the film is \"liberal but fun adaptation of a classic\" that \"turns out to be quite touching as Muppet movies go. Less pleasing are the forgettable songs that offer both clumsy word construction and dire music that eats away at the aesthetic quality of the movie. But you'll be too busy looking out for the assorted Muppets to care much.\" Anthony McGlynn of Screen Rant called The Muppet Christmas Carol \"a work of genius on every level\" and \"the greatest Christmas movie ever made\", praising the original songs that were written for the film and Michael Caine's performance as Scrooge."

        "content": "\"When Love Is Gone\" was a song sung by the female character Belle (portrayed and voiced by Meredith Braun) as she laments that Scrooge's love of money has replaced his love of her. The song itself was cut from the original 1992 American theatrical edition of the film by Jeffrey Katzenberg of Walt Disney Studios, who believed that the following scene would not appeal to young viewers. Instead, the song was only played during the film's end credits scene. Director Brian Henson objected to this decision as the concluding song, \"The Love We Found,\" was a direct counterpoint to it. Henson commented: \"'When Love Is Gone' was not in the theatrical release, and is presently missing from some copies of the movie, which is a real shame.\" The song titled \"When Love Is Gone\" is only included on some home media releases of The Muppet Christmas Carol which are now out of print. It is included as a deleted scene in the \"extras\" section of the film on Disney+. The song is included on all of the 1993 VHS and LaserDisc releases of the film., as well as at least one UK VHS release. The LaserDisc version includes the only widescreen presentation of this song ever released. The 2002 and 2005 DVD releases of the movie do retain the song, but only in the 90-minute full-screen version of the film, not in the 86-minute widescreen version on the same disc. A 2012 standalone DVD release of the film uses the same disc from the 2005 release, so it also contains the song. However, a different DVD was used for the 2012 Blu-ray combo pack which does not contain the song. The digital download release of the film contains the entire \"When Love Is Gone\" as a bonus feature, in widescreen and in high definition. In a 2018 interview with The Big Issue, Henson said he believed that the song was \"unlikely\" to appear in any further releases of the film, because The Walt Disney Company lost the video master and film negative. However, on December 9, 2020, Henson confirmed to BBC Radio 2 that the original film negative featuring the entire footage of the song had been found by Disney archivists and would be included in all future 4K releases. Due to time restraints, Disney+ was unable to include the new full version on its Christmas 2020 release of the film."

        "content": "In Japan's Sengoku period, Takeda Shingen,  daimy\u014d of the Takeda clan, meets with his brother Nobukado, and an unnamed thief whom the latter met by chance and spared from crucifixion due to the thief's uncanny resemblance to Shingen. The brothers then agree that he would prove useful as a double, and they decide to use the thief as a kagemusha, a political decoy. Later, the Takeda army has besieged a castle of Tokugawa Ieyasu. One evening when Shingen visits the battlefield he is shot by a sniper who has mapped Shingen's previous movements in the camp. Mortally wounded, he orders a withdrawal and commands his generals to keep his death a secret for three years. Shingen soon dies with only a small group of witnesses. Meanwhile, Shingen's rivals Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Uesugi Kenshin each contemplate the consequences of Shingen's withdrawal of his army still not knowing of his death. Nobukado presents the thief to Shingen's generals, proposing to have this kagemusha impersonate Shingen full-time. At first, even the thief is unaware of Shingen's death, until he tries to break into a huge jar, believing it to contain treasure, and instead finds Shingen's preserved corpse. The generals then decide they cannot trust the thief and set him free. Later, the Takeda leaders secretly drop the jar with the corpse inside into Lake Suwa. Spies working for Tokugawa and his ally Oda witness the disposal of the jar and, suspecting that Shingen has died, go to report the death. The thief, however, overhearing the spies, goes to offer his services, hoping to be of some use to Shingen in death. The Takeda clan preserves the deception by announcing that they were making an offering of sake to the god of the lake. The spies follow the Takeda army as they march home from the siege. Although they suspect that Shingen has died, they are later convinced by the impostor's performance. Returning home, the kagemusha successfully fools Shingen's retinue. By imitating the late warlord's gestures and learning more about him, the kagemusha begins to uncannily mimic the persona of Shingen, and even convinces Takeda Katsuyori's son and Shingen's grandson, who was very close with Shingen. When the kagemusha must preside over a clan council to plan how to respond to provocative attacks made by Tokugawa against Takeda border castles, he is instructed by Nobukado to not speak until Nobukado brings the generals to a consensus, whereupon the kagemusha will simply agree with the generals' plan and dismiss the council. However, Katsuyori is incensed by his father's decree of the three year subterfuge, which delays his inheritance and leadership of the clan. Katsuyori thus decides to test the kagemusha in front of the council, as the majority of the attendants are still unaware of Shingen's death. He directly asks the kagemusha what course of action the \"lord thinks\" should be taken. After a long pause, the kagemusha replies, \"A mountain does not move,\" convincingly in Shingen's own manner, which further impresses the generals. Soon, in 1573, Oda Nobunaga is mobilizing his forces to attack Azai Nagamasa, continuing his campaign in central Honshu to maintain his control of Kyoto against the growing opposition. When the Tokugawa and Oda clans launch an attack on Takeda territory, Katsuyori begins a counter-offensive against the advice of other generals. The kagemusha is forced to lead reinforcements to the 1574 Battle of Takatenjin, and helps inspire the troops to victory. In a fit of overconfidence, the kagemusha attempts to ride Shingen's spirited horse. When he falls off, those who rush to help him see that he does not have their lord's battle scars, and he is revealed as an impostor. The thief is driven out of the palace in disgrace, and Katsuyori takes over the clan. Sensing weakness in the Takeda clan leadership, the Oda and Tokugawa clans are emboldened to begin a full-scale offensive into the Takeda homeland. Now in full control of the Takeda army, Katsuyori leads the counter-offensive against Nobunaga, resulting in the Battle of Nagashino. Although courageous in their assault, wave after wave of attacking Takeda cavalry and infantry are cut down by volleys of gunfire from Oda arquebusiers deployed behind wooden stockades, effectively eliminating the Takeda army. The exiled kagemusha, who has followed the Takeda army, is dismayed and in a final show of loyalty, he takes up a spear and makes a hopeless charge against the Oda lines. Mortally wounded, the kagemusha attempts futilely to retrieve the f\u016brinkazan banner, which had fallen into a river, but succumbs to his wounds in the water. His body floats past it as the film concludes with a long shot of the abandoned banner."

        "content": "George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola are credited at the end of the film as executive producers in the international version. This is because they persuaded 20th Century Fox to make up a shortfall in the film's budget when the original producers, Toho Studios, could not afford to complete the film. In return, 20th Century Fox received the international distribution rights to the film. Kurosawa originally cast the actor Shintaro Katsu in the title role. Katsu left the production, however, before the first day of shooting was over; in an interview for the Criterion Collection DVD, executive producer Coppola states that Katsu angered Kurosawa by arriving with his own camera crew to record Kurosawa's filmmaking methods. It is unclear whether Katsu was fired or left of his own accord, but he was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, a well-known actor who had appeared in a number of Kurosawa's previous films. Nakadai played both the kagemusha and the lord whom he impersonated. Kurosawa wrote a part in Kagemusha for his longtime regular actor Takashi Shimura, and Kagemusha was the last Kurosawa film in which Shimura appeared. However, the scene in which he plays a servant who accompanies a western doctor to a meeting with Shingen was cut from the foreign release of the film. The Criterion Collection DVD release of the film restored this scene as well as approximately another eighteen minutes in the film. According to Lucas, Kurosawa used 5,000 extras for the final battle sequence, filming for a whole day, then he cut it down to 90 seconds in the final release. Many special effects, and a number of scenes that filled holes in the story, landed on the \"cutting-room floor\"."

It was directed by Lee Unkrich, the editor of the first two films and the co-director of Toy Story 2, written by Michael Arndt, while Unkrich wrote the story along with John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton, respectively, director and co-writer of the first two films. In the film, Andy Davis, now 17, is leaving for college. Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the other toys are accidentally donated to a daycare center by Andy's mother, and the toys must decide where their loyalties lie.

Jim Varney, who voiced Slinky Dog in the first two films, died on February 10, 2000, 10 years before the release of the third film, so the role of Slinky was passed down to Blake Clark. The returning cast is joined by Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Whoopi Goldberg, Timothy Dalton, Kristen Schaal, Bonnie Hunt, and Jeff Garlin who voice the new characters introduced in this film. The film was released in the United States on June 18, 2010. Toy Story 3 was the first film to be released theatrically with Dolby Surround 7.1 sound. Like its predecessors, Toy Story 3 received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the vocal performances, screenplay, emotional depth, animation, and Randy Newman's musical score. It became the second Pixar film (after Up) and third animated film overall (after Beauty and the Beast and Up), as well as the third film produced by Walt Disney Pictures to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. The film received four more Academy Award nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song, winning the latter two. Toy Story 3 earned $1.067\u00a0billion worldwide, becoming the first animated film to do so, the highest-grossing film of 2010, and the fifth highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release, as well as the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It is one of the most expensive films of all time and Pixar's highest-grossing film, all records held at the time of its release. The sequel, Toy Story 4, was released in June 2019."

        "content": "Andy is 17 years old and preparing to leave for college. He has not played with his toys for years, and most have gone, except for Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, Bullseye, Rex, Slinky, Hamm, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the Aliens, and three toy soldiers. As the despondent toys reflect on their future, the soldiers parachute out the window and leave. Andy intends to take Woody to college and puts the others into a trash bag to put them in the attic; however, Andy's mother mistakenly believes the bag to be trash and puts it on the curb. The toys narrowly escape from the garbage truck and upsettingly believe Andy wanted to throw them away, get into a donation box in his mother's car with Molly's old Barbie doll, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows, but is unable to convince them of Andy's real intentions, and goes along when Andy's mother drives to Sunnyside. At Sunnyside, Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys, led by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (\"Lotso\"). The toys (except for Woody) are delighted to learn that Sunnyside never runs out of children, and Barbie is enamored with a Ken doll. Woody attempts to return home, but is instead found by a child from Sunnyside named Bonnie, who brings him home and plays with him and her other toys. Bonnie's toys are shocked that Woody escaped from Sunnyside. Chuckles, a toy clown, explains that he, Lotso, and Big Baby were owned by a girl named Daisy, but were lost during a family trip. When they made it home, Lotso found out that he had been replaced. Embittered, he lied to Big Baby that Daisy had replaced all of them. They went to Sunnyside on a truck, where Lotso took over, turning it into a toy prison. Chuckles was eventually broken and later found by Bonnie. After Andy's toys are subjected to a very rough playtime with the toddlers, Buzz asks Lotso to move the toys to the older children's room. Lotso allows Buzz to go, though when he suggests that Andy's toys go as well, Lotso decides to switch Buzz to his original factory setting; due to this, his memory of his friends is (temporarily) erased. Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she lost in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for them. They realize that Woody was telling the truth about Andy's intentions and try to escape, but Lotso's henchmen, assisted by the now-brainwashed Buzz (who once again believes he's a real space ranger), imprison them. Woody returns to Sunnyside, where a Chatter Telephone tells him that there is now only one way out \u2013 the trash. Later that night, the toys make their escape plan. Mr. Potato Head disguises himself in a tortilla and keeps watch for Lotso and the gang, Woody and Slinky retrieve Sunnyside's master key and hand it to Jessie who leads Bullseye, and Mrs. Potato Head out to the playground, Rex and Hamm along with Barbie, Woody, and Slinky try to reset Buzz but instead reset him to his Spanish mode. Buzz allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster but are cornered by Lotso's gang. Woody reveals Lotso's deception to Big Baby, who angrily throws Lotso into the dumpster. As a garbage truck approaches, the toys try to leave, but Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster. The rest of Andy's toys jump after him, just as the truck arrives, and all fall inside. Buzz returns to normal after a television falls onto him inside the truck. The truck takes the toys to a landfill, where they are swept onto a conveyor belt that leads to an incinerator. The Aliens spot an industrial claw but are swept away while running toward it. After narrowly avoiding a shredder while trying to rescue Lotso, Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them. The toys fall into the incinerator and resign themselves to their apparent fate, but the Aliens, having made their way to the industrial claw, suddenly rescue them. Lotso is later found by a garbage truck driver, who fastens him to his truck's radiator grille along with a few other toys. Woody and his friends ride another garbage truck back to Andy's house. Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie. Andy introduces the toys individually to Bonnie and is surprised to find Woody at the bottom of the donation box. Bonnie recognizes him, and though initially hesitant, Andy passes Woody on to her, and they play together before he leaves. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie. In the film's epilogue, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have vastly improved Sunnyside and maintain contact with Bonnie's toys through letters. The toy soldiers parachute into Sunnyside, where Ken and Barbie welcome them."

        "content": "According to the terms of Pixar's initial seven-film deal with Disney, all characters created by Pixar for their films were owned by Disney. Furthermore, Disney retained the rights to make sequels to any Pixar film, though Pixar retained the right of first refusal to work on these sequels. In 2004, when the contentious negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Michael Eisner, Disney chairman at the time, put plans in motion to produce Toy Story 3 at a new Disney studio, Circle 7 Animation. Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return, even if Pixar was not on board. It was slated for a theatrical release sometime in spring 2008. Bradley Raymond, who previously directed Disney's direct-to-video sequels such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and The Lion King 1\u00bd, was hired to direct the film. Among the scripts Circle 7 had under consideration was one from Teacher's Pet screenwriters Bill and Cheri Steinkellner. Their idea for the film involves Andy and his toys (Woody, Buzz, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, Jessie, and Bullseye) paying a visit to his grandmother's house for the night because his room is getting remodeled. So a set of Andy's toys and new characters Hee-Hee, and Gladiola are trying to figure out who stole the toys one by one in a whodunit-style murder mystery story. Though it was rejected, Disney was so impressed with the script that this version would have been considered for a possible fourth installment. The final version of the Circle 7 script was written by Meet the Parents screenwriter Jim Herzfeld. It focused on Andy's toys shipping a malfunctioning Buzz to the factory in Taiwan where he was built called Wocka-Wocka, with the other toys hoping he will be fixed there. While searching on the Internet, they then discovered that many more Buzz Lightyear toys are malfunctioning around the world and the company had issued a massive recall. Fearing Buzz's destruction, a group of Andy's toys (Woody, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Jessie, and Bullseye) all ship themselves to Taiwan and venture out to rescue Buzz. At the same time, Buzz meets other toys from around the world that were once loved, but have been recalled such as Rosey, a warm cozy toy, and Jade, a leggy doll with an evening gown. Along with meeting the recalled toys, Buzz also meets a new Star Command action figure that was going to be the replacement of Buzz, Daxx Blastar, along with his accessory pet cat named Comet. In January 2006, Disney bought Pixar in a deal that put Pixar chiefs Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter in charge of all Disney Animation. Shortly thereafter, Circle 7 Animation was shut down and its alternate version of Toy Story 3 was canceled. The following month, Disney CEO Robert Iger confirmed that Disney was in the process of transferring the production to Pixar. John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Lee Unkrich visited the house where they first pitched Toy Story and came up with the story for the film over a weekend. Stanton then wrote a treatment. This story had no traces of the Circle 7 version of the film since the filmmakers did not read its script: \"Not out of spite, but we wanted to start fresh, and not be influenced by what they'd done,\" said Unkrich. \"We didn't look at any of the work they'd done. We really didn't want to know anything about it.\" In February 2007, Lasseter announced Toy Story 2s co-director, Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of himself (Lasseter had directed the first two films and was busy directing Cars 2), and Michael Arndt as screenwriter. 2010 was also announced as the tentative release date. Unkrich, who had been working with Arndt and story development artists on the film since the middle of 2006, said that he felt pressure to avoid creating \"the first dud\" for Pixar, since (as of 2010) all of Pixar's films had been critical and commercial successes. In February 2008, the film's plotline was reported: \"Woody the cowboy and his toy-box friends are dumped in a daycare center after their owner, Andy, leaves for college.\" During the initial development stages of the film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that, although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files, which necessitated recreating the models from scratch. To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, more than a year and a half was invested on research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence. Instead of sending Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and John Ratzenberger scripts for their consideration in reprising their roles, a complete story reel of the film was shown to the actors in a theater. The reel was made up of moving storyboards with pre-recorded voices, sound effects, and music. When the preview concluded, the actors signed on to the film. The film's art director, Daisuke Tsutsumi, is married to Hayao Miyazaki's niece, who originally inspired the character Mei in Miyazaki's anime film My Neighbour Totoro (1988). Totoro makes a cameo appearance in Toy Story 3. Dolby Laboratories announced that Toy Story 3 would be the first film to feature theatrical 7.1 surround sound. Thus, even the Blu-ray version would feature original 7.1 audio, unlike other films which were remixed into 7.1 for Blu-ray."

On March 23, 2010, Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were released separately on Blu-ray/DVD combo packs; Toy Story included a small feature of \"The Story of Toy Story 3\" and Toy Story 2 included one on the \"Characters of Toy Story 3.\" Mattel, Thinkway Toys, and Lego are among companies that produced toys to promote the film. Fisher Price, a Mattel Company, released Toy Story 3 with 21 3D images for viewing with the View-Master viewer. Disney Interactive Studios also produced a video game based on the film Toy Story 3: The Video Game, which was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, Nintendo DS, and PSP on June 15, 2010.

Toy Story 3 was featured in Apple's iPhone OS 4 Event on April 8, 2010, with Steve Jobs demonstrating a Toy Story 3-themed iAd written in HTML5. Pixar designed a commercial for the toy Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear and formatted it to appear as if it came from an old VCR recording. The recording was altered with distorted sound, noise along the bottom of the screen, and flickering video, all designed to make it look like a converted recording from around 1983. A Japanese version of the commercial was also released online, with the name \"Lots-O'-Huggin Bear\" replaced with \"Little Hug-Hug Bear\" (Japanese:\u30cf\u30b0\u30cf\u30b0\u30d9\u30a2\u3061\u3083\u3093/Hagu Hagu Beya-Chan). On Dancing with the Stars May 11, 2010 episode, the Gipsy Kings performed a Spanish-language version of the song \"You've Got a Friend in Me,\" which featured a paso doble dance choreographed by Cheryl Burke and Tony Dovolani. Both the song and dance are featured in the film. Toy Story 3 was promoted with airings of the first and second film on several channels in the weeks preceding the film's release, including Disney Channel, Disney XD, and ABC Family.

A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated \"This film\u2014this whole three-part, 15-year epic\u2014about the adventures of a bunch of silly plastic junk turns out also to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that noble, stubborn, foolish thing called love.\" Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \"A\" saying \"Even with the bar raised high, Toy Story 3 enchanted and moved me so deeply I was flabbergasted that a digitally animated comedy about plastic playthings could have this effect.\" Gleiberman also wrote in the next issue that he, along with many other grown men, cried at the end of the film.

His exasperated parents have tried multiple ways to build up his courage to little success. Richard is sent to buy a bag of nails for building a treehouse. However, Richard gets caught in a harsh thunderstorm and takes shelter in a library. He meets Mr. Dewey, an eccentric librarian/custodian who insists that he is in need of a special book and gives him a library card, despite Richard's protests. Searching for a phone, Richard finds a large rotunda painted with many famous literary characters. He slips on water dripping from his coat and falls over, knocking himself out. Richard awakens to find the rotunda art melting, which washes over him and the library, turning them into illustrations. He is met by the Pagemaster, the mythical Keeper of Books and Guardian of the Written Word. Richard asks for directions to the exit, so the Pagemaster sends him through the fiction section toward the green neon exit sign. Along the way, Richard befriends three anthropomorphic books: Adventure, a swashbuckling pirate-like book; Fantasy, a sassy but caring fairy tale book; and Horror, a fearful \"Hunchbook\" with a misshapen spine. The three agree to help Richard if he checks them out using his new library card. Together, the quartet encounters classic-fictional characters. They meet Dr. Jekyll who turns into Mr. Hyde, driving them to the open waters of the Land of Adventure. However, the group is separated after Moby-Dick attacks, following the whale's battle with Captain Ahab. Richard and Adventure are shipwrecked and picked up by the Hispaniola, captained by Long John Silver. The pirates go to Treasure Island, but find no treasure except for one gold coin, nearly causing a mutiny between the captain and the crew. Fantasy and Horror return and defeat the pirates. Silver attempts to convince Richard to leave with him but surrenders when Richard threatens him with a sword. In the fantasy section, Richard sees the exit sign on the top of a mountain. However, Adventure's bumbling awakens a dormant dragon. Richard tries to fight the dragon with a sword and shield, but the dragon swallows him. Richard finds books in the dragon's stomach and uses a beanstalk from Jack and the Beanstalk to escape through the dragon's mouth. He and the books climb the beanstalk to reach the exit. They enter a large dark room where the Pagemaster awaits them. Richard accuses the Pagemaster of causing the horrors that he suffered, but the Pagemaster reveals the journey was intended to make Richard face his fears. Dr. Jekyll, Captain Ahab, Long John Silver, and the dragon reappear in a magical twister and congratulate him. The Pagemaster swoops Richard and the books into the twister, sending them back to the real world. Richard awakens, finding Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror lying next to him as real books. Mr. Dewey finds him, and, even though the library policy only allows a person to check out two books at a time, lets him check out all three books \"just this once\". Richard returns home a braver boy, sleeping in his new treehouse with his books."

        "content": "The animation in the film was produced by Turner Feature Animation, headed by David Kirschner and supervising animator Bruce W. Smith and recently spun off from Hanna-Barbera. The crew included animators who were veterans of productions such as An American Tail (1986) (also produced by David Kirschner and composed by James Horner), The Land Before Time (1988) and Aladdin (1992). This was one of the first films to feature live-action, traditional animation, and CGI animation all together. One scene involving a computer-generated dragon made from paint was used, a challenge for the filmmakers. All of the fictional works featured in the film were created and first published before January 1, 1923, making them a part of the public domain in most countries. The theme songs to the movie are \"Dream Away\", sung by Babyface and Lisa Stansfield, and \"Whatever You Imagine\", sung by Wendy Moten. According to the film's animation crew, the film went overbudget during animation production due to mismanagement and changes to the narrative. The 2001 book Producing Animation by Catherine Winder and Zahra Dowlatbadi (Johnston's assistant on The Pagemaster) recommends against making story changes during the animation process. Joe Johnston went on to express his dissatisfaction over the production, claiming that the film was re-edited without his consent. He has since crossed The Pagemaster off his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. This was also the third film in which Leonard Nimoy and Frank Welker co-starred; the first two were Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and The Transformers: The Movie. The two later co-starred again, 17 years later, in Transformers: Dark of the Moon."

        "content": "The screenwriting credits for this film were the subject of a protracted legal arbitration with the Writers Guild of America (WGA) when its producer, David Kirschner, attempted to claim sole authorship of the screenplay and original story, with no credit for its original screenwriter, David Casci. Typically, proposed credits are submitted to the WGA for approval well in advance of the release of a film or the publishing of posters or novelizations on which writing credits appear. In the case of The Pagemaster, the producers attempted to claim that, as the film was now largely animated, the WGA did not have jurisdiction to determine credits. Casci had written the screenplay under a WGA contract, as well as previous live-action versions for Disney Television dating back to 1985, also written under WGA contract. These facts positioned the WGA to get involved, testing their tenuous authority over a feature film with animated elements. After a lengthy investigation and interviews with those intimately familiar with the genesis of the Pagemaster project, including three persons within Kirschner's own office, the WGA credit arbitration process determined that David Casci was, in fact, the primary writer, and that Kirschner did not provide a sufficient creative contribution to the writing process to warrant any screenwriting credit. Upon receiving this determination by the WGA, Fox threatened to pull out of arbitration and release the film without WGA-approved credits, positioning the WGA to be forced to file an injunction blocking the film's heavily promoted Christmas season release. Ultimately, a settlement was reached, and Fox released the film with both Kirschner and Casci receiving story and screenplay credit, with a third writer, Ernie Contreras, also receiving screenplay credit. At the time, this case was the most expensive and extensive investigation of its type undertaken by the WGA on behalf of one of its members."

Unfortunately, such moments are few and far between.\" Rita Kempley of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, calling it a \"splendidly original children's fantasy about the world of books.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave another positive review, calling it a \"clever, often engaging, and always fast-paced motion picture\" that \"uses the visual medium to encourage its viewers to reach out with their imagination.\" The Pagemaster earned a Razzie Award nomination for Macaulay Culkin as Worst Actor for his performance in the film (also for Getting Even with Dad and Richie Rich).

Later, cheerleader Minxie Hayes has a vision of Billy Taggart and Darry Jenner, another victim of the Creeper, who attempt to warn her about the Creeper, before he blows out another tire, disabling the bus. With the team stranded, the Creeper abducts bus driver Betty Borman and coaches Charlie Hanna and Dwayne Barnes. When the Creeper returns, he singles out six of the students: Dante Belasco, Jake Spencer, Minxie Hayes, Scotty Braddock, Andy \"Bucky\" Buck, and Deaundre \"Double D\" Davis. Minxie has another vision in which Darry says the Creeper emerges every twenty-third spring, for twenty-three days to eat humans, and she tells the other students. After hearing several police reports, the Taggarts go hunting for the Creeper and soon make radio contact with the school bus. The Creeper attacks Bucky, but Rhonda stabs it through the head with a javelin. Dante begins prodding the Creeper's wing, only for it to grab and decapitate him. The Creeper tears off its injured head and uses Dante's severed head to replace its own. The students decide to leave the bus to find help, but the Creeper returns and chases them into a field, where it kills Jake and takes Scotty. When the Creeper attacks Jonny, Chelsea, and Bucky on the bus again, the Taggarts arrive and Jack shoots it with a home-made harpoon, which the Creeper fights him off, managing to escape after flipping over the bus. Rhonda, Izzy Cohen, and Double D find a truck and attempt to escape but are chased by the Creeper again. Izzy pushes Rhonda out of the truck before causing the vehicle to crash, injuring both Double D and the Creeper, who loses an arm, a leg, and a wing, although Izzy crawls from the wreckage before the truck explodes. The Creeper continues to pursue Double D by leaping towards him and, when it has Double D pinned down, Jack shows up and shoots the Creeper in the head with the harpoon. He repeatedly stabs the Creeper in the chest but it goes into a hibernation state before it can die. Twenty-three years later, a group of teenagers drives to the Taggart farm, where the Creeper is a sideshow attraction, called \"The Bat Out of Hell\", and the middle-aged Jack Jr. is charging entrance fees. They see an elderly Jack watching it with the harpoon at his side, and when they ask him if he is waiting for something, he looks up at the Creeper and says: \"about three more days, give or take a day or two\"."

        "content": "Grey's Anatomy is an American medical drama television series that premiered on March 27, 2005, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) as a mid-season replacement. The series focuses on the lives of surgical interns, residents, and  attendings as they develop into seasoned doctors while balancing personal and professional relationships. The title is an allusion to Gray's Anatomy, a classic human anatomy textbook first published in 1858 in London and written by Henry Gray. Shonda Rhimes developed the pilot and continued to write for the series until 2015. Krista Vernoff, who previously worked with Rhimes, is now the showrunner. Rhimes was also one of the executive producers alongside Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg, and recently, Ellen Pompeo. Although the series is set in Seattle, it is filmed primarily in Los Angeles, California. The series revolves around Dr. Meredith Grey, played by Ellen Pompeo. Grey is first featured as an intern and later becomes the chief of general surgery, all the while exploring the ups and downs of a surgeon's life. The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Katherine Heigl, Justin Chambers, T. R. Knight, Chandra Wilson, James Pickens Jr., Isaiah Washington, and Patrick Dempsey. The cast has undergone major changes throughout the series' run. At the start of the 18th season, the show had a large ensemble of 13 actors\u2014including three from the original cast (Pompeo, Wilson, and Pickens). Grey's Anatomy is the longest-running scripted primetime show currently airing on ABC, and the longest scripted primetime series carried by ABC. Its success catapulted longtime series regulars including Pompeo, Dempsey, and Oh to worldwide recognition; they were among the top five highest-earning television actors in 2013. While the show's ratings have fallen over the course of its run (it was once among the overall top-ten shows in the United States), it is still one of the highest-rated shows among the 18\u201349 demographic, and the #3 drama on all of broadcast television in the United States. The series was the highest revenue-earning show on television in terms of advertising in the 2007\u201308 season; in 2017, it was ranked tenth on the list. In its fifteenth season, Grey's Anatomy ranked as ABC's highest-rated drama. As of February 28, 2019, it was the longest-running American primetime medical drama series. On May 10, 2019, the series was renewed for a 16th and 17th season. The 16th season premiered on September 26, 2019. The 17th season premiered on November 12, 2020, about two months later than usual, due to production delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 10, 2021, the series was renewed for an 18th season, with Pompeo, Wilson, and Pickens all returning. The 18th season premiered on September 30, 2021. In January 2022, the series was renewed for a nineteenth season, with Pompeo agreeing to return. The show now has a spin-off series named Station 19. Grey's Anatomy has been well received by critics throughout much of its run and has been included in various critics' year-end top 10 lists. Since its inception, the show has been described by the media outlets as a television \"phenomenon\" or a \"juggernaut\", owing to its longevity and dominant ratings. It is considered to have had a significant effect on popular culture and has received numerous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama and a total of 38 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including two for Outstanding Drama Series. The cast members have also received accolades for their individual performances."

During her time as an intern, Grey works alongside fellow physicians Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with hectic schedules and stressful residency requirements. During their internship, they are overseen by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior resident, who works with attending physicians Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love-interest, and Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), head of cardiothoracic surgery, who becomes Yang's fianc\u00e9. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, is the former lover of Ellis Grey. During the first 6 seasons, Burke, O'Malley, and Stevens all depart the series. The series also shows drama and emotions focused on Meredith's life. In addition to Webber, Burke, and Shepherd, the surgical wing is primarily supervised by Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), Shepherd's ex-wife and the head of OB/GYN, neonatal and fetal surgery who leaves for Los Angeles at the end of season 3; Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), head of plastic surgery; Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), a resident who later becomes head of orthopedic surgery and leaves Seattle for New York at the end of the twelfth season; Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), as head of cardiothoracic surgery, who leaves Seattle Grace in season 5 after a disagreement with Torres, with whom she shared a brief relationship; Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), as head of trauma who later marries and divorces Yang; Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), as head of pediatric surgery, and later head of maternal / fetal surgery who marries Torres; Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), as head of cardiothoracic surgery who departs at the end of season 8 but returns in season 14; and Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), Derek's sister, who is hired to replace him as head of neurosurgery. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith's paternal half-sister, joins the residency program in season 4 until her death with her love-interest Mark Sloan in the plane crash at the end of season 8, after which Seattle Grace is renamed Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in their memory. Former Mercy-West residents April Kepner (Sarah Drew) and Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) join Seattle Grace following an administrative merger in season 6. Other additions include Leah Murphy (Tessa Ferrer), who departs at the end of season 10 but returns during season 13; Shane Ross (Gaius Charles), who leaves with Yang for Zurich, Switzerland in the season 10 finale; Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton), who resigns at the end of season 13; Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington), who marries Karev; Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), the former love-interest of Meredith's maternal half-sister Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary), who also serves as head of cardiothoracic surgery; and Ben Warren (Jason George), an anesthesiologist-turned-resident-turned-firefighter, who marries Bailey. Season 11 sees the death of Derek Shepherd, and in season 12, attending cardiovascular surgeon Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson) joins the show. In the early episodes of season 14, Riggs leaves the series to start a life with Owen's long-lost sister Megan (Abigail Spencer); by the season finale, Robbins, Kepner and Warren also depart the show. Midway through the sixteenth season, Karev made his final appearance on the series. During the seventeenth season, DeLuca is stabbed while chasing a child abductor and despite efforts of Hunt and Altman, he passes away. Avery and Koracick also depart in season 17 as Avery moves to Boston to take over his family's Foundation, whilst Koracick leaves to assist Avery."

Each installment typically begins with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode. Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. The season typically ends with a dramatic event such as a death or character departure. Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show also emphasizes their personal, as well as their professional, lives. The series often sets aside medical ethics concerns in order to foreground character development and relationships. While the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, they also display competitive spirit and seek praise. After arriving at the hospital each morning, residents may argue over who gets the challenge of a certain patient who has arrived that day. A hospital superior assigns cases, often generating tension between the residents and their superiors. Within each episode are shifts from the doctors interacting with their patients, to scenes with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or romantic, which may produce conflicts between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voiceover, typically contrasting or following up on the initial one."

Shepherd is introduced as Meredith's love-interest, while Burke begins a relationship with Yang. Introduced in the show's second season are obstetrician-gynecologist and neonatal surgeon, Addison Montgomery, plastic surgeon Mark Sloan (nicknamed 'McSteamy' by the interns), from New York, and orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres. Montgomery is Shepherd's estranged wife who arrives in Seattle seeking reconciliation with him, Sloan is Shepherd's former best-friend, who aided the breakdown of his marriage by having an affair with Montgomery, while Torres is introduced as a love-interest, and eventual wife for O'Malley. The penultimate episode of season 3 introduces Lexie Grey, Meredith's half-sister who unexpectedly decides to pursue her internship at Seattle Grace Hospital after her mother's sudden death, and begins an on-again, off-again relationship with Sloan. Burke and Yang, having been engaged, endeavor to plan their wedding, while Montgomery departs the show in the season 3 finale, relocating to California, seeking a new life. The season three finale also shows Burke's exit from the show, after leaving Yang at the altar on their wedding day. Grey, Yang, Stevens, Karev are all promoted to residents, in the season 4 premiere, while O'Malley is forced to repeat his internship year, following his failing of the intern exam. Subsequently, Torres and O'Malley divorce one another, due to him having an affair with Stevens, initially concealing it from Torres. Early in the fourth season, cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn becomes Torres's love-interest. During the fifth season, Hahn departs from the series after a disagreement with Torres, and O'Malley retakes his intern exam, passes and joins his fellow physicians as a resident. 2 new characters are introduced, former United States Army trauma surgeon Dr. Owen Hunt, and pediatric surgeon Dr. Arizona Robbins. Hunt becomes a love-interest for Yang, while Robbins begins a relationship with Torres. When Stevens is diagnosed with stage IV metastatic melanoma, she and Karev get married at the conclusion of the fifth season. In addition, Meredith and Shepherd marry, with their vows written on a blue post-it note. O'Malley dies in the premiere of the sixth season, due to injuries sustained from saving a woman from being hit by a bus, and Stevens later departs Seattle following a communication breakdown with her then-husband Karev following the Seattle Grace merger with Mercy West Hospital. Several new characters are introduced as Seattle Grace Hospital merges with Mercy West Hospital. Residents April Kepner, Jackson Avery, Reed Adamson, and Charles Percy, all transfer to Seattle Grace Hospital from Mercy West Hospital, and Avery has a brief relationship with Lexie, until she reunites with Sloan. Subsequently, Teddy Altman is introduced as the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery. In the season 6 finale, a deceased patient's grieving husband embarks on a shooting spree at the hospital, injuring Karev, Shepherd, and Hunt, and killing residents Adamson and Percy. In the shooting's emotional reverberations, Yang and Hunt abruptly marry, not wanting to risk separation. Torres and Robbins eventually wed, officiated by Bailey. In season eight, Webber steps down and allocates his job to Hunt. As the final year of residency for Meredith, Yang, Karev, Kepner and Avery is coming to a close, the doctors are all planning to relocate to different hospitals to pursue their specialty careers. However, all plans are put on hold when several doctors from Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital are engaged in a plane crash, which kills Lexie and endangers Meredith, Shepherd, Yang, Sloan and Robbins. At the conclusion of the eighth season, Altman is courteously fired by Hunt as she struggles to decide whether or not to take the job as Chief at the United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM). In the season 9 premiere, Sloan dies due to sustained injuries from the plane crash following a brief relapse of temporary health (\"the surge\") and the remaining characters work through their post traumatic stress and Arizona Robbins's loss of limb by way of suing Seattle Grace Mercy West as the hospital was responsible for putting the surgeons on the plane. The season continues with the struggle of the lawsuit and the animosity that it creates within the hospital, Yang and Hunt eventually divorce in order to help the lawsuit. The doctors who were on the plane win the lawsuit, but the payout bankrupts the hospital. They all club together and buy Seattle Grace Mercy West, with the help of the Harper Avery Foundation, and they become the Board of Directors, once being called the \"Grey-Sloan 7\". One of the changes they implement is renaming the hospital to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital in the memory of Lexie Grey and Mark Sloan. Robbins cheats on Torres with a visiting facial reconstruction surgeon and Webber gets electrocuted in the season 9 finale. Grey's Anatomy saw the departure of one of its major players, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh in the season 10 finale. The 11th season also saw the introduction of the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Maggie Pierce, Richard's secret daughter with Ellis Grey. Towards the end of the eleventh season, Derek Shepherd witnesses a car accident and pulls over to help the injured, but his car is hit by a truck with him inside as he attempts to leave the scene. He later dies at another hospital following the doctors' mishandling of his injuries. The season 12 finale saw the departure of one of the show's longest running characters, Callie Torres, played by Sara Ramirez. Altman returns to Seattle at the beginning of the fourteenth season while Robbins and Kepner depart in the season finale to pursue other career opportunities. Season 16 was the last to feature Alex Karev, who moved to Kansas to reunite with Stevens, leaving Grey as the last remaining intern from the original cast. Season 17 saw the departure of Andrew DeLuca, after he was stabbed and ultimately died after pursuing the sex trafficker Opal, and was also the last season to feature Jackson Avery, who moved to Boston in order to run a family foundation and Tom Koracick who also moved to Boston to assist Avery."

        "content": "Shonda Rhimes wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching, and thought it would be interesting to create a show about \"smart women competing against one another\". When asked how she decided to develop a medical drama, Rhimes responded: The series was pitched to ABC Entertainment, who gave the green light. The show was picked up as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal in the 2005 television season. Francie Calfo, executive vice president of development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out: While creating characters, as well as writing the first script, the series' writers had no character descriptions in mind, and hoped to cast the best actor available for each part. Rhimes has said that if the network had not allowed her to create characters this way, she would have been hesitant about moving forward with the series. Female roles, in particular, were developed as multi-faceted characters."

Before the series debuted on March 27, 2005, a few early releases were shown to close friends and family of the producers and actors. The show was scheduled to run in the Boston Legal time slot for 4 weeks. The show's high ratings and viewership resulted in ABC keeping it in that slot for the remainder of the season. ABC Entertainment President, Steve McPherson, commented on the scheduling change: \"Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let [Grey's Anatomy] build on its tremendous momentum through May.\" Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would be changed from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although this did not take place."

        "content": "Grey's Anatomy is produced by ShondaLand, in association with The Mark Gordon Company, and ABC Studios (formerly Touchstone Television). Rhimes, Betsy Beers, Krista Vernoff, Mark Gordon, Rob Corn, and Mark Wilding have all served as executive producers throughout the course of the series. In subsequent seasons, Steve Mulholland, Kent Hodder, Nancy Bordson, James D. Parriott, and Peter Horton have also been executive producers, with Allan Heinberg joining the show in 2006 in this role. As of season eight, the executive producers were Rhimes, Beers, Gordon, Vernoff, Corn, Wilding, and Heinberg. Rhimes is the series head writer, or its most prolific writer. She often promotes the show by answering fan questions on her Twitter account. Other members of the writing staff are Vernoff, Wilding, Peter Nowalk, Stacy McKee, William Harper, Zoanne Clack, Tony Phelan, Joan Rater, and Debora Cahn. From the second through seventh seasons, the writers maintained a blog entitled Grey Matter, where the writer of an episode discussed background of the writing. Directors vary by episode, with Rob Corn directing most frequently, followed by Tom Verica. Horton, Edward Ornelas, and Jessica Yu have also directed a substantial number of episodes. Cast members Chandra Wilson, Debbie Allen, and Kevin McKidd have each directed multiple episodes. Grey's Anatomy has been edited by Susan Vaill since the show's inception, and David Greenspan was named an editor in 2006. Casting directors Linda Lowy and John Brace have been a part of the production team since 2005.

In an interview, Ellen Pompeo (Meredith Grey) stated \"We always ask Linda, you know, what is this procedure, what is this surgery, when is this performed, what happens\"- various members of the cast spoke of the importance of having real surgeons around especially in learning how to properly hold instruments, how to accurately use medical language and develop their characters in an authentic way; most of the cast members observed real surgery in real life as preparation for their roles. The production staff is part of a Grey's Anatomy softball team that competes against other television shows, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation."

        "content": "Grey's Anatomy used a color-blind casting technique, resulting in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role was cast without the character's race being pre-determined, keeping Rhimes's vision of diversity. The production staff began casting with the program's title character, Dr. Meredith Grey, which Rhimes said was a challenging role to cast. \"I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile (2002),\" said Rhimes, \"and after a while, they were like, 'We think we can get that girl from Moonlight Mile.\" The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read for the role of Cristina instead. Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd. Rob Lowe was offered the role, but turned it down as he had already agreed to star in another medical drama Dr. Vegas. When Patrick Dempsey read for the part, \"he was just perfect,\" according to Rhimes. The only character developed with a racial description in mind was Dr. Miranda Bailey, who is portrayed by Chandra Wilson. Her character was first described as a tiny blonde with curly hair, but when Wilson began speaking, Rhimes reported: \"[Wilson] is exactly who Miranda is.\" James Pickens Jr. was selected to appear as Dr. Richard Webber in the series' pilot and first season. Katherine Heigl wanted to portray Dr. Izzie Stevens as a brunette but was requested to retain her natural blonde for the part. Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Dr. Preston Burke, initially read for the role of Shepherd but was cast as Burke, because the original actor to play Burke had to withdraw. T. R. Knight signed on for the pilot as Dr. George O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the character was multi-faceted. Rounding out the season 1 cast was Justin Chambers as Dr. Alex Karev, a character who was not originally included in the show's pilot, but added through digital editing and additional scenes. Season 2 marked the introduction of attending doctors Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). They were initially cast as recurring characters, but both were given star billing at the opening of season 3. Ramirez was cast after ABC executives offered them a role in the network show of their choice; Dane had previously auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in the pilot episode. Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) also joined the show in season 2, after making a guest appearance in the season 1 finale In October 2006, Washington allegedly insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an on-set altercation with Dempsey, and ABC terminated Washington's contract at the end of season 3. Washington returned for a guest appearance in season 10. At the conclusion of season 3, Walsh departed the show to pursue the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, Private Practice, but continues to make guest appearances. Chyler Leigh joined the cast as a main character in season 4 as Dr. Lexie Grey, Meredith's half-sister. Leigh had appeared as a guest-star in the final 2 episodes of season 3. On the selection of Leigh for the role of Lexie, Rhimes said: \"Chyler stood out ... It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting.\" Dr. Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who first appeared on Grey's Anatomy in season 2, returned as a series regular in season 4. Shortly after the announcement that Smith would be a regular member of the cast, Entertainment Weekly Michael Ausiello, reported that her character, Hahn, would depart from Grey's Anatomy on November 6, 2008. E! Online Kristin Dos Santos asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show had been forced by the ABC network, as part of an attempt to \"de-gay\" Grey's Anatomy. Rhimes countered these claims, saying that \"we did not find that the magic and chemistry with Brooke's character would sustain in the long run\". Season 5 introduced actor Kevin McKidd (Dr. Owen Hunt), who was signed as a series regular after originally being cast for a specific story-arc. In addition, Jessica Capshaw (Dr. Arizona Robbins) was originally introduced for a 3-episode arc, but her contract was extended until the end of the season; she became a series regular in the sixth season. Knight departed the show at the conclusion of season 5, citing an unhappiness with the development and lack of screen-time for his character. Directly following Knight's departure, Entertainment Weekly reported that Heigl had not returned to the set as scheduled after her maternity leave. It was later confirmed that Heigl would not return to the show at all. Kim Raver, who was cast as recurring character Dr. Teddy Altman in season 6, was given star billing later in the season. Sarah Drew (Dr. April Kepner) and Jesse Williams (Dr. Jackson Avery), who both made their series debuts as recurring characters in the sixth season, and received star-billing in the seventh. The 6 original actors' contracts expired after season 8, but in May 2012, Pompeo, Oh, Chambers, Wilson, Pickens Jr. and Dempsey renewed their contracts with the show for another 2 years. At the conclusion of season 8, Leigh's character Lexie Grey departed from the show at Leigh's request, and with Rhimes's agreement. Raver's character Teddy Altman was also written out of the show during the season 8 finale. Rhimes said that Raver had been offered a contract renewal, but declined. In July 2012, Dane (Sloan) confirmed that he was departing the show to pursue other projects; he made his final appearances in the first 2 episodes of season 9. With the start of season 10, Camilla Luddington, Gaius Charles, Jerrika Hinton and Tessa Ferrer were introduced to the show as series regulars. They were first introduced to the show in season 9 as the new interns. On August 13, 2013, Oh (Cristina) announced that the show's tenth season would be her final one. In March 2014, it was announced that Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Preston Burke in the first 3 seasons of the show, would make a guest appearance to coincide with the departure of series regular Sandra Oh, his former on-screen love-interest. Neither Charles's nor Ferrer's contracts were renewed for season 11. On May 2, 2014, it was announced that, in addition to Pompeo and Dempsey, all the original remaining cast members\u2014apart from Oh\u2014signed 2-year deals, extending their contracts through seasons 11 and 12. Despite joining the series in season 2, Sara Ramirez was on the same negotiation schedule as the season 1 cast and also signed a new 2-year deal. On April 23, 2015, Dempsey departed the show during the show's eleventh season, despite the fact that he still had a year left in his contract. On the night of the season 12 finale, May 19, 2016, Sara Ramirez announced that they would be leaving the show following the decision to not renew their contract. On January 17, 2018, it was announced by ABC that Ellen Pompeo's contract had been renewed through season 16. Not only did the contract renewal insure that Pompeo will return as Meredith Grey, but it made her a producer of Grey's Anatomy and a co-executive producer of Station 19. The deal made Pompeo the highest-paid actress currently on a dramatic TV series, with her making $575,000 per episode and over $20 million yearly. On March 8, 2018, it was announced that series regulars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew would not be returning for season 15 after executive producers decided to let them go. In May 2018, it was confirmed that Kim Raver, who made returning guest appearances in season 14, would once again become a series regular, beginning with season 15. In January 2020, Justin Chambers announced that he had departed the series and that his final episode had aired on November 14, 2019. In March 2021, Giacomo Gianniotti departed the series after wanting to pursue new things such as directing. In May 2021, Jesse Williams and Greg Germann both left the main cast, although Germann is expected to remain on the show in a guest capacity. In September 2021, it was announced that Kate Walsh would be returning as Addison Montgomery for multiple episodes in season 18."

Premiering on September 25, 2005, and concluding on May 15, 2006, the season consisted of 27 episodes. As the original first season order was for 13 episodes, 5 episodes were held for season 2, as ABC   decided to close the first season of Grey's Anatomy on the same night as Desperate Housewives finale. During season 2, Grey's Anatomy produced 2 specials recapping the events of recent episodes, narrated by Bailey, entitled \"Straight to the Heart\" and \"Under Pressure\".

        "content": "Grey's Anatomy has been well received among critics. The show holds an average score of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave an insight on the series' overwhelming success and the lows, writing that the quality arc is \"all over the place\". She noted the steady build-up in the first season; the series skyrocketing into a phenomenon in the second season; the gradual dip in season three; and \"some seriously bumpy moments\" in the fourth and the fifth season, which was interrupted by the writers' strike. VanDerWerff felt that the \"climb begins again in season six\". Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly in a review wrote, \"I believe the show's best season to date is season 2. Let me make it clear that I'm not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show's history, and most of them didn't last a full season.\" adding, \"I still enjoy the show, and I'll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey's Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as 'McDreamy', the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it's also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run.\" The site lauded the show saying, \"On average, it's been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show's hospital setting. It's been, by turns, a good soap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family.\" The first season received positive reviews which steadily built up, with Gary Levin of USA Today calling Grey's Anatomy one of the top shows on television. The New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a \"winner\", whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating \"You simply can't stop watching.\" The Washington Post Tom Shales was critical of season one, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: \"The show is much more a matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different.\" Shortly after its initial airing, the Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan called Grey's Anatomy the new Friends (a concluded National Broadcasting Company (NBC) sitcom following the lives of a group of young adults, that for all of its 10-year run was in the top-5 for viewer ratings). The second season received high critical acclaim: top critics like Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the show a \"phenomenon\", adding the show was, \"one of the best TV shows around\", while Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly later during the tenth season called the second \"the show's best season to date\". However, Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures opined that Grey's Anatomy is a mere combination of Scrubs, ER, Sex and the City and The Love Boat. It further garnered positive reviews: Christopher Monfette of IGN added \"The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships, whimsical banter and challenging life-lessons; all to a montage-fetish, indie-rock soundtrack.\" Todd Gilchrist, also from IGN, called the season \"terrific\" adding, \"Indeed, one of the best currently on television. While it remains to be seen what the creators do with it, now that it's become an outright event program, the season demonstrates that Rhimes and co. know what to do with the opportunities presented them. whether you're male or female, this is the kind of entertainment that small-screen devotees and folks fed up with television need to see.\" The title character of Grey's Anatomy, Meredith, has received both overwhelmingly positive and weary feedback by critics along the course of the show, with the development of the character garnering praise from majority critics. Earlier reactions for Meredith were mixed; in a 2006 review, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times dubbed to her as \"the heroine of Grey's Anatomy\". A reviewer for BuddyTV praised the distinct uniqueness in the character calling Meredith an \"unconventional heroine\" adding that the character was, \"Neither black nor white but always ... wait for it ... many shades of grey. The reviewer and to add that even in her lighter moments, she has still been \"dark and twisty.\" The sentiment was shared by Glenn Diaz who remarked, \"You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy.\" When Pompeo did not receive a nomination 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, for her work as Meredith. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times suggested that Pompeo, \"has worked very hard ... to make Meredith Grey an interesting character\", and should have received a nomination. IGN Monfette, less impressed by the character, criticized her storyline as \"some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do.\" Robert Rorke of the New York Post was critical of Meredith's relationship with Derek Shepherd, writing: \"She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless 'McDreamy' soliloquies.\" The development of the character has received praise from critics. Reviewing the first part of the eighth season, TV Fanatic wrote: \"this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season.\" Rick Porter reviewing the episode \"How to Save a Life\" from the eleventh season for Zap2it wrote, \"Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, \"How to Save a Life\" would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added How to Save a Life\" may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Ellen Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show.\" Janalen Samson of BuddyTV lauded the Meredith's development throughout the series saying, \"When one considers how this character has grown over eleven seasons, it really is amazing. Kudos to Ellen Pompeo for her fine work. She's actually done the impossible, because I actually care what happens to Meredith Grey.\" Reviewing the season 12 premiere, \"Sledgehammer\", critics including Alex Hawkins of the Western Gazette again highlighted Pompeo's being due for an Emmy Award. The majority of the supporting cast of Grey's Anatomy have been well received as well, with the New York Post Rorke deeming Stevens to be \"the heart-and-soul\" of Grey's Anatomy, whereas Eyder Peralta of the Houston Chronicle was critical of her character development, stating: \"[She's] the reason I don't watch Grey's Anatomy anymore.\" Kelli Catana of The Huffington Post named Yang \"the best damn character\" and deemed \"the Meredith/Yang relationship the most true friendship on network television.\" Television Without Pity writer Lauren Shotwell claimed Yang is \"the only one of these five [residents] that regularly acts like an actual doctor\". Analyzing Alex Karev, Rachel Simon called him \"underrated\", and she pointed out that his personal growth never seems to get acknowledged, as \"Alex has evolved, slowly and realistically, into a genuinely good person whose faults don't miraculously disappear, but take a backseat to much better qualities.\" Robert Bianco of USA Today said Dempsey has a \"seemingly effortless way of humanizing Derek's 'dreamy' appeal with ego and vanity\". His friendship with Mark Sloan has been well received. Victor Balta said \"they've demonstrated an easy chemistry that makes for some of the great comic relief around Seattle Grace Hospital.\" Addison Montgomery was deemed \"sassy and bright and interesting.\" TV Guide said of Walsh's stint on Grey's Anatomy that she \"adds spice to an already hot show.\" Callie Torres, after having previously received mixed reviews, was praised for her bisexual storyline. Critics added that the character was anchored by stellar performances by Sara Ramirez. Lexie Grey, having initially been criticized, became a critics' favorite in the series. Alex Keen of The Trades wrote that Lexie's \"presence and confidence have increased quite a bit ... and actress, Chyler Leigh, does a fantastic job of making this progression feel seamless. Since the series has defused the tension between Little Grey and Big Grey (aka Meredith), Lexie has clear sailing through the season and steals the show as one of the best current characters on the series.\" With the departure of several cast members throughout the seasons, many new characters have been added to the drama's ensemble. McKidd and Capshaw were referred to as \"fresh additions\" to the series, by Monfette of IGN. Matt Roush of TV Guide commented: \"Hunt is the most encouraging thing to happen to Grey's Anatomy in quite a while.\" Matt Mitovich of TV Guide noted that Robbins \"quickly established herself as a fan favorite\", describing her as \"a breath of fresh air in the often-angsty halls of Seattle Grace. On April Kepner and Jackson Avery, Courtney Morrison of TVFanatic wrote, \"April has grown since her character was introduced ... she's honest. A girl with principles is a girl you want to do well.\" He described her and Avery as \"a couple for whom viewers can root\". Speaking of the new cast members, in addition to the remaining original ones, Robert Bianco from USA Today called them the show's \"best ensemble in years\". Regarding season three, Bill Carter of The New York Times called Grey's Anatomy \"television's hottest show\", adding: \"[No show] is expected to challenge Grey's Anatomy for prime-time pre-eminence.\" Contrasting with Carter's view, Monfette of IGN said that it speedily found itself \"mired in the annoying and absurd\", adding: \"This third season may very well represent a case of over-writing a concept that has, perhaps tragically, run bone-dry on narrative fuel.\" At the conclusion of season three, Entertainment Weekly Gregory Kirschling said \"the show lacked a defining happy, warm-gooseflesh moment\", adding that the season \"didn't leave you dying for the [next] season premiere\". Speaking of the fourth season, Laura Burrows of IGN said the series became \"a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic\", adding: \"This season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot.\" In contrast to the moderately negative feedback the third and fourth seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said of the fifth season: \"Overall, it feels more like the good old days than Grey's Anatomy has in a long time.\" Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five \"hits on all the things the show does so well\", adding: \"There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears.\" Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: \"Grey's has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did.\" The series has a score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on five reviews for season seven. In response to the season, Bianco from USA Today commented: \"Happily, it now seems to have landed on solid ground.\" Also of the seventh season, Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Armstrong said: \"It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons,\" whereas Verne Gay of Newsday commented: \"Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part.\" HitFix gave a positive review saying that, \"season seven overall has been one of the show's strongest ever.\" and added, \"There was a time when Grey's Anatomy was this show where I suffered through a lot of stuff that made me cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could do so well. Over the last couple of years, it's evolved into a show that's much more consistent in tone, where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching.\" Speaking of season eight, Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly called it a \"so-so season\", and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"emotional\". Also acknowledging the fan base, Verne Gay of Newsday wrote \"Grey's has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it.\" regarding the eighth season. The ninth season received more positive reviews, Rob Salem of Toronto Star called it \"a solid return to form.\" Praising the friendship between Meredith and Cristina of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"There's still one good reason to keep watching: Where else can you find such deep friendships between female co-workers\". The tenth season was also marked with praise, Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly wrote \"There's true sorrow here along with the passion, which keeps their dynamic so intriguing to me.\" Caroline Siede from The A.V. Club wrote in her review for the tenth season \"At its best, Grey's Anatomy is about everyday bravery, sacrifice, and courage. At its worst, it's a melodramatic, moralizing soap opera. Both sides are on display as the show heads confidently into its 10th season.\" Many sources, including Rachel Simon of Bustle and Nicole Pomarico of Wetpaint, claimed that Sandra Oh's performance during her final season on Grey's Anatomy is worthy of an Emmy nomination. Bryce Olin of Netflix ranked Grey's 9th among the 50 Best TV Shows on Netflix stating, \"It's a tough call, but based on Grey's casting choices and revolutionary portrayals of female doctors in the series, I'm willing to argue that Grey's Anatomy is the best medical drama of all time. Obviously, Shonda Rhimes didn't reinvent the wheel with the series, but there's no denying its popularity.\" adding, \"I understand its significance in the pop culture sphere.\" He also stated that the show could go higher in the ranks with the upcoming season stating, \"Apparently, Grey's Anatomy fans are passionate about their show, although it seems like they've been closeted for the last few years. I'd love to move Grey's Anatomy even higher on the ranking, but I'll have wait until the eleventh season comes to Netflix.\" The show was criticized for its handling of a controversy: The Grey's Anatomy scandal revolved around actor Isaiah Washington using a homophobic slur on set. Mainstream media coverage scapegoated this scandal as \u201cblack masculinity for perpetrating homophobia, thus containing both sexual and racial difference in the name of tolerance.\u201d"

When [the] final shows air, every place in New York City is empty. You could get a table at the best restaurants.\" The Daily Beast Jace Lacob also considered the show an impact, comparing its success to that of Friends, and calling it a \"cultural phenomenon\". Steve Sternberg, a media analyst with Magna Global USA explained that the show appeals to a broad audience, writing: \"Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. People are looking for shows they can watch with other household members.\" In its initial seasons, Grey's Anatomy introduced a \"Mc-labeling\" surge, which started when various characters dubbed Dempsey's character \"McDreamy\". Canadian newspaper the National Post considers this trend a \"phenomenon\". Analyzing the show's impact on culture, Dessylyn Arnold of Yahoo! Voices noted that the \"Mc-labeling\" trend has been parodied on other shows including ER and Degrassi: The Next Generation. Mark Lawson of The Guardian has credited Grey's Anatomy with popularizing the \"songtage\", or musical montage segments. Parodying this, MADtv spoofed the show in 2006, making fun of the series' emotional scenes including those accompanied by a musical montage. Grey's Anatomy has also been credited to helping redefine \"good\" television; The A.V. Club writes, \"Since The Sopranos burst onto the scene, we've too often classified a show as \"good\" based on how closely it adhered to the dark, violent, male-centric template set out by that particular show. It's time for that to end. At its best, Grey's Anatomy has been among the very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it's been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even when it seems to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, Grey's Anatomy is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say.\" The series placed at No. 66 on Entertainment Weekly \"New TV Classics\" list in 2007, and was declared the third-highest rated show for the first ten years of the IMDb (2002\u20132012). The show's premise has inspired the creation of A Coraz\u00f3n Abierto, a Colombian adaptation of Grey's Anatomy, which in turn spawned a Mexican version of the same name. An additional study conducted by Brian Quick of the University of Illinois indicated that the show's portrayal of doctors being \"smart, good looking, capable, and interesting\", leads viewers to associating real-world doctors to be that way. Surgical resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: \"None of [the characters] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is so far away from the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't have time to do your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes.\" In 2011, a woman residing in Sheboygan, Wisconsin became unresponsive due to an asthma attack. Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy. In 2017, an Israeli woman saved her husband by performing cardiac massage she learned from Grey's Anatomy, The woman performed cardiac massage for 20 minutes before medical personal arrived and transferred the husband to Shaare Zedek Medical Center. The mid-season premiere of the fourteenth season was entitled \"1-800-799-7233\", the National Domestic Violence Hotline; upon release on January 18, 2018, the move was received favorably and viewers variously changed their Twitter usernames to the same and used the platform to bring awareness to both the hotline and the issue of domestic abuse."

Subsequent reports confirmed the decision, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of Grey's Anatomy would serve as a backdoor pilot for the proposed spin-off. The cast of Grey's Anatomy was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, she should have been consulted, and Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Stevens. The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007, sees Montgomery take a leave of absence from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best-friend from Los Angeles, Naomi Bennett (Merrin Dungey, later Audra McDonald), a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist. While in Los Angeles, she meets Bennett's colleagues at the Oceanside Wellness Center. The two-hour broadcast entitled \"The Other Side of This Life\" served as the twenty-second and twenty-third episodes of the third season, and was directed by Michael Grossman, according to Variety. The cast included Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein, Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Chris Lowell, and Merrin Dungey. KaDee Strickland's character, Charlotte King, who would be introduced in the spin-off's first-season premiere, did not appear in the backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. She did not have to audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes. Also not present in the backdoor pilot was McDonald, due to her character, Naomi Bennett, being portrayed by a different actress, Merrin Dungey. However, on June 29, 2007, ABC announced that Dungey would be replaced, with no reason given for the change. The drama was titled Private Practice, and its premiere episode followed the second part of the season debut of Dancing with the Stars, and provided a lead-in to fellow freshman series Dirty Sexy Money. Pushing Daisies, a third new series for the evening, rounded out the lineup as a lead-in to Private Practice. The series ended its run on January 22, 2013, after 6 seasons."

Five volumes of the Grey's Anatomy Original Soundtrack have been released . For the first 2 seasons, the show's main title theme was an excerpt from \"Cosy in the Rocket\", by British duo Psapp; it is featured on the first soundtrack album released via ABC's corporate cousin, Hollywood Records, on September 27, 2005. The second soundtrack, featuring songs from the series' second season, was released on September 12, 2006, followed by a third soundtrack with music from the third season. Following the seventh season musical episode \"Song Beneath the Song\", \"Grey's Anatomy: The Music Event\" soundtrack was released, with volume 4 of the soundtrack released subsequently. In January 2009, Ubisoft announced that it had signed a licensing agreement with ABC Studios to develop a video game based on Grey's Anatomy. Designed for the Wii, Nintendo DS and PC, Grey's Anatomy: The Video Game was released on March 10, 2009. The game lets the player assume the role of one of the main characters, making decisions for the character's personal and professional life, and competing in a number of minigames. It has been criticized by reviewers because of the simplicity of the mini-games and voice actors who do not play the same characters on the series, with Jason Ocampo of IGN giving it a 6/10 overall rating. The Wii release received mixed reviews, and the Windows release received generally unfavorable reviews. ABC and Nielsen partnered in 2011 to create a Grey Anatomy application for Apple's iPad. The application was designed to allow viewers to participate in polls and learn trivial facts as they watch a live episode. It uses Nielsen's Media-Sync software to listen for the episode and to post features as the episode progresses. The creators of the show set up a real online wedding registry to mark the wedding of Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd. Instead of buying gifts fans were encouraged to donate money to the American Academy of Neurology Foundation."

And Maddy (Kudrow) is a vacuous soap opera actress who has always struggled for her own identity. Despite being as busy with her own life as the others, Eve is the only one of the three who deals with the long term hospitalization of their cantankerous seventy-nine-year-old father, Lou Mozell (Matthau), when he enters the early stages of dementia, and the associated outcomes of that hospitalization.

        "content": "Prison Break is an American serial drama television series created by Paul Scheuring for Fox. The series revolves around two brothers, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller); Burrows has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, and Scofield devises an elaborate plan to help his brother escape prison and clear his name. Along with creator Paul Scheuring, the series is executive produced by Matt Olmstead, Kevin Hooks, Marty Adelstein, Dawn Parouse, Neal H. Moritz, and Brett Ratner who directed the pilot episode. The series' theme music, composed by Ramin Djawadi, was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2006. Prison Break is a joint production between Original Film, Adelstein/Parouse Productions (seasons 1-4), Dawn Olmstead Productions (season 5), Adelstein Productions (season 5), One Light Road Productions (season 5) and 20th Century Fox Television, and is syndicated by 20th Television. The series was originally turned down by Fox in 2003, which was concerned about the long-term prospects of such a series. Following the popularity of serialized prime time television series Lost and 24, Fox decided to back production in 2004. The first season received mostly positive reviews from critics with universal acclaim from audiences. Furthermore, it performed exceptionally in the ratings and was originally planned for a 13-episode run, but was extended to include an extra nine episodes due to its popularity. The subsequent seasons continued to receive strong ratings, however, with some critics claiming the show had overstayed its welcome. Prison Break was nominated for several industry awards, including the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series Drama and the 2006 People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama, which it won. In the United States, all five seasons have been released on DVD and released on Blu-ray internationally. The success of the series has inspired short videos for mobile phones, several official tie-ins in print and on the Internet, and a video game. A spin-off series, Prison Break: Proof of Innocence, was produced exclusively for mobile phones. The series has spawned an official magazine and a tie-in novel. The fourth season of Prison Break returned from its mid-season break in a new timeslot on April 17, 2009, for the series' last six episodes. Two additional episodes, titled \"The Old Ball and Chain\" and \"Free\" were produced, and were later transformed into a standalone feature, titled The Final Break. The events of this feature take place before the last scene of the series finale, and are intended to conclude unfinished plotlines. The feature was released on DVD and Blu-ray July 21, 2009. A nine-episode fifth season was announced by Fox in January 2016. The revival series premiered on April 4, 2017, and concluded on May 30. In January 2018, Fox confirmed that season 6 was in early development; however, in August 2019, Fox announced that it had no current plans to revive Prison Break, with Miller stating late 2020 that he had no plans on returning to the series."

Lincoln is sentenced to death and is incarcerated in Fox River State Penitentiary where he awaits his execution. Lincoln's brother, brilliant structural engineer Michael Scofield, is convinced of Lincoln's innocence and formulates an elaborate escape plan. In order to gain access to Fox River, Michael commits an armed robbery which results in him being sentenced to Fox River. In prison, Michael befriends the prison doctor Sara Tancredi when he pretends to suffer from Type 1 diabetes, in order to gain daily access to the prison's infirmary, where he receives his daily insulin shots. The brothers' fight to ward off the execution is aided by their lifelong friend Veronica Donovan, who begins to investigate the conspiracy that put Lincoln in jail. However, they are hindered by covert agents, members of an organization called \"The Company\". The Company was responsible for framing Lincoln, and they did so because of Lincoln's father Aldo Burrows, and his former connections with The Company. The brothers, along with six other inmates, Fernando Sucre, Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell, Benjamin Miles \"C-Note\" Franklin, David \"Tweener\" Apolskis, John Abruzzi, and Charles \"Haywire\" Patoshik, who come to be known as the Fox River Eight, escape in the episode immediately prior to the season finale, after using their prison industry privileges to dig an escape tunnel underneath the prison."

Brad Bellick gets fired from the prison where he worked as the main guard and chases after the inmates himself for the reward money. Several of the escapees reunite in search of a large cache of money buried long ago by another Fox River inmate, Charles Westmoreland. Federal agent Alexander Mahone is assigned to track down and capture the eight fugitives, but is revealed to be working for The Company, which wants all eight men dead. When Sara discovers her father, Governor Frank Tancredi, has been killed, she meets with Michael, remaining with him as the brothers try to bring down now-President Reynolds, a Company member. To ensure the brothers' safety, Sara allows herself to be arrested and faces trial. During the trial, the testimony of former Secret Service agent Paul Kellerman, who used to work for The Company-controlled President, exonerates Lincoln and Sara. Half of the escapees are killed or recaptured, but the brothers make it to Panama.

        "content": "Prison Break maintains an ensemble cast for each season along with many recurring guest stars. The first season features a cast of ten actors who receive star billing, who were based in Chicago or at Fox River State Penitentiary. The second season features a cast of nine actors who receive billing; three characters are downgraded from series regular to recurring status, another is upgraded, and a new character is introduced. The third season introduces four new characters; two of whom are prisoners at Penitenciar\u00eda Federal de Sona. Most of the changes in the cast have been due to character deaths. Series creator, Paul Scheuring, explains that killing off major characters \"makes the audience that much more fearful for our protagonists\" and that \"it actually does help us in terms of reducing story lines\". The two protagonists of the series, Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows, are the only characters to have appeared in every episode of the series. Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a high school drop-out and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully convicted of the murder of Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set on the first day of filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors. Wentworth Miller as Michael Scofield: Michael is Lincoln's brother (his last name is his mother's maiden name), and worked as a structural engineer before devoting full-time to his brother's case. In order to save his brother's life, Michael creates an elaborate plan to help his brother escape from prison. In an interview, Paul Scheuring recalled that most of the actors who tested for the role \"would come in playing mysterious, but it was so cheesy and false.\" A week before the start of production, Miller auditioned for the role and impressed Scheuring with his performance; he was cast the following day. Amaury Nolasco as Fernando Sucre: Sucre develops a friendship with Michael during time at Fox River State Penitentiary, where he was his cell-mate. Initially, his character's story focuses on his wish to reunite with his fianc\u00e9e. Upon receiving the pilot script, Nolasco's first thought was that it was \"one of those failed pilots that the network did not really want\" since most of the series pilots would have started production by that time. Admitting that he does not like to read, Nolasco was amazed that the script was a \"huge page-turner\". Prior to his last audition for the role, Nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was their favorite choice. Subsequently, he was cast in the role. Robert Knepper as Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell: T-Bag appears in all five seasons of the series as a cunning, violent, and manipulative psychopath, consistently underestimated by those around him. T-Bag will stop at nothing to get what he wants and lets nothing stand in his way. Robin Tunney as Veronica Donovan (seasons 1\u20132): Veronica is Michael and Lincoln's childhood friend who decides to review Lincoln's case at Michael's insistence. She becomes Lincoln's lawyer and appears as a major character in the first season. She also stars in the first episode of the second season. Peter Stormare as John Abruzzi (seasons 1\u20132): Due to his role as the leader of a Chicago mafia, Abruzzi became a prominent figure at Fox River State Penitentiary. He agrees to provide an escape jet plane for Michael in exchange for the location of the eyewitness to his crimes, Otto Fibonacci. He appears regularly in the first half of the first season and makes selected appearances towards the end of the first season and the beginning of the second season. Marshall Allman as Lincoln \"L. J.\" Burrows Jr. (seasons 1\u20134): L. J. is the teenage son of Lincoln Burrows and is greatly affected by his father's death sentence. He is forced into hiding after he becomes the target of the people who want Lincoln dead. Wade Williams as Brad Bellick (seasons 1\u20134): Bellick is introduced as the captain of Fox River's correctional officers. After reading the pilot script, Williams initially did not want to portray the role of Bellick because the character was \"horrible and despicable\". His reluctance stemmed from being the father of a four-year-old daughter. However, his manager persuaded him to audition for the role and Williams landed the role of Bellick. Sarah Wayne Callies as Sara Tancredi (seasons 1\u20132, 4\u20135): Sara is the prison doctor at Fox River and the daughter of Governor Frank Tancredi, who is linked into the plot that brings Lincoln to Fox River. She takes a liking to Michael and eventually aids his escape. She ultimately joins them on the run. Callies was the first actress the producers saw at the audition for the role of Sara Tancredi and was also the first to become a principal cast member. Paul Adelstein as Paul Kellerman (seasons 1\u20132, 4\u20135): Kellerman was introduced as a Secret Service agent working for the Vice President to make sure that the execution of Lincoln Burrows goes smoothly. He appears as a major character in the first and second seasons. Rockmond Dunbar as Benjamin Miles \"C-Note\" Franklin (seasons 1\u20132, 4\u20135): Desperate for his family, C-Note blackmails Michael at Fox River to join his escape team. He appears in the series as a major character in the first and second seasons. William Fichtner as Alexander Mahone (seasons 2\u20134): Introduced as an FBI agent in the second season, Mahone's assignment was to locate the fugitives. Mahone is intellectually matched with Michael and his background unfolds as the series progresses. In the third season he finds himself incarcerated with Michael in Sona and is eventually forced to become his ally through the fourth season. Chris Vance as James Whistler (seasons 3\u20134): Whistler is incarcerated in Sona for the murder of the Mayor's son and appears as a major character in the third season. He also stars in the first episode of the fourth season. Robert Wisdom as Norman \"Lechero\" St. John (season 3): Appearing as a major character in the third season, Lechero is a prisoner at Sona who rules the prison as a dictator and a Panamanian drug kingpin. Danay Garcia as Sofia Lugo (seasons 3\u20134): Sofia was introduced in the third season as Whistler's girlfriend. At the beginning of the fourth season, she begins dating Lincoln Burrows. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe as Gretchen Morgan (seasons 3\u20134): Introduced as \"Susan B. Anthony\", Gretchen is an operative for The Company who is in charge of ensuring the escape of James Whistler. Michael Rapaport as Donald Self (season 4): Introduced in the fourth season, Self is a Department of Homeland Security special agent who teams up with the gang to take down The Company. Mark Feuerstein as Jacob Anton Ness (season 5): Introduced in the fifth season, Jacob is Sara's new husband and an economics professor who is later revealed to be a rogue CIA operative whose responsible for Michael's disappearance.

        "content": "The original concept of Prison Break\u2014a man deliberately getting himself sent to prison in order to help someone escape\u2014was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring thought it was a good idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series. Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds. Thus, the miniseries never materialized. Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24, Fox decided to back the production in 2004. The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script."

        "content": "The majority of the first season of the series was filmed on location in and around Chicago. After it was closed down in 2002, Joliet Prison became the set of Prison Break in 2005, standing in as Fox River State Penitentiary on screen. Scenes set in Lincoln's cell, the infirmary, and the prison yard were all shot on location at the prison. Lincoln's cell was alleged to be the same one in which serial killer John Wayne Gacy was incarcerated, which at least one member of the production crew refused to enter, because it was alleged to be haunted. Other sets were built at the prison, including the cell blocks that housed the general prison population; these blocks had three tiers of cells (as opposed to the real cell block's four) and had cells much larger than real cells to allow more space for the actors and cameras. Exterior scenes were filmed in areas around Chicago, Woodstock, and Joliet in Illinois. Other locations included O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Toronto, Ontario in Canada. Prison Break spent $2 million per episode in the state of Illinois, which cost them a total of $24 million in 2005. Renewed for a second season, Prison Break resumed filming on June 15, 2006, in Dallas, Texas, due to the close proximity of rural and urban settings. Locations within a 30-minute radius of Dallas were chosen which included Little Elm, Decatur, Mineral Wells and McKinney. Many of these locations were used to represent various American towns. The show was expected to spend in excess of $50 million in Texas over the course of the second season. For the final three episodes of the second season, filming took place in Pensacola, Florida to represent Panama. Each episode took eight days to film and approximately $1.4 million went to the local economy per episode. The third season was shot in Dallas and had a budget of $3 million per episode. Several of the exterior scenes with Lincoln and Gretchen negotiating the escape from the Panama jail were shot in the Casco Viejo quarter of Panama City. The principal photography for the fourth season was relocated to Los Angeles, California."

        "content": "The show debuted on August 29, 2005 to an estimated audience of 10.5 million viewers. Fox had not seen such success for summertime Monday numbers since Melrose Place and Ally McBeal aired in September 1998. The premiere was ranked first in both the 18\u201349 and 18\u201334 demographics. The strong debut performance was also matched by various positive reviews. According to The New York Times, Prison Break was \"more intriguing than most of the new network series, and it certainly is one of the most original\", complimenting its ability to create a \"suspenseful thriller\" and its \"authentic look\". Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it as one of the best new shows of 2005. On the other hand, The Washington Post criticized the show for its \"somber pretentiousness\" and \"uniformly overwrought\" performances. Due to its ratings success, Fox decided to extend Prison Break by an extra nine episodes, making it the first new series in the 2005\u20132006 television season to receive a full season order of 22 episodes. The series averaged 9.2 million viewers per week in its first season. The premiere of the second season of Prison Break obtained an average of 9.4 million viewers. The decline was steeper among young-adult viewers with a decrease of 20% in the 18\u201349 demographic compared to its series premiere, but its household rating grew from 3.6% to 3.9% during the last half-hour. Robert Bianco of USA Today commented on the \"harebrained absurdities that have swamped this show\", and blamed the writers for being \"incredibly lazy\" for the continuous use of the tattoo as an \"all-purpose plot fix\". In contrast, Detroit Free Press commended the second-season premiere on matching the standard set by the first season, which delivered \"rocking good entertainment\" due to its \"motley crew of cellblock characters\" and the \"taut, ingenious storytelling of series creator Paul T. Scheuring and his staff.\" The second season obtained its largest audience on the original airdate of the episode, \"Chicago\" with an average of 10.1 million viewers. Overall, the second season averaged 9.3 million viewers per week. The third and particularly fourth season received progressively more negative reviews, as the show's plot diverged from its origin story of breaking out of prison, and focused more on conventional elements of a government conspiracy drama series. Season five received mixed reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 52% based on 21 reviews, with an average score of 6.61/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Prison Break recaptures some of its old urgency in its return, but familiar faces and frenetic action aren't enough to make up for a plot that manages to bore while beggaring belief.\" On Metacritic, the season has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\"."

In France, the broadcasting watchdog, Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA), also complained that the violence in some episodes exceeded the amount allowed for its rating, which is \"not for under 10s\". Under France's regulations, any higher ratings would have moved the show away from its primetime timeslot to a later timeslot.

Online streaming of episodes was postponed after the third episode. However, due to the show's three-week broadcast hiatus prompted by Fox's broadcast of the Major League Baseball playoff games in October, a strategy was developed by News Corporation (the parent company of Fox Broadcasting Company and MySpace) in an attempt to maintain their viewers' interest in the show. Starting in October, Fox began to stream past episodes of the second season on the social networking site MySpace and websites of the network's owned and operated stations (the stations are part of the Fox Television Stations Group).

On October 24, 2007, The Hollywood Reporter reported that a full spin-off series was under development, tentatively titled Prison Break: Cherry Hill. The series was to revolve around an upper-middle-class housewife, Molly, and her stint in a women's prison. However, the producers' original idea to introduce Molly in the third season of Prison Break was later dropped due to the writers' strike. The new series was planned to instead begin under the Prison Break brand similar to CSI: Miami and CSI: NY, but ultimately did not go into production."

It features Steve Carell as the titular 40-year-old virgin Andy, an employee at an electronics store. Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen play co-workers who resolve to help him lose his virginity, and Catherine Keener stars as Andy's love interest, Trish. Watching Carell's performance in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) inspired Apatow to cast him in the lead role for the film, and they wrote The 40-Year-Old Virgin together. It was based on a sketch Carell created with The Second City where a man aged 40 hides a secret. Filming took place in Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley, California, from January to April 2005. The film was released theatrically in the United States on August 19, 2005, through Universal Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics, with Carell being highlighted for his performance, and grossed over $177\u00a0million worldwide on a $26\u00a0million budget. He won accolades from the Golden Schmoes Awards and MTV Movie & TV Awards for this role while Keener received awards from the Boston Society of Film Critics and Los Angeles Film Critics Association.

He gave up trying to have sex after various failed attempts and lives alone in an apartment with a collection of action figures and video games. When a conversation at a poker game with his co-workers David, Jay, and Cal turns to past sexual exploits, they learn that he secretly is still a virgin. Andy is mortified upon discovering the next day that everyone else at work has learned about the secret, including their boss Paula, who is attracted to him and later privately offers to take his virginity. He almost quits work in humiliation before David consoles him and recommends trying again to have sex. David, Jay, and Cal become determined to help Andy achieve this. They all give differing advice on how to interact with women. David invites him to join them for a speed dating event and unsuccessfully tries to reconnect with his ex-girlfriend Amy there. Jay drags Andy to various social events, books a painful chest waxing appointment, and sets him up with a transvestite prostitute, which all end with embarrassing results. Cal advises Andy to simply be confident and ask women questions instead of talking about himself. He practices this on a bookstore clerk named Beth, who quickly becomes intrigued by him. David gives Andy his pornography collection, encouraging him to masturbate. Andy eventually gets a date with a customer named Trish Piedmont. At the end of their first date, they almost have sex but are interrupted by her teenage daughter Marla. Trish suggests they postpone having sex, and Andy enthusiastically agrees; they decide to abstain until their twentieth date. Their relationship flourishes over the following weeks. She encourages Andy's dream of starting a business and helps fund it by selling his collectibles. After Marla argues with Trish over wanting birth control, Andy takes her to a group information session at a sexual health clinic, where she is mocked for being a virgin. Andy admits his own virginity to defend her, earning him Marla's respect. Meanwhile, David suffers an emotional breakdown at work over his obsession with Amy and takes a vow of celibacy, which leads to Paula giving his sales duties to Andy for the day and later promoting him to floor manager due to his high sales quota. As Cal takes on Andy's previous role, he hires a woman named Bernadette to work at the store, hoping to match her with David so he can move on from Amy. After Jay's girlfriend Jill breaks up with him due to his infidelity, he concedes to Andy that sex can ruin a relationship. Following a reconciliation with Jill, Jay later invites Andy and the others to a nightclub to celebrate her pregnancy. Trish tries to initiate sex with Andy on their twentieth date and becomes upset when he resists. They argue, and Andy leaves to meet his friends at a nightclub. He gets drunk and leaves with Beth to have sex at her apartment. Cal gets David and Bernadette to hook up, while Marla convinces Trish to reconcile with Andy. At Beth's, Andy sobers up and decides to leave without having sex, just as his friends arrive and encourage him to go back to Trish. Andy returns to his apartment to find Trish waiting for him. She has found David's porn collection; he tries to explain, but she flees in alarm and disgust, fearing Andy may be a sexual deviant. While pursuing her on his bike, Andy collides with her car, flying through the side of a billboard truck. She rushes to his side, and Andy finally confesses that he is a virgin. Trish is relieved and accepting, and they profess their love for each other. They eventually marry in a lavish ceremony with everyone in attendance, having generated roughly $500,000 from the sales of his action figures to pay for it, before having sex for the first time. The film ends with a musical sequence where all the characters sing and dance to \"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\"."

        "content": "The 40-Year-Old Virgin was Judd Apatow's directorial debut. While serving as a producer for the 2004 film Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, he got the idea to have a film with Carell in the lead role after watching his performance in that, thinking \"It would be great to see a Steve Carell movie\". Apatow later asked him whether he had any movie ideas, and both men wrote The 40-Year-Old Virgin together after the latter expressed desires to make something about a virgin who was aged 40, basing it off a sketch Carell created while performing with the improv comedy troupe The Second City. Carell did many versions of the sketch, trying out different scenarios where the 40-year-old man is hiding a \"big secret.\" Apatow had difficulty coming up with the ending for the film. Garry Shandling suggested it was important to show that Andy was having better sex because he was in love, and instead of directly showing the sex they decided to have Andy sing and have a musical number. Apatow started casting the film early in the development process and tailored its script to the strengths of the actors. He also produced it for Apatow Productions along with Clayton Townsend and Shauna Robertson. Catherine Keener was the first choice for the female lead. Apatow specifically cast Stormy Daniels because he wanted \"someone who's really, really comfortable\" doing nude scenes that were required for the film's plot. A large portion of the dialogue in The 40-Year-Old Virgin was improvised. Keener stated in 2010 that Apatow \"never really would even say cut\" and instead would say \"reload\" when burning through film due to the improvisation, calling the experience \"hysterically funny\". She also mentioned \"you had to kind of lose sense of being self-conscious on that movie because it was sort of an all-in in terms of throwing a joke out or even the writer would sit behind the monitors behind the curtain\". The production used over a million feet of film, a milestone reached on the last day of filming and celebrated with free champagne from Technicolor SA. Filming for The 40-Year-Old Virgin started on January 17, 2005, and wrapped on April 1, 2005. The movie was shot in parts of California, including Studio City, Los Angeles, and San Fernando Valley's Ventura Boulevard. Lyle Workman composed the film's score while Jack N. Green and Brent White respectively served as its cinematographer and editor. Production was halted by Universal Pictures after the first week, due to concerns that the physical appearance of Carell's character resembled that of a serial killer, and that the early footage was not funny. Paul Rudd was criticized for being overweight and the studio was unhappy with how Apatow treated the project like an independent film. Apatow initially had a supporting role in mind for Jason Segel that Universal refused to allow. Because of the accidental deaths of fish used in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the American Humane Association withheld its \"no animals were harmed...\" disclaimer. Seven test screenings were held for the film prior to entering theaters, with each costing approximately $10,000. It was initially considered \"uncomfortably dirty, and not all that funny\" before Apatow reduced the amount of pornography shown. Malco once pleaded for him to cut his scenes, fearing what would happen following its release and insisting: \"My mom is an ordained minister, bro, cut me out of the movie, please. I'm serious.\" This request was declined because Apatow found Malco funny. He was surprised to find out his mother ended up taking \"all of her church friends to see it, multiple times\", and stated The 40-Year-Old Virgin \"changed my career\" by leading to more subsequent job offers without prior auditions. Jay was initially conceived as \"a preppy, fraternity boy\" before Malco's audition prompted him to be reworked into a \"streetwise, trash-talking womanizer\". He liked how the character \"actually learns his own life lessons along with Andy\" and called him the main character's \"sexual antithesis\". Carell's chest was genuinely waxed for the film, with five cameras set up to capture the scene, which was done in one take. He insisted on having an actual wax, telling Apatow: \"It won't be as funny if it's mocked up or if it's special effect. You have to see that this is really happening.\" Malco began to feel sick while watching the waxing and ran away from the set. According to Miki Mia, it took three or four hours to shoot the scene, and she requested that some of the chest hair be trimmed in advance to reduce Carell's pain. Mia noted that only \"a tiny bit\" was removed \"so that it'll look great on camera\". His chest was never fully waxed during the filming, and he shaved off all the hair after three weeks. After Carell blurted out Kelly Clarkson's name during the wax, Clarkson told Rogen in 2021 that it would be \"literally the one thing people know me from\" regardless of anything else she did. Rogen explained he came up with this idea while seeing her on television as he was compiling a list of \"clean jokes\" and \"dirty jokes\" to use in the scene."

On December 11, 2005, a version of the film that runs for 133 minutes was released onto DVD under the banner \"unrated\", which is 17 minutes longer than what was shown in theaters. This additional footage consists of more nudity, Andy asking Viagra for help on how to get rid of an erection, another scene featuring a \"bad encounter\" from his younger days, fantasies of a porn star, and Jay having \"a lot more amusing racial banter\" with Mooj. A 2008 Blu-ray distribution includes the same extended cut along with its theatrical version. For the 100th Anniversary of Universal Pictures, both editions were re-released onto DVD on January 10, 2012. This version also had a similar banner of \"unrated\"."

        "content": "With an approval rating of 84% at the end of 2005, Rotten Tomatoes ranked The-40-Year-Old Virgin as the year's \"Best Reviewed Comedy\" and added it \"proves that Steve Carell has the comedic chops to carry a movie and provide a good share of laughs.\" Ebert and Roeper gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating. Roger Ebert said, \"I was surprised by how funny, how sweet, and how wise the movie really is\" and \"the more you think about it, the better The 40-Year-Old Virgin gets.\" The pair gave minor criticisms, with Ebert describing \"the way she (Catherine Keener as 'Trish') empathizes with Andy\" as \"almost too sweet to be funny\" and Richard Roeper saying that the film was too long, and at times extremely frustrating. Roeper later chose the movie as the tenth best of 2005. The A.V. Club reviewer Nathan Rabin felt Carell made \"a surprisingly graceful transition to a leading-man role\" following his performance in Anchorman, and said both of them worked well due to the \"chemistry and comic chops\" of their casts. He concluded by praising Carell for instilling \"a good deal of complexity and sophistication into his affectionate characterization\" and believed it compensated for a perceived lack of humor in the romance. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the movie an A-, saying that Carell portrays Andy \"in the most surprising way possible: as a credible human being.\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film a \"charmingly bent comedy,\" adding that Carell was an essential component for \"making this film work as well as it does.\" Emanuel Levy gave the film a B+ grade, calling it an R-rated comedy superior to Wedding Crashers that has \"a generous heart and a sweet, almost naive center\" in spite of the profane language used. While Brian Lowry of Variety believed The 40-Year-Old Virgin was slightly too long and \"indulges in some juvenile excesses\", he also felt it often provoked laughs even when \"sophomorically homophobic.\" Rating the movie 3 and a half stars, The Baltimore Sun critic Chris Kaltenbach opened with \"People see the name of this movie and get defensive. What's wrong with being a virgin? they ask. Absolutely nothing, and that's part of the point of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, probably the most sweet-spirited sex comedy ever made. It's pretty funny, too.\" He went on to call the lead character \"endearing\" and \"a marvelous comic invention\". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post is critical of the film but praised Carell for his performance. She wrote Andy remaining \"steadfastly chaste and genuinely humane\" was its most surprising aspect and described him as a character \"of old-fashioned decency in a movie that otherwise flouts it at every turn.\" It was condemned by Harry Forbes of Catholic News Service as \"relentlessly vulgar and frequently offensive\", and by political columnist Cal Thomas for being an example of societal decline in regards to \"self-control or what was once known as purity.\""

        "content": "On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 189 reviews, with an average rating of 7.20/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Steve Carell's first star turn scores big with a tender treatment of its titular underdog, using raunchy but realistically funny comedy to connect with adult audiences.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale. For the film's 10th anniversary, Erik Abriss from Complex and Josh Wigler of MTV News both wrote pieces asserting it remained enjoyable. The former called this \"the best romantic comedy of the 2000s\" as well as \"the most influential\" for shifting \"the comedic zeitgeist from inane to intellectual, from screwball to sensitive, from hyper-masculine to hilariously honest\" while the latter compiled a list of reasons it \"Still Cracks You Up 10 Years Later\", with the first being how the film \"marked the beginning of a modern comedy age\". Writing for The Atlantic on the same day, Megan Garber felt The 40-Year-Old Virgin \"holds up\" and might have become better over time. She wrote that the movie \"launched (almost) a thousand bromantic comedies\", put Apatow \"on the mainstream map\", and made him a \"Hollywood king (and, much more interestingly, queen)-maker\". Garber added it raises questions on how people become adults and established how \"whatever makes an adult now, it isn't, in general, the thing that has defined adulthood for so much of human history: the having of sex.\" Chris Serico of Today said this \"has continued to resonate among comedy fans, and served as a breakthrough movie for its director, Judd Apatow, and his co-writer/star, Steve Carell\" a decade after being released. He went onto praise Carell's performance and stated it \"took his career and the movie to the next level\". A 2018 article from Detroit Free Press contributor Julie Hinds noted that The 40-Year-Old Virgin was \"Michigan's favorite romantic comedy\", and called that ranking \"a fine choice\" when \"Carell's character has a heart of gold\" and \"eventually lands in a solid, committed relationship\". 15 years after the film's premiere, NME writer Beth Webb praised its use of \"a mature virgin\" for a protagonist who does not feel sex-starved. She called that aspect \"a milestone\" for \"cinema's muddled relationship with virginity, in which women have since taken control of their virtue on screen, while men remain largely underrepresented\" and declared the movie as a whole to be \"a milestone for sex-positive cinema\"."

        "content": "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve (NYRE) is an annual New Year's Eve television special broadcast by ABC. The special broadcasts primarily from New York City's Times Square and prominently features coverage of its annual ball drop event, along with live and pre-recorded musical performances by popular musicians from Times Square and Hollywood. Since 2016\u201317, the special has regularly included performances and coverage of midnight festivities from New Orleans in the Central Time Zone as well. Its creator and namesake was the entertainer Dick Clark, who conceived New Year's Rockin' Eve as a younger-skewing competitor to Guy Lombardo's popular and long-running New Year's Eve big band broadcasts on CBS. The special first aired on December 31, 1972; its first two editions were broadcast by NBC, and hosted by Three Dog Night and George Carlin, respectively, with Clark anchoring coverage from Times Square. In 1974\u201375, the program moved to its current home of ABC, and Clark assumed the role of host. Following the death of Guy Lombardo and the decline of CBS's specials, New Year's Rockin' Eve grew in popularity and became ingrained in pop culture\u2014prompting Clark himself to make appearances on other programs in parodies of his role. New Year's Rockin' Eve has consistently remained the highest-rated New Year's Eve special broadcast by the United States' major television networks; its 2012 edition peaked at 22.6 million home viewers\u2014not including viewers watching from public locations, which were not measured by Nielsen at the time. Dick Clark hosted New Year's Rockin' Eve annually from 1973 through 1999 and from 2001 through 2004. For 2000, in lieu of New Year's Rockin' Eve, Clark joined overall host Peter Jennings as a guest co-host in Times Square for ABC News' day-long ABC 2000 broadcast. In December 2004, Clark suffered from a stroke, which resulted in Regis Philbin serving as guest host. Due to lingering speech impediments from the stroke, Clark ceded hosting duties to Ryan Seacrest the following year, but continued to make limited appearances as a co-host until his death in 2012 (despite his death, his name still remains on the program). Hosting solo since the 2012\u201313 edition, Seacrest has typically been joined by Jenny McCarthy as a correspondent from Times Square (McCarthy ceded correspondent duties following the 2019 edition), with Ciara serving as the presenter of the Hollywood concert segments. Through its deal with Dick Clark Productions (which was absorbed into MRC Live & Alternative in 2021), New Year's Rockin' Eve will remain on ABC through at least 2024."

        "content": "New Year's Rockin' Eve is primarily broadcast from Times Square in New York City, providing coverage of the New Year's Eve festivities held there, including performances by popular musicians, and culminating with the long-running ball drop approaching midnight. The special also features pre-recorded performances; since the 2017\u201318 edition, these concert segments (branded since the 2014\u201315 edition as the \"Billboard Hollywood Party\"; since 2018 Billboard has been a sister property to Dick Clark Productions/MRC Live & Alternative) have been presented from a studio in Los Angeles by Ciara and is the only segment to not include a New Year's countdown. Since 2016\u201317, the special has also originated performances from New Orleans, hosted from the Sugar Bowl's \"Fan Fest\" event (the game itself is televised by ABC's sister sports network ESPN the next day). For 2021\u201322, the special included performances from Puerto Rico and the countdown to midnight (Atlantic Time) in Spanish. Since 2005, Ryan Seacrest has hosted the live show outside in Times Square, joined by a celebrity correspondent providing additional reports from attendees. From his return and until his death, Dick Clark hosted a limited number of segments from Times Square Studios throughout the broadcast, including the countdown. Clark carried on with his tradition of kissing his wife, Kari Wigton, at midnight. Since 2000\u201301's edition, coverage has begun with a segment airing in primetime: initially airing at 10:00\u00a0p.m. ET/PT, beginning with the 2011-12 edition, the show was extended to 8:00\u00a0p.m. ET/PT to accommodate musical retrospective specials that aired from the 2011\u201312 to 2013\u201314 editions. These specials primarily featured music countdowns with footage from the Dick Clark Productions archives, including the top New Year's Rockin' Eve performances of all-time, and the top women in music. On the 2014\u201315 edition, the retrospective countdowns were dropped, with the segment since serving as an extension of the program in general. For the purposes of classification for Nielsen ratings as the show is split between primetime and late night, it is officially classed into four separate \"parts\" to demarcate numbers between the lower-rated start and end of the special, and the higher-rated countdown portion. The first two hours are referred to as \"Part I\", with the 10:00\u00a0p.m. hour considered as \"Part II\". \"Part I\" usually begins with the Hollywood concert segments while the headliners performed during \"Part II\" and \"Part III\". The actual Times Square countdown portion starting at 11:30\u00a0p.m. ET/PT up to approximately 12:10\u00a0a.m. ET/PT is classed as \"Part III\", followed by the heavily taped performance \"Part IV\" (outside the 1:00\u00a0a.m. ET New Orleans/Central countdown) leading up to the special's end. Following late local programming (such as late-night newscasts), the main New Year's Rockin' Eve broadcast begins at 11:30\u00a0p.m. ET/PT; some stations may tape delay this segment in order to correspond to the local time zone. Since the 2016\u201317 edition, the live coverage from Times Square has been followed by live coverage of festivities from New Orleans, including Jackson Square's fleur-de-lis drop at midnight in the Central Time Zone. After the conclusion of live coverage, the special continues, which features the remainder of the Hollywood concert segments. Part IV, which typically fills the remaining 65 minutes of the special (up to approximately 2:10\u00a0a.m. ET/PT), has run as late as 3:00\u00a0a.m. ET/PT in the past."

        "content": "Prior to the premiere of New Year's Rockin' Eve, the most well-known New Year's Eve program was the annual big band remote of bandleader Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians, broadcast from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Guy Lombardo hosted 48 straight New Year's Eve broadcasts on CBS until his death in 1977, beginning on radio in 1928 (and for a period, splitting with NBC Radio following midnight ET), and on CBS Television from 1956 to 1976 (which also featured coverage of the ball drop in Times Square). Lombardo was also well known for his band's performance of the song \"Auld Lang Syne\" at midnight, which helped make the standard synonymous with the New Year's holiday in North America. At the time, Dick Clark was well known as the host of American Bandstand, a music program produced from the studios of Philadelphia television station WFIL-TV (now WPVI-TV) and broadcast by ABC (which itself aired a New Year's Eve special on December 31, 1959). In the 1970s, Clark felt that Guy Lombardo's New Year's specials were outdated and did not appeal well to younger viewers; he believed that only older viewers would be interested in big band music accompanied by \"people dancing cheek-to-jowl in their tuxedos and funny hats\". In response, he decided to produce a more youthful New Year's Eve special of his own to compete. Clark's new program would be known as New Year's Rockin' Eve, a name chosen to signify the major contrast between his special and the more formal atmosphere of Guy Lombardo's special. The first edition, Three Dog Night's New Year's Rockin' Eve, was aired by NBC on December 31, 1972, and was hosted by the members of the rock band Three Dog Night. The special featured pre-recorded musical performances from the ballroom of the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California by Helen Reddy, Billy Preston, and Three Dog Night. Clark served as a reporter from Times Square for live coverage of the ball drop and arrival of 1973. The second special, New Year's Rockin' Eve 1974, also on NBC, was hosted by comedian George Carlin and featured pre-recorded musical performances by The Pointer Sisters, Billy Preston, Linda Ronstadt and Tower of Power once again from the Queen Mary ballroom. Beginning with the 1975 edition, the program moved to ABC and Clark assumed hosting duties; billed as Chicago's New Year's Rockin' Eve 1975 and seen as part of ABC's Wide World of Entertainment late-night block, the first ABC edition was headlined by the rock band Chicago, with guests The Beach Boys, The Doobie Brothers, Herbie Hancock and Olivia Newton-John, in segments pre-recorded at MGM Studios in Hollywood."

        "content": "Following Guy Lombardo's death in 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians attempted to continue their New Year's Eve broadcasts from the Waldorf-Astoria for 1977\u201378. However, the effects of Lombardo's absence led to a decline in viewership, allowing New Year's Rockin' Eve to overtake the Royal Canadians in viewership in only its sixth year on-air. The threat of the new special also prompted CBS to drop the Royal Canadians entirely in 1979 in favor of a new special, Happy New Year, America, which premiered for New Year's Eve 1979\u201380. With its recent success, Clark began hoping that New Year's Rockin' Eve would become a television tradition of its own, lamenting that \"Lombardo would always win [in New York] because of the Waldorf and 35 years of tradition, but we finally got it wrested.\" Clark's hopes soon became reality, as New Year's Rockin' Eve had displaced Guy Lombardo as the most popular and most-watched New Year's Eve special on American television in the years following. The 1980 edition was co-hosted by Erin Moran and John Schneider of Happy Days and The Dukes of Hazzard respectively, and continued with Clark's goal to showcase acts that represented the previous year by featuring Barry Manilow, Blondie, Chic, The Oak Ridge Boys, and the Village People as performers. The 1988 edition was co-hosted by China Beach cast members Marg Helgenberger and Brian Wimmer from the Cocoanut Grove club at the Ambassador Hotel. In 1990, New Year's Eve fell on a Monday, that night ABC broadcast the Monday Night Football game between the Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints. Fearing that his special wouldn't start on time, Clark asked ABC to move the start time one hour early to 8 PM EST so the special would run at its normal time. Mark Curry and Holly Robinson of the ABC sitcom Hangin' with Mr. Cooper co-hosted for 1993\u201394, with segments at Walt Disney World featuring performances by acts such as Brooks and Dunn and Kiss, along with the marriage of two California firefighters, Laura Turpin and Bob Hutnyan. The 1994\u201395 edition was co-hosted with Margaret Cho and Steve Harvey, and included musical performances from Melissa Etheridge, Hootie & the Blowfish and Salt-N-Pepa. The 1996\u201397 edition was co-hosted by Stacey Dash and Donald Faison of the ABC comedy series Clueless, and included performances by Jann Arden, Kiss, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, The Presidents of the United States of America, and The Tony Rich Project. This edition also marked the 25th anniversary of New Year's Rockin' Eve; Clark marked this accomplishment by discussing the greatest challenges he had faced hosting the special; including being unable to hear his director over the loud crowds of Times Square, harsh weather conditions, and a year where the emcee had to contend with a group of 30 nude attendees in the background. Clark aimed to continue hosting the special through the year 2000. Ultimately, Clark hosted the program nearly uninterrupted through 2004. The late-night portion of the 1997\u201398 edition was followed by a second, hour-long special at 1:05\u00a0a.m., After New Year's Eve, which was hosted by David Sanborn and featured Boz Scaggs, Isaac Hayes, Dr. John, Joan Osborne, Lou Reed, and Naughty by Nature. The popularity of New Year's Rockin' Eve also resulted in Clark making appearances on other television series to reference his role. During a Y2K-themed short in The Simpsons 1999 Halloween special \"Treehouse of Horror X\", Clark made a cameo appearance hosting a New Year's Eve event in Springfield. The Y2K bug caused the emcee to melt, exposing him as a robot. In an interview following the episode's airing with its writer, Ron Hauge, Clark said that the episode gave the \"biggest response\" he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done. Clark made a further appearance during the pilot episode of fellow Matt Groening series Futurama, \"Space Pilot 3000\", where Clark's head (as preserved in a jar) hosts New Year's Rockin' Eve 3000. In the 1994 film Forrest Gump,  footage of Clark from the first edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve is seen on a television at a bar during a scene of the film taking place on New Year's Eve in 1972. New Year's Rockin' Eve was also the subject of an episode of the sitcom Friends, \"The One with the Routine\", in which Janine Lecroix invites Joey, Ross, and Monica to attend a studio taping for New Year's Rockin' Eve as audience members."

        "content": "On December 31, 1999, in lieu of New Year's Rockin' Eve, ABC News presented ABC 2000 Today, a day-long telecast hosted by Peter Jennings which, as part of a consortium of broadcasters, presented coverage of international and U.S. festivities celebrating the arrival of the year 2000. Clark joined Jennings and ABC News reporter Jack Ford as correspondents for coverage from Times Square. They were among the key members of the team of more than 1,000 members of the ABC News division in New York, London, and elsewhere around the world that were part of the broadcast, which also included correspondents/anchors Charles Gibson, Diane Sawyer, Barbara Walters, and Sam Donaldson and London Bureau chief Rex Granum. They were all under the direction of ABC's Roger Goodman. The ABC 2000 Today telecast overall also received a Peabody Award. Reflecting on the event, Clark was enthusiastic about his participation, feeling that New Year's Eve 2000 was one of the biggest nights he had ever spent in Times Square. New Year's Rockin' Eve returned to ABC the following New Year's Eve for the arrival of 2001. The 2000\u201301 edition also introduced a new primetime hour at 10:00\u00a0p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime \u2013 believing that viewers, no matter where they were, wanted to know what was going on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Madison Michelle as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by  98 Degrees, Baha Men, Boyz II Men, Lonestar, and Third Eye Blind among others. The 2002 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve, its 30th edition, featured pre-recorded concert performances from tours by Aerosmith, Destiny's Child, and Elton John during the primetime hour, followed by studio segments (again hosted by Wayne Brady) featuring performances by Blink-182, Bush, Busta Rhymes, Jessica Simpson, LFO, The O'Jays, and Pink. The primetime hour of New Year's Rockin' Eve 2002 was also preceded by ABC 2002, a follow-up to the ABC 2000 special, hosted by Peter Jennings from the Rose Center for Earth and Space. The two-hour special featured a \"meaningful and reflective\" view on New Year's celebrations from around the world, and also included performances by Arlo Guthrie, Sting, and U2. Clark personally felt that 2002, since it was the first in the wake of the September 11 attacks, was the most \"nerve-racking\" New Year's Eve he had ever experienced."

        "content": "On December 8, 2004, it was reported that Clark had been hospitalized after suffering from a minor stroke. Despite Clark indicating his participation in New Year's Rockin' Eve 2005 in a prepared statement, reports soon surfaced that the stroke may have been serious enough to prevent him from hosting at all. It was officially announced on December 14 that Dick Clark would not be hosting, and that Regis Philbin would fill in for Clark. In a statement, Clark said that he was thankful that Philbin was able to quickly step in on short notice to host the show, and hoped that he would do a good job. Philbin was optimistic about his role, considering it the \"best temp job ever\". Various personalities paid tribute to Clark throughout the night on New Year's Eve; the New Year's Rockin' Eve broadcast featured special celebrity messages for Clark, and revelers in Times Square were seen with signs saluting Clark. During CNN's coverage, revelers in Times Square told CNN's Jason Carroll that Philbin was \"all right\" filling in for Clark (but still had Anderson Cooper and Carroll too). Mayor Michael Bloomberg also spoke with Philbin on Clark's absence during the show, noting that \"it isn't that we don't like Regis, but we want [Clark] back next year.\" Philbin's hosting received mixed reviews: Richard Huff of the New York Daily News noted that Philbin's hosting was \"stiff\" at first, and suggested that he would have performed better if he had a co-host to interact with like his daytime talk show Live with Regis and Kelly. In conclusion, he considered Philbin's performance to be \"suitable \u2013 although not spectacular\". Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times believed that Philbin was feeling \"surprisingly nervous\" in his role at host, and felt that \"rowdy crowds\" (which Philbin chose to avoid by staying in the studio) and the success of Rod Stewart's career (which Philbin pounced on to promote his new album, \"When You're Smiling\") were bothering him."

        "content": "In August 2005, ABC announced that Dick Clark would return to New Year's Rockin' Eve for its 2006 edition, marking his first television appearance since the stroke. For that broadcast, it was also announced Clark would be joined by a new co-host, media personality and American Idol host Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest had previously hosted Fox's competing New Year's Eve Live\u2014which, ironically, would be hosted by Philbin that year. Speaking to USA Today, Seacrest reminisced on having watched New Year's Rockin' Eve in his childhood, stating that \"I knew when I was on other shows, I knew we weren't going to beat Dick Clark. He is New Year's Eve.\" As a part of a long-term deal with Dick Clark Productions, Seacrest also became an executive producer for the special. In an interview with People Magazine in December 2005, Seacrest revealed that while Clark had not completely recovered from the stroke, and that his speech was not exactly like how it was beforehand, Clark had made great progress since the original diagnosis. Alongside pre-recorded performances from Hollywood hosted by actress and pop singer Hilary Duff, the 2006 edition also featured a live performance by Mariah Carey directly inside Times Square \u2013 the first such performance in the show's history. Live performances from Times Square became a regular feature during future editions of New Year's Rockin' Eve. During the program, Clark made limited on-air appearances, but still conducted his traditional countdown, and also recollected on his recent experiences: Public curiosity over Clark's condition and his return to television helped Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2006 draw in over 20 million viewers throughout the night, and score a 7.1 audience share among the key demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds. Reaction to Clark's appearance was mixed. While some TV critics (including Tom Shales of The Washington Post, in an interview with the CBS Radio Network) felt he was not in good enough shape to do the broadcast, stroke survivors and many of Clark's fans praised the emcee for being a role model for people dealing with post-stroke recovery. The New York Times Brian Stelter compared Seacrest's new role as co-host of Rockin' Eve to being like a \"traffic cop\", \"tossing to bands and correspondents and to Mr. Clark for the countdown\"."

        "content": "Following the 2006 edition, Dick Clark Productions announced that Seacrest had agreed to remain a host for future editions of New Year's Rockin' Eve. As he was still afflicted with speech impediments that resulted from dysarthria, a lingering effect of his stroke, Clark's role in the special was reduced; he continued to make limited on-air appearances from Times Square Studios as co-host near midnight, and still conducted his traditional countdown, but Seacrest hosted the majority of the program outside in Times Square itself. The 2008 edition featured live performances from Times Square by Carrie Underwood, Miley Cyrus, and the Jonas Brothers. Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas hosted concert segments from Hollywood, which also featured performances by Akon, Natasha Bedingfield, Sean Kingston, OneRepublic, Plain White T's, Taylor Swift and will.i.am. Seacrest's increased role as host was recognized beginning on the 2009 edition, as the special was officially renamed Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest'''. It featured live performances by the Jonas Brothers, Taylor Swift, and Lionel Richie, with Kellie Pickler serving as a correspondent. Hollywood segments featured performances by Fall Out Boy, Jesse McCartney, Natasha Bedingfield, Ne-Yo, The Pussycat Dolls, Solange, Robin Thicke and will.i.am. For its 2010 edition, headlining performances in Times Square included Daughtry, and Jennifer Lopez (who infamously wore a dark-colored catsuit for her performance to mixed reviews), while Melissa Rycroft served as a correspondent. Fergie hosted concert segments on-location from Las Vegas, Nevada, featuring performances by her group The Black Eyed Peas, Colbie Caillat, Robin Thicke, Keri Hilson, Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, David Guetta, and Orianthi. American Idol season 8 runner-up Adam Lambert stated that he was also reportedly scheduled to perform, but dropped from both Rockin' Eve and a scheduled appearance on fellow ABC program Jimmy Kimmel Live! in response to his controversial performance at the American Music Awards (which are also produced by Dick Clark Productions). Neither ABC nor Dick Clark Productions ever confirmed whether or not Lambert had been booked at all, however. The 2011 edition featured live performances by Kesha, Taio Cruz and the supergroup NKOTBSB (the combined Backstreet Boys and New Kids on the Block), and actress Jenny McCarthy served as a reporter from Times Square. Fergie reprised her role as host for the pre-recorded Hollywood segments, which included performances by Avril Lavigne (which featured the world premiere of \"What the Hell\", the first single from her then-upcoming album Goodbye Lullaby), Natasha Bedingfield (who performed her latest single \"Strip Me\"), Jennifer Hudson, Ne-Yo, Train, Mike Posner, Willow Smith, Jason Der\u00fclo, Far East Movement, La Roux, Kesha, and Drake. Viewership for the 2011 edition peaked at around 19 million viewers."

Fergie co-hosted for the sixth consecutive year for the pre-taped Hollywood segments, while Jenny McCarthy returned for her second year corresponding from Times Square.  Musical guests in Times Square included Lady Gaga (who also joined Mayor Michael Bloomberg in activating the ball drop), Justin Bieber, Pitbull and Hot Chelle Rae. Performers in the Hollywood segments included Taio Cruz, Nicki Minaj, Blink-182, Florence and the Machine, LMFAO, Gym Class Heroes, OneRepublic (at Disneyland), The Band Perry, will.i.am, Christina Perri, and Robin Thicke. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve aired in 1972, the primetime portion of the show was preceded by a two-hour retrospective special focusing on memorable music performances from the show's history.New Year's Rockin' Eve 2012 brought ABC's highest ratings on New Year's Eve since ABC 2000 Today; an average 8.4 million viewers watched the retrospective segment, the primetime hour brought in 12.9 million viewers, and the first hour of the main broadcast peaked at 22.6 million viewers. These numbers excluded viewership from locations such as bars and New Year's Eve parties, as Nielsen ratings do not account for out-of-home viewership (however, the company announced on October 24, 2016, that it would begin to offer out-of-home ratings data to broadcasters in April 2017)."

        "content": "On April 18, 2012, Dick Clark died after suffering a heart attack following surgery to fix an enlarged prostate. Neither ABC or Dick Clark Productions immediately commented on the future of the program. In August 2012, ABC confirmed via a press release that New Year's Rockin' Eve would return for its 2012\u201313 edition.  The primetime hour of this edition was preceded by a two-hour tribute special, New Year's Rockin' Eve Celebrates Dick Clark. Clark's legacy was also recognized by the Times Square Alliance, organizers of the ball drop: a triangular Waterford Crystal panel engraved with Dick Clark's name was presented to his widow Kari Wigton and installed on the ball. On October 23, 2013, Dick Clark Productions confirmed the 2013\u201314 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve, and announced that Ryan Seacrest had signed a multi-year deal of unspecified length to continue serving as host and executive producer of the special. Seacrest stated that he would \"forever be both sentimental and grateful\" about his involvement in the special, and that he was \"excited to work together to create new traditions and fun moments on the show that only live television can deliver.\" Fellow producer Allen Shapiro credited Seacrest's involvement in New Year's Rockin' Eve for its \"extended and expanded\" success. That year, the special was aired in simulcast in Canada for first time by Citytv, replacing its coverage of concert festivities at Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square (the network's local station continued to sponsor the event, however). While viewership was down by 5%, New Year's Rockin' Eve was still the highest-rated among the New Year's specials. On February 7, 2014, ABC announced that it had renewed both New Year's Rockin' Eve and the American Music Awards through 2023 and 2024, respectively. The 2016 edition featured One Direction's final U.S. television appearance before their planned hiatus. That year, New Year's Rockin' Eve was once again the highest rated of the New Year's Eve specials across the major networks; for the late-night portion, while overall household viewership was down by 7%, ratings in the 18\u201349 demographic were up by 3%."

        "title": "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve_2017\u20132020: New Orleans expansion, Mariah Carey incident and return",
        "content": "The 2017 edition expanded to feature coverage of New Year's Eve festivities in New Orleans hosted by Lucy Hale, with performances by Jason Derulo and Panic! at the Disco from the Sugar Bowl's Allstate Fan Fest concert, and Jackson Square's fleur-de-lis drop at midnight in the Central Time Zone. The segments are subsidized by New Orleans and the state of Louisiana as a means of promoting tourism. While household ratings for the late-night portion of the broadcast were down by 9% in comparison to 2016, New Year's Rockin' Eve was once again the highest-rated New Year's special across the major networks, with a 9.0 rating in metered markets, and a 6.8 rating among adults 18\u201349. Mariah Carey was one of the Times Square headliners for the 2017 edition. Her performance was notably marred by technical issues; when opening with \"Emotions\", Carey remarked throughout the song that she was unable to hear her backing track. On her second song, \"We Belong Together\", she briefly sang the song with a backing track before abruptly stopping. A representative of the singer claimed that Carey had alerted production staff that her in-ear monitors were not working, but that they refused to address the situation, and alleged that they were \"[setting] her up to fail\". Dick Clark Productions denied any wrongdoing, stating that they \"had no involvement\" in the incident, and that the allegations by Carey's management that they had intentionally sabotaged her performance were \"defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd\". New Jersey's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA) had announced plans for a live performance from Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall by an unannounced artist, but these plans fell through, citing \"scheduling conflicts and other considerations\". The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the CRDA's contract to host the DCP-produced Miss America pageant in Atlantic City contained provisions allowing \"promotional accommodations\" for the city in other DCP-produced programming, such as New Year's Rockin' Eve and the Billboard Music Awards.  Robert Mulcahy, chairman of the board for the CRDA, explained that Live Nation (which was to fund the broadcast using cash left over from cancelled beach concerts) were unable to find an act that met the approval of DCP, and added that local casinos declined to fund the performance, as they preferred to host their own parties rather than book major acts. Despite the previous year's incident, Carey was subsequently invited to perform in Times Square again for New Year's Rockin' Eve 2018, in what media outlets described as an attempt at \"redemption\". The 2018 edition saw major ratings gains, especially in primetime; the 8:00\u201310:00\u00a0p.m. primetime segment reached 10.5 million viewers with a 3.1/13 rating among 18-49s, and the 10:00\u00a0p.m. hour reached 15.7 million viewers and a 5.0/20 rating among 18-49s\u2014the highest ratings to date for the 10:00\u00a0p.m. segment. New Year's Rockin' Eves only major competitor on English-language network television was Fox's inaugural New Year's Eve with Steve Harvey, as NBC was committed to air Sunday Night Football if the NFL shifted a Week 17 game with playoff implications into primetime (however, the NFL decided against doing so, and NBC thus aired rerun programming in primetime instead). On November 13, 2018, it was announced that YouTube Music would be a presenting sponsor of the 2019 edition. The service is also presenting sponsor of the DCP-produced American Music Awards. With the return of NBC's New Year's Eve after a hiatus, the 2019 edition experienced a decline in ratings to an 8.3 household share for its late-night portion, but was once again the top-rated among the New Year's specials. On October 7, 2019, Jenny McCarthy stated on Live with Kelly and Ryan that she would not appear as the Times Square correspondent for the 2020 edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve, citing a desire to spend the holiday with her family, and her commitments to season 3 of Fox's The Masked Singer. Lucy Hale would serve as Times Square correspondent in place of McCarthy, and Billy Porter of the FX series Pose hosted the New Orleans segments in place of Hale, and also performed his song \"Love Yourself\". Ciara again hosted the Hollywood concert segments. Longtime ABC News journalist Barbara Walters (via file footage) and other ABC personalities also played into a social media meme involving her longtime intro to the ABC newsmagazine 20/20, by noting in a segment that \"This is 2020\". The broadcast also introduced a sponsored segment featuring a \"first millionaire of 2020\" promotion by the Powerball lottery."

Cyndi Lauper performed a duet with Porter\u2014who had been a cast member for her Broadway musical Kinky Boots. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both the Times Square and New Orleans celebrations televised by the special were held with no public attendance (with the former featuring a limited audience of essential workers and their families). The special featured an on-air interview between Seacrest and President-elect Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden. Big Freedia hosted the New Orleans segments of the special. In December 2020, it was reported that Mayor of New Orleans LaToya Cantrell had sent a letter to DCP requesting that Lauren Daigle (a Christian singer from Louisiana who had seen recent success as a pop crossover) not appear as a New Orleans-based performer for the special, citing her recent guest appearance during a worship event organized by Sean Feucht that was not approved by the city, and violated COVID-19-related public health orders.  After criticism of the letter by state lieutenant governor Billy Nungesser (who maintained that Daigle had mistaken it for a legitimate event), a DCP staff member told The Times-Picayune | The New Orleans Advocate that Daigle had not actually been booked at all. On December 16, 2021, it was announced that Seacrest had signed a multi-year extension with DCP's parent company MRC (which discontinued Dick Clark Productions as a studio imprint in September 2021, and moved all of its productions under the MRC Live & Alternative banner) to continue his role as host and EP of New Year's Rockin' Eve. The 2022 edition\u2013which marked the special's 50th anniversary\u2013included segments from Distrito T-Mobile in San Juan hosted by Roselyn S\u00e1nchez, including midnight celebrations in the Atlantic Time Zone (11:00\u00a0p.m.\u00a0ET)\u2014the program's first-ever countdown for that time zone as well as ABC's first Atlantic Time countdown since ABC 2000 Today''\u2014and a performance by Daddy Yankee. However, as their master control operations are designed to interrupt the network feed at or near that time so that local content avails start on time, some ABC stations in the Eastern and Central Time Zones (such as O&O WPVI-TV in Philadelphia and affiliates WSB-TV in Atlanta, WFTV in Orlando and WISN-TV in Milwaukee) interrupted the Puerto Rico countdown to start late newscasts or other local programming\u2014in some cases, preceded by local commercial breaks or that night's live Mega Millions drawing\u2014at 11:00/10:00. Billy Porter returned as host of the New Orleans segments, while Liza Koshy reported from Times Square. While LL Cool J was originally announced as one of the headlining acts in Times Square, he was dropped on December 29 due to being tested positive for COVID-19. Chl\u00f6e was also dropped from the special for unspecified reasons. On December 31, ABC announced that Karol G also dropped out, but that Ashanti and Ja Rule would join the lineup as replacement acts."

The world-weary Count travels to New York City with his bug-eating manservant, Renfield, and establishes himself in a hotel ... only after an airport transport mix-up accidentally sends his coffin to be the centerpiece at a funeral in a black church in Harlem. While Dracula learns that late 1970s America contains such wonders as blood banks, sex clubs, and discotheques, the Count also proceeds to suffer the general ego-crushing that comes from life in the Big Apple, after he romantically pursues flaky fashion model Cindy Sondheim. He has admired her from afar, believing her to be the current reincarnation of his true love Mina Harker. Dracula is ineptly pursued in turn by Cindy Sondheim's psychiatrist and quasi-boyfriend Jeffrey Rosenberg. Jeffrey is the grandson of Dracula's old nemesis Fritz  van Helsing, who changed his name to Rosenberg \"for professional reasons\". Rosenberg's numerous methods to combat Dracula (mirrors, garlic, a Star of David, which he uses instead of a cross, and hypnosis) are easily averted by the Count. Rosenberg also tries burning Dracula's coffin with the vampire still inside, but he is arrested by hotel security. Subsequently he tries to shoot Dracula with three silver bullets, but the Count remains unscathed, patiently explaining that this works only on werewolves. Rosenberg's increasingly erratic actions eventually cause him to be locked away as a lunatic. As mysterious cases of blood-bank robberies and vampiric attacks begin to spread, NYPD Lieutenant Ferguson starts to believe the psychiatrist's claims and gets Rosenberg released. As a major blackout hits the city, Dracula flees with Cindy via taxi cab back to the airport, pursued by Rosenberg and Ferguson. His coffin is accidentally sent to Jamaica instead of London and the couple miss their flight. On the runway, Cindy finally agrees to become Dracula's vampire bride. Rosenberg attempts to stake Dracula, but as he moves in for the kill, they fly away. A check falls from the sky, by which Cindy pays off her (enormous) psychiatry bill owed to Rosenberg. He remarks, \"She has become a responsible person ... or whatever\". Rosenberg keeps Dracula's cape (the only thing his stake struck) which Ferguson borrows, hoping, since the cape makes the wearer, it will help him be stylish on his wedding anniversary. Dracula and Cindy, now transformed into bats, fly toward Jamaica."

It was AIP's highest-grossing film until the release of The Amityville Horror later in the year. It was one of the highest-grossing independent films for many years. Critical reviews at the time were mixed, however. Love at First Bite has a 70% \"Fresh\" rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews with the site's consensus reading: \"Love At First Bite could use some more warm-blooded barbs to liven up its undead comedy, but George Hamilton's campy charisma gives the prince of darkness some welcome pizazz\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times described Love as \"[a] coarse, delightful little movie with a bang-up cast and no pretensions at all,\" while Dave Kehr lamented the film's \"hodgepodge of flat one-liners and graceless slapstick.\" Variety noted a \"tendency to lurch from joke to joke\" and observed that the story may be \"silly,\" but Hamilton \"makes it work. In the first place, he's funny just to watch.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film zero stars out of four, writing that Hamilton \"has no idea how to play comedy\" and gave \"a smug performance in a film full of tired jokes and some of the most cruel racial stereotyping you'll ever see.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"It is not quite the coupling of the decade, and Ms. St. James, although sympathetic, looks occasionally distracted, as if she were expecting a phone call at any minute. But Hamilton, baying 'Children of de night, shawt opp' at the baying wolves outside, has all the energy the movie needs. His characterization, grandly sweeping, sincere, preposterous but solemn, is just right.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post suggested that the film \"was evidently contrived by funnymen who started to run short of gags right after thinking up the title,\" also observing that Susan Saint James \"doesn't even seem to be trying\" and that \"Hamilton does an acceptable vocal impression of Bela Lugosi, but the act may have been more amusing when he was just doing it for friends.\" Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin compared the film to the work of Mel Brooks and opined that it had \"fewer belly-laughs than Young Frankenstein\" but was \"more consistent in its humour, partly because it pays more attention to character ... but chiefly because it adheres to its aim of producing 'a comedic Dracula, rather than a comical one.'\""

However, after another argument with his boss, she empties the shack and burns it down. The two decamp to the outskirts of Paris, where her friend Lisa (Consuelo de Haviland) has a small hotel. Betty laboriously types out Zorg's novel and submits it to various publishers. They meet Lisa's new boyfriend Eddy (G\u00e9rard Darmon), and the four have many fun times, often fuelled by alcohol. They find work in Eddy's pizzeria, but a fight erupts in which Betty stabs a customer with a fork. Zorg tries to slap her back to her senses. Though Zorg hides the rejection letters, Betty finds one and, going to the publisher's house, slashes his face. Zorg induces him to drop charges by threatening him with violence, saying that she is the only good thing in his life and she is all he has. Eddy's mother dies and the friends go to the funeral in Marvejols. There, Eddy asks Zorg and Betty if they will live in the dead woman's house and look after her piano shop. Zorg enjoys the quiet provincial life and makes friends with the grocer Bob (Jacques Mathou), his sex-starved wife Annie (Cl\u00e9mentine C\u00e9lari\u00e9), and various offbeat characters, but Betty's violent mood swings are a concern. One day, after an irritating comment from Zorg, she punches out a window with her bare hand and goes on a screaming flight through the town. Happiness seems on the horizon when a home test suggests that Betty is pregnant, but a lab test is negative and she sinks into depression and tells him that she is hearing voices talking to her in her head. Zorg, masquerading as a woman, robs an armoured cash collection van delivery headquarters, holding the guards at gunpoint, and tying them up. He attempts to use the money to buy Betty's happiness, but she fails to respond and enacts yet another prosecutable offence by luring a small boy away from his mother and taking him to a toy store. Zorg finds her and they both flee from the authorities as they rush to rescue the boy. One day, Zorg comes home to find blood all over the place and Betty gone. Bob tells him she has gouged out an eye and is in the hospital. Rushing there, Zorg finds her under heavy sedation and is told to come back the next day. Going home, he receives a phone call from a publisher accepting his manuscript. On his next visit to the hospital, he finds Betty restrained and catatonic. He becomes agitated and a doctor tells him that she will need prolonged treatment and may never recover her sanity. Zorg reacts by blaming her illness on the medication being administered and physically attacks the doctor. He is forcefully ejected from the hospital after a violent struggle with three orderlies. Returning in disguise, he whispers his farewells and smothers Betty with a pillow. Going home, he sits down to continue his current book."

        "title": "The Godfather_Summary",
        "content": "The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same name. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy. The story, spanning from 1945 to 1955, chronicles the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando), focusing on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss. Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for the price of $80,000, before it gained popularity. Studio executives had trouble finding a director; the first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film but disagreement followed over casting several characters, in particular, Vito and Michael. Filming took place primarily on location around New York City and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was composed principally by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola. The Godfather premiered at the Loew's State Theatre on March 14, 1972, and was widely released in the United States on March 24, 1972. It was the highest-grossing film of 1972, and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made, earning between $246 and $287 million at the box office. The film received universal acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for the performances, particularly those of Brando and Pacino, the directing, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The Godfather acted as a catalyst for the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast and crew. The film also revitalized Brando's career, which had declined in the 1960s, and he went on to star in films such as Last Tango in Paris, Superman, and Apocalypse Now. At the 45th Academy Awards, the film won Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola for Best Director. Since its release, The Godfather has been widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990)."

        "content": "In 1945 New York City, at his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo, Vito Corleone, the Don of the Corleone crime family listens to requests. His youngest son, Michael, who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized stallion. Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, Luca Brasi, to spy on them. Brasi is garroted to death during his meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later, Sollozzo kidnaps Hagen, then has Vito gunned down in the street. Vito's eldest son Sonny takes command. Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives a fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca \"sleeps with the fishes\". Vito survives, and at the hospital, Michael thwarts another attempt on his father. When Michael decides to remain guard, NYPD Capt. McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard, orders him removed. When Michael asks him why he removed his father's police guards and asks how much he was paid to do so, McClusky breaks Michael's cheekbone. Sonny retaliates with a hit on Tattaglia's son. The Corleones plot to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey; feigning a desire to settle the dispute, Michael meets them in a Bronx restaurant in which, after retrieving a handgun planted by Clemenza, a Corleone capo, he kills both men. Despite a clampdown by the authorities, war breaks out between the Five Families and Vito fears for his family. Michael takes refuge in Sicily under Tommasino's protection and his elder brother Fredo is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When Carlo again abuses Connie, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and gunned down by rival gangsters. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia, but a car bomb intended for him by one of his bodyguards takes her life. Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant don, Barzini, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo too weak, Michael takes the family reins, starting to move the family's business to Las Vegas. Expecting trouble due to this move, he insists Hagen also relocate to Las Vegas but relinquish his role to Vito because Hagen is not a \"wartime consigliere\". Vito agrees Hagen should \"have no part in what will happen\" in the coming battles with the rival families. When Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos, he is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family. In 1955, after warning Michael that whoever approaches him to arrange a meeting between him and Barzini is a traitor, Vito suffers a fatal heart attack. At the funeral, Tessio, another Corleone Capo, asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signifying the betrayal that Vito forewarned, and the meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the other New York City Dons and Greene. Tessio's treachery leads to his execution. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. Clemenza then garrotes Carlo to death. Later, an enraged Connie accuses Michael of murdering her husband and tells Kay that Michael ordered all of the killings. Kay is at first relieved when Michael assents to discuss his business dealings with her this one time, and denies the accusation, but is dismayed when the Capos arrive to pay reverence to her husband as Don Corleone and close his office door on her."

Published in 1969, it became the best selling published work in history for several years. Paramount Pictures originally found out about Puzo's novel in 1967 when a literary scout for the company contacted then Paramount Vice President of Production Peter Bart about Puzo's unfinished sixty-page manuscript. Bart believed the work was \"much beyond a Mafia story\" and offered Puzo a $12,500 option for the work, with an option for $80,000 if the finished work were made into a film. Despite Puzo's agent telling him to turn down the offer, Puzo was desperate for money and accepted the deal. Paramount's Robert Evans relates that, when they met in early 1968, he offered Puzo the $12,500 deal for the 60-page manuscript titled Mafia  after the author confided in him that he urgently needed $10,000 to pay off gambling debts. In March 1967, Paramount announced that they backed Puzo's upcoming work in the hopes of making a film. In 1969, Paramount confirmed their intentions to make a film out of the novel for the price of $80,000, with aims to have the film released on Christmas Day in 1971. On March 23, 1970, Albert S. Ruddy was officially announced as the film's producer, in part because studio executives were impressed with his interview and because he was known for bringing his films in under budget."

        "content": "Evans wanted the picture to be directed by an Italian American to make the film \"ethnic to the core\". Paramount's latest mafia movie, The Brotherhood, had done very poorly at the box office; Evans believed that the reason for its failure was its almost complete lack of cast members or creative personnel of Italian descent (the director Martin Ritt and star Kirk Douglas were not Italian). Sergio Leone was Paramount's first choice to direct the film. Leone turned down the option, in order to work on his own gangster film Once Upon a Time in America. Peter Bogdanovich was then approached but he also declined the offer because he was not interested in the mafia. In addition, Peter Yates, Richard Brooks, Arthur Penn, Costa-Gavras, and Otto Preminger were all offered the position and declined. Evans' chief assistant Peter Bart suggested Francis Ford Coppola, as a director of Italian ancestry who would work for a low sum and budget after the poor reception of his latest film The Rain People. Coppola initially turned down the job because he found Puzo's novel sleazy and sensationalist, describing it as \"pretty cheap stuff\". At the time Coppola's studio, American Zoetrope, owed over $400,000 to Warner Bros. for budget overruns with the film THX 1138 and when coupled with his poor financial standing, along with advice from friends and family, Coppola reversed his initial decision and took the job. Coppola was officially announced as director of the film on September 28, 1970.  Coppola agreed to receive $125,000 and six percent of the gross rentals."

        "content": "Before The Godfather was in production, Paramount had been going through an unsuccessful period. In addition to the failure of The Brotherhood, other recent films that were produced or co-produced by Paramount had greatly exceeded their budgets: Darling Lili, Paint Your Wagon, and Waterloo. The budget for the film was originally $2.5\u00a0million but as the book grew in popularity Coppola argued for and ultimately received a larger budget. Paramount executives wanted the movie to be set in contemporary Kansas City and shot in the studio backlot in order to cut down on costs. Coppola objected and wanted to set the movie in the same time period as the novel, the 1940s and 1950s; Coppola's reasons included: Michael Corleone's Marine Corps stint, the emergence of corporate America, and America in the years after World War II. The novel was becoming increasingly successful and so Coppola's wishes were eventually agreed to. The studio heads subsequently let Coppola film on location in New York City and Sicily. Gulf+Western executive Charles Bluhdorn was frustrated with Coppola over the number of screen tests he had performed without finding a person to play the various roles. Production quickly fell behind because of Coppola's indecisiveness and conflicts with Paramount, which led to costs being around $40,000 per day. With costs rising, Paramount had then-Vice President Jack Ballard keep a close eye on production expenses. While filming, Coppola stated that he felt he could be fired at any point as he knew Paramount executives were not happy with many of the decisions he had made. Coppola was aware that Evans had asked Elia Kazan to take over directing the film because he feared that Coppola was too inexperienced to cope with the increased size of the production. Coppola was also convinced that the film editor, Aram Avakian, and the assistant director, Steve Kestner, were conspiring to get him fired. Avakian complained to Evans that he could not edit the scenes correctly because Coppola was not shooting enough footage. Evans was satisfied with the footage being sent to the West Coast and authorized Coppola to fire them both. Coppola later explained: \"Like the godfather, I fired people as a preemptory strike. The people who were angling the most to have me fired, I had fired.\" Brando threatened to quit if Coppola was fired. Paramount wanted The Godfather to appeal to a wide audience and threatened Coppola with a \"violence coach\" to make the film more exciting. Coppola added a few more violent scenes to keep the studio happy. The scene in which Connie smashes crockery after finding out Carlo has been cheating was added for this reason."

        "content": "On April 14, 1970, it was revealed that Puzo was hired by Paramount for $100,000, along with a percentage of the film's profits, to work on the screenplay for the film. Working from the book, Coppola wanted to have the themes of culture, character, power, and family at the forefront of the film, whereas Puzo wanted to retain aspects from his novel and his initial draft of 150 pages was finished on August 10, 1970. After Coppola was hired as director, both Puzo and Coppola worked on the screenplay, but separately. Puzo worked on his draft in Los Angeles, while Coppola wrote his version in San Francisco. Coppola created a book where he tore pages out of Puzo's book and pasted them into his book. There, he made notes about each of the book's fifty scenes, which related to major themes prevalent in the scene, whether the scene should be included in the film, along with ideas and concepts that could be used when filming to make the film true to Italian culture. The two remained in contact while they wrote their respective screenplays and made decisions on what to include and what to remove for the final version. A second draft was completed on March 1, 1971, and was 173 pages long. The final screenplay was finished on March 29, 1971, and wound up being 163 pages long, 40 pages over what Paramount had asked for. When filming, Coppola referred to the notebook he had created over the final draft of the screenplay. Screenwriter Robert Towne did uncredited work on the script, particularly on the Pacino-Brando garden scene. Despite finishing the third draft, some scenes in the film were still not written yet and were written during production. The Italian-American Civil Rights League, led by mobster Joseph Colombo, maintained that the film emphasized stereotypes about Italian-Americans, and wanted all uses of the words \"mafia\" and \"Cosa Nostra\" to be removed from the script. The league also requested that all the money earned from the premiere be donated to the league's fund to build a new hospital. Coppola claimed that Puzo's screenplay only contained two instances of the word \"mafia\" being used, while \"Cosa Nostra\" was not used at all. Those two uses were removed and replaced with other terms, which Coppola felt did not change the story at all. The league eventually gave its support for the script."

        "content": "Puzo was first to show interest in having Marlon Brando portray Don Vito Corleone by sending a letter to Brando in which he stated Brando was the \"only actor who can play the Godfather\". Despite Puzo's wishes, the executives at Paramount were against having Brando, partly due to the poor performance of his recent films and also his short temper. Coppola favored Brando or Laurence Olivier for the role, but Olivier's agent refused the role claiming Olivier was sick; however, Olivier went on to star in Sleuth later that year. The studio mainly pushed for Ernest Borgnine to receive the part. Others considered were George C. Scott, Richard Conte, Anthony Quinn and Orson Welles. After months of debate between Coppola and Paramount over Brando, the two finalists for the role were Borgnine and Brando, the latter of whom Paramount president Stanley Jaffe required to perform a screen test. Coppola did not want to offend Brando and stated that he needed to test equipment in order to set up the screen test at Brando's California residence. For make-up, Brando stuck cotton balls in his cheeks, put shoe polish in his hair to darken it, and rolled his collar. Coppola placed Brando's audition tape in the middle of the videos of the audition tapes as the Paramount executives watched them. The executives were impressed with Brando's efforts and allowed Coppola to cast Brando for the role if Brando accepted a lower salary and put up a bond to ensure he would not cause any delays in production. Brando earned $1.6 million from a net participation deal. From the start of production, Coppola wanted Robert Duvall to play the part of Tom Hagen. After screen testing several other actors, Coppola eventually got his wish and Duvall was awarded the part. Al Martino, a then famed singer in nightclubs, was notified of the character Johnny Fontane by a friend who read the eponymous novel and felt Martino represented the character of Johnny Fontane. Martino then contacted producer Albert S. Ruddy, who gave him the part. However, Martino was stripped of the part after Coppola became director and then awarded the role to singer Vic Damone. According to Martino, after being stripped of the role, he went to Russell Bufalino, his godfather and a crime boss, who then orchestrated the publication of various news articles that claimed Coppola was unaware of Ruddy giving Martino the part. Damone eventually dropped the role because he did not want to provoke the mob, in addition to being paid too little. Ultimately, the part of Johnny Fontane was given to Martino. Robert De Niro originally was given the part of Paulie Gatto. A spot in The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight opened up after Al Pacino quit the project in favor of The Godfather, which led De Niro to audition for the role and leave The Godfather after receiving the part. De Niro also cast for the role of Sonny Corleone. After De Niro quit, Johnny Martino was given the role of Gatto. Coppola cast Diane Keaton for the role of Kay Adams due to her reputation for being eccentric. John Cazale was given the part of Fredo Corleone after Coppola saw him perform in an Off Broadway production. Gianni Russo was given the role of Carlo Rizzi after he was asked to perform a screen test in which he acted out the fight between Rizzi and Connie. Nearing the start of filming on March 29, Michael Corleone had yet to be cast. Paramount executives wanted a popular actor, either Warren Beatty or Robert Redford. Producer Robert Evans wanted Ryan O'Neal to receive the role in part due to his recent success in Love Story. Pacino was Coppola's favorite for the role as he could picture him roaming the Sicilian countryside, and wanted an unknown actor who looked like an Italian-American. However, Paramount executives found Pacino to be too short to play Michael. Dustin Hoffman, Martin Sheen, and James Caan also auditioned. Burt Reynolds was also offered the role but Marlon Brando was threatening to quit if Reynolds came on board so Reynolds turned down the role. Jack Nicholson was also offered the role but turned it down as he felt that an Italian-American actor should play the role. Caan was well received by the Paramount executives and was given the part of Michael initially, while the role of Sonny Corleone was awarded to Carmine Caridi. Coppola still pushed for Pacino to play Michael after the fact and Evans eventually conceded, allowing Pacino to have the role of Michael as long as Caan played Sonny. Evans preferred Caan over Caridi because Caan was seven inches shorter than Caridi, which was much closer to Pacino's height. Despite agreeing to play Michael Corleone, Pacino was contracted to star in MGM's The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, but the two studios agreed on a settlement and Pacino was signed by Paramount three weeks before shooting began. Coppola gave several roles in the film to family members. He gave his sister, Talia Shire, the role of Connie Corleone. His daughter Sofia played Michael Francis Rizzi, Connie's and Carlo's newborn son. Carmine Coppola, his father, appeared in the film as an extra playing a piano during a scene. Coppola's wife, mother, and two sons all appeared as extras in the picture. Several smaller roles, like Luca Brasi, were cast after the filming had started."

        "content": "Before the filming began, the cast received a two-week period for rehearsal, which included a dinner where each actor and actress had to assume character for its duration. Filming was scheduled to begin on March 29, 1971, with the scene between Michael Corleone and Kay Adams as they leave Best & Co. in New York City after shopping for Christmas gifts. The weather on March 23 predicted snow flurries, which caused Ruddy to move the filming date forward; snow did not materialize and a snow machine was used. Principal filming in New York continued until July 2, 1971. Coppola asked for a three-week break before heading overseas to film in Sicily. Following the crew's departure for Sicily, Paramount announced that the release date would be moved to early 1972. Cinematographer Gordon Willis initially turned down the opportunity to film The Godfather because the production seemed \"chaotic\" to him. After Willis later accepted the offer, he and Coppola agreed to not use any modern filming devices, helicopters, or zoom lenses. Willis and Coppola chose to use a \"tableau format\" of filming to make it seem if it was viewed like a painting. He made use of shadows and low light levels throughout the film to showcase psychological developments. Willis and Coppola agreed to interplay light and dark scenes throughout the film. Willis underexposed the film in order to create a \"yellow tone\". The scenes in Sicily were shot to display the countryside and \"display a more romantic land,\" giving these scenes a \"softer, more romantic\" feel than the New York scenes. One of the film's most shocking moments involved an actual, severed, horse's head. This scene was filmed at Sands Point Preserve on Long Island. Coppola received some criticism for the scene, although the head was obtained from a dog-food company from a horse that was to be killed regardless of the film.  On June 22, the scene where Sonny is killed was shot on a runway at Mitchel Field in Uniondale, where three tollbooths were built, along with guard rails, and billboards to set the scene. Sonny's car was a 1941 Lincoln Continental with holes drilled in it to resemble bullet holes. The scene took three days to film and cost over $100,000. Coppola's request to film on location was observed; approximately 90 percent was shot in New York City and its surrounding suburbs, using over 120 distinct locations. Several scenes were filmed at Filmways in East Harlem. The remaining portions were filmed in California, or on-site in Sicily. The scenes set in Las Vegas were not shot on location because there were insufficient funds. Savoca and Forza d'Agr\u00f2 were the Sicilian towns featured in the film. The opening wedding scene was shot in a Staten Island neighborhood using almost 750 locals as extras. The house used as the Corleone household and the wedding location was at 110 Longfellow Avenue in the Todt Hill neighborhood of Staten Island. The wall around the Corleone compound was made from styrofoam. Scenes set in and around the Corleone olive oil business were filmed on Mott Street. After filming had ended on August 7, post-production efforts were focused on trimming the film to a manageable length. In addition, producers and director were still including and removing different scenes from the end product, along with trimming certain sequences. In September, the first rough cut of the film was viewed. Many of the scenes removed from the film were centered around Sonny, which did not advance the plot. By November, Coppola and Ruddy finished the semi-final cut. Debates over personnel involved with the final editing remained even 25 years after the release of the film. The film was shown to Paramount staff and exhibitors in late December 1971 and January 1972."

        "content": "Coppola hired Italian composer Nino Rota to create the underscore for the film, including the main theme, \"Speak Softly, Love\". For the score, Rota was to relate to the situations and characters in the film. Rota synthesized new music for the film and took some parts from his Fortunella score, in order to create an Italian feel and evoke the tragedy within the film. Paramount executive Evans found the score to be too \"highbrow\" and did not want to use it; however, it was used after Coppola managed to get Evans to agree. Coppola believed that Rota's musical piece gave the film even more of an Italian feel. Coppola's father, Carmine, created some additional music for the film, particularly the music played by the band during the opening wedding scene. Incidental music includes, \"C'\u00e8 la luna mezzo mare\" and Cherubino's aria, \"Non so pi\u00f9 cosa son\" from Le Nozze di Figaro. There was a soundtrack released for the film in 1972 in vinyl form by Paramount Records, on CD in 1991 by Geffen Records, and digitally by Geffen on August 18, 2005. The album contains over 31 minutes of music that was used in the film, most of which was composed by Rota, along with a song from Coppola and one by Johnny Farrow and Marty Symes. AllMusic gave the album five out of five stars, with editor Zach Curd saying it is a \"dark, looming, and elegant soundtrack\". An editor for Filmtracks believed that Rota was successful in relating the music to the film's core aspects."

The theatrical version of The Godfather debuted on American network television on NBC with only minor edits. The first half of the film aired on Saturday, November 16, 1974, and the second half two days later. The television airings attracted a large audience with an average Nielsen rating of 38.2 and audience share of 59% making it the eighth most-watched film on television, with the broadcast of the second half getting the third-best rating for a film on TV behind Airport and Love Story with a rating of 39.4 and 57% share. The broadcast helped generate anticipation for the upcoming sequel. The next year, Coppola created The Godfather Saga expressly for American television in a release that combined The Godfather and The Godfather Part II with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its NBC debut on November 18, 1977. In 1981, Paramount released the Godfather Epic boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities. The Godfather Trilogy was released in 1992, in which the films are fundamentally in chronological order. The Godfather Family: A Look Inside was a 73-minute documentary released in 1991. Directed by Jeff Warner, the film featured some behind the scenes content from all three films, interviews with the actors, and screen tests. The Godfather DVD Collection was released on October 9, 2001, in a package that contained all three films\u2014each with a commentary track by Coppola\u2014and a bonus disc containing The Godfather Family: A Look Inside. The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a \"Godfather\" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches."

In addition, the duplicate negative was lost in Paramount archives. In 2006 Coppola contacted Steven Spielberg\u2014whose studio DreamWorks had recently been bought out by Paramount\u2014about restoring The Godfather. Robert A. Harris was hired to oversee the restoration of The Godfather and its two sequels, with the film's cinematographer Willis participating in the restoration. Work began in November 2006 by repairing the negatives so they could go through a digital scanner to produce high resolution 4K files. If a negative were damaged and discolored, work was done digitally to restore it to its original look. After a year and a half of working on the restoration, the project was complete. Paramount called the finished product The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration and released it to the public on September 23, 2008, on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Dave Kehr of The New York Times believed the restoration brought back the \"golden glow of their original theatrical screenings\". As a whole, the restoration of the film was well received by critics and Coppola. The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration contains several new special features that play in high definition, along with additional scenes."

        "content": "The Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972. The film's opening day gross from five theaters was $57,829 with ticket prices increased from $3 to $3.50. Prices in New York increased further at the weekend to $4, and the number of showings increased from four times a day to seven times a day. The film grossed $61,615 in Toronto for the weekend and $240,780 in New York, for an opening weekend gross of $302,395. The film grossed $454,000 for the week in New York and $115,000 in Toronto for a first week gross of $568,800, which made it number one at the U.S. box office for the week. In its first five days of national release, it grossed $6.8 million, taking its gross up to $7,397,164. A week later its grossed had reached $17,291,705 with the one week gross of around $10 million being an industry record. It grossed another $8.7 million by April 9 to take its gross to $26,000,815. After 18 weeks at number one in the United States, the film had grossed $101 million, the fastest film to reach that milestone. Some news articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100\u00a0million in North America, but such accounts are erroneous; this record belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965. It remained at number one in the US for another five weeks to bring its total to 23 consecutive weeks at number one before being unseated by Butterflies Are Free for one week before becoming number one for another three weeks. The film eventually earned $81.5\u00a0million in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada during its initial release, increasing its earnings to $85.7\u00a0million through a reissue in 1973, and including a limited re-release in 1997, it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135\u00a0million, with a  production cost of 6.5 million. It displaced Gone with the Wind to claim the record as the top rentals earner, a position it would retain until the release of Jaws in 1975. The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142\u00a0million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner. Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount, jumped from 77 cents per share to $3.30 a share for the year, according to a Los Angeles Times article, dated December 13, 1972. Re-released five more times since 1997, it has grossed between $246\u00a0million and $287\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts, and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the top 25 highest-grossing films."

        "content": "The Godfather has received overwhelming critical acclaim and is seen as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time, particularly in the gangster genre. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 97% approval rating based on 133 reviews, with an average rating of 9.40/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a rare score of 100 out of 100 based on 15 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times praised Coppola's efforts to follow the storyline of the eponymous novel, the choice to set the film in the same time as the novel, and the film's ability to \"absorb\" the viewer over its three-hour run time. While Ebert was mainly positive, he criticized Brando's performance, saying his movements lacked \"precision\" and his voice was \"wheezy\". Ebert named The Godfather \"The best film of 1972\". The Chicago Tribunes Gene Siskel gave the film four out of four stars, commenting that it was \"very good\". The Village Voices Andrew Sarris believed Brando portrayed Vito Corleone well and that his character dominated each scene it appeared in, but felt Puzo and Coppola had the character of Michael Corleone too focused on revenge. In addition, Sarris stated that Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, and James Caan were good in their respective roles. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote \"If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out of a merger of commerce and art, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d is it.\" Desson Howe of The Washington Post called the film a \"jewel\" and wrote that Coppola deserves most of the credit for the film. Writing for The New York Times, Vincent Canby felt that Coppola had created one of the \"most brutal and moving chronicles of American life\" and went on to say that it \"transcends its immediate milieu and genre\". Director Stanley Kubrick thought the film had the best cast ever and could be the best movie ever made. Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote negatively of the film in a contemporary review, claiming that Pacino \"rattles around in a part too demanding for him,\" while also criticizing Brando's make-up and Rota's score. Previous mafia films had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider. In contrast, The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society. Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering. Some critics argue that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping, and is an important part of the film's appeal (\"You can act like a man!,\" Don Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane). Remarking on the fortieth anniversary of the film's release, film critic John Podhoretz praised The Godfather as \"arguably the great American work of popular art\" and \"the summa of all great moviemaking before it\". Two years before, Roger Ebert had written in his journal that it \"comes closest to being a film everyone agrees... is unquestionably great\"."

When the winners were announced on January 28, 1973, the film had won the categories for: Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor \u2013 Drama (Brando), Best Original Score, and Best Picture \u2013 Drama. Rota's score was also nominated for Grammy Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture or TV Special at the 15th Grammy Awards. Rota was announced the winner of the category on March 3 at the Grammys' ceremony in Nashville, Tennessee. When the nominations for the 45th Academy Awards were revealed on February 12, 1973, The Godfather was nominated for eleven awards. The nominations were for: Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Marlon Brando for Best Actor, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for Best Adapted Screenplay, Pacino, Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, Best Film Editing, Nino Rota for Best Original Score, Coppola for Best Director, and Best Sound. Upon further review of Rota's love theme from The Godfather, the Academy found that Rota had used a similar score in Eduardo De Filippo's 1958 comedy Fortunella. This led to re-balloting, where members of the music branch chose from six films: The Godfather and the five films that had been on the shortlist for best original dramatic score but did not get nominated. John Addison's score for Sleuth won this new vote, and thus replaced Rota's score on the official list of nominees. Going into the awards ceremony, The Godfather was seen as the favorite to take home the most awards. From the nominations that The Godfather had remaining, it only won three of the Academy Awards: Best Actor for Brando, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. Brando, who had also not attended the Golden Globes ceremony two months earlier, boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony and refused to accept the Oscar, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award after George C. Scott in 1970. Brando sent American Indian Rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather in his place, to announce at the awards podium Brando's reasons for declining the award, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television. Pacino also boycotted the ceremony; he was insulted at being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, when he had more screen time than his co-star and Best Actor-winner Brando, and thus should have received the nomination for Best Actor. The Godfather had five nominations for awards at the 26th British Academy Film Awards. The nominees were: Pacino for Most Promising Newcomer, Rota for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Brando for Best Actor, the film's costume designer Anna Hill Johnstone for Best Costume Design. The only nomination to win was that of Rota."

        "content": "Although many films about gangsters preceded The Godfather, Coppola steeped his film in  Italian immigrant culture, and his portrayal of mobsters as persons of considerable psychological depth and complexity was unprecedented. Coppola took it further with The Godfather Part II, and the success of those two films, critically, artistically and financially, was a catalyst for the production of numerous other depictions of Italian Americans as mobsters, including films such as Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas and TV series such as David Chase's The Sopranos. A comprehensive study of Italian-American culture in film from 1914 to 2014 was conducted by the Italic Institute of America showing the influence of The Godfatherhttps://italic.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/filmStudySlides1228-1.pdf Over 81 percent of films, 430 films, featuring Italian Americans as mobsters (87 percent of which were fictional) had been produced since The Godfather, an average of 10 per year, while only 98 films were produced preceding The Godfather. The Godfather epic, encompassing the original trilogy and the additional footage that Coppola incorporated later, has been thoroughly integrated into American life. Together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, it has resulted in a stereotyped concept of Italian-American culture biased toward the criminal networks. The first film had the largest effect. Unlike any film before it, its portrayal of the many poor Italians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th century is perhaps attributable to Coppola and expresses his understanding of their experience. The films explore the integration of fictional Italian-American criminals into American society. Though set in the period of mass Italian immigration to America, the film explores the specific family of the Corleones, who live outside the law. Although some critics have considered the Corleone story to portray some universal elements of immigration, other critics have suggested that it resulted in viewers overly associating organized crime with Italian-American culture. Produced in a period of intense national cynicism and self-criticism, the film struck a chord about the dual identities felt by many descendants of immigrants. The Godfather has been cited as an influence in an increase in Hollywood's negative portrayals of immigrant Italians, and was a recruiting tool for organized crime. The concept of a mafia \"Godfather\" was a creation of Mario Puzo, and the film resulted in this term being added to the common language. Don Vito Corleone's line, \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\", was voted the second-most memorable line in cinema history in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute, in 2014. The concept was not unique to the film. French writer Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, in his novel Le P\u00e8re Goriot (1835), wrote that Vautrin told Eugene: \"In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline.\" An almost identical line was used in the John Wayne Western, Riders of Destiny (1933), where Forrest Taylor states, \"I've made Denton an offer he can't refuse.\" In 2014, the film also was selected as the greatest film by 2,120 industry professionals in a Hollywood survey undertaken by The Hollywood Reporter. Gangsters reportedly responded enthusiastically to the film. Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano, the former underboss in the Gambino crime family, said: \"I left the movie stunned\u00a0... I mean I floated out of the theater. Maybe it was fiction, but for me, then, that was our life. It was incredible. I remember talking to a multitude of guys, made guys, who felt exactly the same way.\" According to Anthony Fiato, after seeing the film, Patriarca crime family members Paulie Intiso and Nicky Giso altered their speech patterns to imitate that of Vito Corleone. Intiso was known to swear frequently and use poor grammar; but after seeing the movie, he began to improve his speech and philosophize more."

John Belushi appeared in a Saturday Night Live sketch as Vito Corleone in a therapy session; he said of the Tattaglia Family, \"Also, they shot my son Santino 56 times\". In the television show The Sopranos, Tony Soprano's topless bar is named Bada Bing!, a phrase popularized by James Caan's character Sonny Corleone in The Godfather. In the animated television series The Simpsons, there have been many references to the film. For instance, in the season 3 episode \"Lisa's Pony\", Lisa wakes up to find a horse in her bed and starts screaming, a reference to a scene in The Godfather. In the season 4 episode \"Mr. Plow\", Bart Simpson is pelted with snowballs in mimicry of Sonny Corleone's killing. The film's baptism sequence was parodied in the season 4 episode \"Fulgencio\", of the comedy series Modern Family. The 2006 video game The Godfather is based upon this film and tells the story of an original character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions. Duvall, Caan, and Brando supplied voiceovers and their likenesses, but Pacino did not. Francis Ford Coppola openly voiced his disapproval of the game. The 2016 Disney film Zootopia'' parodies a portrayal of Vito."

Allen is a mild-mannered forensic accountant while Terry is a hot-tempered detective who has been partnered with Allen ever since he mistakenly shot Derek Jeter during the World Series, earning him the nickname \"Yankee Clipper\" They receive no respect from the other officers, particularly detectives Martin and Fosse. All but Terry idolize cocky detectives Chris Danson and P. K. Highsmith, who are considered New York City's best policemen even though they frequently cause millions of dollars in property damage catching petty criminals. During a pursuit, they leap to their deaths after attempting to \"aim for the bushes\", which causes the precinct to wonder why they did it and who will take their place. Allen and Terry investigate a scaffolding permit violation by multi-billionaire Sir David Ershon but wind up uncovering a much bigger plot by Ershon to cover the losses incurred by his client Lendl Global. Lendl CEO Pamela Boardman has hired a team of mercenaries led by Roger Wesley to make sure Ershon pays her back. Terry and Allen go to Allen's house to talk through the case and have dinner. Terry develops a slight crush on Allen's wife Sheila, while not believing she is truly with Allen because of her beauty. When they visit his ex-girlfriend, Christinith, to gain their police evidence, she and her husband want him to have sex with her. Meanwhile, Terry unsuccessfully attempts to reconnect with his ex-fianc\u00e9e Francine, who had walked out on him due to his anger issues. During their investigation, Allen confides in Terry about how he ran a college dating service in his past, though he insists that he was never a pimp. He stopped the service because he was deep into his dark alternative personality, \"Gator\" and wound up in the hospital, where he met Sheila. When Sheila tells Allen she is pregnant, he reverts to his dark personality, which causes her to kick him out. Their investigation comes to a halt when Ershon's attorney, Don Beaman, learns of Ershon's plan to cover his losses, leading Wesley to kill him and make it look like suicide. Angered at their lack of progress, Capt. Gene Mauch splits up the partners, sending Terry to traffic duty and Allen to beat patrol. Despite Terry's anger, Allen still works the case on his own.  After he learns that Danson and Highsmith died investigating a staged theft during which Wesley broke into an accounting firm next door, he finds credible evidence and earns his gun back from Mauch. Allen then convinces Terry to rejoin him. They meet Capt. Mauch at Bed Bath & Beyond, his second job, where he admits he has been holding off on the case because Ershon has high-profile connections that could ruin him, so he allows them to finish the case off-the-books. They go to an investment meeting Ershon is having and realize that the $32 billion Ershon seeks is really coming from the NYPD pension fund. They escape with Ershon to his private apartment, and he tells them that the money from the pension fund is already in his account, ready to be transferred. Later that night, Allen and Terry finally reconcile with their loved ones. Allen apologizes to Sheila through her mother as a secret communication system and so she welcomes him back in. Terry also apologizes to Francine for letting his anger rule his life. The next morning, they drive to the bank to stop the transfer, evading Wesley's team, groups of Chechen and Nigerian investors to whom Ershon owes money, and police officers who are told Allen and Terry have gone rogue. Reaching the bank, they halt the transfer. Wesley arrives and, as a delaying tactic, shoots both officers and Ershon in their arms. Mauch finally arrives with backup, rescuing them and arresting Ershon for embezzlement, and Wesley for multiple counts of murder. Ershon's arrest leads to a stock market crash and the subsequent federal bailout of Lendl Global. Terry marries Francine, and Allen reunites with his wife. The narrator finishes off by stating that the true heroes are the everyday people who work to make a difference, not the ones who appear in the newspaper or on TV."

        "content": "Jurassic World is a 2015 American science fiction action film. It is the fourth installment of the Jurassic Park franchise and the first in the Jurassic World trilogy. Directed by Colin Trevorrow, written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, alongside Derek Connolly and Trevorrow from a story by Jaffa and Silver, and produced by Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley, the film stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, Omar Sy, BD Wong, and Irrfan Khan. Set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, Jurassic World takes place on the same fictional island of Isla Nublar, located off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. A successful theme park of cloned dinosaurs, dubbed Jurassic World, has operated on the island for years, bringing John Hammond's dream to fruition. The park plunges into chaos when a transgenic dinosaur escapes from its enclosure and goes on a rampage, while a conspiracy orchestrated by the park's staff creates more dangers. Universal Pictures intended to begin production of a fourth Jurassic Park film in 2004 for a mid-2005 release but was in development hell while the script underwent several revisions. Following a suggestion from executive producer Steven Spielberg, writers Jaffa and Silver explored the idea of a functional dinosaur park. Once Trevorrow was hired as director in 2013, he followed the same idea while developing a new script with Connolly. Filming lasted from April to August 2014 in Louisiana and Hawaii. The dinosaurs were created by Industrial Light & Magic using CGI and by Legacy Effects using life-sized animatronics. Production was completed in May 2015. Jurassic World was released in the United States on June 12, 2015. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $1.6 billion in box office revenue, reaching third among the highest-grossing films of all time. It was also the second-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the highest-grossing in the franchise. Two sequels have been released: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) and the upcoming Jurassic World Dominion (2022)."

        "content": "Brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park on Isla Nublar, of which their aunt Claire Dearing is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant Zara as the boys' guide, but they evade her and explore on their own. Elsewhere on the island, Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training a quartet of Velociraptors composed of Blue, Delta, Echo, and Charlie, and researching their intelligence. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, head of InGen security Vic Hoskins believes that the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry vehemently oppose. Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, the Indominus rex, a transgenic dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure's security. Owen warns Claire that the Indominus lacks social skills, making it dangerous and unpredictable. When the Indominus has apparently escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives, but it devours the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Realizing that it is highly vicious and intelligent, Owen advises Masrani to have the Indominus destroyed, but to protect his company's investment, Masrani dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry, so it can safely be returned to its paddock. After most of the unit is slaughtered, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector, while Masrani ponders Owen's warning and confronts Wu. While exploring the park in a tour vehicle, Zach and Gray enter a restricted area. The Indominus arrives and destroys the vehicle but the boys narrowly escape. They find the ruins of the original Jurassic Park visitor center, repair an old Jeep Wrangler, and drive back to the park resort. As Claire and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the Indominus as well. Masrani and two troopers hunt down the Indominus by helicopter, but it breaks into the park's aviary. The aviary's pterosaurs crash Masrani's helicopter, killing its passengers, before converging onto the resort, and attacking everyone, including Zara who is then devoured by a Mosasaurus. Gray and Zach find Owen and Claire at the resort as armed personnel shoot down the pterosaurs. Assuming command, Hoskins orders the raptors to be used to track the Indominus, where Owen reluctantly complies and spearheads the assault with the raptors. Upon finding the Indominus, the dinosaurs begin communicating among themselves. Owen realizes that the Indominus has Velociraptor DNA and it takes away Owen's command of the raptors, becoming the pack's new alpha. Troops fire on the Indominus, but it escapes. The raptors kill most of the troops, while Charlie is killed in the chaos. Hoskins evacuates Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island to protect Wu's research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at the lab securing more embryos, but Delta breaks in and kills him. Owen re-establishes his bond with the three surviving raptors before the Indominus reappears. They attack the hybrid, but Delta and Echo are killed while Blue is knocked unconscious. Claire releases the park's veteran Tyrannosaurus rex from its paddock and lures it into a battle with the Indominus. The Indominus quickly gains the advantage over the Tyrannosaurus until Blue recovers and joins the battle. The duo overpower the Indominus until it gets cornered at the lagoon's edge, where it is dragged underwater by the Mosasaurus. The survivors are evacuated and the island is abandoned once again. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents, while Owen and Claire decide to stay together. Back on the now-abandoned Isla Nublar, the Tyrannosaurus goes up to the helicopter landing pad and roars in victory, reestablishing her dominance on the island."

        "content": "Director Colin Trevorrow stated that the Indominus rex, the synthetic hybrid dinosaur at the center of the film's story, is symbolic of consumer and corporate excess. The dinosaur was \"meant to embody [humanity's] worst tendencies. We're surrounded by wonder and yet we want more, and we want it bigger, faster, louder, better. And in the world of the movie, the animal is designed based on a series of corporate focus groups.\" He also stated, \"There's something in the film about our greed and our desire for profit. The Indominus rex, to me, is very much that desire, that need to be satisfied.\" Film journalists have noted parallels between the workings of the park in Jurassic World and of the film and entertainment industry. Actor James DuMont, who has a small role in the film, said \"the person [and] the environment are one\" is an obvious theme; another theme is \"those who do not stop evil are supporting and encouraging it\". The film also explores animal rights concepts; the Indominus rex was raised in captivity and in complete isolation\u2014making the creature \"not fully functional\". Trevorrow has cited the 2013 documentary film Blackfish, which is critical of captive killer whales at SeaWorld, as a key inspiration for Jurassic World. Captive killer whale Tilikum, which was raised partly in isolation and was responsible for the deaths of three people, served as an inspiration for the Indominus rex, and the public relations and corporate excesses of SeaWorld depicted in the documentary inspired the fictional park in Jurassic World."

        "content": "In May 2001, Steven Spielberg had Amblin Entertainment commence development of ideas for Jurassic Park IV, which he planned to produce. Initially, Jurassic Park III director Joe Johnston was not interested in directing the fourth film. In 2002, William Monahan was announced as screenwriter, and a release date was set for mid-2005. Kathleen Kennedy would produce the film, and Spielberg would serve as executive producer. An early story idea would partially involve dinosaurs migrating to the Costa Rican mainland. A team of experts, including Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ian Malcolm, would chart an expedition to an offshore island and discover the dinosaurs breeding freely. Part of the plot would involve the characters devising a way to restrict the spread of the dinosaurs and prevent an ecological disaster. Early concept art also depicted genetically engineered human-dinosaur mercenaries. Monahan's first draft of the script was finished in July 2003; the story was not set in a jungle, as in previous films. Monahan subsequently left the project to work on Kingdom of Heaven. He was replaced by John Sayles, who wrote two drafts of the script. In one draft, a new character, a mercenary named Nick Harris, would be charged with training a team of genetically modified Deinonychus for use on rescue missions and to combat drug dealers. The concept of a human who trains dinosaurs came from Spielberg. By April 2005, the film had been postponed, as Spielberg was dissatisfied with the script revisions. Frank Marshall would eventually join the project as a producer. Progress on the film stalled during 2005 as Marshall and Spielberg were busy with other film projects. Additional work on the film was expected to begin following the release of a fourth Indiana Jones film, which Marshall and Spielberg were working on. In 2006, Spielberg said Johnston would direct the film. By April 2007, Johnston was no longer involved as director. A release date of 2008 was expected, but was later delayed to 2009. By 2010, Johnston was involved with the project again and planned for the film to be the first in a new Jurassic Park trilogy. Johnston hoped to further develop the project with Spielberg after they finished other projects, including Johnston's 2011 film, Captain America: The First Avenger. In 2011, writer Mark Protosevich was hired. He wrote two story treatments, neither of which were approved. Spielberg and Kennedy felt that the film did not yet have an adequate story. In 2012, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver were hired to write the script. The writers incorporated three ideas from Spielberg: a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, a human who has a relationship with trained raptors (from Sayles's earlier draft), and a human-eating dinosaur that escapes and has to be stopped. The concept of a dinosaur with a chameleon-like ability to render itself nearly invisible is a plot device from Crichton's \"The Lost World\" novel that had not been used in the previous films."

In February 2013, it was announced that Kennedy would not produce the film, as she would be busy with the upcoming Star Wars sequel trilogy. A month later, Colin Trevorrow was hired as director, and Patrick Crowley was announced as a producer alongside Marshall. Trevorrow and his writing partner, Derek Connolly, rewrote the earlier draft by Jaffa and Silver, while retaining Spielberg's three story ideas. The film's release was delayed by a year to give the writers time to perfect the script. Universal announced in September 2013 that the film would be titled Jurassic World, with a release scheduled for June 12, 2015. The film is set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park, and is considered a direct sequel to that film; although The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III remain canon in the series, Jurassic World ignores their events as they occurred on a different island location. Between 2003 and 2008, several cast members from previous Jurassic Park films were expected to reprise their roles, including Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, and Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler. Attenborough retired from acting following a fall at his house in 2008. A statue of his character is featured in the film. Trevorrow and Connolly did not want to bring back the other characters unless there would be a good reason for them to be involved in the story; they considered Dr. Henry Wu, the scientist responsible for recreating dinosaurs, a logical choice. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson were cast as the child characters in October 2013. Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt were cast in the lead roles. Vincent D'Onofrio and Irrfan Khan were cast in early 2014, and BD Wong was announced to be reprising his role of Dr. Henry Wu, marking the character's first appearance since the original Jurassic Park film in 1993."

The Indominus rex enclosure was among the shooting locations in Hawaii. Filming continued in Hawaii until June 2014, before moving to Louisiana. The Main Street and boardwalk area of the fictional Jurassic World theme park was constructed in the parking lot of the abandoned Six Flags New Orleans park. NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans was also used to construct interior sets representing the Jurassic World park. Other sets constructed at the facility included a Mosasaurus feeding show and a raptor enclosure. The film includes a scene in which Claire's assistant Zara (portrayed by Katie McGrath) is carried off by several Pteranodon before falling into the park's lagoon, where she is eaten by the Mosasaurus, marking the first female death in the film series. Trevorrow wanted to make it \"the most spectacular death we can possibly imagine\", while also wanting to surprise moviegoers, stating, \"Let's have someone die who just doesn't deserve to die at all.\" Stan Winston provided animatronic dinosaurs for the previous Jurassic Park films, and intended to do the same for the fourth film prior to his death in 2008. Instead, Winston's former colleagues at Legacy Effects provided an animatronic Apatosaurus for the film. Maquettes were used to depict the velociraptors during certain scenes, and some dinosaurs were created through the use of motion capture. The remaining dinosaurs were computer-generated by Industrial Light & Magic. Filming concluded on August 5, 2014."

During the San Diego Comic-Con convention in July 2014, 500 copies of a limited-edition Jurassic World poster by Mark Englert were given out. Audiences at the convention were disappointed by the lack of Jurassic World footage; what they thought to be footage for the film was a teaser trailer announcement for Legendary Pictures' upcoming film, Skull Island. Two viral marketing websites, one for the fictional Masrani Global Corporation and one for the Jurassic World theme park, were launched on November 17, 2014. The Masrani website was created by Jack Anthony Ewins and Timothy Glover, two Jurassic Park fans who had earlier created a website for the fictional Patel Corporation. Khan was initially reported to be playing a park owner with the surname Patel; after some fans mistook the Patel website for an official website associated with the film, Universal hired Ewins and Glover in April 2014 to design the official Masrani website and to add their own backstory details to it. The Masrani website included information that was absent from the film; it contained details of the company's purchase of InGen and about the park's origins. The Masrani website also included videos showing D'Onofrio and Wong talking in-character about the fictional company. The theme park website featured a high level of fictional detail, including hotel accommodations, weather reports and wait times for rides. Paleontologist Brian Switek was hired in early 2015 to ensure the accuracy of dinosaur information on the theme park website. Trevorrow wrote fictional customer comments for the site; he said, \"It was then that I realized I'd gone too far down the rabbit hole\". Closed circuit video shown on the control room monitors was filmed during production and was also added to the theme park website. A short teaser trailer was released online on November 23, 2014. The first full trailer was released online on November 25, 2014; it had initially been scheduled to air on NBC two days later during a Thanksgiving football game. The film was marketed with the tagline \"The park is open\". A television advertisement for the film premiered during Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, 2015. A clip from the film was aired on MTV on April 8, 2015, and depicted the character Owen arguing with Claire about the treatment of the park's dinosaurs. Film director and writer Joss Whedon criticized the clip, calling it \"'70s-era sexist\" and, referring to Pratt's and Howard's characters, stated; \"She's a stiff, he's a life-force\u2014really? Still?\" Trevorrow later stated he was not bothered by Whedon's comments and that \"to be honest, I don't totally disagree with him. I wonder why [Universal] chose a clip like that, that shows an isolated situation within a movie that has an internal logic. That starts with characters that are almost archetypes, stereotypes that are deconstructed as the story progresses.\" Howard also considered the clip to be a marketing mistake. Later in April 2015, three new posters for the film were released during a three-day period leading up to the premiere of the final trailer. Trevorrow was disappointed with Universal because he felt the trailers showed \"far more of this movie than I would have ever wanted\". Trevorrow stated that because of the film's cost, the trailers included scenes Universal felt were necessary to ensure its financial success after the studio's disappointment with Jurassic Park III'''s box-office performance. Universal spent $34.9 million on television advertisements for the film. Companies including Kellogg's, Dairy Queen and Barbasol served as promotional partners for the film, and Lego and Hasbro released toys based on it. Two video games, Lego Jurassic World and Jurassic World: The Game, were released in 2015. Tippett Studio worked with Universal and Efexio to create an application titled \"Jurassic World Mobile MovieMaker\", which adds images of dinosaurs to a background photograph."

        "content": "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Jurassic World has an approval rating of 71% based on 354 reviews and an average rating of 6.6/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"Jurassic World can't match the original for sheer inventiveness and impact, but it works in its own right as an entertaining -- and visually dazzling -- popcorn thriller.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 49 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film four stars out of five and said it is a \"terrifically enjoyable and exciting summer spectacular\" and \"savvy, funny, ridiculous in just the right way\". Robbie Collin of The Telegraph also awarded it four stars, deeming it a worthy sequel to the original Jurassic Park and calling it \"methodically paced and shot with an awestruck visual sense that's pure Spielberg\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it three stars out of four and wrote; \"It's not the cynical, cash-in cheesefest you feared. OK, Jurassic World is a little of that. But this state-of-the-art dino epic is also more than a blast of rumbling, roaring, 'did you effing see that!' fun.\" He praised Trevorrow's direction, Pratt's and Howard's performances and the effects. Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said the film wasn't \"terribly scary\" and criticized the romance between Owen and Claire, but he praised the CGI implementation and the film's musical score. The Associated Press rated the film two stars out of four, calling it \"an ugly, over-saturated movie\" that lacks the \"deft sense of wonderment, wit and suspense that guided the original\". The review praised Pratt and Howard's performances, however. Spielberg said, \"To see Jurassic World come to life is almost like seeing Jurassic Park come true,\" while Sam Neill also praised the film and its acting. Several news publications, as well as Neill, noted the violence of Zara's death scene, both critically and favourably, with some reviewers expressing concerns about sexism or misogyny in the film's handling of the franchise's first notable depiction of a woman being killed onscreen, although Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"There's nothing amusing about the demise of Zara, who's as close to 'real people' as Jurassic World gets, and it's that unsettling quality about her death that more Hollywood disaster epics need in order to reclaim their visceral emotional prowess\". Additionally, several news outlets, such as The New York Times, New York and Slate, considered the film's depiction of Claire, including her use of high heels throughout the film, to be sexist. UK film website Movie Metropolis called Jurassic World a tasteful homage to the original but said it lacks some of that film's soul and rated it four stars out of five. Several websites have noted plot and character similarities between Jurassic World and the 1999 film Deep Blue Sea. Entertainment website Dark Horizons stated in its coverage of Jurassic World that \"some aren't warming to the Deep Blue Sea meets Jaws 3-D storyline\", while entertainment website Flickering Myth posted the story \"Deja Vu: Isn't Jurassic World just Deep Blue Sea with dinosaurs?\", which outlined plot and character similarities between the two films. Pop culture website The Complex stated Jurassic World is \"basically going to be the big budget Deep Blue Sea re-imagining that we all deserve. Scientists, driven by a cold near-heartless leader, tinkering with already smart animals. The beast whisperer who warns against fucking with nature. It's like watching Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane flirt all over again.\""

        "content": "To maintain continuity with the previous films, Jurassic World does not feature any feathered dinosaurs. The first Jurassic Park film was lauded by paleontologists for depicting dinosaurs accurately and in keeping with the science of the time, but later discoveries have refuted the view of dinosaurs as invariably scaly creatures. Jurassic World was criticized for purposely ignoring new discoveries and knowledge. Several dinosaur researchers called the film a \"dumb monster movie\" for failing to include new discoveries about the creatures; for example, the feathers or proto-feathers that covered some dinosaurs and the way Velociraptor held its front limbs. Many paleontologists considered the dinosaurs a retrograde step from the original Jurassic Park. In response to these criticisms, Trevorrow said that Jurassic World was not meant as a documentary film: \"It is very inaccurate \u2014 it's a sci-fi movie.\" The film includes a scene addressing the topic, as Dr. Henry Wu says that such inaccuracies can be attributed to the fact that the dinosaurs are genetically engineered animals. A fictional review on the film's theme park website speculates that the use of amphibian DNA to fill the gaps in the dinosaur DNA\u2014a plot point in the original novel and film\u2014prevented the dinosaurs from growing feathers. The filmmakers had planned to depict feathered dinosaurs early in the film's development."

They accepted the ruling on March 31. On April 2, Universal Pictures originally wanted Trevorrow and Connolly to be credited for the screenplay; they were credited in the film's Super Bowl trailer as the only writers. It was then reported that they appealed the WGA's decision, that they wrote an entirely new screenplay that was not based on Jaffa and Silver's draft, and that they wanted full writing credit for the script. Five days later on April 7, the arbiters had unanimously denied Trevorrow's and Connolly's appeal in a second hearing held on April 3, and that they gave Jaffa and Silver an additional credit for writing the original story. Trevorrow and Connolly appealed the decision. Later that day, Trevorrow said he and Connolly had not appealed the WGA's original decision to give Jaffa and Silver co-credit for the screenplay, despite disagreeing with it. He also stated that he and Connolly were not informed of the second hearing until it was already over. The credits of the screenplay ultimately went to both writing teams; Jaffa and Silver were also being credited for writing the original story."

Trevorrow and Connolly returned to write the script for the sequel, which features Pratt and Howard reprising their roles. Trevorrow said in 2014, \"We wanted to create something that would be a little bit less arbitrary and episodic, and something that could potentially arc into a series that would feel like a complete story\". Trevorrow acted as an executive producer with Spielberg. J. A. Bayona directed the film, which serves as the middle chapter of the Jurassic World trilogy. A third film, Jurassic World: Dominion, is scheduled for release in June 2022, with Trevorrow returning as director. Pratt and Howard also reprise their roles. Rides and other mediaJurassic World eventually led to several theme park rides. Jurassic World: The Ride opened at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2019. It is a refurbishment of the original Jurassic Park: The Ride, which operated from 1996 to 2018. In 2021, Universal's Islands of Adventure opened a roller coaster attraction known as VelociCoaster, based on the Jurassic World films. The film also led to animated projects, including several in the Lego Jurassic World line, such as Lego Jurassic World: The Indominus Escape, a 2016 short film; Lego Jurassic World: The Secret Exhibit, a 2018 television special; and Lego Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar, a 2019 miniseries. A 3D-animated television series, titled Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous, was released in 2020. It was a co-production between Netflix and DreamWorks Animation. In 2018, Frontier Developments released Jurassic World Evolution'', a film-based construction and management simulation game that allows players to build their own Jurassic World park."

He looks on as she tries to balance her hectic life. Mark is much less concerned about what other people think than Bonnie is, which causes problems on occasion. He has a generally more professional demeanor, and sometimes does not understand why Bonnie continues to put up with annoying people in her life. Charlie Stewart as Charlie Malloy, Bonnie's son. Charlie shares most of his scenes with his friend Frankie. His role is small and usually unscripted, although he adds comedy to the show.

She was removed without explanation from the cast when season two started. Marianne Muellerleile as Gloria, Bonnie's live-in housekeeper/nanny.

(The joke being that Volvos have a reputation for being well-built, reliable, and safe cars.) Jack Connors (Fred Applegate), formerly a homeless man and a great practical joker. Jack revealed he survived the nuclear war because he was sleeping under an expressway overpass, whose structure protected him. Jack considered his finding the farm advantageous, as he is no longer homeless. Alice McConnell (Meagen Fay).  Her character was a progressive feminist stereotype. She reveals she worked in an old bookstore which had been built in the 1960s and equipped with a fallout shelter which was converted into the basement. She ran out of register tape and went to the basement to get a fresh roll, thus being spared when the attack occurred. Frederick Ross (Cleavant Derricks), formerly a research biologist. His excellent knowledge of science is vital to the survival of the community. Although he considered it ironic that he was possibly the only black man to have survived the nuclear war and occasionally mused over the possible loss of a black female companion, he genuinely enjoyed his white friends and living on the farm. Suzanne Skillman (Marita Geraghty), a hair salon employee, a dumb blonde stereotype, although it was clear her hair color was brunette. Curtis Thorpe (Lane Davies), formerly an aggressive venture capitalist. He finds adjusting to farm life difficult as most of the business skills he had before are not needed on the farm, although he was surprisingly athletic, having played track & field at Harvard."

The series has also aired as a two-hour special on the Canadian and American Discovery Channel with an alternate narrator, although Branagh's narration can still sometimes be heard. Unlike previous series, each period begins with \"tech specs\" highlighting specific traits of that period; as well as the location based on fossil finds from that period, they also show the period's oxygen content (from up to the Carboniferous)/global temperature (from the Early Permian onwards), and hazards. It also features evolution sequences between periods and looks inside creatures to show new evolutionary traits that humans -within the context of the series- would later adopt (such as the heart of  Petrolacosaurus or Diictodon's ear bone). The major difference is that, similar to Sea Monsters before it, there are only three episodes, each containing two to three segments in time, instead of six full episodes. The first episode also features cameo appearances of the orthocone Cameroceras and the shark-like holocephalian Stethacanthus, also like Sea Monsters before it."

Becky would sometimes get into the same trouble caused by Dave. In these videos, the hosts talked about how the vehicles worked, the history of the vehicle featured and talked to real people who worked in their fields. At the end of each episode, Dave and/or Becky would encourage the viewers to visit their local library or the place based on the theme's episode to learn more about the vehicles. On other episodes, at the end, Dave and Becky would also remind the viewers about safety (such as \"don't play on the railroad tracks\" in There Goes a Train and \"don't play with fire\" in There Goes a Fire Truck).

        "content": "Park Plaza Mall has just installed a state-of-the-art security system, including shutters across all exits and three high-tech robots programmed to disable and apprehend thieves using tasers and tranquilizer guns. Four couples (Rick and Linda, Greg and Suzie, Mike and Leslie, and Ferdy and Allison) decide to have a party in a furniture store where three of them work. After hours, all of them (except Allison and Ferdy) begin to have sex, drink, and party inside the furniture store. Outside, a lightning storm strikes the mall several times and damages the computer controlling Protectors 1, 2 and 3, which kill the technicians and a janitor before starting their routine patrol. Starting with Protector 1, Mike and Leslie get killed as they leave the store, witnessed by the others, who scatter. The men break into a sporting-goods store to arm themselves with firearms, while the women take gasoline and flares from an automotive store. Using a propane tank, the men blow up and seemingly destroy Protector 1. While the men set up the elevator as a booby trap, the killbots ambush the women and ignite Suzie by shooting her gasoline can, killing her. Greg unsuccessfully shoots them before Rick drags him away. The teenagers regroup and rig the elevator trap on Protector 2, destroying it. They then hide in the restaurant where Allison works. Inside, Greg confronts Allison and Linda about leaving the air ducts and exhibits rage due to Suzie's death, pulling his gun on Ferdy when he intercedes on Allison and Linda's behalf. Rick tries to calm him down, and Ferdy suggests destroying the killbots' main control center in hopes of shutting them all down. The group agrees and heads to the control center on the third floor. The robot throws Greg over the railing and he falls to his death. On the run, the four remaining survivors, Allison, Ferdy, Rick, and Linda also find the first robot recovered after its earlier defeat. They take refuge inside a department store and set up mannequins to confuse Protector 1 and Protector 3. Their plan works as they fire at the dummies and one of them blinds itself with its own reflected laser. However, the blind Protector 3 kills Linda and an enraged Rick rams a golf cart into it. A bolt of electricity kills him, but his attempts successfully destroy the robot. As the final robot called Protector 1 corners Allison, Ferdy rescues her and shoots it point-blank, damaging its laser just before he falls unconscious. Despite an injured leg, Allison escapes into the paint store and sets up a trap by mixing paint and chemicals. She lures Protector 1 inside, where it gets stuck for failing to find traction on the spilled paint and thinners. She tosses a flare into the store, igniting the chemicals and finally destroys Protector 1. As daylight appears, Allison leaves the store and Ferdy awakens. The two remain the only survivors. In a post-credits scene, a fourth, unknown Protector says its catchphrase \"Have a nice day\" one last time."

Wynorski wrote the script with Steve Mitchell, whom he had known since the 1970s, when they met at conventions for EC Comics, and became friends. They decided to do a \"phantom of the mall\"-type movie and Mitchell says it was Wynorski's idea to feature robots. Wynorski said he was inspired by the 1954 film Gog; he claims he never saw the 1973 TV film Trapped, which some believe inspired Chopping Mall. Mitchell says they wrote up the story in 24 hours and sent it to Julie Corman. Vestron gave their approval within a week despite lack of a script. The script took around four or five weeks to write. Wynorski says Roger Corman \"was nothing but supportive from the get-go. He loved the idea.\""

The script was full of in-jokes, writing in characters from A Bucket of Blood and Eating Raoul. The writers got the actors from the respective films: Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, and Paul Bartel. Mitchell wanted John Terlesky to play the hero, but Wynorski wanted Russell Todd. Terlesky played the part of Mike. Chopping Mall also acts as a debut film for Rodney Eastman, who later went on to star in A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master."

I now have it memorized, many dos and don'ts.\" The film was written to be filmed at the Beverly Center, but they charged too much money, so the film was shot mostly at the Sherman Oaks Galleria, where Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Commando had been filmed. The Beverly Center was used for exterior shots instead. Mitchell later recalls, \"I think we both felt a pretty fair amount of pressure when we started shooting. It was Julie\u2019s picture, but it was still Roger\u2019s company, and he was the bottom line. We both very much wanted to make him happy.\" He says, \"the specter of Roger loomed large for the first couple of days\", but after the second or third night, Corman said they were doing a \"very fine job\". \"So there was a collective sigh of relief on our part that we were making Roger happy, and that\u2019s what really mattered,\" says Mitchell. Wynorski says that Bartel and Woronov ad-libbed the bulk of their parts. Mitchell estimates filming took 20 days at the Galleria and two days at Corman's studios."

It was aired during the 1997\u201398 television season. The series was co-created by Steven Bochco, Bill Clark, David Milch, and William M. Finkelstein. The series attempted to create a setting of a gritty, realistic police station similar to NYPD Blue, but focusing on the uniformed police officers rather than the detectives. The pilot was rated TV-MA for violence, and received attention and controversy as the first broadcast television episode to receive the classification, airing the same year the rating system was introduced."

        "title": "Brooklyn South_Synopsis",
        "content": "The focus for Brooklyn South was the 74th Precinct in Brooklyn. Francis \"Frank\" Donovan (Jon Tenney) was the patrol sergeant who presided every day over the morning shift assignments he gave to the uniformed officers. Donovan was an informant for the hated Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB), and secretly reported to Lt. Stan Jonas (James B. Sikking), who, early in the series, transferred from being an IAB officer to the precinct captain after the officious Captain Lou Zerola (Bradford English) transferred to precinct maintenance. It was later revealed in the season that Donovan became an undercover informant 15 years earlier for IAB to protect his father, a retired cop living in Florida, from indictment for corruption. In the pilot episode, a psychotic gunman went on a shooting rampage outside the police station, killing a number of policemen and innocent bystanders. He was wounded in the shootout and brought back into the station where he died from his gunshot wounds. It was later revealed that Ann-Marie Kersey (Yancy Butler), a policewoman whose boyfriend was one of the victims of the shooting spree, slipped into the room where the wounded madman was being held and kicked him several times in his chest which caused his death. Because the shooter was black and all of his victims were white, the killer's family pressured the city to launch an Internal Affairs investigation. Eventually, everyone was exonerated for the suspect's death, and Kersey completely got away with it, though her guilt over murdering a critically wounded criminal would haunt her off-and-on for the duration of the series. Kersey then had a romantic affair with Donovan, but it did not last.  Kersey and Donovan later got back together. Later in the series, Kersey was designated to detective. Also in the pilot episode, Phil Roussakoff (Michael DeLuise), a burly officer, transferred to the 74th Precinct and was partnered with Jimmy Doyle (Dylan Walsh), a well liked and respected street cop whose younger brother, Terry (Patrick McGaw), was trying to become a police officer to follow in their late father's footsteps. Terry left the police academy to take an undercover assignment to infiltrate an Irish street gang planning a bank robbery. Roussakoff briefly dated Jimmy and Terry's younger sister, Kathleen (A. J. Langer), but was awkward and uncomfortable to dating. Terry helped foil the Irish gang's robbery, and he ended up joining the police vice squad anti-crime unit. Jack Lowery (Titus Welliver) was a tough street cop coping with personal demons which included his selfish and nagging wife, Yvonne, who died early in the season. Lowery later started an affair with his female partner, Nona Valentine (Klea Scott), which did not sit well with Clement Johnson (Richard T. Jones), Nona's former boyfriend and the station's traffic cop. Eventually Nona and Clem got back together, then broke up, and by the series end, Nona got back together again with Lowery. Hector Villaneuva (Adam Rodriguez) was a young rookie cop who was tutored by the rest of the officers how to do his job the best be could. Richard Santoro (Gary Basaraba) was the station's desk sergeant, a police veteran who had seen it all and was the voice of reason in the station house, keeping things calm. Santoro later stuck up for Donovan when he came out as an informant for Internal Affairs Bureau to save Santoro from a corrupt IAB officer who was trying to ruin Santoro's reputation. Ray MacElwaine (John Finn) was a 50-year-old veteran police officer who transferred to the 74th Precinct late in the series and soon proved himself to everyone that despite his age, he could still \"walk the beat\" and take down criminals. MacElwaine also stuck up for Donovan after finding out Donovan's work with IAB. In the series final episode, MacElwaine decided to retire from the police force, and Santoro was promoted to Lieutenant. So, Captain Jonas threw a double-party for the entire police station in celebrating Santoro's promotion and MacElwaine's retirement. In his speech, MacElwaine changes his mind and decides not to retire, to great celebration. Other secondary characters included Kevin Patrick (Mark Kiely), a police officer wounded in the opening shooting spree in the pilot episode, which made him a paraplegic, and his wife Noreen (Star Jasper), both of whom were friends with Jimmy, Terry, and the Doyle family. Also, Emily Flannagan (Brigid Brannagh) was a local barmaid and the daughter of Irish mobster Paddy Flannagan who was the leader of the small Irish gang that Terry had infiltrated. After Terry's undercover work was done, he and Emily got romantically together, but the series ended before their romance could go any further."

The series underwent retooling in an attempt to boost ratings, but despite the changes, the series was canceled in May 1998 shortly after the first season wrapped. In his autobiography, Steven Bochco says personal issues kept him from inputting as much as usual into this show's production, and that this contributed to weak scripts after the first few episodes. He then took more control in the later episodes and ratings started to perk up, but CBS chairman Les Moonves cancelled the show anyway, a decision Bochco adamantly disagreed with, and a season after extreme tinkering by CBS doomed his comedy Public Morals to a short two-episode run."

        "content": "The Real can be experienced; e.g., jouissance, alienation, the numinous, psychological trauma, transcendence, the sublime, a splitting of ideology, or narrative that separates signifiers from conscious desire-quest. Narrative is a structural defense mechanism against the Real (i.e., mythic order, hero's journey, storytelling, theme, pathos, ethos, plot, conflict, chronotope). The Logos of the Symbolic creates the Order of the Real; the Real and Kairos divide the Logos, resist symbolization, and anticipate being symbolized. The Lacanian real is a section of the triadic, Borromean knot: the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real; the center of the knot is the sinthome. Jacques Lacan defines the Real as a Plenum, contradistinct from the ontic. Metaphor (a.k.a. transference; a.k.a. repression: barrier separating Signifier over signified) is a paradoxical extension, inextricably intertwined with place, landscape, and body (viz., utopia, dystopia, pantheon). The Lacanian real is a \"negative space\", a philosophical void of \"sociality\" and \"subjectivity\". Lacanian psychoanalysis derives the sinthome by anamorphosically reading the \"chain\" of signifiers from the eternal return of the objet petit a (metonymic sliding of the signified), rendering the real identity of the subject through resistance and transference. The inner voice of the subject has a \"Presence\" (or frustration), \"Intermittence\" (or castration anxiety), and \"Absence\" (or privation; metaphorically-vertical Desire and metaphorically-horizontal Need); i.e., Lacan's graph of desire. The symbolic introduces \"a cut in the real,\" in the process of signification: \"it is the world of words that creates the world of things.\" Thus the real emerges as that which is outside language: \"it is that which resists symbolization absolutely\". The primordial Real in which a (pre-Oedipal) human subject is born is differentiated from the real which a subject integrated into the symbolic order experiences. In the former, the real is the continuous, \"whole\" reality without categories and the differential function of language."

Glyn Daly (2004) provides further examples of \u017di\u017eek's three modalities through pop culture:The real Real is the hard limit that functions as the horrifying Thing (the Alien, Medusa's head, maelstrom and so on) - a shattering force of negation. The symbolic Real refers to the anonymous symbols and codes (scientific formulae, digitalisation, empty signifiers\u2026) that function in an indifferent manner as the abstract \"texture\" onto which, or out of which, reality is constituted. In The Matrix, for example, the symbolic Real is given expression at the point where Neo perceives \"reality\" in terms of the abstract streams of digital output. In the contemporary world, Zizek argues that it is capital itself that provides this essential backdrop to our reality and as such represents the symbolic Real of our age (Zizek, 1999: 222; 276). With the ''imaginary real'' we have precisely the (unsustainable) dimension of fantasmatic excess-negation that is explored in Flatliners. This is why cyberspace is such an ambiguous imaginary realm."

His point of contact with it is personality: the inward fount of his being: his heart, not his head. Man is real, and in the deepest sense alive, in virtue of this free personal life-principle within him; but he is bound and blinded by the ties set up between his surface-intelligence and the sense-world. The struggle for reality must be a struggle on man's part to transcend the sense-world, escape its bondage. He must renounce it, and be 're-born' to a higher level of consciousness; shifting his centre of interest from the natural to the spiritual plane. According to the thoroughness with which he does this, will be the amount of real life he enjoys. The initial break with the 'world,' the refusal to spend one's life communing with one's own cinematograph picture, is essential if the freedom of the infinite is to be attained. We are amphibious creatures: our life moves upon two levels at once\u2014the natural and the spiritual. The key to the puzzle of man lies in the fact that he is \"the meeting point of various stages of Reality.\" All his difficulties and triumphs are grounded in this. The whole question for him is, which world shall be central for him\u2014the Real, vital, all-embracing life we call spirit, or the lower life of sense? Shall 'Existence,' the superficial obvious thing, or 'Substance,' the underlying verity, be his home? Shall he remain the slave of the senses with their habits and customs, or rise to a plane of consciousness, of heroic endeavour, in which\u2014participating in the life of spirit\u2014he knows reality because he is real?\" \"There are,\" says Plotinus, \"different roads by which this end [apprehension of the Infinite] may be reached. The love of beauty, which exalts the poet; that devotion to the One and that ascent of science which makes the ambition of the philosopher; and that love and those prayers by which some devout and ardent soul tends in its moral purity towards perfection. These are the great highways conducting to that height above the actual and the particular, where we stand in the immediate presence of the Infinite, who shines out as from the deeps of the soul.\""

It is scarcely possible to persist in this Esthetic perception without feeling lifted up by it above things and above ourselves, in an ontological vision which closely resembles the Absolute of the Mystics.\""

        "content": "When high school music teacher Michael McCann discovers his wife is pregnant by his best friend, he divorces her and retreats into a life of solitude as a maker of finely crafted furniture in rural Virginia. Five years later, his only companion is a valuable collection of gold coins. Tanny Newland, the unsavory younger brother of politician John Newland, crashes his brother's car in the woods surrounding Michael's house, seriously injuring the woman he is with. Afraid of being arrested for drunk driving, Tanny steals Michael's coins while he is sleeping, takes off into the night and is never seen again. Weeks later during a winter storm, Michael is startled to discover a toddler has wandered into his home while he was outside gathering wood. A short distance away he discovers the body of her mother, a heroin addict whose car had run out of gas nearby. Unbeknownst to him, the child is the out-of-wedlock daughter of John Newland, who participates in the investigation but keeps his relationship to the child a secret in order to protect his career. Michael is permitted to adopt the child and christens her Mathilda. She proves to be a bit of a handful in her early years, but with the help of friend and local shopkeeper April Simon, Michael manages to raise her to be a bright, personable, precocious young lady, and the once sour, lonely man is transformed by her presence. As John Newland watches his daughter grow older, he begins to invite her to join him and wife Nancy in their home. John arranges for her to learn to ride a horse, eventually giving her one of her own. Due to Nancy's two miscarriages and the couple's deep desire to have a child, Nancy insists on adoption. John finally reveals Mathilda's true identity and his desire to adopt her properly. Nancy encourages him to gain custody of the girl, and a trial ensues. Although the lawyer tries to manipulate the court and Mathilda herself to see that the Newlands are the better parents, Mathilda herself still refuses and honestly prefers Michael. The judge is inclined to side with the Newlands, given their wealth and ability to provide Mathilda with advantages she never would have with Michael. Then the remains of Tanny Newland - surrounded by the gold coins he stole from Michael - are found at the bottom of the quarry his brother was draining to create a lake surrounded by real estate he planned to sell. Michael's sudden return to wealth - and the judge's realization that Tanny was most likely killed by his brother - convinces him that Mathilda should remain with Michael. The film ends with Michael taking Mathilda to visit her late mother's grave, in a remote potter's cemetery."

Try as I might, I just couldn't accept this Victorian story in modern dress. The motivations seemed wrong (would 20th century people behave this way?), the plotting seemed contrived (as indeed it was), and the plot's habit of springing big surprises on us was too manipulative. This is not at all a bad movie, mind you, but a good movie gone wrong, through a simple twist of miscalculation. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote: \"When clowns write sad stories for themselves, the results are almost always disastrous. For A Simple Twist of Fate, Steve Martin not only wrote the screenplay... but also executive-produced the project, creating for himself a character that is about as different from his typical roles as can be imagined. And if the exercise isn't precisely disastrous, it comes very close to it... Perhaps it's a stretch for a performer with such remarkable charisma to play someone who is without it ... Martin does a skillful job of nullifying himself, and he does present a side of himself that has been glimpsed only briefly. But what a joyless accomplishment it is. As a comic, Martin soars, but here he has clipped his own wings.\" According to Variety \"The pairing of Steve Martin and 19th-century novelist George Eliot seems about as likely an artistic union as Oliver Stone adapting Louisa May Alcott. Yet A Simple Twist of Fateinspired by Silas Marnerbetrays no tell-tale strains of clashing sensibilities. Martin leavens the material somewhat, but this is a faithful, heartfelt, somber piece about family and responsibility.\" Kevin Thomas, in the Los Angeles Times, gives Steve Martin and director Gillies MacKinnon credit for taking risks by updating the classic George Eliot novel.  He describes it as a \"charming update of Silas Marner\" that is well written, well played and has substance and a musical score that successfully bring 19th century literature into a moving and powerful modern-day film. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 43% based on reviews from 21 critics."

Sam Cole is the driven chief detective of a squad that is dedicated to solving some of the worst crimes the city has to offer. There were several technical advisers who worked on the show: Chic Daniel, an LAPD living legend who served more than twenty years on SWAT; Robert Deamer, a specialist of gang enforcement who is one of the most decorated veterans of Special Enforcement Unit (ex-C.R.A.S.H.); and Lieutenant Todd Reinhold, an actual squad leader of Special Weapons And Tactics. The series was originally titled Metro which was the division where the show was originally going to be set. Then, the title was changed to RHD/LA which was used for the fall schedule announcement. CBS ordered the final title believing that people would be confused about what RHD stood for. In April 2002, Schindel left to focus on his duties at NBC's Law & Order. Frank Spotnitz joined the show as an executive producer and the showrunner in May 2002 after The X-Files ended its nine-season run and then left in October because he decided that it \"was not creatively the show that he wanted to be working on.\" Thematically, the show was very reminiscent of Mann's film Heat in that it also dealt with a driven cop working the Robbery-Homicide Division leading a multi-ethnic squad. Stylistically, Mann has said that RHD was a chance to test out some of the high-definition digital cameras he would later employ to much greater effect on Collateral and the film version of Miami Vice."

Because of its NBC Universal ownership, reruns of the series have since aired on the high definition network Universal HD. It is rumored that the arrest of Tom Sizemore, due to a drug related incident, ultimately led to the cancellation of the show. Sizemore has stated during filming of his show Shooting Sizemore that he regrets letting down all the cast members, staff, and producer Michael Mann.

        "content": "30 Rock is an American satirical sitcom television series created by Tina Fey that originally aired on NBC from October 11, 2006, to January 31, 2013. The series, based on Fey's experiences as head writer for Saturday Night Live, takes place behind the scenes of a fictional live sketch comedy show depicted as airing on NBC. The series' name refers to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, the address of the now Comcast Building, where the NBC Studios are located and where Saturday Night Live is written, produced, and performed. The series was produced by Lorne Michaels' Broadway Video (which also produces Saturday Night Live) and Fey's Little Stranger, in association with NBCUniversal. 30 Rock episodes were produced in a single-camera setup (with the exception of the two live episodes that were produced in the multiple-camera setup) and were filmed in New York. The pilot episode premiered on October 11, 2006, and seven seasons followed. The series stars Fey with a supporting cast that includes Alec Baldwin, Tracy Morgan, Jane Krakowski, Jack McBrayer, Scott Adsit, Judah Friedlander, Katrina Bowden, Keith Powell, Lonny Ross, John Lutz, Kevin Brown, Grizz Chapman, and Maulik Pancholy. Tonally, 30 Rock uses surreal humor to parody the complex corporate structure of NBC and its then parent company General Electric. A critic for The A.V. Club once remarked that it \"usually adopts the manic pacing of a live-action cartoon\". The show was influential in its extensive use of cutaways: sudden, short cuts to unrelated scenes showing something the characters are briefly discussing. 30 Rock also became known for its dedication to making sets extremely elaborate, once showing a set that took three days to build for only six seconds of video. 30 Rock won several major awards (including Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2007, 2008, and 2009 and nominations for every other year it ran) and appeared on many critics' year-end \"best of\" 2006\u20132013 lists. On July 14, 2009, the series was nominated for 22 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most in a single year for a comedy series. Over the course of the series, it was nominated for 103 Primetime Emmy Awards and won 16, in addition to numerous other nominations and wins from other awards shows. Despite the high praise, the series struggled in the ratings throughout its run, something of which Fey herself has made light. In 2009, Comedy Central and WGN America bought the syndication rights to the show, which began airing on both networks on September 19, 2011; the series also entered into local broadcast syndication on the same day. 30 Rock is regarded as a landmark series. Its series finale in particular has been named as one of the greatest in television history by several publications. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America West named 30 Rock the 21st best-written television series of all time."

        "content": "In 2002, Fey was the head writer and a performer on the television show Saturday Night Live (SNL). She pitched the show that became 30 Rock to NBC, originally as a sitcom about cable news. NBC Entertainment president Kevin Reilly felt that \"Fey was using the news setting as a fig leaf for her own experience and [he] encouraged her to write what she knew.\" The show was subsequently reworked to revolve around an SNL-style sketch show. After being presented to Reilly once more, the show was set to air during the 2005\u20132006 television season. In May 2003, Fey signed a contract with NBC to remain in her SNL head writer position until at least the 2004\u20132005 television season and to develop a primetime project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal. Filming was postponed due to Tina Fey's first pregnancy. During the 2004\u20132005 pilot season, a pilot was announced named Untitled Tina Fey Project. The 30 Rock pilot focused on the boss of a variety show who must manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer. The storyline evolved into one that dealt with a head writer of a variety show who dealt with both of the stars, as well as the show's new network executive. 30 Rock was officially given the green light to air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order. The series underwent further changes during the months leading up to and following its debut. A May 2006 press release mentioned that sketches from The Girlie Show would be made available in their entirety on NBC's broadband website, DotComedy.com. The idea was to air the fictitious TGS with Tracy Jordan online. This aspect of the series was abandoned prior to its debut."

Fey's first act as casting director was to cast herself as the lead character, Liz Lemon, who is said to be much like Fey herself when she first became head writer on SNL. The next actor to be cast was Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan, who was then a former castmate of Fey's in SNL. Morgan was asked by Fey to play the role, and he believed it was \"right up [his] alley and it was tailor made for [him]\". Fey said that the character of Kenneth was written with McBrayer in mind. McBrayer is an old friend of Fey's (they worked together at Second City in Chicago), and she \"really wanted him for that part and was very happy when no one objected\". Rachel Dratch, Fey's longtime comedy partner and fellow SNL alumna, was originally cast to portray Jenna. Dratch played the role in the show's original pilot, but in August 2006, Krakowski was announced as Dratch's replacement, with Dratch remaining involved in the show playing various characters. Fey explained the change by noting that Dratch was better-suited to playing a variety of side characters, which was suitable when the show intended to feature actual sketches from TGS with Tracy Jordan. However, this aspect of the show was scrapped, thus they required more of a straight-ahead acting part for the role of Jenna. Although Fey went on to say, \"Rachel and I were both very excited about this new direction,\" Dratch said that she was not happy with the media's depiction of the change as a demotion; furthermore, she was also skeptical about the reasons she was given for the change and was not happy with the reduction in the number of episodes in which she would appear. Following the first season, Dratch only appeared in a handful of episodes. Shortly following the casting of McBrayer and Dratch, Baldwin was cast as Jack, the \"totally uncensored\" vice president of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming. Fey said that the character of Jack was written with Baldwin in mind, and she was \"very pleasantly surprised when he agreed to do it\". Judah Friedlander was cast as Frank Rossitano, a staff writer of The Girlie Show. Friedlander had never met Fey before auditioning for a role in 30\u00a0Rock. His character was based on at least two writers with whom Fey used to work at SNL, but he has said that he \"certainly brought some of [his] own things to it, as well\". Finally, Scott Adsit was cast as Pete Hornberger, a longtime friend of Liz's and producer of The Girlie Show. Adsit, an old friend of Fey's, also had his character written based on him. Following SNLs ongoing tradition, 30\u00a0Rock had several real-life politician cameos, including Al Gore (twice), Nancy Pelosi (series finale) and Condoleezza Rice (as Jack's former love interest)."

Jack Donaghy, the \"Head of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming\" at General Electric (GE), is transferred to work at the NBC headquarters, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and retool the late-night sketch-comedy series The Girlie Show. The show's cast and crew are outraged by this, especially head writer Liz Lemon and main actress Jenna Maroney. Jack proceeds to wreak havoc on The Girlie Show, forcing Liz to hire off-the-wall movie star Tracy Jordan. He again irritates the cast and crew of The Girlie Show when he changes the name to TGS with Tracy Jordan (or just TGS). As the season progresses, the episodes become less about TGS and more about how the characters deal with juggling their lives and their jobs\u00a0. Specifically, Liz, but other characters are also explored. Episodes also become less self-contained, and various story arcs develop in the second half of the season. For example, the first major story arc centers on Liz's relationship with Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), \"The Beeper King\". Other story arcs include Jenna promoting her movie The Rural Juror; Tracy going on the run from the Black Crusaders; Jack's engagement, which was eventually called off, to a Christie's auctioneer named Phoebe (Emily Mortimer); and another relationship of Liz's with Floyd (Sudeikis)."

When Jerry Seinfeld confronts Jack about a new marketing campaign which featured clips of Seinfeld's sitcom, Seinfeld, in all NBC shows, he has a chance encounter with Liz that gives her some much-needed advice. During the TGS summer hiatus, Jenna becomes overweight due to performing in the Broadway show Mystic Pizza: The Musical (based on the real 1988 film Mystic Pizza). Tracy has encountered some marital problems with his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) and they become separated, but later reunite. During the season, Jack develops a relationship with a Democratic congresswoman named Celeste \"C.\u00a0C.\" Cunningham (Edie Falco). They later break up. An arc that was established in the first season, but becomes more apparent in the second, regards Jack running for the GE chairmanship against his nemesis Devon Banks (Will Arnett). The season ends with Liz planning to adopt a child after believing she was pregnant with Dennis' baby. Kenneth also travels to Beijing to be a page at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and Tracy invents a pornographic video game. Jack ends the season working at a new government job in Washington, DC, but plans to get fired by proposing a \"gay bomb\"."

Jenna reaches a new level of fame due to being a judge on a reality show and considers settling down with boyfriend Paul. Many LGBT groups called for Tracy Morgan's resignation or dismissal from the show due to anti-gay comments he made between the end of season five and the filming for season six. Morgan issued an apology and continued with his starring role. 30 Rock had previously received an award from GLAAD, commending the show on its portrayal of LGBT themes and characters.

Ultimately, however, he begins to wonder if he is truly happy. Elsewhere, Tracy has found success with his new movie studio, which produces comedy films mostly starring African American actors, similarly to Tyler Perry; Jenna prepares to marry her long-term boyfriend Paul (Will Forte), and Kenneth has started a relationship with Hazel (Kristen Schaal), unaware that she is using him to get her moment on TGS."

Chris Harnick, writing in the Huffington Post, has ranked it along with I Love Lucy and Seinfeld as one of the great TV comedies. The Writers Guild of America West listed it as the 21st best written TV series.  Its series finale has been rated highly by several publications. HitFix ranked it the 15th best series final, IndieWire included it in its list of 16 best series finals, and HuffPost named it the 5th best. The first season of 30 Rock was reviewed favorably by critics. Metacritic gave the pilot episode a Metascore\u2014a weighted average based on the impressions of a select thirty-one critical reviews\u2014of 67 out of 100. Robert Abele of LA Weekly declared that the show was a \"weirdly appropriate and hilarious symbol of our times\". The Wall Street Journal's Dorothy Rabinowitz wrote that the \"standard caution is relevant\u2014debut episodes tend to be highly polished. All the more reason to enjoy the hilarious scenes and fine ensemble cast here\". Some less favorable reviews were received from Brian Lowry of Variety. Lowry said, \"Despite her success with Mean Girls, Fey mostly hits too-familiar notes in the pilot. Moreover, she's a limited protagonist, which is problematic.\" Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune criticized \"30\u00a0Rock for being less than the sum of its parts, and, as an entry in the single-camera comedy sweepstakes, it fails to show either the inspired inventiveness of Arrested Development or provide the surprisingly perceptive character studies of The Office\". At the end of 2006, LA Weekly listed 30 Rock as one of the best \"Series of the Year\". The show also appeared on similar year end \"best of\" 2006 lists published by The New York Times, The A.V.

The television season begins in September of any given year and ends in May of the following year. \"Viewers\" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes (broadcast in the series' regular timeslot) of 30 Rock aired during the television season. Although the viewer average may be higher for some seasons than others, the rank will not necessarily be higher. This is due to the number of programs aired during primetime. In some seasons, more regular programs may be aired during primetime than in others. The pilot episode generated 8.13\u00a0million viewers, the series' highest ratings until that of its third-season premiere which garnered 8.5\u00a0million viewers. In its original timeslot of Wednesday at 8:00\u00a0pm EST, the show averaged 6.23\u00a0million viewers. 30 Rock aired on Wednesdays for its first four episodes. The season's lowest ratings were achieved by \"Jack the Writer\" and \"Hard Ball\" which both achieved 4.61\u00a0million viewers. The season-two premiere, \"SeinfeldVision\" was viewed by 7.33\u00a0million viewers, the highest rating since the pilot. On January 10, 2008, 30 Rock entered a hiatus due to the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike. The episode that aired on that date was viewed by 5.98\u00a0million viewers. The second-season finale, \"Cooter\", which aired on May 8, 2008, was viewed by 5.6\u00a0million viewers.

NMR reported that 30 Rock adds nearly 7.5% to its total audience every week as a result of viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing. A March 2007 report from MAGNA Global, based on NMR data about viewership ranked by among adults 25\u201354, shows that as of the time of the report 30 Rocks viewers have a median income of $65,000, high enough to place the show tied at 11th in affluence with several other shows. This is during a period where for the season 30 Rock is tied at number 85 in the 18\u201349 demographic. During its second season, 30 Rock ranked in fourth place, against all primetime programming, for television series which are watched by viewers with income above $100,000.

Similarities between the two led to speculation that only one of them would be picked up. Baldwin said, \"I'd be stunned if NBC picked up both shows. And ours has the tougher task, as a comedy, because if it's not funny, that's it.\" Kevin Reilly, then president of NBC Entertainment, was supportive of Fey, describing the situation as a \"high-class problem\": Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, as well as the conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied. Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock. Fey said, \"it's just bad luck for me that in my first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television. I was joking that this would be the best pilot ever aired on Trio. And then Trio got canceled.\" Fey wound up \"beating\" Sorkin when Studio 60 was canceled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Though 30 Rocks first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60, Studio 60 was more expensive to produce. One early promo for 30 Rock portrayed Alec Baldwin mistakenly thinking he would meet Sorkin, and when asked on her \"Ask Tina\" space what she thought of the criticism that 30 Rock received, Fey jokingly replied that people who did not like it were probably confusing it with Studio 60. However, none of 30 Rocks producers have given Studio 60 any serious criticism, positive or negative. In a November 1, 2006, interview, Fey said she had seen the first two episodes of Studio 60. When asked what her impressions were, she jokingly replied, \"I can't do impressions of Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry.\" At least five 30 Rock episodes have briefly parodied Studio 60: \"Jack the Writer\" contains a self-referring walk and talk sequence, such sequences being commonly used on Studio 60 and Aaron Sorkin's previous shows. \"Jack-Tor\": Liz tries to quote global education statistics, only to mess up and realize that she does not know what she is talking about. \"Jack Meets Dennis\": Liz says the upcoming show will be \"worse than that time we did that Gilbert and Sullivan parody.\" The second episode of Studio 60, \"The Cold Open,\" included a parody of the \"Major-General's Song\" on the show-within-the-show. \"The Fabian Strategy\": In the ending sequence, Kenneth watches the credits for TGS, which include Ricky and Ronnie as writers, the two ex-head writers on Studio 60. \"Plan B\": Aaron Sorkin appears as himself as Liz is attempting to get a new job at NBC's The Sing-Off. Sorkin explains to Liz that he, too, is having trouble finding work writing for television, despite having written such works as The West Wing, A Few Good Men, and The Social Network. Liz adds Studio 60 to that list, but Sorkin tells her to \"shut up\". The two of them also engage in Sorkin's signature \"Walk and Talk\" during their exchange, leading them to where they started the conversation, which Liz points out. Some critics have compared 30 Rock to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, with parallels drawn between the relationship of Liz and Jack and that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant. It has also been compared to That Girl. Like That Girl and Mary Tyler Moore, 30 Rock is a sitcom centering on an unmarried, brunette career woman living in a big city where she works in the television industry. That Girl was parodied in the opening segment of 30 Rocks pilot."

Baldwin was in negotiations for a year to star in the project before dropping out. Ted Danson replaced Baldwin as the lead character, and the series setting was changed to Los Angeles to accommodate Danson's wish to remain in his home city. Following this, the series (now titled Mr. Mayor) was rewritten to lose any connections to 30 Rock. On June 22, 2020, at the request of Fey and Carlock, NBC announced that four episodes of the series that depict actors in blackface would be removed from streaming services and taken off circulation on TV. Fey stated: \"As we strive to do the work and do better in regards to race in America, we believe that these episodes featuring actors in race-changing makeup are best taken out of circulation. I understand now that 'intent' is not a free pass for white people to use these images. I apologize for pain they have caused\".  The episodes that were removed are the third season episode \"Believe in the Stars\" and the fifth season episode \"Christmas Attack Zone\", both of which featured Jenna in blackface; the sixth season episode \"Live from Studio 6H\", which featured guest star Jon Hamm in blackface; and the east coast version of the fifth season episode \"Live Show\".

        "content": "Jim Davis (Christian Bale) is a former U.S. Army Ranger and GWOT veteran who suffers from PTSD. Jim has a Mexican girlfriend, Marta (Tammy Trull), whom he is determined to marry and bring into the United States to start a life together. With this in mind, Jim returns to Los Angeles, California. In Los Angeles, Jim meets up with his best friend Mike Alonzo (Freddy Rodriguez). Mike's longtime girlfriend, Sylvia (Eva Longoria), a young attorney, is \"on the warpath\" over his failure to get a job (his previous job was outsourced) and she encourages Jim to help Mike hand out resumes.  After being denied a position in the Los Angeles Police Department for failing the psychological profile, Jim gets drunk with Mike. The two visit Jim's ex-girlfriend, but when her current boyfriend shows up, a fight ensues in which the boyfriend is backed up by a group of friends. Jim is able to get the upper hand and when Mike produces a gun, they subdue the men and rob them of their possessions, including marijuana and a handgun which they later decide to sell. Jim later leaves messages on Mike's answering machine with several different voices, pretending to be companies responding to his resume. The next day, Jim goes to visit Mike and finds Sylvia in a good mood due to the fake callbacks. Jim and Mike go to a \"paisa\" bar to try to sell the gun, but leave after their potential buyer is killed. Mike is horrified, but Jim is strangely excited by witnessing death again. When Mike arrives back home drunk, Sylvia is upset, so Mike plays back the answering machine, unaware that his friend didn't hang up early enough and his voice is heard on the tape. Sylvia is enraged and throws Mike out. He stays at Jim's place. Jim gets shortlisted for a position with the Department of Homeland Security, but, after cheating to pass a urine test, he fails a polygraph test due to a question about his drug use. The only hope left for him is a government agent working out of Colombia, who appreciates Jim's ability to \"get things done\"; Jim eventually accepts the position but is warned that he must not marry a foreigner. Jim is told to report to FLETC in a few days. Meanwhile, Mike gets a job with a company managed by an old friend. Mike goes to visit Sylvia and tells her that he has a job for real. She calms down and the two make love. Impatient, Jim goes inside and tells Sylvia that Mike is coming to Mexico with him for the weekend, as it is their last chance to hang out. Sylvia is angry and against the idea, but Mike decides to go with Jim and Toussant to Mexico. In Mexico, the trio attend a big party where Marta reveals she is pregnant, and Jim responds violently, threatening to punch her in the stomach and shoot her in the head. On the way back, Jim reveals that he is transporting 20 kilos of marijuana. When Mike protests, Jim pulls a gun on him, flashing back, before breaking down in tears, horrified at what he is becoming. Mike, filled with pity for his friend, agrees to accompany Jim to the deal. When they arrive, they realize one of the buyers was the same man they had earlier robbed and beaten, the boyfriend of Jim's old flame. Hostility ensues with both Jim and the other gang members pulling out guns, resulting in the other man's death. The other members of the buying party plead for their lives, but Jim kills them while suffering flashbacks. While Jim and Mike are escaping in the car, a man comes from the house and shoots at the car with an Armsel Striker; Jim is hit in the back and face and subsequently paralyzed. He urges Mike to \"step up\" and shoot him, thus ending his suffering. After some hesitation, Mike and Jim say their goodbyes and Mike ends up killing Jim. The film ends with Mike returning to Sylvia. They embrace together as Mike breaks down crying."

The source of most of Howie's frustration was his wife's younger sisters (the siblings, or \"sibs\", of the title), Audie (Margaret Colin) and Lily (Jami Gertz). Audie was a real estate agent and hence almost unemployed in the era's weak market; she was also recovering from a recent bout of alcoholism. Lily had just been dumped by her boyfriend, who had fled to Germany without her, and had a host of other problems. Both sisters brought all of their problems to Nora, continuing a pattern that had apparently begun when they were all children. In the beginning of the pilot, Nora was distraught after just having learned that the head of her accounting firm had died. Nora's late boss had left the firm to his boorish, whiny nephew Warren Morris (Dan Castellaneta), who was another ongoing character. Shortly after inheriting his uncle's firm, Warren had fired Nora, only to learn that she was the one most of the client base had trusted, and that most of them left with her. He was now unemployed and constantly begging Nora for a job. The original title proposed for the series was Grown-ups."

The following night, the show began airing in its regular Wednesday 9:30/8:30c time period, kicking off the latter half of the three-hour Wednesday comedy block that ABC was promoting as The Hump. Ultimately, Sibs had very little appeal to a mass audience, and garnered weak ratings in its first month on the air. The series' low ratings adversely affected the shows that followed it, Anything but Love and Good & Evil, another freshman comedy, which, in its own right, was struggling due to its 10:30/9:30c scheduling and controversy over its storylines. Sibs was put on hiatus in late October 1991 as the three-hour sitcom block was discontinued (Anything but Love moved into Sibs''' time slot, while Good & Evil was canceled). The remaining episodes were aired by ABC in April and May of 1992, on Tuesdays at 9:30/8:30c (again following Roseanne), and the series was officially canceled during May 1992 upfronts."

        "content": "In 1993, a year after the series' cancellation, Heide Perlman proposed a new comedy pilot for ABC which was a re-conceived version of Sibs. Perlman was successful in having Margaret Colin, Jami Gertz and Dan Castellaneta participate in the new pilot, in which all reprised their Sibs characters of Audie, Lily and Warren respectively. ABC greenlighted the pilot, titled Related By Birth, and it was produced later that year. This incarnation focused on the close relationship of sisters Audie and Lily, with no mention as to the existence of older sister Nora or brother-in-law Howie (as Marsha Mason and Alex Rocco declined to appear in this project). Audie, who had been cynical and icy in Sibs, exhibited a softer personality in this version, whereas Lily was portrayed as more neurotic. Warren, whose character had also become more subdued, was a companion of the girls, while the new supporting cast included Mark Nassar as Audie's frantic, entrepreneurial boss Michael Brickman and Grayson McCouch as Henry, Lily's assistant in a catering business. ABC aired Related By Birth as a summer pilot special on July 2, 1994, but passed on developing the project into a weekly series."

Meanwhile, the Cat in the Hat goes on a picnic. Their paths cross when the Grinch bumps his car into the Cat's, and things quickly escalate into a fierce car chase after the Cat unintentionally insults the Grinch by calling him \"Mr. Greenface.\" The Cat returns to the safety of his house, but the Grinch follows him there to demonstrate a device he has invented, an \"Acoustical Anti-Audial Bleeper\", also referred to as a \"Vacusound Sweeper\", that scrambles all sounds within a 50-mile radius, including the Cat's voice. Back home, the Grinch decides to upgrade the sweeper into a \"darkhouse\", an anti-lighthouse that spreads beams of darkness. The Cat becomes upset with the Grinch's hi-jinks and has a psychiatric session with him in a thought bubble to find out what makes him so mean-spirited. He gets nowhere with the imaginary Grinch (though he is briefly triggered by the memory of his deceased mother), so the Cat then decides to go over and have a talk with him. The Grinch makes it so dark that the Cat can't see where he's going, and he crashes his car when he passes a \"Dead End\" sign. The Grinch decides to liven things up by changing the beam of darkness to persimmon pink. The Cat takes refuge in a nearby restaurant, while the Grinch sends beams that make things change colors, and literally and crazily come to life. His hi-jinks result in confusion all over the restaurant to Humoresques by Anton\u00edn Dvor\u00e1k. The Cat is now furious with the Grinch and ponders to himself how he can change the Grinch, eventually finding an idea and rallies up everybody in the restaurant to follow him to the Grinch's house. There, he leads everyone in a song to remind the Grinch of all of the love he received from his mother and implore him to change his ways and be a better person. Before the Grinch can get to the darkhouse to scramble it, he collapses in grief over the memory of his mother (whose reflection in the puddle of his tears comforts him) and he and Max dismantle the darkhouse. The next morning, the Grinch is again happy. When the reflection tries to turn him evil again, Max reveals he left the Vacusound Sweeper intact and scrambles the reflection's words."

        "content": "In 1924, newly successful author Kit Marlowe returns to her hometown to speak, as part of a lecture tour, and to visit her dear childhood friend Millie. The friends have formed distinctly opposite personalities: Kit is witty, perceptive, wry and calmer, while Millie is intense, self-involved and histrionic. Millie has married Preston Drake and is pregnant, and she surprises Kit when she discloses she has also written a book, a romance novel. Millie asks Kit to present her book to her publisher. Upon their meeting, Preston appears to be impressed by Kit Marlowe. Eight years pass, and Millie has become increasingly difficult and resentful of any diversion from full attention being focused upon herself. When Kit jokes and glowingly reports about her shopping trip with Preston and Millie's only child, Deirdre, Millie impudently retorts \"Time you had one of your own!\" as she swans out. Preston immediately asks Kit why she has remained so loyal to Millie over the years. Kit confides in Preston despite Millie's often emotionally unstable and dysfunctional behavior, she feels indebted as Millie was her first real friend. Kit feels a particular loyalty to Millie as orphaned Kit grew up with an aunt who died and found a sense of home and family through Millie's parents' kindness and generosity towards Kit. Millie has become a very successful writer, with a string of romance novels. This has made her very arrogant and condescending to those around her. Visiting New York, on the eve of the opening of a play written by Kit, the Drakes' marriage is slowly disintegrating. In an interview with a reporter, Preston, an architect and engineer, is shown to feel secondary to his wife\u2019s success. In a private moment with Kit, when Millie mentions Preston\u2019s drinking habit, Kit replies \u201cpeople drink for escape,\u201d but Millie does not seem to appreciate Kit\u2019s point. In a private moment between Preston and Kit, he professes his love for her. Millie and Preston clash with Kit playing referee. The response is complete ingratitude from self-absorbed Millie and growing romantic feelings from an increasingly frustrated Preston. Moments later, as the three converse, Preston and Millie's argument escalates (with Millie displaying what some might interpret as \u2018manic\u2019 behavior) and Preston leaves Millie \u2018for good\u2019. Kit tracks down Preston and tries to convince him to return to Millie, but he tries to convince Kit that he is in love with her. Selflessly, Kit tells him she can not reciprocate, as she could not do that to Millie. They kiss goodbye and part. Ten years pass, and World War Two is underway. Kit is on a radio show espousing the good of the American Red Cross, and Preston, now a major in the Army, hears her. He calls the radio station to suggest they meet for a drink. They do, but Kit also has her much-younger beau, Rudd Kendall, and Preston\u2019s almost 18-year-old daughter, Deirdre, whom Preston has not seen in those ten years, join them. Preston tells Kit he is engaged, and Kit is happy for him. Preston and his daughter become reacquainted. The next morning Rudd (again) presses Kit to marry him, but she puts him off, promising an answer in a few days, and he leaves. Rudd, feeling reproached and rejected, then meets with Deirdre. Millie treats Preston's return as a victory and sets the scene for a desperate reconciliation. Preston however dashes her hopes by revealing his engagement and asks for \u2018joint custody\u2019 of Deirdre. Preston incidentally discloses to Millie that he was once in love with Kit. An outraged Millie throws him out. Millie then rants and raves to Deirdre about how Kit is a Jezebel (the writer's tongue-in-cheek reference to Davis\u2019s 1938 film Jezebel). Millie spitefully does her best to poison Deirdre against Kit and relishes in excessively establishing herself as the center of attention and reveling in her self-indulgence, oblivious to Deirdre's clear distress. Millie also discloses that Kit is to marry Rudd, causing Deirdre further distress, and Deirdre leaves. Kit and Millie have an all-out argument about all that hasn\u2019t been said until now, where Millie acts victimized and Kit reveals a few brutal home truths to an in denial and melodramatic Millie. Millie even goes as far to discard to her own daughter to her love rival. Realizing her words are falling on deafened ears, frustrated Kit physically shakes Millie to \"knock some sense\" into her self-obsessed friend in arguably the film's most remembered scene. That night, Kit, having decided to marry Rudd, finds out from him that he is now in love with Deirdre. Kit tracks down Deirdre at a handsome but incompatible beau's bachelor pad, calms her, and returns her to Rudd. Kit then returns home to find Millie, and they reconcile. Millie tells Kit about her new book, about the trials of two women friends, and Kit suggests that Millie title the book \u201cOld Acquaintance\u201d. Millie agrees."

        "content": "Banyon is a detective series broadcast in the United States by NBC as part of its 1972-73 television schedule, though a standalone two-hour television movie was broadcast first in March 1971. The series was a Quinn Martin Production (in association with Warner Bros. Television), the first-ever show Martin made for the NBC network, though he did not produce the pilot. Banyon was a period drama set in the late 1930s in Los Angeles.  It concerned the life of private investigator Miles C. Banyon (Robert Forster), a tough-but-honest detective who would accept essentially any case for US$20/day.  Located in the same complex (the famed Bradbury Building) as Banyon's office was the secretarial school operated by Peggy Revere (Joan Blondell).  By an agreement between Banyon and Revere, part of the training provided to these young women was a period serving as Banyon's secretary; this gave him the advantage of not having to provide a salary for a secretary but meant that he never had the same one long enough for her to become a truly knowledgeable or reliable assistant.  Besides Revere, the other ongoing female character was Banyon's girlfriend, Abby Graham (Julie Gregg), a nightclub singer who was constantly trying to encourage him to \"settle down\" and marry her, but to no avail during the brief run of this series.  Banyon's police acquaintance with the Los Angeles Police Department was the cynical Lieutenant Pete McNeil (Richard Jaeckel). Banyon was unable to find an adequate audience and lost in the Nielsen ratings to ABC's Love, American Style and movies on CBS and was canceled  midseason.  Despite the show's short life, Quentin Tarantino liked Forster's performance as the title character so much that he hired him for the feature film Jackie Brown many years later. It is one of the few Quinn Martin shows not owned currently by ViacomCBS; the series rights remain with WarnerMedia. It is also one of only two QM shows to bill a cast member above the title (the other is A Man Called Sloane, featuring Robert Conrad)."

        "content": "Woody Deane (Kevin Zegers) and Nell Bedworth (Samaire Armstrong) are neighbors and former childhood friends who go to the same high school, but are otherwise completely different. Woody is a popular varsity football player while Nell is a girl who loves literature but lacks social skills. They loathe each other and are constantly in dispute. One day their class goes on a school trip to a museum and they are forced to work together on an assignment. They quickly begin arguing in front of a statue of the ancient Aztec god Tezcatlipoca. As they argue, the statue casts a spell upon them\u2014causing them to wake up in each other's bodies the next morning. When they arrive at school, they immediately blame each other for the body swap, but agree to pretend to be the other person until they can find a way to switch back. At first, they seem to succeed, but quickly return to arguing when they each feel the other is misrepresenting them in the opposite body, such as Woody (in Nell's body) answering a question oddly and surprising a teacher. The following day, Nell (in Woody's body) arrives at school wearing \"Chinos and an Oxford cotton button-down\" making Woody's appearance look \"dorky\" which frustrates Woody, and he is even more frustrated after he hears about how Nell (in Woody's body) failed Woody's football practice the previous day. As payback, Woody (in Nell's body) dresses in inappropriate and provocative clothing the following day. After school, Nell, in retaliation, breaks up with Breanna (Brooke D'Orsay), Woody's girlfriend, much to the disappointment of Woody. The humiliation competition continues when Woody (in Nell's body) drives off with a biker boy, Nicky (Brandon Carrera), and makes Nell think she is going to lose her virginity. However, Woody decides it is \"so gay\" and leaves Nicky just as he is removing his clothing. The following day, rumors are being spread around school by Nicky about his night with Nell. When Nell finds out, she gets very upset. When Woody finds Nell, he admits that he didn't actually lose Nell's virginity and that everyone was simply spreading Nicky's lies. However, Nell is still let down and so Woody decides to confront Nicky. It turns out that Woody (in Nell's body) can't fight him, and Nell (in Woody's body) runs up and punches him in the face. After this, Nell and Woody reach a truce and realize the statue of Tezcatlipoca at the museum had something to do with their body swap. They head down to the museum and even after confronting the statue, they fail to return to their original bodies. They realize they are going to have to help each other in two important upcoming events. Nell must learn how to play football for Woody's Homecoming game and Woody must learn about poetry and literature for Nell's Yale interview. Later that night Nell (in Woody's body) is getting drunk at a party while Woody (in Nell's body) is stuck at a slumber party listening to all the gossip about himself, and is surrounded by nail polish, pajamas, slippers, and gets a bikini wax. After spending so much time together, Nell and Woody become very fond of each other and start to understand each other better. The night before the interview and the game, they agree to go to the Homecoming Dance together, as \"not a date.\" The day of the interview and match, Woody goes to Yale for the interview and at first messes things up and is asked to leave, but he starts to talk about poetry in rap, which impresses and astonishes the interviewer. After that, he goes to the football game and watches Nell run in the winning touchdown in the closing seconds. A college recruiter witnesses his good performance and wants to talk to him later. After the game, they congratulate each other for their successes. Shortly after this, the spell lifts and they return to their original bodies. The scene finishes with Woody being kissed by Breanna and Nell going home very upset about it. The following day, Woody tries to talk to Nell, but is stopped by her mother, who sees Woody's family as uneducated. Nell receives an acceptance letter from Yale, meaning that her interview (done by Woody in her body) was successful; however, she is still upset with Woody and decides not to go to the Homecoming Dance. Meanwhile, Nell's father has a talk with her on the porch about Woody, during which she confesses she truly likes him, and her father surprises her with a dress and shoes for the dance. Woody and Breanna are selected as the Homecoming King and Queen. As the Homecoming King and Queen prepare to dance, an upset Woody sees Nell and both confess their love for each other. They leave the school together and share a kiss in front of their houses. The following day, Nell tells her mother that she is taking a year's sabbatical before attending  Yale, and hops into Woody's car as they drive off together."

        "content": "Adventure Time is an American fantasy animated television series created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network. The series follows the adventures of a boy named Finn (Jeremy Shada) and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (John DiMaggio)a dog with the magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the Ice King (Tom Kenny), Marceline (Olivia Olson), BMO (Niki Yang), and others. The series is based on a 2007 short film that aired on Nicktoons. After the short became a viral hit on the Internet, Nickelodeon's executives passed on its option before Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series from Seibert and Ward, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010, and ended on September 3, 2018. The series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for episodes are decided by storyboarding artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced that on September 29, 2016, the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. The series finale aired on September 3, 2018, which was followed by the Distant Lands specials and the Fionna and Cake spin-off, which were released on HBO Max. Adventure Time was a ratings success for Cartoon Network, with some of its episodes attracting over three million viewers, and despite being aimed primarily at children, the show has developed a following among teenagers and adults. Adventure Time has received positive reviews from critics and won awards, including eight Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award, three Annie Awards, two British Academy Children's Awards, a Motion Picture Sound Editors Award, and a Kerrang! Award. The series has also been nominated for three Critics' Choice Television Awards, two Annecy Festival Awards, a TCA Award, and a Sundance Film Festival Award, among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an Eisner Award and two Harvey Awards. The series has also spawned various forms of licensed merchandise, including books, video games and clothing."

Pendleton Ward, the series' creator, describes Finn as a \"fiery little kid with strong morals\". Jake, on the other hand, is based on Tripper Harrison, Bill Murray's character in Meatballs. This means while Jake is somewhat care-free, he will \"sit [Finn] down and give him some decent advice if he really needs it\". Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, which was ravaged by a cataclysmic event known as the \"Mushroom War\", a nuclear war that destroyed civilization a thousand years before the series' events. Throughout the series, Finn and Jake interact with major characters, including Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom and a sentient piece of gum; the Ice King (Tom Kenny), a menacing but largely misunderstood ice wizard; Marceline the Vampire Queen (Olivia Olson), a thousand-year-old vampire and rock music enthusiast; Lumpy Space Princess (Pendleton Ward), a melodramatic and immature princess made out of \"lumps\"; BMO (Niki Yang), a sentient video game console-shaped robot that lives with Finn and Jake; and Flame Princess (Jessica DiCicco), a flame elemental and ruler of the Fire Kingdom."

        "title": "Adventure Time_Concept and creation",
        "content": "According to series creator Pendleton Ward, the show's style was influenced by his time attending the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and his experiences working as a writer and storyboard artist on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, a series which ran on Cartoon Network from 2008 until 2010. In an interview with Animation World Network, Ward said he strives to combine Adventure Times subversive humor with \"beautiful\" moments, using Hayao Miyazaki's film My Neighbor Totoro as inspiration for the latter. Ward has also named Home Movies and Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist as influences, largely because both shows are \"relaxing\" and feature \"conversational dialogue that feels natural [and is neither] over the top [nor] cartoony and shrill\". The series can trace its origin back to a seven-minute, stand-alone animated short film of the same name (this short would later be identified as the show's pilot post facto). Ward created the short almost entirely by himself, and concluded its production in early 2006. It was first broadcast on Nicktoons Network on January 11, 2007, and was re-broadcast as part of Frederator Studios' anthology show Random! Cartoons on December 7, 2008. After its initial release, the video became a viral hit on the Internet. Frederator Studios then pitched an Adventure Time series to Nicktoons Network, which rejected it five times. When Nicktoons' rights to commission a full series expired, Frederatorthe short's production animation studiopitched it to other channels. One of the studios that Frederator approached was Cartoon Network, which was interested in producing a full series, but would commit to a deal only if Ward could prove the pilot \"wasn't a one-hit wonder\". Rob Sorcher, the chief content officer at Cartoon Network, was influential in getting the network to take a chance on the show; he recognized the series as \"something that felt really indie\u00a0... comic book-y [and] new\". Cartoon Network asked Ward to submit a sample script for their consideration, but Frederator convinced him to rough out a storyboard instead, as \"a board would give a better sense of what was on Pen's mind\", according to Frederator's vice president Eric Homan. Ward and his college friends Patrick McHale and Adam Muto (the former of whom served as a writer, storyboard artist, and creative director for the show during its first few seasons, while the latter served as a storyboard artist and creative director for the show before becoming its showrunner) began developing ideas, all the while concentrating on \"keep[ing] the good things about the original short [while also] improv[ing] on\" them. The group's first product was a rough storyboard featuring Finn and Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date. Cartoon Network was not happy with this story, and so Ward, McHale, and Muto created a storyboard for the episode \"The Enchiridion!\", which was their attempt to consciously emulate the style of the original Nicktoons short. This tactic proved successful, and Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008. \"The Enchiridion!\" was the first episode to enter into production. Ward and his production team began storyboarding episodes and writing plot outlines, but Cartoon Network was still concerned about the direction of the new series. McHale later recalled that during the pitch of an episode titled \"Brothers in Insomnia\" (which, for various reasons, was scrapped) the room was filled with executives from Cartoon Network. The pitch went well, but the production staff was soon inundated with questions about the stylistic nature of the series. Around this time, Cartoon Network paused the production of the show in an attempt to resolve these creative issues. A number of writers and animators were let go, and in their place, Cartoon Network management hired three veteran animators who had worked on SpongeBob SquarePants: Derek Drymon (who served as executive producer for the first season of Adventure Time), Merriwether Williams (who served as head story editor for the show's first and second seasons), and Nick Jennings (who became the series' long-serving art director). Drymon, in particular, played a key role at this time, ensuring that both Cartoon Network and the show's production crew were on the same creative page. Thurop Van Orman, the creator of The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, was also hired to guide Ward and his staff for the first two seasons. The storyboard for \"Prisoners of Love\" assuaged many of the fears some Cartoon Network executives had expressed. As production for season one progressed, more artists were brought on board. Dan \"Ghostshrimp\" Bandit, a freelance illustrator who had also written and storyboarded on Flapjack, was hired as the show's lead background designer; Ward told him to create background art that set the show \"in a 'Ghostshrimp World\". Ghostshrimp designed major locations, including Finn and Jake's home, the Candy Kingdom, and the Ice Kingdom. The position of lead character designer was given to Phil Rynda, who held this role for two-and-a-half seasons. The lead production crew for the show (which included Ward and McHale) were initially hesitant to bring him on board, but they were soon convinced by director Larry Leichliter, who assured them Rynda was talented and could draw in a variety of styles. With the producers satisfied, Rynda quickly began designing characters that were simple but still fell in line with \"Pen's natural aesthetic\". Around this time, Rynda and McHale began drafting artistic guidelines for the show, so that its animation style would always be somewhat consistent. With many of the lead production roles filled, Ward turned his attention to choosing storyboard artists for the first season. He assembled a team made up largely of \"younger, inexperienced people\", many of whom he discovered on the Internet. Many of these individuals had backgrounds in indie comics, and Ward has called them \"really smart, smartypants people\" who were responsible for inserting more idiosyncratic and spiritual ideas into the series. For the first four-and-a-half seasons of the show, Ward served as the showrunner for Adventure Time. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Ward revealed that he had stepped down from this role sometime during the fifth season. As a naturally introverted person, he found interacting with and directing people every day to be exhausting. Following Ward's resignation from the post, Adam Muto became the series' new showrunner. Until late 2014, Ward continued to work on the cartoon as a storyboard artist and storyline writer. After November 2014, he stopped regularly contributing to episode outlines, but still looked over stories, provided occasional input, and continued to storyboard for the series on a limited basis."

        "content": "In terms of tone and genre, Warda self-professed fan of ambivalent emotions, such as feeling \"happy and scared at the same time\"has described the show as a \"dark comedy\". He has also cited the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragonsof which many of the show's writers are devoteesas an inspiration for the show. In the United States, the series is rated TV-PG; Ward said he never wanted to push the boundaries of the PG rating, noting in an interview with Art of the Title that he \"never really even thought about the rating\u00a0... we don't like stuff that's overly gross. We like cute stuff and nice things\". Ward intended the show's world to have a coherent physical logic, and although magic exists in the story, the show's writers tried to create an internal consistency in the characters' interactions with the world. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Ward said the show's writing process usually began with the writers telling each other what they had done the previous week to find something humorous to build on. He also said, \"A lot of the time, if we're really stuck, we'll start saying everything that comes to our mind, which is usually the worst stuff, and then someone else will think that's terrible but it'll give him a better idea and the ball just starts rolling like that\". Because of the busy schedule of writing and coordinating a television series, the writers did not have time to play Dungeons and Dragons, but they still wrote stories they would \"want to be playing D&D with\". Sometimes, the writers and storyboard artists convened and played writing games. One game that was often used is called exquisite corpse; one writer starts a story on a sheet of paper, and another writer tries to finish it. But while a few episodes (such as the fifth-season episode \"Puhoy\" and the sixth-season episode \"Jake the Brick\") have been generated using this game, Ward has confessed that \"the ideas are usually terrible\". Former storyboard artist and creative director Cole Sanchez said episode scripts are either created by expanding the good ideas produced by these writing games, or are based on an idea proposed by a storyboard artist in the hope it can be developed into an episode. After the writers pitched stories, the ideas were compiled onto a two-or-three-page outline that contained \"the important beats\". The episodes were then passed to storyboard artists (often referred to colloquially as \"boarders\"). While many cartoons are based on script pitches to network executives, Cartoon Network allowed Adventure Time to \"build their own teams organically\" and communicate using storyboards and animatics. Rob Sorcher said this novel approach was sanctioned because the company was dealing with \"primarily visual people\", and that by using storyboards the writers and artists could learn and grow \"by actually doing the work\". The storyboard artists generally worked on an episode in pairs, independent from other storyboarders, which, according to freelance writer David Perlmutter in his book America Toons In, countered creative ennui and prevented episodes from being \"alike in either content or tone\". The storyboard artists were given a week to \"thumbnail\" (roughly sketch out) a storyboard and fill in the details complete with action, dialogue, and jokes. The series' showrunner and his creative directors then reviewed the storyboard and made notes. The artists were then given another week to implement the notes and to clean up the episode. Storyboard writing and revising usually took up to a month."

        "content": "Following the writing revisions, voice actors would record their parts for the episodes and an animatic would be compiled to reduce the running time to the necessary eleven minutes. Specialized artists then created prop, character, and background designs. According to former lead character designer Phil Rynda, most of this pre-production was done in Photoshop. While the episodes' design and coloring was done in Burbank, California, the actual animation was handled in South Korea by either Rough Draft Korea or Saerom Animation. Animating an episode often took between three and five months alone. The animation was hand-drawn on paper, which was then digitally composited and painted with digital ink and paint. Executive producer Fred Seibert compared the show's animation style to that of Felix the Cat and various Max Fleischer cartoons, but said its world was equally inspired by \"the world of videogames \". While the episodes were being handled in South Korea, the production crew in the United States worked on retakes, music scoring, and sound design. Upon being completed, the animation was sent back to the United States, at which point it was inspected by the production crew, who looked for mistakes in the animation or \"things that didn't animate the way [the staff] intended\". These problems were then fixed in Korea and the animation was finalized. From story outlining to broadcast, it took between eight and nine months for each episode to be created; because of this, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. While a great majority of the series' episodes were animated by Korean animation studios, Adventure Time occasionally featured guest animators and directors. For instance, the second-season episode \"Guardians of Sunshine\" was partly rendered in 3-D to emulate the style of a video game. The fifth-season episode \"A Glitch is a Glitch\" was written and directed by Irish filmmaker and writer David OReilly, and features his distinctive 3-D animation. Animator James Baxter animated select scenes and characters in both the fifth-season episode \"James Baxter the Horse\" as well as the eighth-season episode \"Horse & Ball\". The sixth-season episode \"Food Chain\" was written, storyboarded, and directed by Japanese anime director Masaaki Yuasa, and was animated entirely by Yuasa's own studio Science SARU. Another sixth-season episode, \"Water Park Prank\", features Flash animation by David Ferguson. A stop-motion episode titled \"Bad Jubies\", directed by Kirsten Lepore, aired near the middle of the show's seventh season. Finally, Alex and Lindsay Small-Butera, noted for their web series Baman Piderman, contributed animation to the eighth-season episode \"Beyond the Grotto\" and the ninth-season episode \"Ketchup\"."

Former storyboard artist Niki Yang voices the sentient video game console BMO in English, as well as Jake's girlfriend Lady Rainicorn in Korean. Polly Lou Livingston, a friend of Pendleton Ward's mother Bettie Ward, plays the voice of the small elephant named Tree Trunks. The Adventure Time cast members recorded their lines together at group recording sessions rather than individually, with the aim of recording natural-sounding dialogue. Hynden Walch has described these group recordings as being akin to \"doing a play readinga really, really out there play\". The series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters, and crew members cast people with whom they were interested in working. For instance, in a panel, both Adam Muto and Kent Osborne said the Adventure Time crew often sought out actors who had had roles in the television programs Star Trek: The Next Generation and The Office to play various supporting or background characters."

Inspired by the title sequences of The Simpsons and Pee-wee's Playhouse, Ward developed a new title sequence featuring a panning sweep of the Land of Ooo while a synthesizer note rose slowly until the main theme was played. Ward's draft for this idea was handed to layout animators, who then finalized the timing for the sequence. From there, the sequence evolved; while Ward added \"silly character stuff\", Patrick McHale focused his attention on the Ice King's shot and gave him a \"high school [year]book\" smile. The crew also struggled to get the shadows in the shot featuring Marceline correct. After the panning sweep, the sequence cuts to the theme song, which plays while shots of Finn and Jake adventuring are shown. For this part of the sequence, Ward was inspired by the \"simple\" aspects of the introduction to the 2007 comedy film Superbad. When the theme mentions \"Jake the Dog\" and \"Finn the Human\", the characters' names are displayed next to their heads, with a solid color in the background. The sequence was finalized immediately before the series aired. The show's eponymous theme song is sung by Ward, accompanied by a ukulele. It is first heard in the pilot episode; in that version, Ward is accompanied by an acoustic guitar. For the version used in the series, Ward sang in a higher register to match with the higher range of the ukulele. The finalized version of the theme song was originally supposed to be a temporary version. Ward said, \"I recorded the lyrics for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little crummy microphone just so that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the network. Later, we tried re-recording it and I didn't like it\u00a0... I only liked the temp one!\" Because the series' finalized theme song was originally recorded as a temp track, ambient noises can be heard throughout. For instance, the sound of Derek Drymon typing can be heard while Jake is walking through the Ice Kingdom. According to Ward, much of the series' music has similar \"hiss and grit\" because one of the show's original composers, Casey James Basichis, \"lives in a pirate ship he's built inside of an apartment [and] you can hear floorboards squeak and lots of other weird sounds\". As the show progressed, Basichis's friend Tim Kiefer joined the show as an additional composer. The two now work together on its music. The show's title sequence and theme song have stayed mostly consistent throughout its run, with seven exceptions. During the Fionna and Cake episodes (viz. season three's \"Fionna and Cake\", season five's \"Bad Little Boy\", season six's \"The Prince Who Wanted Everything\", season eight's \"Five Short Tables\", and season nine's \"Fionna and Cake and Fionna\") the series runs a different intro sequence that mirrors the original, with the major exception that all the characters are gender-bent, and the theme is sung by former storyboard revisionist Natasha Allegri. Likewise, the intro to the series' three miniseries are each unique: the introduction to the Marceline-centric Stakes (2015) places most of the emphasis on Marceline, and the theme song is sung by Olivia Olson; the introduction to Islands (2017) adopts a nautical theme, highlights the principal characters in the miniseries, and is sung by Jeremy Shada; and the intro to Elements (2017) features imagery reflecting the four primary elements in the Adventure Time universe (that is: fire, ice, slime, and candy) and is sung by Hynden Walch. The introductions to the guest-animated episodes \"A Glitch Is a Glitch\" and \"Food Chain\" are each unique, featuring animation courtesy of David OReilly and Masaaki Yuasa, respectively. Finally, the series finale, \"Come Along With Me\", features an introduction offering viewers a glimpse of future Ooo, one thousand years after Finn and Jake. This intro features the new characters Shermy and Beth and is sung by the latter (voiced by Willow Smith). The series regularly features songs and musical numbers. Many of the cast membersincluding Shada, Kenny, and Olsonsing their characters' songs. Characters often express their emotions in song; examples of this include Marceline's song \"I'm Just Your Problem\" (from season three's \"What Was Missing\") and Finn's \"All Gummed Up Inside\" (from season three's \"Incendium\"). While the series' background music is composed by Basichis and Kiefer, the songs sung by characters are often written by the storyboard artists. And while it is a general rarity, the show also occasionally refers to popular music. Early during the show's run, Frederator, Seibert's production company, occasionally uploaded demos and full versions of songs sung by the characters to their official website, and when the production crew set up a series Tumblr account, this tradition of publishing demos and full versions of songs to the public was revived. On November 20, 2015, the label Spacelab9 released a limited-edition 12\" LP featuring many of Marceline's songs, which was followed by a 38-song series soundtrack in October 2016."

        "content": "The show is set in the fictional \"Land of Ooo\", in a post-apocalyptic future about a thousand years after a nuclear holocaust called the \"Great Mushroom War\". According to Ward, the show takes place \"after the bombs have fallen and magic has come back into the world\". Before the series was fully developed, Ward intended the Land of Ooo to simply be \"magical\". After the production of the episode \"Business Time\", in which an iceberg containing reanimated businessmen floats to the surface of a lake, the show became explicitly post-apocalyptic; Ward said the production crew \"just ran with it\". Ward later described the setting as \"candyland on the surface and dark underneath\", noting he had never intended the Mushroom War and the post-apocalyptic elements to be \"hit over the head in the show\". He limited it to \"cars buried underground in the background [and other elements that do not] raise any eyebrows\". Ward has said the series' post-apocalyptic elements were influenced by the 1979 film Mad Max. Kenny called the way the elements are worked into the plot \"very fill-in-the-blanks\", and DiMaggio said, \"it's been obvious the Land of Ooo has some issues\". The series has a canonical mythologyor, an overarching plot and backstorythat is expanded upon in various episodes. This mythology mainly involves the nature of the Mushroom War, the origin of the series' principal antagonist the Lich, and the backstories of several of the series' principal and recurring characters. Ward once noted that the details behind the Mushroom War and the series' dark mythology form \"a story worth telling\", but he also felt the show would be better off if the show \"dance[d] around how heavy the back-history of Ooo is\"."

        "content": "Rebecca Sugar said that after joining the show as a storyboarder, she \"became more aware of what we\u2019re really saying by excluding [LGBTQ] characters\" from children's TV, which felt \"more and more dire\" to her. She began working hard to put \"LGBTQIA characters in G-rated content\" in the years to follow. The show introduced viewers to two queer characters: Marceline the Vampire Queen and Princess Bubblegum. Sugar tried to foster the relationship between these two characters through her work on the show, and one genderfluid character (BMO). Initially, while many of these queer themes were worked into episodes as subtext (so as to avoid controversy or network censorship), later episodes\u2014such as the series finale \"Come Along with Me\" and the Distant Lands special \"Obsidian\"\u2014openly expanded on these themes, bringing them to the forefront of the series' plot. In a March 2021 Vanity Fair piece, Sugar said that she was encouraged by the \"creative team to put their own life experiences into the character of Marceline,\" but when this led to a \"romantic storyline between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum\", Cartoon Network executives intervened. This moment led Sugar and the rest of the show's team to see the limit of what they could accomplish, in terms of representation. In September 2021, Abbey White, a reporter for Insider and The Hollywood Reporter, noted the series' interest in \"gender nonconformity and gender-swapping\", and they argued that Lumpy Space Princess upends gender norms."

Olivia Olson, who provided the voice of Marceline, said that since this discussion wore on for a while \"the ending of the show was getting stretched and stretched and stretched\". Chief content officer Rob Sorcher told the Los Angeles Times of the network's decision to end the series, saying: Adventure Time was playing less and less on Cartoon Network, yet we were moving towards a large volume of episodes. And I really began thinking \"[The end] can't come quickly as a sudden company decision, it needs to be a conversation over a period of time.\" And it did also strike me that if we don't wind this up soon, we're going to have a generation of fans graduate through the [television] demo[graphic that Cartoon Network targets] and we won't have completed a thought for them. Consequently, on September 29, 2016, Cartoon Network confirmed that the series would conclude after its tenth season. The final episode of the series is a special, titled \"Come Along with Me;\" the special was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich, Steve Wolfhard, Seo Kim, Somvilay Xayaphone, Hanna K. Nystr\u00f6m, Aleks Sennwald, and Sam Alden, and Graham Falk. The story was developed by Herpich, Wolfhard, Ashly Burch, showrunner Adam Muto, head writer Kent Osborne, Jack Pendarvis, Julia Pott, and series creator Pendleton Ward. Former head background designer Ghostshrimp returned after having officially left the series during the fourth season. According to Osborne, Cartoon Network provided the writers with \"an opportunity to spend a lot of time thinking about the finale\" before production ended. In an interview with TV Guide, Muto explained that the show's writers used many of the episodes preceding the finale to conclude minor character story arcs \"so we wouldn't have to cram too much in at the very end here.\" This allowed the finale itself to be \"less dense\" by simply \"hitting the big [beats] and then finding vignettes for all the characters ... so we could get snapshots of where they could end up.\" According to Pendarvis, storyline writing for the series ended in mid-November 2016, with the last storyline meeting being held on November 21. A tweet by Osborne revealed that the series' final script was pitched to storyboarders, with Alden and Nystr\u00f6m in attendance, on November 28. This episode was then pitched to the show's producers during the third week of December 2016. Voice recording for the episode ended on January 31, 2017, as confirmed by a number of cast members, including Maria Bamford and Andy Milonakis. The series finale aired on September 3, 2018, receiving a largely positive reception. Around a year later, on October 23, 2019, Cartoon Network announced that four hour-long specials\u2014collectively titled Adventure Time: Distant Lands\u2014would air on HBO Max. The specials aired throughout 2020 and 2021. On August 17, 2021, it was announced that a second spin-off, Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake, focusing on the gender-swapped Fionna and Cake characters, was ordered by HBO Max."

        "content": "Each Adventure Time episode is about eleven minutes in length; pairs of episodes are often telecast in order to fill a half-hour program time slot. Before the official debut of the first season, Cartoon Network aired both \"Business Time\" and \"Evicted!\" on March 11 and 18, respectively, advertising these showings as \"previews\" of the series-to-come. The show officially debuted with \"Slumber Party Panic\" on April 5, 2010. During the latter part of its run, the show began to experiment with the miniseries format. The first of these was Stakes (2015), which aired during the show's seventh season. The following miniseries, Islands (2017) aired as part of the eighth season. The third and final miniseries, Elements (2017), aired during the show's ninth season. The show's seventh season was originally intended to comprise 39 episodes, ranging from \"Bonnie & Neddy\" to \"Reboot\". However, when it came time to upload the seventh season onto streaming sites like CartoonNetwork.com, Cartoon Network chose to end the season with the episode \"The Thin Yellow Line\", for a total of 26 episodes. This new episode count for the season was cemented by the release of the complete seventh season DVD on July 18, 2017, which included episodes \"Bonnie & Neddy\" through \"The Thin Yellow Line\". As such, the episode and season number sequence is accordingly changed, as follows: For its first six seasons, episodes regularly aired once a week. Starting in November 2014, the show began to air new episodes via \"bombs\", or weeks in which new episodes debuted every day. This change in airing style disrupted the viewing patterns of some fans, as Dave Trumbore of Collider explained: \"Back when [the show] was regularly airing in a more traditional schedule, it was a little easier to keep track of the completely insane episodes full of half-explained mythology and lots and lots of non-sequiturs. During the last few seasons, however, [when] the episodes started to arrive in more of a scattershot fashion scheduled around multi-part specials [it became easier to miss] the random airings of certain episodes\". The series' initial run concluded in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. Reruns have aired on Boomerang and Adult Swim."

        "content": "The show has received positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Zack Handlen called it \"a terrific show [that] fits beautifully in that gray area between kid and adult entertainment in a way that manages to satisfy both a desire for sophisticated (i.e., weird) writing and plain old silliness\". Adventure Time has been complimented for its resemblance to cartoons of the past. In an article for the Los Angeles Times, television critic Robert Lloyd compared the series to \"the sort of cartoons they made when cartoons themselves were young and delighted in bringing all things to rubbery life\". Robert Mclaughlin of Den of Geek expressed a similar sentiment when he wrote that Adventure Time \"is the first cartoon in a long time that is pure imagination\". He complimented the show for \"its non-reliance on continually referencing pop culture\". Eric Kohn of IndieWire said the show \"represents the progress of [cartoon] medium\" in the current decade. A number of reviews have positively compared the series and its creators to other culturally significant works and individuals, respectively. In 2013, Entertainment Weekly reviewer Darren Franich called the series \"a hybrid sci-fi/fantasy/horror/musical/fairy tale, with echoes of Calvin and Hobbes, Hayao Miyazaki, Final Fantasy, Richard Linklater, Where the Wild Things Are, and the music video you made with your high school garage band\". Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker praised Adventure Times unique approach to emotion, humor, and philosophy by likening it to \"World of Warcraft as recapped by Carl Jung\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club concluded that the show was \"basically what would happen if you asked a bunch of 12-year-olds to make a cartoon, only it's the best possible version of that, like if all the 12-year-olds were super geniuses and some of them were Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and the Marx Brothers\". Adventure Times willingness to explore dark, sad, and complex issues has received praise. Kohn applauded the fact that the show \"toys with an incredibly sad subtext\". Novelist Lev Grossman, in an interview with NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition in the third-season episode \"Holly Jolly Secrets\", the fourth-season episode \"I Remember You\", and the fifth-season episode \"Simon & Marcy\", noting that his origin is \"psychologically plausible\". Grossman praised the way the series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: \"It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. And I look at him and think this cartoon is about my father dying\". Critics have suggested that the show has grown and matured as it has aged. In a review of season four, for instance, Mike LeChevallier of Slant magazine complimented the show for \"growing up\" with its characters. He concluded that the series has \"strikingly few faults\" and awarded the fourth season three-and-a-half stars out of four. The series has been included on a number of best-of lists. Entertainment Weekly ranked it number 20 (out of 25) in a list of the \"Greatest Animated TV Series\". Similarly, The A.V. Club, in a non-ranked run-down of the \"best animated series ever\", called the series \"one of the most distinctive cartoons currently on the air\". The show has also received limited criticism from reviewers. LeChevallier, in an otherwise largely positive review of the third season for Slant magazine, wrote that \"the short-form format leaves some emotional substance to be desired\", and that this was inevitable for a series with such short episodes. The independent cartoon scholar and critic David Perlmutter, who otherwise applauded the show's voice acting and its ability to surpass its source material, argued that the show's vacillation between high and low comedy epitomizes the fact that Cartoon Network is \"unsure of what direction to pursue\". He noted that \"while some of [Adventure Times] episodes work well, others [are] simply confusing\". The newspaper Metro cited the show's frightening situations, occasional adult themes, and use of innuendo as reasons why parents might not want their young children watching it."

Heidi MacDonald of Slate has argued that the scouting of indie comic creators employed by Adventure Time (as well as several other Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon series) has led to an \"animation gold rush\" in which major studios are actively seeking under-the-radar talent for their shows, with her article surmising that \"your favorite brilliant indie cartoonist is probably storyboarding for Adventure Time\". MacDonald also pointed out that Adventure Time has influenced the tone of modern comics, noting: If anything, walking around [comic] shows like SPX, I've noticed something of an Adventure Time track among many of the small press comics now coming out: Where once young cartoonists overwhelmingly produced gloomy masculine self-absorption and misanthropy in the tradition of Daniel Clowes or Chris Ware, these days many booths feature fantasy epics with colorful characters and invented worlds heavy on the talking animals. It shouldn't be surprising that up-and-coming cartoonists are absorbing the Adventure Time aesthetic. A 20-year-old making comics now could have been watching the show since she was 15, after all. In an interview with Paste magazine, Rebecca Sugar explained that working on Adventure Time and connecting with indie and underground comic artists who worked on the show (like Ward, McHale and Muto) was a creative game-changer, as they told her to do what she would do when drawing comics and to not hold anything back. She argued that many of the recent development in animation were inspired by what the show was able to do by being \"very artist-driven\" and allowing independent comic artists to have a major say in the direction of episodes."

Jane, a senior research fellow at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, said that the two main characters are male, and many episodes involve them engaging in violent acts to save princesses, but \"Finn and Jake are part of an expansive ensemble cast of characters who are anything but stereotypical and who populate a program which subverts many traditional gender-related paradigms\". She said the show features \"roughly equal numbers of female and male characters in a protagonist, antagonist, and minor roles\"; includes characters with no fixed gender; uses \"gendered 'design elements'\" such as eyelashes and hair to illustrate character traits rather than gender; equally distributes traits regardless of gender; privileges found, adoptive families or extended families; frames gender in ways that suggest it is fluid, and features elements of queer and transgender sub-text. Carolyn Leslie, writing in Screen, agrees, saying, \"despite having two male leads, Adventure Time is particularly strong when it comes to questioning and challenging gender stereotypes\". She uses Princess Bubblegum, BMO, and Fionna and Cake as examples of characters who refuse to be readily categorized and genderized. The first non-fiction book to scholarly study the series was Adventure Time and Philosophy (2015). Published by Open Court Publishing Company, this work considers Adventure Time from a variety of angles, using the show as a way to explore different philosophical ideas. In July 2020, independent scholar Paul Thomas released a book entitled Exploring the Land of Ooo. In addition to explicating the show\u2019s production history, the book also considers the show\u2019s levels of storytelling, its embracing of creative retcons, and its predication on the monomyth."

According to reports, the film would be executive-produced and written by Pendleton Ward, and produced by Roy Lee and Chris McKay. In October 2015, series producer Adam Muto confirmed that series creator Pendleton Ward was \"working on the premise\" for the film, but that there was \"nothing official to announce yet\". On July 22, 2018, Muto noted that \"an [Adventure Time] movie was never officially announced\". On August 31, 2018, Muto said the finale of the show would not affect a potential movie, nor would the finale lead directly into a film. He also noted that \"all the lore and stuff would not work for a first time viewer\", suggesting that the film would have to hold well on its own to be successful."

Since the dramatic increase in popularity of the series, many graphic T-shirts have been officially licensed through popular clothing retailers. Pendleton Ward hosted T-shirt designing contests on the websites of both We Love Fine and Threadless. Other shirts can be purchased directly from Cartoon Network's store. A collectible card game called Card Wars, inspired by the fourth-season episode of the same name, has been released. On March 11, 2016, it was announced by Lego via Lego Ideas that an official Adventure Time Lego set from an idea by site user, aBetterMonkey, had met voting qualifications and was approved to be produced in cooperation with Cartoon Network. The set was released in January 2017. On July 21, 2013, Taiwan High Speed Rail and the Taiwan branch of Cartoon Network worked together on a project called \"Cartoon Express\" (Chinese: \u6b61\u6a02\u5361\u901a\u5217\u8eca). The entire train was covered with characters from various Cartoon Network shows (including The Amazing World of Gumball, The Powerpuff Girls, Ben 10, and Regular Show), and the two sides of the train is painted with Finn and Jake respectively. Throughout the project, there were over 1,400 runs of the train and over 1.3 million passengers were transported. Near the end, the Taiwan High Speed Rail also sold postcards as souvenirs for sale since August 23, 2014, and the project eventually ended on September 9, 2014. In addition, Cartoon Network established a waterpark named Cartoon Network Amazone in Chonburi, Thailand; it opened on October 3, 2014. Promoting the waterpark, Thai Smile painted Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum and Marceline on the planes. \"Leela and the Genestalk\", an episode from the seventh season of the animated Comedy Central program Futurama, features a cameo of Finn and Jake, with DiMaggio (who voices Bender in Futurama) reprising his role as Jake for the appearance. Similarly, the twenty-eighth season premiere of the Fox series The Simpsons, entitled \"Monty Burns' Fleeing Circus\", includes a couch gag that parodies the title sequence to Adventure Time, complete with Pendleton Ward himself singing a spoof of the Adventure Time theme song. According to Al Jean, the executive producer of The Simpsons, \"[The couch gag] was the brain child of Mike Anderson, our supervising director\u00a0... It's a really beautiful, elaborate crossover\". On the Portuguese talk show 5 Para A Meia-Noite, the humorist Eduardo Madeira, who portrayed a hater called Os\u00f3rio, used Princess Bubblegum and Marceline to mock the Eurovision Song Contest 2018's Portuguese contestants, Cl\u00e1udia Pascoal and Isaura. In the 2016 horror film Better Watch Out, the two boys in the film, Luke the antagonist and his friend Garrett, are fans of the series, and after subduing Luke's babysitter and using drugs and alcohol, the two boys play Fuck, marry, kill using the \"Adventure Time chicks\" as options.  Luke says that he would \"[f]uck Princess Bubblegum,\" to which Garrett replies \"Not Marceline?\" Luke then gives reasons for his choice."

Felix seems to have come from nowhere and is supposed to work as a watchman in a garage. One morning, Maria is kidnapped by a military squad in civilian clothes in front of her mother and is taken to the garage Olimpo, one of the many well-known torture places in the middle of Buenos Aires, which operate with the general indifference of the locals. As soon as Maria is captured the film's mood becomes uncomfortable and the atmosphere is minimalist. The head of the center, Tigre (Enrique Pi\u00f1eyro), asks Felix, their best torturer, to make Maria talk. Yet, Felix is overcome by his feelings for Maria, and Maria is determined to exploit this for her survival."

As the country celebrated its win of the World Cup, many political activists were tortured in Buenos Aires and then later taken on \"death flights\", where victims were drugged and then dropped alive into the Atlantic Ocean from military aircraft. Chilean born director Marco Bechis was a victim of the country's military regime and was forced to leave Argentina in 1977, at the age of 20, for political reasons."

It is indeed no surprise to learn that this Italian-Chilean was himself snatched by the military in Buenos Aires and tortured. Yet, despite his admirable insistence on moving us with the truth (helped by his grainy camera work), Bechis can also tell a tale and he gradually incorporates a race-against-time element. Will Maria escape, especially when she is taken out on the town by her captor? Let's just say that the answer would be alien to Hollywood.\""

        "content": "In ancient Baghdad, poet Omar Khayy\u00e1m wanders the streets in search of his friend, Sinbad, the son and namesake of Sinbad the Sailor, and finds him outside the Khalif's palace. Although the Khalif has offered a reward for his capture, the roguish Sinbad ignores Omar's warnings and nonchalantly sneaks into the palace. Spouting Omar's poetry, Sinbad romances Nerissa, one of the Khalif's harem girls, but is exposed by a slave. Both Sinbad and Omar are caught and brought before the Khalif for sentencing. Also on trial are Greek scholar Simon Aristides, and his daughter Kristina, Sinbad's childhood friend, who has been wrongfully accused of stealing. After the Khalif orders that Sinbad and Omar be executed, his advisor, Jiddah, persuades him to meet with Murad, the ambassador to Tamerlane, a Tartar leader whose forces are threatening to invade Baghdad. Murad boldly informs the Khalif that the Tartars will soon be storming the city and demands that he and his men be entertained in the meantime. Anxious to save Kristina, Sinbad reveals to the Khalif that Simon possesses the formula for an explosive called \"Greek fire\" and will share it with the Khalif in exchange for Simon's, Kristina's, Omar's and his freedom. The Khalif refuses to release Sinbad and Omar, but while they are incarcerated in the dungeon, Simon and Kristina give the ruler a private demonstration of Greek fire. As protection, Simon has entrusted the formula to Kristina, who can recite the instructions only while hypnotized. In front of the Khalif, Simon hypnotizes Kristina, who then gives her father directions for mixing the various bottled ingredients. Unknown to them, Jiddah is in cahoots with Murad, and both men are eavesdropping on the proceedings. Although Jiddah and Murad can hear Kristina telling her father how much of each item to use, they cannot ascertain the chemicals being poured by Simon. Meanwhile, the Khalif, ecstatic about the explosive, agrees to Simon's demand that Sinbad and Omar be freed in the morning. That night, Kristina confides in Ameer that she wants to marry Sinbad and asks her to tell him about his imminent release. Although jealous, Ameer delivers the message to Sinbad, but when she returns to Kristina's chambers, she finds Kristina gone and Simon murdered. Ameer sees Murad fleeing with Kristina and Simon's chemicals and sends a message via carrier pigeon before being caught by Jiddah. While torturing Ameer to reveal the bird's destination, Jiddah notices that she has a Forty Thieves tattoo on her shoulder. Although the Thieves, a band of raiders once led by Sinbad's father, are now dead, Ameer admits that their heirs have banded together, and Jiddah deduces that the message went to them. At dawn, Sinbad and Omar learn that their execution is to proceed as scheduled, but they escape the dungeon and fight their way to the Khalif's chambers. There, Sinbad offers to retrieve Kristina in exchange for his and Omar's freedom, some gold and a promise that he will be made second in command in Bagdad. The Khalif agrees and Sinbad rides off with Omar, unaware that Jiddah, having heard his exchange with the Khalif, is alerting Murad of his plan. Later, while resting in the desert, Sinbad and Omar are joined by Ameer, who reveals that Murad and his men are traveling in disguise with a caravan of merchants and that the Forty Thieves will attack them at first camp. Omar and Sinbad ride to the camp ahead of the caravan, and Sinbad has Omar bury him in the spot where he thinks Kristina's tent will be placed. Breathing through a reed, Sinbad remains buried in the Tartars' camp, far from Kristina's tent, until Murad unwittingly plucks his reed from the sand. Sinbad is forced to surface but manages to sneak into Kristina's tent and free her. As Sinbad, Omar and Kristina ride off, the Forty Thieves, who are all women, attack the camp and reclaim Simon's bottles. Omar, Sinbad and Kristina then go to the Forty Thieves's cave and, using the cry \"open sesame,\" signals a donkey named Sesame to open the \"door.\" After arranging with Ghenia, the raiders' leader, Sinbad reunites with Ameer, but when he refuses to have \"eyes only for her,\" Ameer rejects him. Just then, Murad's men advance on the cave, and Sinbad quickly hypnotizes Kristina, who has fallen in love with Omar, and concocts some Greek fire using Simon's chemicals. Hurling torches coated with the explosive, the Thieves, Sinbad and Omar cripple Murad and his men. Sinbad then defeats Murad in a sword fight, and victory is declared. Later, Sinbad convinces the women to go with him to Bagdad and make peace with the Khalif. At the palace, the Khalif waits for Sinbad with Jiddah, whose duplicity he has yet to realize, preparing to execute him for failing his mission. When Sinbad appears with Kristina and a bevy of beautiful raiders, however, the Khalif embraces him and orders Jiddah to be de-tongued. At Sinbad's behest, Omar is made the royal poet, the Thieves are pardoned, and Sinbad is installed as second in command. Then as a final request, Sinbad asks Ameer to be his bride."

Terlesky replaced Rick Hill, the protagonist from the previous film, in the starring role of Deathstalker.

He asked Jim Wynorski, who had just made Chopping Mall (1986) for Corman, to direct it. Wynorski says Corman was upset that he did not make Conan the Barbarian, \"he should have done Conan, but he didn\u2019t, someone else did it and he said I\u2019m gonna copy it, so that\u2019s what he did.\" Wynorski hired several actors he had worked with before, including John Terlesky. He was dating Monique Gabrielle at the time and had dated Toni Naples, and both were cast. He also hired John LaZar because he had been in Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. There was a script by Neil Ruttenberg which Wynorski felt was \"terrible\" so Wynroski rewrote it with Terlesky and regular collaborator R. J. Robertson. Wynorski said the original script \"was trying to be a Conan movie, and I just said, you know, not what I want to do and I want to be entertaining and I had John who was very, very personable, and I had Toni and Monique and John (LaZar) and Queen Kong, when she was there, and some of the Spanish actors spoke English very well, and they were very happy to do something different.\" The director said, 'we kinda did our version of It Happened One Night\" He wrote two parts for Monique Gabrielle \"because it gave me an extra person, I needed a lot of people who could speak English and, so by creating a dual role for Monique, I created yet another character and every night, John and I would go back to the hotel and rewrite new stuff and shoot it over the next couple of days.\" Wynorski reused sets from previous Corman films but says \"the sets were pretty much trashed by the time I got there, cause I think I was the last guy to use them before they got torn down.\" Wynorski says the producer, Frank Isaac, was \"very upset\" because they kept changing the original script. \"Finally he got so angry about it he called Roger Corman, and Roger Corman\u2019s family came down and Roger watched dailies and said, \u201cThis is fine, keep going\u201d.\" When Corman got back to California, Wynorski asked him to send down the biggest lady wrestler he could find. He did and Wynorski filmed the Queen Kong scene. Wynorski said \"Maria Socas was/is a very sweet person, she was trying to do the role serious and finally I just said play it serious and we\u2019ll do comedy around you.\""

        "content": "Men in Black 3 (stylized as MIB\u00b3) is a 2012 American science fiction action comedy film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and starring Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin. It is the third installment in the Men in Black film series which in turn is loosely based on the comic book series The Men in Black by Lowell Cunningham. It was released fifteen years after the original Men in Black (1997) and ten years after the first sequel, Men in Black II (2002). Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg returned as director and executive producer, respectively. In the film, Boris the Animal, an old enemy of Agent K, escapes from prison and travels back in time to kill the younger K in order to allow his species, a ruthless alien race known as Boglodites, to attack Earth. This forces Agent J to go back in time and team up with K's younger self to save his partner and the world. With a budget of over US $215 million, it is not only one of the most expensive films ever made but also the most expensive comedy film made as of 2012. Men in Black 3 was released on May 25, 2012 by Columbia Pictures and grossed over $624\u00a0million worldwide, making it the 10th highest-grossing film of 2012. Unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing film in the series. The film also received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised it as an improvement over its predecessor. A spin-off film in the series, Men in Black: International, was released on June 14, 2019."

        "content": "In 2012, an alien criminal named Boris the Animal, the last Boglodite, escapes from a maximum-security prison on the Moon to take revenge on Agent K, who shot off his left arm and captured him in 1969. He confronts K and his partner Agent J, and tells him he is \"already dead\". Back at MiB Headquarters, J discovers K was responsible not only for capturing Boris, but for deploying the \"ArcNet\", a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth, leading to their extinction. Boris travels back in time to July 16, 1969, to kill the young Agent K, altering history. With only J's memory somehow unaffected, no one else at the Agency understands his inquiries and knowledge regarding K until Agent O, the new Chief of MIB following Zed's death, eventually pieces together J's erratic actions as signs that there has been a fracture in the space-time continuum. With K gone, the ArcNet was never deployed, and present-day Earth is defenseless from a Boglodite invasion. Knowing from the Agency's records Boris will commit a murder at Coney Island on July 15, 1969, J time travels to said date to kill Young Boris. However, he is arrested by young K, who takes him to MiB Headquarters and prepares to neuralyze him, but decides at the last minute to investigate his claims that he traveled from the future to stop Boris. K and J follow clues, leading them to a bowling alley, and then The Factory, where undercover MiB agent Andy Warhol directs them to Griffin, the last Archanan. Griffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris is coming and flees, but tells J and K where to meet him so he can give them the ArcNet. They meet Griffin at Shea Stadium, after which he is captured by Boris. J and K pursue and rescue Griffin, acquiring the ArcNet. Young Boris escapes and Old Boris arrives on the early morning of July 16 and they team up. After K initially takes the news of what Old Boris will do to him badly, he, J, and Griffin use jetpacks to fly to Cape Canaveral to attach the ArcNet onto the Apollo 11 rocket to deploy it in space, but end up getting arrested by the military. Griffin shows a skeptical colonel the future, revealing to him the importance of their mission, and he assists them in getting to the launch site. As the agents climb up the rocket's launch tower, they are attacked by both Borises. J uses his time-travel device to evade Old Boris's attacks and knocks him off the launch tower. K shoots off Young Boris's left arm, knocking him off of the tower while also restoring the timeline. K attaches the ArcNet to the rocket and it is deployed successfully when the rocket launches, with Old Boris incinerated by the rocket exhaust. Young Boris attacks K on a beach, but the colonel saves K by sacrificing himself. Boris tries to goad K into arresting him so history will repeat itself, but K kills him instead, breaking the cycle. The colonel's young son James arrives and when he inquires about his father, K neuralyzes him and tells him only that his father is a hero. Observing from afar, J realizes that he is James and that K has been watching over him his whole life, and his being there was why the space-time fracture didn't alter his memory. With his mission complete, J returns to 2012, where he reconciles with K, who tells him the Boglodites have been extinct for forty years while J implies his new knowledge of the secret K has been hiding to protect him and thanks him. The un-aged Griffin observes this, and breaking the fourth wall, says it is his new favorite moment in human history."

        "content": "The film's premise was first proposed to director Barry Sonnenfeld by Will Smith during the filming of Men in Black II in 2002, with Smith suggesting that his character, Agent J, travel back in time to save his partner, Agent K, while at the same time exploring Agent K's backstory. Sonnenfeld said the idea \"turned out to be a very long process of development, mainly because of the knotting  issues of time travel.\" It was reported that Smith and executives were leery about bringing back Sonnenfeld because of conflicts on the set of Men in Black II. In a lawsuit filed against his former agents over commissions, Sonnenfeld alleged that Sony considered other directors for Men in Black 3. Sonnenfeld ultimately convinced all involved that he had a strong vision for the film. The film was first announced on April 1, 2009, by Sony Pictures Entertainment president Rory Bruer during a Sony ShoWest presentation. By October 2009, Etan Cohen had been hired to write the screenplay. Sonnenfeld read the script and started working on it in January 2010. As of March 2010, Will Smith remained undecided whether to join the film or another, The City That Sailed. Sonnenfeld in May 2010 confirmed the return of Tommy Lee Jones and Smith. Both had expressed interest in 2008 in reprising their roles. The filmmakers also included Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald as producers, with Steven Spielberg as executive producer; all were producers of the two previous films. In June 2010, writer David Koepp was hired to rewrite the Cohen script. A third writer, Jeff Nathanson, was hired in November 2010 to rewrite the segment of the script that takes place in 1969. Nathanson and Koepp, along with producer Spielberg, had previously worked together on the 2008 film Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which Spielberg directed. Special effects artist Rick Baker created the practical aliens and prosthetic makeup for the film, reprising his role from the previous two Men in Black films. In designing the look for the alien creatures, Baker used the time travel plot device as a reason to design \"retro\" looking aliens reminiscent of science fiction B movies of the era, saying, \"In 2012 the aliens should look like Men in Black aliens and in 1969 they should be retro aliens. Fishbowl space helmets, guys with space suits with ribbed things on it, exposed brains, [and] bug eyes.\" Principal photography began on November 16, 2010, even though, \"We knew starting the movie that we didn't have a finished second or third act,\" director Sonnenfeld said in 2012. \"Was it responsible? The answer is, if this movie does as well as I think it will, it was genius. If it's a total failure, then it was a really stupid idea.\" Filming was originally slated to commence on October 18, 2010, and continue until May 2011, in New York City, with shooting starting in 2010 partly in order to take advantage of a New York tax break in which the state rebates 30\u00a0percent of production costs incurred there. Filming was ultimately split into two parts, the first taking place from November until about Christmas 2010; the filmmakers announced shooting would begin again in mid-February, but it was delayed until April. Sonnenfeld initially stated he would be shooting in 3D, but later decided to film in 2D and convert to 3D during post-production. Set photos for the film appeared online on November 17, 2010, showing Smith, Jones, Emma Thompson, and Nicole Scherzinger. Filming was done in April 2011 in the Morris Park section of The Bronx. Parts of Coney Island, in Brooklyn, had parking and filming permits posted for April 24 and May 2\u20134, 2011, production dates for what the permits titled MIB3. Shooting also took place in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, and was scheduled to wrap in June. For the film, the Ford Taurus SHO was selected as the MIB's official car, replacing the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Mercedes-Benz E-Class from the first two films. For the 1969 scenes, a 1964 Ford Galaxie was used as the MIB's official car. This is the first time Frank the Pug was absent in a Men in Black movie, as well as Chief Zed, Jack Jeebs, and actor David Cross. Instead Zed is written in the story as having died and been immortalized at MIB Headquarters, and a portrait of Frank can be seen in J's apartment. An advertisement for 'The Incredible Speaking Pug' can be seen as Agent J enters Coney Island during his time in 1969."

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, in particular praising Brolin's role as the young Agent K, which he cited as an excellent example of good casting. Ebert also praised the \"ingenious plot, bizarre monsters, audacious cliff-hanging\" and the \"virtuoso final sequence.\" Richard Roeper gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars while saying, \"It's that rare threequel that doesn't suck. Great special effects, surprising amount of heart.\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times also gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars and commented, \"Men in Black 3 arrives in the multiplexes of the world with no particular agenda. Which may be part of the reason that it turns out to be so much fun.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly noted, \"Sonnenfeld and Cohen move their baby along with an integrity and gait that ought to serve as a blueprint for other filmmakers faced with the particular challenges of reviving big-ticket and time-dated hunks of pop culture.\" Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, \"the franchise is no longer the zenith of blockbusterism, and the gooey effects from Hollywood veteran Rick Baker look overly familiar, but Men in Black 3 remains an amiable comedy with some fondly familiar faces.\" Director Paul Thomas Anderson praised the film, saying, \"It was [expletive] great. ... The time-travel stuff [made me] cry my eyes out. I'm a sucker for that stuff.\" Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald gave the film 1 out of 4 stars and stated, \"Men in Black 3 is so dull and empty, it's the first movie that has ever made me think 'Thank God this is in 3D.'\""

        "content": "In 1944, as the air war over Europe enters a deadly phase with increasing losses of Allied bombers, the 332d Fighter Group (the Tuskegee Airmen) consisting of young African-American USAAF fighter pilots, after enduring racism throughout their recruitment and training in the Tuskegee training program, are sent into combat in Italy. Flying worn-out Curtiss P-40 Warhawk aircraft and chafing at their ground attack missions, the Tuskegee Airmen recognize that they may never fight the Luftwaffe. The tight-knit group of Captain Martin \"Easy\" Julian, 1st Lt. Joe \"Lightning\" Little, 2nd Lt. Ray \"Ray Gun\" Gannon, 2nd Lt. Andrew \"Smokey\" Salem, and 2nd Lt. Samuel \"Joker\" George under the guidance of Major Emanuel Stance and Col. A.J. Bullard, face a white military bureaucracy still resistant to accepting black flyers as equals. Strife develops between friends Easy and Lightning, each of whom battles his own inner demons: Lightning is a hotheaded and reckless pilot, while Easy is an alcoholic prone to self-doubt. After returning to base, Lightning becomes infatuated with Sofia, an Italian girl, and starts a relationship. When Lightning punches a white man who uses a racial slur at a \"whites only\" officer's club, he is sent to the brig and reprimanded by Colonel Bullard. Meanwhile, Bullard secures a chance to \"light up the board\" when the Tuskegee Airmen are chosen to support the Allied landings at Anzio, Italy known as Operation Shingle. There, they battle Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters led by a German ace pilot they nickname \"Pretty Boy\" and manage to raze the base that Pretty Boy retreats back to. Pretty Boy is stunned to see the pilots who damaged his plane and razed his base were African-Americans. During their first victory, Ray Gun is injured by anti-aircraft fire and suffers impaired vision in one eye. Easy reluctantly allows Ray Gun to continue flying. Impressed with the Tuskegee Airmen's performance, the USAAF Bomber Command ask Bullard to use his fighters as escorts for Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers because of unacceptably high casualties among bomber crews. Bullard accepts on the condition his unit be supplied with the new North American P-51 Mustang. The tails of the aircraft are painted bright red and become the unofficial name of the outfit. Noting the reckless aggression of previous escort fights, Bullard orders his pilots to stay with the bombers at all costs. Their first escort mission is a success, and the 332nd downs multiple Luftwaffe aircraft without the loss of a single bomber. Lightning even takes his chances to attack a Kriegsmarine destroyer before returning to base. However, Ray Gun is shot down and captured by a Wehrmacht patrol, while Deke crash-lands and nearly dies, but is rescued from his burning Mustang before the fuel tank explodes. As a result of his injuries, Deke is discharged. Ray Gun is taken to Stalag 18, a German POW camp. A group of POWs recruit him, as they believe that he cannot be a German spy. Easy blames himself for Ray Gun's apparent departure, and spirals deeper into alcoholism. Worried, Lightning makes a deal with Easy: he will fly less recklessly as long as Easy remains sober. Meanwhile, attitudes against the Tuskegee Airmen begin to change as they earn the bomber crews' respect. Lightning proposes to Sofia, who accepts as long as he stays in Italy. Ray Gun and his group of POWs escape, but German guards spot several POWs; Ray Gun draws the Germans' attention while the others escape. One of the POWs reaches the 332nd's base and, assuming Ray Gun to be dead, informs them about his sacrifice. The Tuskegee Airmen are tasked with escorting the first American bombers to attack Berlin, though for propaganda reasons they are only asked to escort the bombers on the first leg of their journey. When the fighter squadron meant to relieve them never arrives, Easy stays with bombers. They are attacked by Pretty Boy, now leading a flight of the revolutionary new Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters. Despite being outclassed, the Tuskegee Airmen shoot down several enemies, and escort a wounded B-17 back to Allied airspace. Pretty Boy nearly shoots down Easy, but at the last moment, Lightning attacks and kills Pretty Boy in a head-on attack. Although victorious, Lightning is mortally wounded and dies, and his Mustang crashes. Easy then has to inform Sofia about Lightning's death, and consequently overcomes his alcoholism. At Lightning's funeral, Ray Gun returns, having survived his escape from German captivity, invoking Lightning's memory. Ultimately, the Tuskegee Airmen are awarded the Presidential Unit Citation in honor of their achievements."

        "content": "George Lucas began developing Red Tails around 1988, after hearing of the Tuskegee Airmen from his friend George Hall, a photographer. At the time, the film was scheduled for release in 1992, with Kevin Sullivan writing the screenplay and Thomas Carter directing. Lucas originally conceived of the film as a long, detailed narrative similar to Lawrence of Arabia, and as a trilogy, but after multiple script drafts, he decided to focus on the combat portion of the story. He compared it to Tucker: The Man and His Dream as \"a story too good to be true\". In researching the film, Lucasfilm invited some of the surviving Tuskegee Airmen to Skywalker Ranch, where they were interviewed about their experiences during World War II. Lucasfilm was also given access to the original mission logbooks used by some of the pilots. A number of writers worked on the project until John Ridley was hired in 2007 to write the screenplay. Lucas held discussions with Samuel L. Jackson regarding Jackson possibly directing and acting in the film. Although Jackson praised the script, he did not commit to either role. Anthony Hemingway, a former production assistant for Lucas' The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles TV series, was ultimately chosen to direct in 2008. Pre-production began in January 2009, with location scouting having taken place in June 2008 in Prague, Czech Republic, Italy and Croatia. Lucas invited storyboard artist David Russell (son of Tuskegee Airman James C. Russell) to design key aerial combat sequences. Production began in March 2009 with high-definition Sony F35 cameras used for principal photography, which took place in the Czech Republic, Italy, Croatia and England over a period from August to December. While shooting in the Czech Republic, the actors also underwent a \"boot camp\" program, during which they lived in similar conditions to the actual Tuskegee Airmen. Harkening back to his early work on Star Wars where he had studied World War II aerial footage to create the space aerobatics performed by Rebel X-wings and TIE fighters, Lucas was familiar with World War II aerial combat. The Lucas template for photographing computer-generated imagery (CGI) dogfighting \"involved lots of action, continuous motion, moving camera, streaks, loops and rolls, and all of the things aerial photography allows you to do in live action.\" Aerial scenes in Red Tails involved actors sitting in a gimbal-mounted cockpits (and mock-up fuselages and wings), in front of a green screen, rocked back and forth by production crew members.  In order to achieve a realistic reaction, actors were flown in actual P-51 Mustangs at the Planes of Fame in Chino, California, to experience the forces involved in dogfighting. Editing began while the production was in Prague. Avid editing systems were used simultaneously in a Prague studio and at Lucasfilm.  A vehicle was fitted with a \"technical center\" so that the production could quickly move between locations. Red Tails was the first film to use Barco's Auro-3D 11.1 surround sound system. In March 2010, Lucas took over direction of reshoots, as Hemingway was busy working on episodes of the HBO series, Treme. The Boondocks creator Aaron McGruder was brought in late in production, after Hemingway's principal photography, to provide re-writes for the Lucas-directed reshoots. In April 2009, Tuskegee Airman Lt. Col. Lee A. Archer, Jr. was appointed an advisor for Red Tails. He died in 2010 while the film was in post-production, and the final credits bear a tribute to him. Lucas covered the cost of production with his own money, and provided a further US$35 million for distribution. In an interview on The Daily Show on January 9, 2012, Lucas stated that the long delay in the production of the film was because major film studios balked at financing and marketing a film with an \"all-black\" cast and \"no major white roles.\" He went on to explain that studios receive \"60% of their profit\" from overseas, and the studios feel there is no market there for films with all-black casts. Red Tails is the last film Lucasfilm made independently before being acquired by The Walt Disney Company on October 30, 2012."

        "content": "Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator reports that 40% of 133 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 5.2/10.  The site's consensus reads: \"Despite a worthy fact-based story and obvious good intentions, Red Tails suffers from one-dimensional characters, corny dialogue, and heaps of clich\u00e9s.\" On Metacritic, the film also holds a score of 46 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. The main criticism was directed to the tone of the film; Stephen Holden in The New York Times review, noted, \"In structure and tone, Red Tails proudly harks back to the 1940s and '50s, when good guys were good, and bad guys bad.\" In rebuttal, co-writer Aaron McGruder commented on the film's tone: \"Some people are going to like this tonal choice and some people are going to say, 'Oh it should've been heavier and it should've been more dramatic.' But there's a version of this that doesn't have to be Saving Private Ryan. We can be Star Wars, as crazy as it is.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, stating, \"Red Tails (is) entertaining. Audiences are likely to enjoy it. The scenes of aerial combat are skillfully done and exciting.\" In a similar vein, aviation historian Budd Davison, in agreement with fellow historian Barrett Tillman, although cognizant of the \"Hollywood treatment\", had a caution to aviation enthusiasts looking for a faithful reenactment of the Tuskegee legend, \"... buy some popcorn, lean back and enjoy, this is Hollywood telling a story, not making a documentary. Save your guffaws until afterward with your friends.\" Ina Diane Archer, daughter of Lee Archer (Tuskegee airman and advisor for Red Tails), in writing for Film Comment, criticizes the film's disconnect between aerial scenes and the rest of the film, saying, \"One longs for more scenes between the ensemble on the ground, but the emphasis on aerial (and digital) technology leaves the characters without context. There's a particularly troubling absence of black women (but for a painting on Lightning's plane) who go unmentioned\u2014no gal back home? no sisters, no Mamas?\u2014nor do we ever see the African Americans who followed the squadron's adventures.\" In the face of media criticism of the portrayals of the Tuskegee Airmen in Red Tails, a number of activists took to social media to protest against what was thought to be a racially tinged effort to denigrate the contribution of the wartime fighting unit. Beginning with statements to support the film made by surviving Tuskegee Airmen who had seen the film in previews, and spurred by the comments made by Lucas in a candid interview on The Daily Show where the producer openly discussed the difficulties of trying to get Red Tails made over the past 23 years, a Facebook campaign was started. In the Oakland, California premiere, two sold-out screenings were a testament to the success of the campaign. Effie Tesfahun, one of the organizers, explained, \"When [Lucas] said Hollywood does not want to touch black films, it really hit me ... I thought we should get together and all go and support [this film]. Regardless of what Hollywood thinks, we all want to see positive messages of black people in the movies ... We need to speak, and speak loud, and speak with our dollars, because that's where people pay attention, when you start talking with your money,\" Tesfahun said. \"We are sending a message that this is what we want.\" Lucas commented on the film's reception: \"It had an effect on a lot of kids and adults. Now it's the one thing that everyone comes up to me and says 'thank you' for \u2013 I'm proud of that.\" \"We didn't get to a point when [the film studios] said, 'Oh let's just do black movies.' But every time you poke 'em, it makes an effect.\" Adolph Reed, professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania, said the film \"trivializes segregation in the military by reducing it to a matter of bad or outmoded attitudes. The ironic effect is significant understatement of both the obstacles the Tuskegee airmen faced and their actual accomplishments by rendering them as backdrop for a blackface, slapped-together remake of Top Gun\"."

        "content": "Red Tails portrays largely fictional events based on the exploits of the Tuskegee airmen, although many viewers were left with the impression that the film was entirely historically accurate. Through a series of three webinars, entitled: \"Tuskegee Airman Webinars \u2013 'Was the Movie Accurate'?\" sponsored by the Commemorative Air Force's Red Tail Squadron, surviving Tuskegee Airmen Colonel Charles McGee and Colonel Harold Brown provided perspectives related to the film's interpretation. Although discussions as to use of equipment and dates were mentioned, three claims made in the film were the most contentious: the number of losses suffered by bomber crews under escort, the encounters with Luftwaffe jet fighters and the overall record established by the Tuskegee Airmen. According to period records, it was long believed that the Tuskegee Airmen did not lose a single bomber due to enemy fire, a statement made by a bomber pilot in the film. However, this claim has been proven inaccurate, and an Air Force report from 2006 showed that at least 25 bombers were lost to enemy fire. As depicted in the climactic scene, the Luftwaffe Me 262 interception of a Tuskegee Airmen escort mission did not result in the first victory over the vaunted jet fighters, credited to another U.S. unit much earlier in the war. The film also states in the epilogue that the Tuskegee Airmen established one of the best fighter records in the U.S. Air Force. The film notes, correctly, that 96 Distinguished Flying Crosses were awarded to the unit and 66 Tuskegee Airmen were killed in action. Officially, however, the Tuskegee Airmen did not produce a single fighter pilot ace, although Lee Archer's record is still in dispute. At the end of webinars, host Brad Lang, the CAF Red Tail Squadron Leader, described the interaction as important to reconciling the historical record with the Red Tails film's essentially dramatic retelling of the Tuskegee Airmen saga. Both colonels also agreed that the discussions were important to resolving the controversy over the film. The movie has also been criticized for portraying the unit's commander as only having a desk job when the actual commander, Lt. Col. (later Gen.) Benjamin O. Davis Jr. flew many combat missions (because both black and white commanders needed such on-the-job training)."

It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons. Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's northern border. Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan base. Critics have praised the series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) has been subject to criticism. The final season received significant critical backlash for its reduced length and creative decisions, with many considering it a disappointing conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama. Many critics and publications have named the show as \"one of the best television series of all time\"."

In 2014, several actors' contracts were renegotiated to include a seventh-season option. By the final season, five of the main cast members made $1\u00a0million per episode, making them among the highest paid television performers. Eddard \"Ned\" Stark (Sean Bean) is the head of House Stark. He and his wife, Catelyn (Michelle Fairley), have five children: Robb (Richard Madden), Sansa (Sophie Turner), Arya (Maisie Williams), Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright), and Rickon (Art Parkinson). Ned also has an illegitimate son, Jon Snow (Kit Harington), who, along with his scholarly friend, Samwell Tarly (John Bradley), serve in the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont (James Cosmo). The Wildlings living north of the Wall include the young Gilly (Hannah Murray), and the warriors Tormund Giantsbane (Kristofer Hivju) and Ygritte (Rose Leslie). Others associated with House Stark include Ned's ward Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen), Ned's vassal Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton), and Roose's illegitimate son, Ramsay (Iwan Rheon). Robb accepts help from the healer Talisa Maegyr (Oona Chaplin), while elsewhere, Arya befriends the blacksmith's apprentice Gendry Rivers (Joe Dempsie) and the assassin Jaqen H'ghar (Tom Wlaschiha). The tall warrior, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie), eventually comes to serve the Starks. In King's Landing, the capital, Ned's old friend, King Robert I Baratheon (Mark Addy), shares a loveless political marriage with Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey). Her younger twin brother, Ser Jamie (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), serves on the Kingsguard. The third and youngest Lannister sibling is the dwarf Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), who is attended by his mistress Shae (Sibel Kekilli) and the sellsword Bronn (Jerome Flynn). Cersei's father is Tywin (Charles Dance), head of House Lannister and richest man in Westeros. Cersei has, among three children, two sons, Myrcella: Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Tommen (Dean-Charles Chapman). Joffrey is guarded by the scar-faced warrior Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane (Rory McCann). The king's Small Council of advisors includes, among others, the crafty Master of Coin, Lord Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish (Aidan Gillen), and the eunuch spymaster, Lord Varys (Conleth Hill). In Dragonstone, Robert's younger brother, Stannis (Stephen Dillane), is advised by the foreign priestess Melisandre (Carice van Houten) and former smuggler Ser Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham). In the Reach, the Tyrell family, led by its matriarch Olenna (Diana Rigg), is represented at court by Margery (Natalie Dormer), the matriarch's granddaughter. The High Sparrow (Jonathan Pryce) is eventually given power as a religious leader. In the southern principality of Dorne, the warrior Ellaria Sand (Indira Varma) seeks vengeance against the Lannisters. Across the Narrow Sea, in Pentos, siblings Viserys Targaryen (Harry Lloyd) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) (colloquially referred to as \"Dany\") are in exile, with the former plotting to reclaim his father's throne. Daenerys is forced into marrying Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), a leader of the nomadic Dothraki. Her retinue eventually comes to include the exiled knight Ser Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen), her aide Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel), the sellsword Daario Naharis (Michiel Huisman), and the elite soldier Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson)."

        "content": "The series has been praised by both television critics and historians for what was perceived as a sort of medieval realism. George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre. Martin has said that, \"the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves\". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on the overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world. Martin explores the relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change. The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other fantasies. In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an interview that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main characters could be injured or killed. In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series. In a 2012 study, out of 40 recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14. A scientific study conducted in 2018 stated that about 60% of the major characters died as a result violence and war."

        "content": "Although the series's first season closely follows the events of the first novel, there were significant changes made for later seasons. According to Benioff, the TV adaptation is \"about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way\". Aspects of the novels' plots and their adaptations are based upon settings, characters, and events in European history. Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe, from its geography and castles to its cultures, the feudal system, palace intrigues, and the knights' tournaments. Like medieval Europe, most of the houses in the series use the patriarchal system of power. The series also includes elements of gothic fiction, including torture tropes. A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses (1455\u20131485) between the houses of Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin's houses of Lannister and Stark. The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella, the \"She-Wolf of France\" (1295\u20131358). She and her family, as portrayed in Maurice Druon's historical novel series, The Accursed Kings, were a main inspiration of Martin's. Other historical antecedents of series elements include: Hadrian's Wall (which becomes Martin's Wall), the Roman Empire, and the legend of Atlantis (ancient Valyria), Byzantine Greek fire (\"wildfire\"), Icelandic sagas of the Viking Age (the Ironborn), the Mongol hordes (the Dothraki), the Hundred Years' War, and the Italian Renaissance. The series's popularity has been attributed, in part, to Martin's skill at fusing these elements into a seamless, credible version of alternate history."

        "content": "The A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels was popular before Game of Thrones. The series has sold more than 90 million copies worldwide with the novels being translated into 45 different languages. George R. R. Martin received multiple fantasy writing awards and nominations, including a World Fantasy Award and multiple Locus Awards, for the series. Writing for Time magazine in 2005 after the release of A Feast for Crows, journalist Lev Grossman called Martin the \"American Tolkien\", stating he is a \"major force for evolution in fantasy\". In January 2006, David Benioff had a telephone conversation with Martin's literary agent about the books he represented. Having been a fan of fantasy fiction when he was younger, he became interested in A Song of Ice and Fire, which he had not read. The literary agent sent Benioff the series's first four books. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first novel, A Game of Thrones, shared his enthusiasm with D. B. Weiss, and suggested that they adapt Martin's novels into a television series; Weiss finished the first novel in \"maybe 36 hours\". They pitched the series to HBO after a five-hour meeting with Martin (himself a veteran screenwriter) in a restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard. According to Benioff, they won Martin over by knowing the answer to his question, \"Who is Jon Snow's mother?\" Before being approached by Benioff and Weiss, Martin had had meetings with other scriptwriters, most of whom wanted to adapt the series as a feature film. Martin, however, deemed it \"unfilmable\", saying that the size of one of his novels is as long as The Lord of the Rings, which had been adapted as three feature films. Benioff agreed it would be impossible to turn the novels into a feature film as their scale is too big for a feature film, and dozens of characters would have to be discarded. Benioff added, \"a fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. That means no sex, no blood, no profanity. Fuck that.\" Martin was pleased with the suggestion that they adapt it as an HBO series, saying that he \"never imagined it anywhere else\". The series began development in January 2007. HBO acquired the television rights to the novels, with Benioff and Weiss as the series' executive producers and Martin as a co-executive producer. The intention was for each novel to yield a season's worth of episodes. Initially, Martin would write one episode per season while Benioff and Weiss would write the rest. Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were added later to write one episode each for the first season. The first and second drafts of the pilot script by Benioff and Weiss were submitted in August 2007 and June 2008, respectively. Although HBO liked both drafts, a pilot was not ordered until November 2008. The pilot episode, \"Winter Is Coming\", was shot in 2009; after its poor reception following a private viewing, HBO demanded an extensive re-shoot (about 90 percent of the episode, with cast and directorial changes). The pilot reportedly cost HBO $5\u201310million to produce, while the first season's budget was estimated at $50\u201360million. For the second season, the series received a 15-percent budget increase for the climactic battle in \"Blackwater\" (which had an $8million budget). Between 2012 and 2015, the average budget per episode increased from $6million to \"at least\" $8million. The sixth-season budget was over $10million per episode, for a season total of over $100million, a record for a series's production cost. By the final season, the production budget per episode was estimated to be $15million."

        "content": "Nina Gold and Robert Sterne were the series' primary casting directors. Through a process of auditions and readings, the main cast was assembled. The only exceptions were Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, whom the writers wanted from the start; they were announced as joining the pilot in 2009. Other actors signed for the pilot were Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon, Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen, and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon. According to Benioff and Weiss, Addy was the easiest actor to cast for the series because of his audition performance. Some characters in the pilot were recast for the first season. The role of Catelyn Stark was played initially by Jennifer Ehle, but the role was recast with Michelle Fairley. The character of Daenerys Targaryen was also recast, with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant. The rest of the first season's cast was selected in the second half of 2009. Although many of the cast returned after the first season, the producers had many new characters to cast in each of the following seasons. Because of the large number of new characters, Benioff and Weiss postponed introducing several key characters in the second season and merged several characters into one, or assigned plot functions to different characters. Some recurring characters were recast over the years; for example, Gregor Clegane was played by three different actors, while Dean-Charles Chapman played both Tommen Baratheon and a minor Lannister character."

        "content": "Game of Thrones used seven writers over its six seasons. Benioff and Weiss wrote most of each season's episodes. A Song of Ice and Fire author George R. R. Martin wrote one episode in each of the first four seasons. Martin did not write an episode for the later seasons, since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel (The Winds of Winter). Jane Espenson co-wrote one first-season episode as a freelance writer. Cogman, initially a script coordinator for the series, was promoted to producer for the fifth season. Cogman, who wrote at least one episode for the first five seasons, was the only other writer in the writers' room with Benioff and Weiss. Before Cogman's promotion, Vanessa Taylor\u2014a writer during the second and third seasons\u2014worked closely with Benioff and Weiss. Dave Hill joined the writing staff for the fifth season after working as an assistant to Benioff and Weiss. Although Martin was not in the writers' room, he read the script outlines and made comments. Benioff and Weiss sometimes assigned characters to particular writers; for example, Cogman was assigned to Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spent several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines were completed, they spent another two to three weeks discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline was created, with each of the writers working on part of it to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took a month and a half to complete both scripts. They were then read by Benioff and Weiss, who made notes, and parts of the script were rewritten. All ten episodes were written before filming began since they were shot out of order by two units in different countries. Benioff and Weiss wrote their episodes together; one wrote the first half of the script with the other writing the second half. They then passed the drafts back and forth to make notes and do rewrites."

Before season four, Martin stated there was an issue with the television series being released before the source material could be written. According to Benioff, Martin gave the showrunners an outline on the final two books of the series. In April 2016, the showrunners' plan was to shoot 13 more episodes after the sixth season: seven episodes in the seventh season and six episodes in the eighth. Later that month, the series was renewed for a seventh season with a seven-episode order. HBO announced in June 2016 that the eighth season would be the final for the series. The first two seasons adapted one novel each. For the later seasons, its creators saw Game of Thrones as an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire as a whole rather than the individual novels, enabling them to move events across novels as the screen adaptation required."

        "content": "Principal photography for the first season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010; the primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains (standing in for Vaes Dothrak); Castle Ward (Winterfell); Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood); Tollymore Forest (outdoor scenes); Cairncastle (the execution site); the Magheramorne quarry (Castle Black); and Shane's Castle (the tourney grounds). Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, was also used in the original pilot episode for scenes at Winterfell. The producers initially considered filming the entire series in Scotland, but decided on Northern Ireland because of the availability of studio space and tax credits. The first season's southern scenes were filmed in Malta, a change in location from the pilot episode's Moroccan sets. The city of Mdina was used for King's Landing. Filming also took place at Fort Manoel (representing the Sept of Baelor); at the Azure Window on the island of Gozo (the Dothraki wedding site); and at San Anton Palace, Fort Ricasoli, Fort St. Angelo and St. Dominic monastery (all used for scenes in the Red Keep). Filming of the second season's southern scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia, where the city of Dubrovnik and nearby locations allowed exterior shots of a walled, coastal medieval city. The Walls of Dubrovnik and Fort Lovrijenac were used for scenes in King's Landing, though exteriors of some local buildings in the series, for example, the Red Keep and the Sept of Baelor, are computer-generated. The island of Lokrum, the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of Trogir, the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, and the Dubac quarry (a few kilometers east) were used for scenes set in Qarth. Scenes set north of the Wall, in the Frostfangs, and at the Fist of the First Men, were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland on the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier near Smyrlabj\u00f6rg, the Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull glacier near Skaftafell, and the M\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull glacier near Vik on H\u00f6f\u00f0abrekkuhei\u00f0i. Filming also occurred at the harbor in Ballintoy, Northern Ireland. Third-season production returned to Dubrovnik, with the Walls of Dubrovnik, Fort Lovrijenac and nearby locations again used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. Trsteno Arboretum, a new location, is the garden of the Tyrells in King's Landing. The third season also returned to Morocco (including the city of Essaouira) to film Daenerys's scenes in Essos. Dimmuborgir and the Grj\u00f3tagj\u00e1 cave in Iceland were used as well. One scene, with a live bear, was filmed in Los Angeles. The production used three units (Dragon, Wolf and Raven) filming in parallel, six directing teams, 257 cast members and 703 crew members. The fourth season returned to Dubrovnik and included new locations, including Diocletian's Palace in Split, Klis Fortress north of Split, Perun quarry east of Split, the Mosor mountain range and Ba\u0161ka Voda farther south. Thingvellir National Park in Iceland was used for the fight between Brienne and the Hound. The fifth season added Seville, Spain, used for scenes of Dorne, and C\u00f3rdoba. The sixth season, which began filming in July 2015, returned to Spain and filmed in Navarra, Guadalajara, Seville, Almeria, Girona and Peniscola. Filming also returned to Dubrovnik, Croatia. The filming of the seven episodes of season seven began on August 31, 2016, at Titanic Studios in Belfast, with other filming in Iceland, Northern Ireland and many locations in Spain, including Seville, C\u00e1ceres, Almodovar del Rio, Santiponce, Zumaia and Bermeo. Filming continued until the end of February 2017, as necessary, to ensure winter weather in some European locations. Filming for season eight began in October 2017 and concluded in July 2018. New filming locations included Moneyglass and Saintfield in Northern Ireland for \"The Long Night\" battle scenes."

Tourism Ireland has a Game of Thrones-themed marketing campaign similar to New Zealand's Tolkien-related advertising. According to First Minister Arlene Foster, the series has given Northern Ireland the most publicity in its history apart from The Troubles. The production of Game of Thrones and other TV series boosted Northern Ireland's creative industries, contributing to an estimated 12.4 percent growth in arts, entertainment and recreation jobs between 2008 and 2013 (compared with 4.3percent in the rest of the UK during the same period).  After filming had finished, HBO converted its filming locations in Northern Ireland into tourist attractions to be opened in 2019. By 2019, 350,000 visitors, or one sixth of all tourists, came to Northern Ireland annually because of Game of Thrones. Tourism organizations elsewhere reported increases in bookings after their locations appeared in Game of Thrones. Between 2014 and 2016, Hotels.com reported hotel bookings increased by 285 percent in Iceland and 120 percent in Dubrovnik. In 2016, bookings doubled in Ouarzazate, Morocco, the location of Daenerys' season three scenes. Dubrovnik also saw an increase in overnight tourist stays after episodes aired. However, the increase in tourism driven by the series\u2014estimated to be responsible for half of its annual increase over many years\u2014led to concerns about \"over-tourism\" and its mayor imposing limits on tourist numbers in the city. Following the series finale, HBO announced in April 2019 a new exhibition and tourist attraction containing show props and set pieces. The attraction, titled Game of Thrones Studio Tour, will be located at former show filming location Linen Mill Studios outside Belfast.  Studies showed that the series had an overall positive economic impacts for both Northern Ireland and Dubrovnik. Despite the positive economic results, the impact from Game of Thrones\u2013related tourist activities could damage historical sites and other locations of cultural value."

Clapton returned to the series as its costume designer for the seventh season. For the first three seasons, Paul Engelen was Game of Thrones main makeup designer and prosthetic makeup artist with Melissa Lackersteen, Conor O'Sullivan, and Rob Trenton. At the beginning of the fourth season, Engelen's team was replaced by Jane Walker and her crew, composed of Ann McEwan and Barrie and Sarah Gower. Over 130 makeup artists and prosthetic designers worked on the show. The designs for the series's costumes were inspired by several sources, such as Japanese and Persian armor. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although the extras who played Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wore hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually did not so viewers could recognize them. Bj\u00f6rk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses were designed for easy removal. All the clothing used during the production was aged for two weeks, so it had a realistic appearance on high-definition television. About two dozen wigs were used by the actresses. Made of human hair and up to  in length, they cost up to $7,000 each and were washed and styled like real hair. Applying the wigs was time-consuming; Emilia Clarke, for example, required about two hours to style her brunette hair with a platinum-blonde wig and braids. Other actors, such as Jack Gleeson and Sophie Turner, received frequent hair coloring. For characters such as Daenerys (Clarke) and her Dothraki, their hair, wigs and costumes were processed to appear as if they had not been washed for weeks."

Most of the environment builds were done as 2.5D projections, giving viewers perspective while keeping the programming from being overwhelming. In 2011, the season one finale, \"Fire and Blood\", was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects. The visual effects crew consisted of both on-set VFX supervisors and concept artists along with visual effect editors in post-production. Because the effects became more complex in subsequent seasons (including CGI creatures, fire, and water), German-based Pixomondo became the lead visual effects producer; nine of its twelve facilities contributed to the project for season two, with Stuttgart the lead studio. Scenes were also produced by British-based Peanut FX, Canadian-based Spin VFX, and US-based Gradient Effects. \"Valar Morghulis\" and \"Valar Dohaeris\" earned Pixomondo Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in 2012 and 2013, respectively. HBO added German-based Mackevision to the project in season four. The season four finale, \"The Children\", won the 2014 Emmy Award for Visual Effects. Additional producers for season four included Canadian-based Rodeo FX, German-based Scanline VFX and US-based BAKED FX. The muscle and wing movements of the adolescent dragons in seasons four and five were based largely on those of a chicken. Pixomondo retained a team of 22 to 30 people focused solely on visualizing Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, with the average production time per season of 20 to 22 weeks. For the fifth season, HBO added Canadian-based Image Engine and US-based Crazy Horse Effects to its list of main visual-effects producers. Visual effect supervisor Joe Bauer said that the VFX team worked on more than \"10,000 shots of visual effects\" throughout all eight seasons. More than 300 artists worked on the show's visual effects team.

According to the file-sharing news website TorrentFreak, it was the most pirated television series from 2012 to 2019 (except 2018, when no new episodes were broadcast), and Guinness World Records named it the most-pirated television program in 2015. Illegal downloads increased to about seven million in the first quarter of 2015, up 45 percent from 2014. An unnamed episode was downloaded about 4.28\u00a0million times through public BitTorrent trackers in 2012, roughly equal to its number of broadcast viewers. Piracy rates were particularly high in Australia prompting the US Ambassador to Australia, Jeff Bleich, to issue a statement in 2013 condemning the practice there. Delays in availability by non-HBO broadcasters before 2015 and the cost of subscriptions to their services have been cited as causes for the series's illegal distribution. According to TorrentFreak, a subscription to a service broadcasting Game of Thrones cost up to $25 per month in the United States, up to \u00a326 per episode in the UK and up to $52 per episode in Australia. In 2013, to combat unauthorized downloads, HBO said it intended to make its content more widely available within a week of the US premiere (including HBO Go). In 2015, the fifth season was simulcast to 170 countries and to HBO Now users. On April 11, the day before the season premiere, screener copies of the first four episodes of the fifth season leaked to a number of file-sharing websites. Within a day of the leak, the files were downloaded over 800,000 times; in one week the illegal downloads reached 32million, with the season five premiere\u2014\"The Wars to Come\"\u2014 pirated 13million times. The season five finale (\"Mother's Mercy\") was the most simultaneously shared file in the history of the BitTorrent file sharing protocol, with over 250,000 sharers and over 1.5million downloads in eight hours. HBO did not send screeners to the press for the sixth season to prevent the spread of unlicensed copies and spoilers. Season seven was either illegally streamed or downloaded an average of 14.7billion times, with 120million illegal views for the season finale. According to anti-piracy company MUSO, the eighth season was illegally downloaded or viewed most in India and China. Illegal viewership for the final season was double the number of legal viewers, with 55\u00a0million illegal downloads for the season eight premiere \"Winterfell\", compared to 17.4million who watched on HBO platforms. Observers, including series director David Petrarca and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, said that illegal downloads did not hurt the series's prospects; it benefited from \"buzz\" and social commentary, and the high piracy rate did not significantly translate into lost subscriptions. According to Polygon, HBO's relaxed attitude towards piracy and the sharing of login credentials amounted to a premium-television \"free-to-play\" model. At a 2015 Oxford Union panel discussion, series co-creator David Benioff said that he was just glad that people watched the series; illegally downloaded episodes sometimes interested viewers enough to buy a copy, especially in countries where Game of Thrones was not televised. Series co-creator D. B. Weiss had mixed feelings, saying that the series was expensive to produce and \"if it doesn't make the money back, then it ceases to exist\". However, he was pleased that so many people \"enjoy the show so much they can't wait to get their hands on it.\""

The series has an overall rating of 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Some critics and publications have called the show among the best HBO series of all time. The series was highly anticipated by fans before its premiere. James Poniewozik said the pilot episode set \"a very large table\", while Ti Singh of Den of Geek said the show \"is here to stay\". First-season reviewers said the series had high production values, a fully realized world and compelling characters. According to Variety, \"There may be no show more profitable to its network than 'Game of Thrones' is to HBO. Fully produced by the pay cabler and already a global phenomenon after only one season, the fantasy skein was a gamble that has paid off handsomely.\" The second season was also well received. Entertainment Weekly praised its \"vivid, vital, and just plain fun\" storytelling and, according to The Hollywood Reporter, the series made a \"strong case for being one of TV's best series\"; its seriousness made it the only drama comparable to Mad Men or Breaking Bad. The critical response for season three was also positive. Matt Fowler of IGN said the series was \"still quite marvelous\" praising the character development. TV Guide named the season's penultimate episode \"The Rains of Castamere\" as number three on their 65 Best Episodes of the 21st Century. The critical acclaim continued into season four, with Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly calling the season \" the height of the show's icon-generating powers\". The Independent stated that the show deviated significantly from the novels however the \"changes benefited the show and condensed the substantial source text admirably well\". The critical response to season five was again positive, however, some commentators criticized the sexual assault in the \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" episode. Season six also received favorable reviews. Time criticized the repetitive story lines early in the season, however, its reviewer praised the \"Battle of the Bastards\" episode as \"one of the show's very best\". One reviewer also noted the \"more woman-friendly\" themes throughout the season, with another singling out Arya Stark story arc. The show's final two seasons, especially season eight, received more criticism. Season seven was praised for its action sequences and focused central characters, but received criticism for its pace and plot developments that \"defied logic\". Writing for Vox, Emily VanDerWerff cited the departure from the source material as a reason for the \"circular storytelling\". Critical reception for season eight was mixed. The Guardian noted the \"rushed business\" of the plot which \"failed to do justice to its characters or its actors\". Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Maureen Ryan condemned the season's reductive treatment of women, and \"decisions set up and executed with little or no foresight or thoughtfulness\", declaring the penultimate episode as \"Game of Thrones at its worst\". Fan reaction was mixed for the final season. A petition on Change.org started by some fans requested that the final season be remade with different writers. Casey Bloys, HBO's president of programming, said at a Television Critics Association event \"the petition shows a lot of enthusiasm and passion for the show but it wasn't something we seriously considered\". Despite the criticism of the writing, the music and visual effects were praised. The cast performances were praised throughout the show's run. Peter Dinklage's \"charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware\" portrayal of Tyrion, which earned him Emmy and Golden Globe awards, was acclaimed. \"In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage\", wrote Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times before Tyrion became the series's central figure in season two. Several critics highlighted performances by actresses and children. Lena Headey's portrayal of the \"riveting\" Cersei Lannister also received praise. Maisie Williams was singled out as well and her season two work with veteran actor Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister). Stephen Dillane received positive reviews for his performance as Stannis Baratheon, especially in the fifth season, with one critic noting \"Whether you like Stannis or not, you have to admit that Stephen Dillane delivered a monumental performance this season.\" The series was also praised for the portrayal of handicapped and disabled characters. One commentator stated that Tyrion Lannister is a \"departure from the archetypal dwarf\" often found in other fantasy stories like The Lord of the Rings. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a 'B' rating, saying that it was ultimately \"okay\". With both \"transcendent moments\" and \"miserable phases\", it was \"beloved enough to be criticized by everyone for something\". Franich described seasons three and four as \"relentless\", seasons six's ending having a \"killer one-two punch\", while seasons seven and eight were \"indifferent\". The New York Times gave the series a mixed review after the season three finale, criticizing the number of characters, their lack of complexity and a meandering plot. The show, however, appeared on many \"best of\" lists for the end of the 2010s. Alan Sepinwall, writing for Rolling Stone, placed the series on his \"50 Best TV Shows of the 2010s\" list, saying its \"ability to most of the time keep all of its disparate threads feeling vital and tied to one another, remains a staggering achievement\"."

        "content": "Despite its otherwise enthusiastic reception by critics, Game of Thrones has been criticized for the amount of female nudity, violence, and sexual violence it depicts, and for the manner in which it depicts these themes. George R. R. Martin responded that he felt obliged to be truthful about history and human nature, and that rape and sexual violence are common in war; and that omitting them from the narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels' themes, its historical realism. HBO said that they \"fully support the vision and artistry of Dan and David's exceptional work and we feel this work speaks for itself\". The show has reportedly been censored or banned for sexual or violent content in countries like China, India, Iran, Jordan, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam. The amount of sex and nudity in the series, especially in scenes incidental to the plot, was the focus of much of the criticism aimed at it in its first and second seasons. Stephen Dillane, who portrays Stannis Baratheon, likened the series's frequent explicit scenes to \"German porn from the 1970s\". The series's use of \"sexposition\", plot delivery accompanied by sex or nudity, was criticized as distracting.  Saturday Night Live parodied this aspect of the adaptation in a sketch that portrayed a 13-year-old boy as a Game of Thrones consultant, whose main concern was showing as many breasts as possible. The episode \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\" in the third season featured the lengthy torture and eventual emasculation of Theon Greyjoy, which prompted criticism. New York magazine called the scene \"torture porn\". According to one commentator, although the series' violence tended to serve a narrative purpose, Theon's torture in \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\" was excessive as well. One commentator noted that Greyjoy's emasculation was one of the only sexual assault scenes where a male was the victim. A scene in the fourth season's episode \"Breaker of Chains\", in which Jaime Lannister rapes his sister and lover Cersei, triggered a broad public discussion about the series' depiction of sexual violence against women. According to Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times, the scene caused outrage, in part because of comments by director Alex Graves that the scene became \"consensual by the end\". Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club wrote that the series's choice to portray this sexual act, and a similar one between Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo in the first season\u2014both described as consensual in the source novels\u2014as a rape appeared to be an act of \"exploitation for shock value\". In the fifth season's episode \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\", Sansa Stark is raped by Ramsay Bolton. Most reviewers and publications found the scene gratuitous and artistically unnecessary. In response to the scene, pop culture website The Mary Sue announced that it would cease coverage of the series because of the repeated use of rape as a plot device, and US Senator Claire McCaskill said that she would no longer watch it. The episode was the lowest rated on Rotten Tomatoes until the season eight episode \"The Bells\". As the later seasons saw Daenerys, Sansa, and Cersei assume ruling positions, Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post noted that the series could be seen as a \"long-arc revenge fantasy about what happens when women who have been brutalized and raped gain power\". Much of the criticism after the series finale was centered around the handling of the female character storylines. One commentator cited the male gaze as one of main sources of the \"romanticized female rape\" and general nudity throughout the series. Another commentator stated the use of both sex and violence helps perpetuate misogyny within the Game of Thrones universe."

In 2016, Bustles Caitlyn Callegari listed 31 examples of scenes where the lighting caused viewers problems ranging from not being able to tell a character's hair color to being unable to see what was going on. Some reviewers have noted this is part of a wider trend among shows that are made by people who have experience working primarily on films, suggesting they \"haven't grasped the nuances (or lack thereof)\" of television as a medium, especially the differences between watching a scene on a television screen versus watching it on the big screen in a movie theater. In a 2017 interview, Robert McLachlan, a cinematographer working on the show, explained the lack of lighting as an artistic choice saying \"we're trying to be as naturalistic as possible\". The criticism reached a high point during \"The Long Night\", the third episode of season eight. Barely minutes into the episode, viewers took to social media sites such as Twitter to express their discontent over the fact that they were having severe difficulties watching the battle and trying to figure out what was going on."

        "content": "Although Game of Thrones was initially dismissed by some critics, its success has been credited with an increase in the fantasy genre's popularity. The series's popularity led to increased sales of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels (republished in tie-in editions), which remained at the top of bestseller lists for months. On the eve of the second season's premiere, CNN said, \"after this weekend, you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of epic fantasy\" and cited Ian Bogost as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001\u20132003) and the Harry Potter films (2001\u20132011) establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are \"gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture\". The show's success led to the commissioning of several fantasy television series, including The Wheel of Time and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power by Amazon Studios. According to Neil Gaiman, whose novels Good Omens and American Gods were adapted for television, Game of Thrones helped to change attitudes towards fantasy on television, but mainly it made big budgets for fantasy series more acceptable. The success of the genre has been attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series. According to The Daily Beast, Game of Thrones was a favorite of sitcom writers and the series has been referred to in other television series. With other fantasy series, it has been cited as a reason for an increase in the purchase (and abandonment) of huskies and other wolf-like dogs. Game of Thrones has added to the popular vocabulary. A first-season scene in which Petyr Baelish explains his motives (or background) while prostitutes have sex in the background gave rise to the word \"sexposition\" for providing exposition with sex and nudity. Dothraki, the series's nomadic horsemen, was ranked fourth in a September 2012 Global Language Monitor list of words from television most used on the internet. The series and its characters have also been referenced by politicians and academics to commentate on modern-day geopolitics, economic inequality, and climate change. In 2019, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift told Entertainment Weekly that several songs on her 2017 album Reputation were inspired by Game of Thrones characters and plots. \"Khaleesi\" became more popular as a name for baby girls in the United States. In the novels and the TV series, \"khaleesi\" is not a name, but the title of the wife of a \"khal\" (warlord) in the Dothraki language, held by Daenerys Targaryen. Game of Thrones has also become a subject of both academic and scientific inquiry. In 2016, researchers published a paper analyzing emotional sentiment in online public discourse associated with the unfolding storyline during the fourth season. The Mathematical Association of America published a journal in 2016 that applied the multidisciplinary field of network science to create a social network for the show's characters and their relationships. The analysis purported to be able to distinguish discussions about an episode's storyline from media critiques or assessments of a specific actor's performance. In 2018, Australian scientists conducted a survival analysis and examined the mortality among 330 important characters during the first seven seasons of Game of Thrones. In 2019, the Australian Red Cross conducted a study using international humanitarian law to determine which of the Game of Thrones characters had committed the most war crimes during the first seven seasons of the show. Animals have also been named after the show. Three species of mud dragons; Echinoderes daenerysae, Echinoderes rhaegal and Echinoderes drogoni, a bee fly; Paramonovius nightking, three species of scarab beetles; Gymnetis drogoni, Gymnetis rhaegali and Gymnetis viserioni, and a brittle star, Ophiohamus georgemartini, due to its sharp thorns resembling those depicted on the Game of Thrones crown."

Fans include political leaders such as former US president Barack Obama, former British prime minister David Cameron, former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard and Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans, who framed European politics using quotes from Martin's novels in a 2013 speech. BBC News said in 2013 that \"the passion and the extreme devotion of fans\" had created a phenomenon, unlike anything related to other popular TV series, manifesting itself in fan fiction, Game of Thrones-themed burlesque routines and parents naming their children after series characters; writers quoted attributed this success to the rich detail, moral ambiguity, sexual explicitness and epic scale of the series and novels. The previous year, \"Arya\" was the fastest-rising girl's name in the US after it had jumped in popularity from 711th to 413th place. , about 58 percent of series viewers were male and 42 percent female, and the average male viewer was 41 years old. According to SBS Broadcasting Group marketing director Helen Kellie, Game of Thrones has a high fan-engagement rate; 5.5 percent of the series's 2.9million Facebook fans talked online about the series in 2012, compared to 1.8percent of the over ten million fans of True Blood (HBO's other fantasy series). Vulture.com cited Westeros.org and WinterIsComing.net (news and discussion forums), ToweroftheHand.com (which organizes communal readings of the novels) and Podcastoficeandfire.com as fan sites dedicated to the TV and novel series; and podcasts cover Game of Thrones."

The third season was seen by 14.2million viewers, making Game of Thrones the second-most-viewed HBO series (after The Sopranos). HBO said that Game of Thrones average gross audience of 18.4million viewers (later adjusted to 18.6million) had passed The Sopranos for the viewership record. The season five episode \"The House of Black and White\" was simulcasted in 173 countries, becoming the \"largest TV drama telecast\" according to Guinness World Records. By the sixth season the average per-episode gross viewing figure had increased to over 25million, with nearly 40 percent of viewers watching on HBO digital platforms. In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook likes found that Game of Thrones was \"much more popular in cities than in the countryside, probably the only show involving zombies that is\". By season seven, the average viewer numbers had grown to 32.8million per episode across all platforms. The series finale was viewed by 19.3million people across HBO platforms, becoming the network's most watched episode. The lead-out show also benefited from the finale's record viewership. Game of Thrones also set viewership records outside the United States on pay-television channels in the United Kingdom (with a 2016 average audience of more than five million on all platforms) and Australia (with a cumulative average audience of 1.2million). Video streaming research company Parrot Analytics stated that after the US, the season eight premiere demand was \"particularly strong in the United Kingdom and France\". Nielsen Media Research noted the show was popular among 18 to 49 key demographic with strong female viewership for a fantasy series. The show also benefited from time shifting viewership. Between season one and season seven, 7-day viewers, the number of both DVR and video on demand views during the week after the episode broadcast, grew from 3.3million to 13.7million. Following the show finale, commentators said many viewers might cancel their premium television and streaming subscriptions.

R. Martin, who also co-wrote two of the scripts. D. B. Weiss and David Benioff said that they would not be involved with any of the projects. Martin said that all the concepts under discussion were prequels, although he believes the term \"successor show\" applies better to these projects, as they are not Game of Thrones spin-offs in the traditional sense. He ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea and revealed that some may be set outside Westeros. In September 2018, speaking about the four projects (i.e. not about the Goldman's project), HBO president of programming Casey Bloys said that some of them had been abandoned completely, while others remained as possibilities for the future; Martin said that: \"at least two of them are solidly based on material in Fire and Blood\". In May 2019, Martin stated that two of the projects were still in the script stage, but were \"edging closer\". In April 2019, Cogman confirmed his prequel would not be moving forward. In January 2021, it was revealed that HBO were developing another prequel series to be based on Martin's novella series Tales of Dunk and Egg. Steve Conrad was attached as writer and executive producer of the Tales of Dunk and Egg series in November 2021. Additionally, an animated drama is in development at HBO Max. In March 2021, it was reported that three additional Game of Thrones spinoffs were in development at HBO, they include 10,000 Ships, a reference to the voyages made by warrior queen Princess Nymeria who later founded Dorne, 9 Voyages, about the voyages of Corlys Velaryon on the Sea Snake, and a project based on Flea Bottom, the poorest slum in King's Landing.

Notable events of that period include the foundation of powerful Houses, the Long Night when the White Walkers first descended upon Westeros, and the Andal Invasion when the Andals invaded from Essos and conquered most of Westeros.

NBC billed the show as \"equal parts sporting event, rock concert, and artistic exhibition\" and Lythgoe called it \"the most challenging and exhilarating project I've ever done.\"  By mid-December, the show was renamed Superstars of Dance and the debut was set for January 4, 2009. Michael Flatley was chosen to host, and Susie Castillo was given a co-hosting position. Superstars of Dance differs from similar TV dance competitions in a number of ways.  It features professionals instead of amateurs, including several world champions.  Additionally, the contestants were chosen by their respective countries, rather than by the show's producers.  Flatley has said Superstars is a lot like a sporting competition, even comparing it the Olympic Games. The winners are not decided by audience votes, but rather by a panel of eight judges.  The producers felt that it would be unfair to decide the winner by phone-in votes, assuming the American public would probably just vote for the American team.  Furthermore, unlike most reality-based competition shows, Superstars does not have a live component. The show was heavily promoted by NBC and widely anticipated, making several \"best bets\" programming guides.  The promotion paid off, as the show debuted with a 6.3 rating share representing an estimated 10.5 million viewers in a difficult time slot against ABC's mega-hit Desperate Housewives."

Tap dancer Sean Robinson, representing Australia, and ribbon dancer Bei Zheng, representing China, followed.  Robinson earned 57 points, while Zheng got just 51, causing protests from the crowd.  South African group Umojo then took the stage to perform a gumboot dance inspired by the country's history.  Wearing miners' costumes, the group accentuated their performance with trash can drums and chanting/singing.  They received 57 points for their efforts. A group from the Australian Dance Theatre dance company follows, performing a contemporary routine which mixes several styles.  They also received 57 points.  Next, Damien O'Kane performs a solo hardshoe routine with a contemporary spin.  The judges give mixed reviews and he ends up with 58 points, tying him for first thus far.  Next, it is Sduduzo Ka-mbili's turn.  Representing South Africa, he does a Zulu warrior dance called the \"Power of Juxta.\"  The routine features athletic kicks and jumps, and is awarded 55 points. American duo Georgia Amabarian and Eric Luna then performed a Cabaret number.  The routine featured several difficult lifts, but not as much foot work.  The judges' opinions are mixed,  ranging from several 7s to a 10 from Ireland, for 57 total points.  Next is a traditional tango, performed by Miriam Larici and Leonardo Barrionuevo of Argentina.  Their routine was loved by the audience and the judges award two 10s and 65 points overall.  Russian soloist Julia Bantner followed with a contemporary dance number that earned just 50 points. Amrapali Ambegaokar, representing India, did a traditional North Indian dance wearing traditional clothing, including bells on her feet.  The number ended with a long spin sequence causing an enthusiastic crowd response. The judges award her 62 points \u2014 the highest solo score of the night. Last, the Shaolin Monks performed their group effort.  They combined Kung Fu, acrobatics, weaponry, and music to create a unique dance experience.  The routine featured jumps, kicks, rolls, and mock fighting.  The number ended with one group member being suspended in mid-air on four sharp spears. The crowd went wild and the judges were impressed as well.  Judge Harold Van Buuren called it \"the performance of the evening\" and the monks receive 66 points, the highest score given to any act."

        "content": "The second episode of Superstars of Dance aired on January 5, 2009.  The show marked the end of the quarterfinals and with it the first eliminations.  At the end of the evening, eight soloists, two duos, and two groups were eliminated. The evening started with a high-energy group number from the Argentinian trio \"Los Huincas Gauchos.\"  Their routine mixed weaponry, drum playing, and hand clapping, but was relatively low on dance steps.  The Argentinian judge, Maria Pogee, remarked that the group \"didn't do everything they were supposed to.\"  The trio received 48 points, the lowest score of the competition to that point.  India's second soloist, Mythili Prakash, went next, performing a traditional South Indian routine.  Her performance earned 58 points.  Indian coach Nakul Dev Mahajan is baffled by the score, saying Prakash \"sets the standard\" for her style of dance\".  South African judge Harold Van Buuren replies that \"there is always room for improvement.\"  Next, Irish step-dancer Kelly Hendry performed a traditional dance with a bit of a contemporary twist.  The judges gave her 56 points. The Australia duo Henry Byalikov and Giselle Peacock went next, and scored 56 points for a Latin-inspired ballroom number.  Following them was another ballroom duo \u2014 Victor Da Silva and Claudia Savvides of South Africa \u2014 who choose to do a \"show piece\" rather than a typical ballroom routine.  Their lift heavy Rumba-esque dance scored 59 points.  Following the ballroom acts, Yang Yanan took the stage to perform with single and double whips.  The crowd is enthused by his use of the weaponry, but the judges feel the act lacks in actual dancing.  In the end, Yang received only 51 points, causing the audience to boo loudly. Next up was American tap dancer, Dormesia Sumbry-Edwards.  She did a classic routine to typewriter sounds that was originally from a Jerry Lewis movie.  The crowd liked it, but was again disappointed as the judging panel awarded just 55 points.  Following her, a group of Russians performed a traditional Cossack dance.  According to the judges, their act was acrobatic and full of energy, but lacked in technical precision.  They earned 51 points for their efforts. The show continued with the India group entry.  Their coach describes the act as a big celebration that makes the audience want to get up and join in but the judges are unimpressed.  The group does, however, score enough to advance to the next round: 54 points.  Next Mamela Nyamza, representing South Africa, performed a tribal piece about a woman frustrated with her marriage and life.  Her interpretive routine featured a lot of screaming and writhing around on the floor, stunning the studio audience \u2014 little applause is heard.  The judges, however, loved the number and award Nyamza with 58 points. Miriam Larici then returned for a solo performance (she had a duet the previous night) in which she attempted to create a one-person tango.  She brought in 57 points for Argentina, 8 less than she and partner Leonardo Barrionuevo received the night prior.  Ireland's duo was up next, with married couple Damien O'Kane and Bernadette Flynn attempting to bring a romantic twist to traditional Irish step-dancing.  For the most part, the judges liked what they saw and gave the couple 58 points. The final duo to perform was Zhen Zhu Zheng and An Nan of China.  The two are part of an acrobatic troupe and incorporate that training into their routine.  Among other moves, An does a full turn en pointe atop Zhen's shoulders.  The crowd cheered loudly, but the judges gave mixed reviews.  A few judges gave high marks for the incredible difficulty of the routine, but most said it was not actually a dance routine.  The duo ends up with 53 points. Russian ballerina Maria Kochetkova came next with what the judges call a beautiful and technically precise number.  The performance ended with a long spin sequence and received 9's across the board, for a total of 63 points, making it the highest scoring solo of the competition to date.  Reed Luplau followed with the final solo of the quarterfinals.  His routine featured several high leaps across the stage and garnered a strong audience reaction.  The judges awarded 65 points, highest among all soloists.  At this point the eight highest soloists are to be advanced into the semi-finals.  Lauplau and Kochetkova advances, as well as dancers from Argentina, South Africa, Ireland, and both soloists from India.  However, there was a three-way tie for the eighth spot.  A tie breaking vote was called for and Robert Muraine received 4 of the 5 tie-break votes to advance. The final act of the quarterfinals is the United States' group entry, The Groovaloos.  The group consists of one girl and nine guys, including one member, Steven, who was recently hit by a stray bullet and told he would never walk again.  Their street dance number began with Steven being rolled out on a stretcher.  The other nine start running, leaping, and dancing about the stage and pretty soon Steven gets up and joins in the action.  The studio audience cheered loudly and the judges award 67 points, including four 10s.  It is the highest score given to any act in the competition to date."

        "content": "The third episode of Superstars of Dance aired on January 12, 2009.  Three groups, three duos, and four soloists took the stage to compete in the first half of the semi-finals.  Scores from the first round don't carry over, except for the master score board, so everyone started with a clean slate. Leading off the show is the group entry from Australia.  They bring a high-energy athletic number filled with countless spins, jumps, and rolls.  The crowd enjoys it, as do the judges, awarding 62 points including a 10 from Russia.  It's a marked improvement over the group's first round score of 57.   Next up is the Irish duo Damien O'Kane & Bernadette Flynn.  They choose a sassier number which involves more movement from O'Kane than the duo's earlier performance.  The judges' opinions are split with some enjoying it and others saying it \"lacked fire,\" and the duo has to settle for 58 points. The first soloist of the evening, Maria Kochetkova, is the next to take the stage.  The Russian ballerina turns in a classic ballet number with clean, crisp lines, and countless pirouettes.  Asked how she can do so much spinning without getting dizzy, she simply replies \"practice makes perfect.\"  The judges again love her performance and award 63 points \u2014 identical to her first round number.  Next up is American popper Robert Muraine, the last soloist to make it into the semi-finals.  His intro claims he never choreographs his numbers because he feels popping is a freestyle art.  Muraine's semi-final performance involves noticeably more variation and movement then his previous set.  The studio audience again enjoys his performance and this time the judges agree, awarding him with 61 points. The South African group entry, Umojo, is the next act to return.  They hit the floor with a powerful dance based on Zulu tribal war dances.  Several members play drums, while others chant and sing.  After the number concludes, a member is asked to explain the significance of the dance.  He then demonstrates some traditional hunting and pre-war dance moves that they've incorporated into their performance.  The judging panel awards 58 points.  Next up are Miriam Larici and Leonardo Barrionuevo of Argentina.  They turn in a scorching hot tango, that brings praise and high scores from six of the seven judges.  South African judge Harold Van Buuren is the lone dissenter, saying that Barrionuevo is not at the same level as Larici.  The couple is questioned about the remark, and Barrionuevo essentially agrees with the critique saying he appreciates the advice.  The couple ends up with 63 points. Amrapali Ambegaokar is the first of India's two soloists to return to the stage.  Her spins, bells, and smile again light up the stage as she performs another traditional North Indian piece.  The judges give her 59 points for her efforts.  Following her is the final soloist of the evening \u2014 Reed Luplau of Australia.  He opts for a more powerful, rock-and-roll flavored number this time around.  When he is done flipping and spinning about the stage, Ambegaokar is called back out - with four soloists performing this evening and only three spots available in the finals, one of them will have to go home.  Amegaokar has the lowest score thus far, so it'll be either her or Luplau who departs.  The judges are unimpressed by Luplau's performance and he ends up 1 point short of Amegaokar, with 58 points.  Everyone is shocked to see the first round standout going home so soon and Luplau is not quite sure what to say in his final interview. As the shock starts to wear off, it's time for the final duet of the evening.  The honor belongs to Victor Da Silva and Claudia Savvides of South Africa.  The couple decides to put it all on the line, bringing a brand new trick-laden piece to the floor.  Savvides barely touches the floor, as Da Silva is constantly lifting her high in the air, often with only one arm.  The number ends with Da Salva spinning his partner around several times above his head, much like a helicopter, then throwing her above his head;  she lands completely wrapped around his body and slides down his body to the floor, holding the same position the whole way down.  The judges appreciate the difficulty demonstrated but feel the tricks took away from the natural flow of the dance.  The couple has to settle for 59 points and second place among duos thus far. The night concludes with the return of the Groovaloos.  Their introduction shows the American group getting a ballet lesson from the Russian coach.  \"About the only similarity [between the styles],\" a group member quips, \"is that both take years to get good at.\"  The theme of tonight's performance is going to work.  First they ride the subway, then the elevator; they clock in and begin work.  The routine features several innovative movements including the girl of the group standing in for a robot that is being fine-tuned by the workers.  Soon it's \"break time\" and the action really starts to pick up.  Group members fly about the stage, rolling and jumping over each other at a break-neck pace. The group goes through several dance steps before the performance concludes with one member doing six consecutive back-flips in place.  The Groovaloos receive a standing ovation and 66 points from the judging panel. During the Groovaloos post-performance interview, co-host Susie Susie Castillo brings up the idea of a skills battle between the Groovaloos and the Shaolin Monks.  The American team is very enthusiastic about the idea and a showdown with the Shaolin Monks is set for next week's show."

The film's cast includes the former professional footballer Eric Cantona and Steve Evets, former bass guitarist with The Fall. Loach said of the film, \"We wanted to deflate the idea of celebrities as more than human. And we wanted to make a film that was enjoying the idea of what you and I would call solidarity, but what others would call support for your friends really, and the old idea that we are stronger as a team than we are as individuals.\""

Looking after his granddaughter is bringing him into contact with his ex-wife, Lily, whom he abandoned after the birth of their daughter. At the same time, his stepson Ryan is hiding a gun under the floorboards of his bedroom for a violent drugs baron. At his lowest moments, Bishop considers suicide. But after a short meditation session with fellow postmen in his living room, and smoking cannabis stolen from his stepson, hallucinations bring forth his footballing hero, the famously philosophical Eric Cantona, who gives him advice. His relationship with Lily improves dramatically. Bishop finds the gun and confronts his stepson. Ryan admits to his involvement with the drugs gang, and Bishop attempts to return the gun to the gangster. He is forced to keep it himself, however, when a Rottweiler is set on him in his car. The gangster then posts footage on YouTube of Bishop's humiliation. The entire family is then arrested by the police on a tip-off but they fail to find the gun as it is hidden in the fridge, under a chicken. Eric Cantona then advises Bishop to seek help from his friends and to 'surprise' himself. Bishop organises 'Operation Cantona', sneaking dozens of fellow Manchester United fans \u2013 wearing Cantona masks (including Cantona himself) \u2013 into the gangster's house and humiliating him and his family, threatening to put the video of their operation onto YouTube, in turn.

It is the second animated series produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment in association with Warner Bros. Animation, after Tiny Toon Adventures. It initially ran a total of 99 episodes, along with a feature-length film, Animaniacs: Wakko's Wish. Reruns later aired on Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, and Discovery Family, which was at the time The Hub Network. Animaniacs is a variety show, with short skits featuring a large cast of characters. While the show had no set format, the majority of episodes were composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring a different set of characters, and bridging segments. Hallmarks of the series included its music, satirical social commentary, pop culture references, character catchphrases, and innuendo directed at an adult audience. A revival of the series was announced in January 2018, with at least two seasons and a third now announced to be produced in conjunction with Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, with producer Steven Spielberg, songwriter Randy Rogel, and many of the main voice actors returning. It premiered on November 20, 2020, on Hulu, with a second season premiering on November 5, 2021."

        "content": "Prior to Animaniacs, Warner Bros. had been working to get Steven Spielberg to make an animated film for the studio. To help court Spielberg's favor, the head of Warner Bros. Animation Jean MacCurdy brought director Tom Ruegger, who had successfully led A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, to help develop the concept with Spielberg. Ruegger pitched the idea to Spielberg of using younger versions of the Looney Tunes characters while capturing the same wackiness of those cartoons, eventually leading into Tiny Toon Adventures. Tiny Toon Adventures was considered a success, winning a number of Daytime Emmy awards and a Primetime Emmy award and revived the Warner Bros. Animation department. With Tiny Toon Adventures success, Spielberg and MacCurdy pushed on Ruegger for the next idea for a series, with Spielberg emphasizing the need for something with a marquee name. Ruegger had already envisioned pulling three characters that he had created for his student film The Premiere of Platypus Duck while attending Dartmouth College, a trio of platypuses for this new series, and made a connection to Warner Bros. after walking around the studio lot and seeing its signature water tower. He came up with making this trio the Warner Brothers and their sister Dot (the latter representing the period in the \"Warner Bros.\" name), tying the characters directly to the studio with their approval. Along with reviving the character designs, Ruegger drew characterization for the Warner siblings from his three sons who could be troublemakers at the time. Because the Warners were portrayed as cartoon stars from the early 1930s, Ruegger and other artists for Animaniacs made the images of the Warners similar to cartoon characters of the early 1930s. Simple, black and white drawings of minstrels were very common in cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s, such as Buddy, Felix the Cat, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and the early versions of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse."

        "title": "Animaniacs_Writing",
        "content": "Steven Spielberg served as executive producer, under his Amblin Entertainment label. Showrunner and senior producer Tom Ruegger lead the overall production and writer's room. Ruegger initially brought in Sherri Stoner, who had also contributed to Tiny Toons Adventures, to help expand the series' concept. Producers Peter Hastings, Sherri Stoner, Rusty Mills, and Rich Arons contributed scripts for many of the episodes and had an active role during group discussions in the writer's room as well. Stoner helped to recruit most of the remaining writing staff, which included Liz Holzman, Paul Rugg, Deanna Oliver, John McCann, Nicholas Hollander, Charlie Howell, Gordon Bressack, Jeff Kwitny, Earl Kress, Tom Minton, and Randy Rogel. Hastings, Rugg, Stoner, McCann, Howell, and Bressack were involved in writing sketch comedy while others, including Kress, Minton, and Rogel, came from cartoon backgrounds. The writers and animators of Animaniacs used the experience gained from the previous series to create new characters cast in the mold of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery's creations, following on the back-and-forth of many of the pairings from their classic shorts. The Marx Brothers, particularly with their breaking of the fourth wall, also played heavily into the comic styling they wanted for the show. While the Warner siblings served as the central point of the show, the writing staff worked out developing other pairings or trios so as to make the cartoon more like a variety show with sketch comedy. Executive producer Steven Spielberg said that the irreverence in Looney Tunes cartoons inspired the Animaniacs cast. Just as Ruegger wrote the Warner siblings based on his own sons, other pairings or trios were based on similar personal relations the writing staff had. Ruegger created Pinky and the Brain after being inspired by the personalities of two of his Tiny Toon Adventures colleagues, Eddie Fitzgerald and Tom Minton, who worked in the same office. Ruegger thought of the premise for Pinky and the Brain when wondering what would happen if Minton and Fitzgerald tried to take over the world, and cemented the idea after he modified a caricature of the pair drawn by animator Bruce Timm by adding mice ears and noses. Deanna Oliver contributed The Goodfeathers scripts and the character Chicken Boo, while Nicholas Hollander based Katie Ka-Boom on his teenage daughter. Stoner created Slappy the Squirrel when another writer and friend of Stoner, John McCann, made fun of Stoner's career in TV movies playing troubled teenagers. When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teenagers when she was 50 years old, the latter developed the idea of Slappy's characteristics as an older person acting like a teenager. Stoner liked the idea of an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and \"have the dirt on [them]\". Several additional sets of characters were also created and vetted by Spielberg for inclusion in the show. Among those that were kept included Buttons and Mindy, due to Spielberg's daughter. Made-up stories did not exclusively comprise Animaniacs writing, as Hastings remarked: \"We weren't really there to tell compelling stories\u00a0... [As a writer] you could do a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, or you could parody a commercial ... you could do all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up.\" Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes \"Ups and Downs,\" \"Survey Ladies,\" and \"I Got Yer Can\" were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively. Another episode, \"Bumbie's Mom,\" both parodied the film Bambi and was based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film. In an interview, the writers explained how Animaniacs allowed for non-restrictive and open writing. Hastings said that the format of the series had the atmosphere of a sketch comedy show because Animaniacs segments could widely vary in both time and subject, while Stoner described how the Animaniacs writing staff worked well as a team in that writers could consult other writers on how to write or finish a story, as was the case in the episode \"The Three Muska-Warners\". Rugg, Hastings and Stoner also mentioned how the Animaniacs writing was free in that the writers were allowed to write about parody subjects that would not be touched on other series. Animaniacs was developed following the passage of the Children's Television Act in 1990 that required that programming aimed at children to include educational content. The writers worked this into the show in part by featuring segments involving the characters interacting with historical figures, and creating songs like \"Yakko's World\", which listed out all the countries of the world at the time, to serve as educational content."

        "content": "Animaniacs featured Rob Paulsen as Yakko, Pinky, and Dr. Otto von Scratchansniff, Tress MacNeille as Dot, Jess Harnell as Wakko, show writer Sherri Stoner as Slappy Squirrel, Maurice LaMarche as the Brain, Squit and the belching segments \"The Great Wakkorotti\" (Harnell said that he himself is commonly mistaken for the role), and veteran voice actor Frank Welker as Ralph the Security Guard, Thaddeus Plotz and Runt. Andrea Romano said that the casters wanted Paulsen to play the role of Yakko: \"We had worked with Rob Paulsen before on a couple of other series and we wanted him to play Yakko.\" Romano said that the casters had \"no trouble\" choosing the role of Dot, referring to MacNeille as \"just hilarious\u00a0...And yet [she had] that edge.\" MacNeille had already been part of Tiny Toons Adventures as Babs Bunny, a role \"custom made\" for her, and Spielberg encouraged her to audition for the role of Dot in Animaniacs. Before Animaniacs, Harnell had little experience in voice acting other than minor roles for Disney which he \"fell into\". Harnell revealed that at the audition for the show, he did a John Lennon impression and the audition \"went great\". For Pinky and the Brain, LaMarche had been a long-time aficionado of Orson Welles, including the infamous Frozen Peas outtake, and when he auditioned for various characters in the show, immediately saw the Brain as having a Welles-like character, adapting his voice for the role. Paulsen took inspiration from British comedy such as Monty Python's Flying Circus for Pinky's voice. Stoner commented that when she gave an impression of what the voice would be to Spielberg, he said she should play Slappy herself. According to Romano, she personally chose Bernadette Peters to play Rita. Other voices were provided by Jim Cummings, Paul Rugg, Vernee Watson-Johnson, Jeff Bennett and Gail Matthius. Tom Ruegger's three sons also played roles in the series. Nathan Ruegger voiced Skippy Squirrel, the nephew of Slappy, throughout the duration of the series; Luke Ruegger voiced The Flame in historical segments on Animaniacs; and Cody Ruegger voiced Birdie from Wild Blue Yonder."

Animaniacs was made with a higher production value than standard television animation; the series had a higher cel count than most TV cartoons. The Animaniacs characters often move fluidly, and do not regularly stand still and speak, as in other television cartoons."

The idea for an original musical score in every episode came from Steven Spielberg. Animaniacs used a 35-piece orchestra, and seven composers were contracted to write original underscore for the series' run: Richard Stone, Steve Bernstein, Julie Bernstein, Carl Johnson, J. Eric Schmidt, Gordon Goodwin, and Tim Kelly. The use of the large orchestra in modern Warner Bros. animation began with Animaniacs predecessor, Tiny Toon Adventures, but Spielberg pushed for its use even more in Animaniacs. Although the outcome was a very expensive show to produce, \"the sound sets us apart from everyone else in animation,\" said Jean MacCurdy, the executive in charge of production for the series. According to Steve and Julie Bernstein, not only was the Animaniacs music written in the same style as that of Looney Tunes composer Carl Stalling, it was recorded at the Eastwood Scoring Stage, which was used by Stalling as well as its piano. Senior producer Tom Ruegger said that writers Randy Rogel, Nicholas Hollander, and Deanna Oliver wrote \"a lot of music\" for the series."

Spielberg also said that Animaniacs''' humor of social commentary and irreverence were inspired by the Marx Brothers and Looney Tunes cartoons. Animaniacs, among other Spielberg-produced series, had a large amount of cartoon violence. Spielberg defended the violence in Animaniacs by saying that the series had a balance of both violent humor and educational segments, so the series would never become either too violent or \"benign\".

        "content": "Characters on Animaniacs had catchphrases, with some characters having more than one. Notable catchphrases include Yakko's \"Goodnight, everybody!\" often said following adult humor, Wakko's \"Faboo!\" and Dot's frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all three Warners was \"Hello-o-o, nurse!\" Tom Ruegger said that the \"Hello-o-o, nurse!\" line was intended to be a catchphrase much like Bugs Bunny's line, \"Eh, what's up, Doc?\" Before the theme song for each \"Pinky and the Brain\" segment, Pinky asks, \"Gee, Brain, what do you want to do tonight?\", to which Brain replies, \"The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!\" During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, \"Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?\" and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur that changes with every episode. Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode \"Win Big\", and then producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes. Running gags and recurring segments were very common in the series. The closing credits for each episode always included one joke credit and ended with a water tower gag similar to The Simpsons couch gag. Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag and another segment titled \"The Wheel of Morality\" (which, in Yakko's words, \"adds boring educational value to what would otherwise be an almost entirely entertaining program\", and ends with a \"moral\" that makes absolutely no sense) eased the production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once (and, in the case of the Wheel segments, enabled the producers to add a segment in where there was not room for anything else in the episode)."

        "content": "A great deal of Animaniacs'  humor and content was aimed at an adult audience, revolving around hidden sexual innuendo and throwback pop culture references.  Animaniacs parodied the film A Hard Day's Night and the Three Tenors, references that The New York Times wrote were \"appealing to older audiences\". The comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan Pirates of Penzance and H.M.S. Pinafore were parodied in episode 3, \"HMS Yakko\". The Warners' personalities were made similar to those of the Marx Brothers and Jerry Lewis, in that they, according to writer Peter Hastings, \"wreak havoc\" in \"serious situations\". In addition, the show's recurring \"Goodfeathers\" segment was populated with characters based on characters from The Godfather and Goodfellas, R-rated crime dramas neither marketed nor intended for children. Some content of Animaniacs was not only aimed at an adult audience, it was suggestive in nature; one character, Minerva Mink, had episodes that network censors considered too sexually suggestive for the show's intended audience, for which she was soon de-emphasized as a featured character. Jokes involving such innuendo would often end with Yakko telling \"Goodnight, everybody!\" as a punchline. Parodies Animaniacs parodied popular TV shows and movies and caricatured celebrities. Animaniacs made fun of celebrities, major motion pictures, television series for adults (Seinfeld, Beverly Hills 90210 and Friends, among others), television series for children (such as Barney & Friends and Rugrats), and trends in the U.S. One episode even made fun of competing show Power Rangers, and another episode caricatured Animaniacs' own Internet fans. Animaniacs also made potshots of Disney films, creating parodies of such films as The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, Bambi, and others. Animaniacs director Russell Calabrese said that not only did it become a compliment to be parodied on Animaniacs, being parodied on the series would be taken as a \"badge of honor\". Songs Animaniacs had a variety of music types. Many Animaniacs songs were parodies of classical or folk music with educational lyrics. Notable ones include \"Yakko's World\" in which Yakko sings the names of all 200-some nations of the world at the time to the tune of the \"Mexican Hat Dance\". \"Wakko's America\" listed all the United States and their capitals to the tune of \"Turkey in the Straw\". Another song, titled \"The Presidents\", named every U.S. president at the time to the tune of the \"William Tell Overture\" (with brief snippets of the tunes \"Mademoiselle from Armentieres\" and \"Dixie\"). Non-educational song parodies were also used, such as \"Slippin' on the Ice,\" a parody of \"Singin' in the Rain\". Most of the groups of characters had their own theme songs for their segments on the show. The Animaniacs theme song, performed by the Warners, was a very important part of the series. In the series' first season, the theme won an Emmy Award for best song. Ruegger wrote the lyrics, and Stone composed the music for the title sequence. Several Animaniacs albums and sing-along VHS tapes were released, including the CDs Animaniacs, Yakko's World, and Animaniacs Variety Pack, and the tapes Animaniacs Sing-Along: Yakko's World and Animaniacs Sing-Along: Mostly in Toon. Shorts featuring Rita and Runt would also incorporate songs for Bernadette Peters to sing. Reception Animaniacs was a successful show, gathering both child and adult fans. The series received ratings higher than its competitors and won eight Daytime Emmy Awards."

Animaniacs, along with other animated series, helped to bring \"Fox Kids\" ratings much larger than those of the channel's competitors. In November 1993, Animaniacs and Tiny Toon Adventures almost doubled the ratings of rivals Darkwing Duck and Goof Troop among ages 2\u201311 and 6\u201311, which are both very important demographics to children's networks. On Kids' WB, Animaniacs gathered about 1 million child viewers every week. While Animaniacs was popular among younger viewers (the target demographic for Warner Bros.' TV cartoons), adults also responded positively to the show; in 1995, more than one-fifth of the weekday (4 p.m., Monday through Friday) and Saturday morning (8 a.m.) audience viewers were 25 years or older. The large adult fanbase even led to one of the first Internet-based fandom cultures. During the show's prime, the Internet newsgroup alt.tv.animaniacs was an active gathering place for fans of the show (most of whom were adults) to post reference guides, fan fiction, and fan-made artwork about Animaniacs. The online popularity of the show did not go unnoticed by the show's producers, and twenty of the most active participants on the newsgroup were invited to the Warner Bros. Animation studios for a gathering in August 1995. Nominations and awards Animaniacs' first major award came in 1993, when the series won a Peabody Award in its debuting season. In 1994, Animaniacs was nominated for two Annie Awards, one for \"Best Animated Television Program\", and the other for \"Best Achievement for Voice Acting\" (Frank Welker). Animaniacs also won two Daytime Emmy Awards for \"Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition\" and \"Outstanding Original Song\" (Animaniacs Main Title Theme). In 1995, Animaniacs was nominated four times for the Annie Awards, once for \"Best Animated Television Program\", twice for \"Voice Acting in the Field of Animation\" (Tress MacNeille and Rob Paulsen), and once for \"Best Individual Achievement for Music in the Field of Animation\" (Richard Stone). That same year, Animaniacs was nominated for Favorite Cartoon for the 1995 Kids' Choice Awards. In 1996, Animaniacs won two Daytime Emmy Awards, one for \"Outstanding Animated Children's Program\" and the other for \"Outstanding Achievement in Animation\". In 1997, Animaniacs was nominated for an Annie Award for \"Best Individual Achievement: Directing in a TV Production\" (Charles Visser for the episode \"Noel\"). Animaniacs also won two more Daytime Emmy Awards, one for \"Outstanding Animated Children's Program\" and the other for \"Outstanding Music Direction and Composition\". In 1998, the last year in which new episodes of Animaniacs were produced, Animaniacs was nominated for an Annie Award in \"Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Daytime Television Program\". Animaniacs also won a Daytime Emmy Award in \"Outstanding Music Direction and Composition\" (for the episode \"The Brain's Apprentice\"). In 1999, Animaniacs won a Daytime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition\". When Animaniacs won this award, it set a record for most Daytime Emmy Awards in the field of \"Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition\" for any individual animation studio. In 2009, IGN named Animaniacs the 17th-best animated television series. On September 24, 2013, Animaniacs was listed among TV Guide's \"60 Greatest TV Cartoons of All Time\"."

Animaniacs aired with a 65-episode first season because these episodes were ordered by Fox all at once. While on Fox Kids, Animaniacs gained fame for its name and became the second-most popular show among children ages 2\u201311 and children ages 6\u201311, second only to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (which began that same year). On March 30, 1994, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot first theatrically appeared in the animated short, \"I'm Mad\", which opened nationwide alongside the full-length animated feature, Thumbelina. The musical short featured Yakko, Wakko, and Dot bickering during a car trip. Producers Steven Spielberg, Tom Ruegger, and Jean MacCurdy wanted \"I'm Mad\" to be the first of a series of shorts to bring Animaniacs to a wider audience. However, \"I'm Mad\" was the only Animaniacs theatrical short produced. The short was later incorporated into Animaniacs episode 69. Following the 65th episode of the series, Animaniacs continued to air in reruns on Fox Kids. The only new episodes during this time included a short, four-episode second season that was quickly put together from unused scripts. After Fox Kids aired Animaniacs reruns for a year, the series switched to the new Warner Bros. children's programming block, Kids' WB."

        "content": "The series was popular enough for Warner Bros. Animation to invest in additional episodes of Animaniacs past the traditional 65-episode marker for syndication. Animaniacs premiered on the new Kids' WB line-up on September 9, 1995, with a new season of 13 episodes. At this time, the show's popular cartoon characters, Pinky and the Brain, were spun off from Animaniacs into their own half-hour TV series. Warner Bros. stated in a press release that Animaniacs gathered over 1 million children viewers every week. Despite the series' success on Fox Kids, Animaniacs on Kids' WB was successful only in an unintended way, bringing in adult viewers and viewers outside the Kids' WB target demographic of young children. This unintended result of adult viewers and not enough young viewers put pressure on the WB network from advertisers and caused dissatisfaction from the WB network towards Animaniacs. Slowly, orders from the WB for more Animaniacs episodes dwindled and Animaniacs had a couple more short seasons, relying on leftover scripts and storyboards. The fourth season had eight episodes, which was reduced from 18 because of Warner Bros.' dissatisfaction with the series. The 99th and final Animaniacs episode aired on November 14, 1998.The Chicago Tribune reported in 1999 that the production of new Animaniacs episodes ceased and the direct-to-video feature film Animaniacs: Wakko's Wish was a closer to the series. Animation World Network reported that Warner Bros. laid off over 100 artists, contributing to the reduced production of the original series. Producer Tom Ruegger explained that rather than produce new episodes, Warner Bros. instead decided to use the back-catalog of Animaniacs episodes until \"someone clamors for more.\" Animaniacs segments were shown along with segments from other cartoons as part of The Cat&Birdy Warneroonie PinkyBrainy Big Cartoonie Show. Ruegger said at the time the hiatus was \"temporary\". Following the end of the series, the Animaniacs team developed Animaniacs: Wakko's Wish, which was released on December 21, 1999. In 2016, Ruegger said on his Reddit AMA that the decline of Animaniacs and other series was the result of Warner Bros.' investment in the much cheaper anime series Pok\u00e9mon. After Warner Bros. gained distribution rights to the cheaper and successful anime, the network chose to invest less in original programming like Animaniacs."

Later, Warner Bros. cut back the size of its animation studio because the show Histeria! went over its budget, and most production on further Warner Bros. animated comedy series ended.

He takes a liking towards Balthazar and treats him with the littlest of respect. He is often seen with an oversize golf club. His several vices include bribery, inflicting physical harm, \"dog golf\", exploiting cheap labor and beating and cheating on his wives. Balthazor sees Killbride as more evil than Satan. He also has a physical attraction to Tina. Overall he is a businessman, and promotes Balthazor when he does his job well. He is a polygamist as he said he has six wives, and only two were shown. Marjoe Saint Sparks (voiced by Dina Waters) \u2013 The crazy, talkative, annoying and stereotypical Southern Belle next-door neighbor. She engages in bestiality with her dog Champers and annoys Tina to no end. She has a tendency to pop out at random times. Champers often tries to kill himself.

Chevdet Tevetoglu (voiced by Kyle McCulloch) \u2013 Chevdet is Balthazor's best friend and the chief engineer behind the drill project at Petromundo. As a recent immigrant, Chevdet works hard to make a better life for his large Turkish family.

Satan once called the servant \"a nasty little bitch\" then claiming he loves him that way. He is often sarcastic and witty, appearing at the end of each episode to inquire about the Hellman's progress toward destroying the drill.

        "content": "Iron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures, it is the sequel to Iron Man (2008) and the third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Theroux, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L. Jackson. Six months after Iron Man, Tony Stark resists calls from the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology, which is causing his declining health. Meanwhile, Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Rourke) uses his own version of the technology to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family. Following the critical and commercial success of Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July, Theroux was hired to write the script and Favreau was signed to return as director. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from Iron Man, while Cheadle was brought in to replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes. In the early months of 2009, Rourke (Vanko), Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast. Filming took place from April to July 2009, mostly in California as in the first film, except for a key sequence in Monaco. Unlike its predecessor, which mixed digital and practical effects, the sequel primarily relied on computer-generated imagery to create the Iron Man suits. Iron Man 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, as part of Phase One of the MCU. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances and action but deemed it to be inferior to the first film. The sequel grossed over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. A sequel, Iron Man 3, was released on May 3, 2013."

        "content": "In Russia, the media covers Tony Stark's disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. Ivan Vanko, whose father, Anton Vanko, a former Stark Industries employee, has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later, Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. To continue the legacy of his father Howard, he reinstitutes the Stark Expo in New York City's Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park. Later, Stark learns that the palladium core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts as CEO of Stark Industries and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who is wielding electrified whips. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains that his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the armor for the U.S. Air Force. Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., approaches Stark, revealing that \"Rushman\" is agent Natasha Romanoff and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Stark invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. Tony discovers a hidden message in the diorama of the 1974 Stark Expo; it proves to be a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., Stark synthesizes it. When he learns that Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency. At the current Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor. Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, but Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Stark. Hammer soon gets arrested for breaking Vanko out of prison, while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard Happy Hogan go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of Rhodes' armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits suicide by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones. At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson reports the discovery of a large hammer at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico."

Downey and Favreau, who had been handed a script and worked from it on the first movie, conceived part of the film's story themselves. On Stark being a hero, Downey said, \"It's kind of heroic, but really kind of on his own behalf. So I think there's probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said, 'I am Iron Man\u2013' that he's now really wondering what that means. If you have all this cushion like he does and the public is on your side and you have immense wealth and power, I think he's way too insulated to be okay.\" Downey put on 20 pounds of muscle to reprise the role. Six-year-old Davin Ransom portrays Tony Stark as a child. Gwyneth Paltrow as Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts: Stark's closest friend, budding love interest, and business partner; Pepper is promoted to CEO of Stark Industries. On her character's promotion, Paltrow opined, \"When we start Iron Man 2 Pepper and Tony are very much in the same vibe... as the movie progresses, Pepper is given more responsibility and she's promoted and it's nice to see her sort of grow up in that way. I think it really suits her, the job fits her really well.\" Paltrow expressed excitement about working with Johansson. Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine: An officer in the U.S. Air Force and Tony Stark's close personal friend who later operates the War Machine armor. Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard from the first film. Cheadle had only a few hours to accept the role and did not even know what storyline Rhodes would undergo. He commented that he is a comic book fan, but had not previously participated in comics-themed films due to the scarcity of black superheroes. Cheadle said he thought Iron Man was a robot before the first film came out. On how he approached his character, Cheadle stated, \"I go, what's the common denominator here? And the common denominator was really his friendship with Tony, and that's what we really tried to track in this one. How is their friendship impacted once Tony comes out and owns 'I am Iron Man'?\". Cheadle said his suit was  of metal, and that he could not touch his face while wearing it. Cheadle signed a six-picture deal. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow: An undercover spy for S.H.I.E.L.D. posing as Stark's new assistant. Johansson dyed her hair red before she landed the part, hoping that it would help convince Favreau that she was right for the role. On why she chose the role, Johansson said, \"the Black Widow character resonated with me... [She] is a superhero, but she's also human. She's small, but she's strong... She is dark and has faced death so many times that she has a deep perspective on the value of life... It's hard not to admire her.\" She stated that she had \"a bit of a freak-out moment\" when she first saw the cat-suit and worked closely with the stunt team to learn how to fight in it in order to \"sell it\". During promotion for Black Widow (2021), Johansson felt there had been a \"hyper-sexualization\" of the character in Iron Man 2, specifically referring to dialogue that described her as \"a piece of something, like a possession\" thinking \"maybe at that time that actually felt like a compliment\"; she was grateful to have been a part of the film, while also evolving along with the character to present a more \"positive message\" as in Black Widow. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer: A rival weapons manufacturer. Sam Rockwell was considered for the role of Tony Stark in the first film, and he accepted the role of Hammer without reading the script. He had never heard of the character before he was contacted about the part, and was unaware Hammer is an old Englishman in the comics. Rockwell said, \"I worked with Jon Favreau on this film called Made. And Justin Theroux, who wrote the script, is an old friend of mine, they sort of cooked up this idea and pitched it to Kevin Feige. What they did, they were maybe going to do one villain like they did with Jeff Bridges, but then they decided to split the villains. And really Mickey [Rourke] is the main [villain], but I come to his aid.\" Rockwell described his character as \"plucky comic relief, but he's got a little bit of an edge\". Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko / Whiplash: A Russian physicist and ex-convict who builds a pair of arc reactor-based electric whips to exact vengeance on the Stark family. The character is an amalgamation of Whiplash and Crimson Dynamo. Rourke visited Butyrka prison to research the role, and he suggested that half of the character's dialogue be in Russian. He also suggested the addition of tattoos, gold teeth and a fondness for a pet cockatoo, paying for the teeth and bird with his own money. Rourke explained that he did not want to play a \"one-dimensional bad guy\", and wanted to challenge the audience to see something redeemable in him. Not knowing anything about computers, Rourke described pretending to be tech-savvy as the hardest part of the role. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.; Jackson signed a nine-film contract to play the character. On the subject of his character not seeing any action in the film, Jackson said, \"We still haven't moved Nick Fury into the bad-ass zone. He's still just kind of a talker.\" The director, Jon Favreau, reprises his role as Harold \"Happy\" Hogan, Tony Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur, while Clark Gregg and Leslie Bibb reprise their roles as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson and reporter Christine Everhart, respectively. John Slattery appears as Tony's father Howard Stark and Garry Shandling appears as United States Senator Stern, who wants Stark to give Iron Man's armor to the government. Favreau stated that Shandling's character was named after radio personality Howard Stern. Paul Bettany again voices Stark's computer, J.A.R.V.I.S. Olivia Munn originally appeared as an unnamed character who was subsequently cut from the film. Favreau then gave her the role of Chess Roberts, a reporter covering the Stark expo. Yevgeni Lazarev appears as Ivan Vanko's father, Anton Vanko, Kate Mara portrays a process server who summons Tony to the government hearing, and Stan Lee appears as himself (but is mistaken for Larry King). Additionally, news anchor Christiane Amanpour, political commentator Bill O'Reilly, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, and Oracle Corporation CEO Larry Ellison appear as themselves. Adam Goldstein also appears as himself, and the film is dedicated to his memory. Favreau's son Max appears as a child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone. In 2017, Spider-Man: Homecoming director Jon Watts said that he had suggested to Feige that they retroactively establish this child to be the introduction of a young Peter Parker / Spider-Man to the MCU; Spider-Man actor Tom Holland supported this idea."

        "content": "Jon Favreau said it was originally his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued that the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, \"I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it.\" Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin \"allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains\". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role. During development, Favreau said the film would explore Stark's alcoholism, but it would not be \"the 'Demon in a Bottle' version\". While promoting the first film, Downey stated that Stark would probably develop a drinking problem as he is unable to cope with his age, the effects of revealing he is Iron Man, and Pepper getting a boyfriend. Downey later clarified that the film was not a strict adaptation of the \"Demon in a Bottle\" storyline from the comic book series, but was instead about the \"interim space\" between the origin and the \"Demon\" story arc. Shane Black gave some advice on the script, and suggested to Favreau and Downey that they model Stark on J. Robert Oppenheimer, who became depressed with being \"the destroyer of worlds\" after working on the Manhattan Project. An early version for the film's story involved Justin Hammer creating different villains in addition to Whiplash, like Ghost, but the idea was discarded. Ghost debuted in the MCU years later in Ant-Man and the Wasp."

In July 2008, after several months of negotiating, Favreau officially signed on to direct. That same month, Justin Theroux signed to write the script, which would be based on a story written by Favreau and Downey. Theroux co-wrote Tropic Thunder, which Downey had starred in, and Downey recommended him to Marvel. Genndy Tartakovsky storyboarded the film, and Adi Granov returned to supervise the designs for Iron Man's armor. In October 2008, Marvel Studios came to an agreement to film Iron Man 2, as well as their next three films, at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, California. A few days later, Don Cheadle was hired to replace Terrence Howard. On being replaced, Howard stated, \"There was no explanation, apparently the contracts that we write and sign aren't worth the paper that they're printed on sometimes. Promises aren't kept, and good-faith negotiations aren't always held up.\" Entertainment Weekly stated Favreau did not enjoy working with Howard, often re-shooting and cutting his scenes; Howard's publicist said he had a good experience playing the part, while Marvel chose not to comment. As Favreau and Theroux chose to reduce the role, Marvel came to Howard to discuss lowering his salary\u2014Howard was the first actor hired in Iron Man and was paid the largest salary. The publication stated they were unsure whether Howard's representatives left the project first or if Marvel chose to stop negotiating. Theroux denied the part of the report which claimed the size of the role had fluctuated. In November 2013, Howard stated that, going into the film, the studio offered him far less than was in his three-picture contract, claiming they told him the second will be successful, \"with or without you,\" and, without mentioning him by name, said Downey \"took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out.\" In January 2009, Rourke and Rockwell entered negotiations to play a pair of villains. A few days later, Rockwell confirmed he would take the role, and that his character would be Justin Hammer. Paul Bettany confirmed that he would be returning to voice J.A.R.V.I.S. Marvel entered into early talks with Emily Blunt to play the Black Widow, though she was unable to take the role due to a previous commitment to star in Gulliver's Travels. Samuel L. Jackson confirmed that he had been in discussions to reprise the role of Nick Fury from the first film's post-credits scene, but that contract disputes were making a deal difficult. Jackson stated, \"There was a huge kind of negotiation that broke down. I don't know. Maybe I won't be Nick Fury.\" In February, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he was signed to play the character in up to nine films. Downey and Rourke discussed his part during a roundtable discussion with David Ansen at the 2009 Golden Globes, and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss the role. Rourke almost dropped out because of Marvel's initial salary offer of $250,000, but the studio raised the offer, and in March, Rourke signed on. Later that same day, Scarlett Johansson signed on to play the Black Widow. Her deal included options for multiple films, including potentially The Avengers. Prior to her casting, Johansson had also researched other Marvel characters she could play, including the Blonde Phantom and the Wasp. In April, Garry Shandling, Clark Gregg, and Kate Mara joined the cast."

The bulk of the production took place at Raleigh Studios, though other locations were also used. Scenes were filmed at Edwards Air Force Base from May 11 through May 13. The location had also been used for Iron Man, and Favreau stated that he felt the \"real military assets make the movie more authentic and the topography and the beauty of the desert and flightline open the movie up\". The Historic Grand Prix of Monaco action sequence was shot in the parking lot of Downey Studios, with sets constructed in May and filming lasting through June. Permission to film in Monaco prior to the 2009 Monaco Grand Prix had initially been awarded, but was later retracted by Bernie Ecclestone. The filmmakers shipped one Rolls-Royce Phantom there, and filmed a track sequence in which race cars were later digitally added. Tanner Foust took on the role of driving Stark's racing car. Also in June, it was reported that John Slattery had joined the film's cast as Howard Stark. Olivia Munn was also cast, in an unspecified role. A massive green screen was constructed at the Sepulveda Dam to film a portion of the Stark Expo exterior, with the rest either shot at an area high school or added digitally. To construct the green screen, hundreds of shipping containers were stacked, covered in plywood and plaster, and then painted green. For the conclusion of that climactic scene, which the crew dubbed the \"Japanese Garden\" scene, a set was built inside Sony Studios in Los Angeles. Filming lasted 71 days, and the film's production officially wrapped on July 18, 2009. A post-credits scene depicting the discovery of a large hammer was filmed on the set of Thor, and some of it was reused in the film. Jon Favreau revealed that the scene was filmed with anamorphic lenses to match Thor, and was directed by Kenneth Branagh, the director of Thor."

The website's critical consensus reads, \"It isn't quite the breath of fresh air that Iron Man was, but this sequel comes close with solid performances and an action-packed plot.\" Metacritic gave the film a weighted average rating of 57 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on a scale of A+ to F, the same score as its predecessor. Brian Lowry of Variety stated, \"Iron Man 2 isn't as much fun as its predecessor, but by the time the smoke clears, it'll do\". Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said, \"To find a comic-book hero who doesn't agonize over his supergifts, and would defend his constitutional right to get a kick out of them, is frankly a relief\". David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote, \"It doesn't come close to the emotional heft of those two rare 2s that outclassed their ones: Superman II and Spider-Man 2. But Iron Man 2 hums along quite nicely\". Roger Ebert gave it 3 stars out of 4, stating, \"Iron Man 2 is a polished, high-octane sequel, not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr\". Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, a one-time Marvel Comics writer, said, \"In a refreshing and unexpected turn, the sequel to Iron Man doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh.\" Conversely, Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter stated, \"Everything fun and terrific about Iron Man, a mere two years ago, has vanished with its sequel. In its place, Iron Man 2 has substituted noise, confusion, multiple villains, irrelevant stunts and misguided story lines.\""

        "content": "In the Nevada desert, a couple, Peter and Mary Jackson are driving just as they are stopped by a sheriff, Collie Entragian. He soon learns they are in possession of marijuana, though this may have been planted by Entragian. He takes them to jail. After they enter the police station, they see a little girl, dead, on the floor and Entragian shoots and kills Peter. Mary is thrown in a jail cell along with a young boy, David Carver, his parents, Ralph and Ellen, and an old man, Tom Billingsley. The little girl is the Carver's daughter, named Pie. In the meantime, in the police station, David kneels and prays to God, his practice since his best friend Brian was struck by a drunk driver. Meanwhile, Steve Ames is in his truck, following famous author Johnny Marinville, who is some 50 miles up ahead. Ames is Marinville's assistant. Steve soon picks up a young female hitchhiker named Cynthia Smith. Johnny stops in the desert to urinate just as Entragian shows up behind him and plants the same bag of marijuana he got from Peter and Mary in Johnny's motorcycle bag and arrests him. Back in the Police Station, David is asked by his mother Ellen why he kept on praying. David revealed that he prays because God made 'his' presence known to him by miraculously saving his friend Brian from the brink of death. He then recollects that when he and Brian were riding a bike, a drunk driver hit Brian. David immediately began praying to God, offering to sacrifice anything, and to do what ever is asked of him in order that his friend be saved, at which point, Brian miraculously regained consciousness. The doctor at the hospital described Brian's recovery as \"miraculous\". Later, David realizes Entragian's skin is breaking out and he keeps saying \"Tak\" because he is possessed. Entragian then takes Ellen so he can shift his spirit into her body. He leaves his vicious dog to guard the cells. Pie's ghost appears and gives David a bar of soap which glows green. David scrubs his body with the soap and while the dog is distracted, slips through the bars of the jail cell and escapes the holding area. David searches the police station and finds a gun on the corpse of another sheriff. He returns and shoots the guard dog, freeing everyone. Meanwhile, Steve drives up to where Johnny was captured by Entragian. He and Cynthia find Johnny's motorcycle hidden behind dry bushes. Cynthia and Steve later search the town, finding all the residents dead. That night, they both meet up with other escaped prisoners from the jail. They gather at a disused theater and Tom tells a story that took place 120 years ago, when Chinese workers digging in a local mine known as 'The China Pit' discovered an evil spirit named \"Tak\". The now-possessed Ellen sends in a mountain lion and Tom is killed. Mary is then taken by Ellen so that Tak can have a new body. David sees Pie's ghost in the theater again. She leads him to the movie editing machine where old footage (apparently supernatural/visionary) reveals the truth of how Tak came to the town. Mary wakes up to find herself trapped in a shed, surrounded by rattlesnakes, scorpions and tarantulas, waiting to be the next host for Tak. With the help of Pie, she manages to escape, while seriously injuring Ellen's body. Tak is forced to take over the body of a buzzard. Johnny later confesses that 40 years ago in Vietnam he saw a guy, possessed by Tak, blow up the bathroom of a bar, killing 87 people. Johnny still feels guilty to this day that he did not warn any of the patrons before fleeing the bar. The group decides to return to the cave with some explosives they found to put an end to Tak. At the entrance, the buzzard comes out and kills Ralph. In order to redeem himself, Johnny goes into the mine and falls in a hole leading to a pit where Tak is. Johnny ignites the explosives, blowing up the mine and giving up his life, while the rest of the survivors drive away in Steve's truck. Along the route driving away from the town, they pass by the empty RV vehicle owned by David's family and Peter's sister's car. Mary tells Steve to stop the truck to retrieve an overnight case from the car. In the back seat Mary finds a photo album belonging to David with a frontispiece picture of Johnny and Pie together, which Steve identifies as being signed by Johnny."

        "content": "Monsters University is a 2013 American computer-animated monster comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed and written by Dan Scanlon (in his feature directoral debut) and produced by Kori Rae, with John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich as executive producers. The music for the film was composed by Randy Newman, making it his seventh collaboration with Pixar. It is a prequel to Monsters, Inc. (2001), making it the only time Pixar has made a prequel film. Monsters University tells the story of the main characters of Monsters, Inc., James P. Sullivan and Mike Wazowski, and their time at college, where they start off as rivals, but slowly become best friends. During the time, they must learn to work together, along with Oozma Kappa members, in order to make his dream reality and things right. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger reprise their roles as James P. Sullivan, Mike Wazowski, Randall Boggs, Roz, and the Abominable Snowman, respectively, while the new cast were joined by Helen Mirren, Alfred Molina, Peter Sohn, Joel Murray, Sean Hayes, Dave Foley, Charlie Day, and Nathan Fillion. Bonnie Hunt, who voiced Ms. Flint in the first film, voices Mike's grade school teacher Ms. Karen Graves. Disney, as the rights holder, had plans for a sequel to Monsters, Inc. since 2005. Following disagreements with Pixar, Disney tasked its Circle 7 Animation unit to make the film. An early draft of the film was developed; however, Disney's purchase of Pixar in early 2006 led to the cancellation of Circle 7's version of the film. A Pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010, and in 2011, it was confirmed that the film would instead be a prequel titled Monsters University. Monsters University premiered on June 5, 2013 at the BFI Southbank in London, England, and was theatrically released on June 21, 2013, in the United States. It was accompanied in theaters by a short film, The Blue Umbrella, directed by Saschka Unseld. The film received positive reviews from the critics and grossed $743\u00a0million worldwide against its $200 million production budget, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2013. An animated short film titled Party Central, which takes place shortly after the events of Monsters University, premiered in fall 2013 before being released theatrically with Muppets Most Wanted in 2014."

        "content": "As a first grader, Mike Wazowski begins to dream of becoming a Scarer - a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children and harvest their screams for energy to power the city of Monstropolis. Eleven years later, Mike enrolls in the Scaring program at Monsters University (MU) and meets classmate James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan. Abigail Hardscrabble, dean of MU, warns the students that anyone who does not pass a final exam at the end of the first semester will have to leave the Scaring program. As the semester progresses, an intense rivalry forms between Mike, who studies hard to improve himself, and Sulley, who relies only on his natural talent and begins to falter. They both attempt to join a fraternity, but only Sulley is accepted into Roar Omega Roar (ROR), the most prestigious house on campus. Hardscrabble tests them separately and fails them both -- Mike for not being scary, Sulley for choosing the wrong approach to scare a child without having all the relevant information about them. They are forced to transfer to a different study program, much to their dismay. Wanting to prove himself, Mike learns of MU's \"Scare Games\" competition and makes a deal with Hardscrabble. If his team wins, all of the members will be admitted to the Scaring program, otherwise, he will leave MU. Mike joins Oozma Kappa (OK), a fraternity of misfits, but they are one member short of being able to enter the competition. Sulley offers to join OK, seeing it as his only chance to return to Scaring, and Mike reluctantly accepts. OK finishes last in the first round but are saved from elimination after another team is disqualified for cheating. During each of the next three rounds, OK steadily improves due to Mike's knowledge of scaring and the others' unique talents. Despite their progress, they face humiliation by rival fraternities, and Hardscrabble questions whether Sulley believes that Mike can be an effective Scarer. Though OK earns a decisive victory over ROR in the final round, Mike discovers afterward that Sulley had tampered with the simulator settings to guarantee a win for OK, causing a heated argument between the two. The other OK members discard their trophy, equally ashamed that Sulley ruined their victory by cheating. Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble what he has done. Outraged at Sulley's betrayal and still determined to prove that he can become a Scarer, Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters the human world. He emerges in a summer camp cabin full of children but is unable to scare any of them and flees into the woods. With assistance from the OK members, Sulley sneaks through the door to find Mike, ignoring Hardscrabble's order to stay away from it and let the authorities handle the situation. Sulley finds Mike and tells him that the reason why he cheated was because he was afraid of failing his team and everyone on the campus all because Mike was not scary and admits that despite being a Sullivan, he's not as great of a success as his family. The two reconcile and try to return to MU, but find out that Hardscrabble has deactivated the door. As police officers begin to chase Mike and Sulley, Mike realizes that they may be able to power the door from their side. Working together, the two scare the officers so badly that their screams overload the door, then return to MU just as it explodes. Mike and Sulley are punished and expelled from MU for their actions, but admits the remaining OK members into the Scaring program for the coming semester, impressed by their performance in the Scare Games. As Mike and Sulley are leaving the campus, Hardscrabble admits that they have surprised her and expresses her hope that they will continue to do so in the future. Seeing a \"help wanted\" advertisement for job openings at Monsters, Inc., the two decide to apply and are hired to work in the mailroom. They work their way up to different jobs before being scarer and scare assistant respectively."

        "content": "Plans for a second Monsters, Inc. film existed since 2002. Following disagreements between Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs, Disney\u2014which owned the rights to make sequels to all of Pixar's films up to Cars\u2014announced that a sequel to Monsters, Inc. would be made by Disney's Circle 7 Animation studio, which was also working on early drafts of Toy Story 3 & Finding Nemo 2. Titled Monsters, Inc. 2: Lost in Scaradise, the film would have focused on Mike and Sulley visiting the human world to give Boo a birthday present, only to find that she had moved. After getting trapped in the human world, Mike and Sulley would split up after disagreeing on what to do. Screenwriters Rob Muir and Bob Hilgenberg were hired to write a script for the film, and storyboarded an early draft of it. Disney's change of management in late 2005\u2014in which Eisner was replaced by Bob Iger\u2014led to renewed negotiations with Pixar, and in early 2006 Disney announced it had purchased the studio. The Disney-owned sequel rights were then transferred to Pixar, leading to the cancellation of Muir and Hilgenberg's version of the film and the subsequent closure of Circle 7. A Pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010. The film was originally planned for release on November 16, 2012, but the release was moved up to November 2, 2012 to avoid competition with The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2. On March 29, 2011, it was confirmed that the film would be a prequel and the title Monsters University was announced. On April 4, 2011, due to Pixar's past success with summer releases, according to a Disney executive, it was confirmed that the film would be released on June 21, 2013. The feature was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae. Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger reprised their roles, and Bonnie Hunt voiced a new character. New voice cast included Dave Foley, Sean Hayes, Julia Sweeney, Helen Mirren, Alfred Molina, Peter Sohn, Charlie Day, Joel Murray, Nathan Fillion, Aubrey Plaza, Tyler Labine, John Krasinski, Bill Hader, Bobby Moynihan, and Beth Behrs. The plot of Monsters University details Mike and Sulley's first meeting, but this created a continuity error from the original film in which Mike tells Sulley \"You've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade.\" Director Dan Scanlon said he had a dilemma with this line during pre-production, but he believed it was best if Mike and Sulley meet in college because, \"we wanted to see their relationship develop when they were adults. And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are.\" He added, \"It felt like the perfect place to do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn't want to make Monsters Elementary.\" Scanlon said during pre-production that, \"Pete Docter, the original director, and John Lasseter\u00a0...\u00a0finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honoring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.' So we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside.\" Scanlon later retconned the line from the first film as \"an old monster expression\", saying, \"That\u2019s what monsters always say to each other.\""

        "content": "Monsters University is the first Pixar film that used global illumination, a new lighting system introduced as part of the overhaul of the rendering system used since the first Toy Story film. In the planning stage of the film, director of photography, Jean-Claude Kalache, asked \"What if we made these lights just work?\" Before the new system, artists had to build reflections and shadows manually, which became increasingly complex as the models and the setups became more technologically advanced. The new lighting system uses path tracing, a technique that imitates the behaviour of the light in the real world; this automatized the process, delivered more realism, produced soft shadows, and let the artist spend more time on models and complex scenes \u2013 some of which contained thousands of light sources. For research, the filmmakers visited several colleges in the U.S., including Harvard University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, observing college architecture, student life, Greek organizations, and the teaching methods of professors and faculty. To research fraternity life, which is central to the film, many of the film's producers spent several weeks at a fraternity house. Researchers also attended a \"Bonfire Rally\" at Berkeley in anticipation of the Big Game, a rivalry football game between the university and Stanford."

Matt Zoller Seitz of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, saying it \"is true to the spirit of [Monsters, Inc.] and matches its tone. But it never seems content to turn over old ground.\" Trevor Johnston of Time Out gave the film four stars out of five, writing \"It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result.\" Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three stars out of four and said it \"is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful.\" Jake Coyle of Associated Press gave the film three stars out of four, saying it \"might not be as gifted as some of its other movies, but sometimes it's alright to be OK.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four, and said \"It's all infectious fun, despite the lack of originality. In the art of tickling funny bones, Crystal and Goodman earn straight A's.\" Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying \"This minor film with major charms still deserves to have kids dragging their parents to the multiplex for one more peek at the monsters in the closet. With Pixar, familiarity breeds content.\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of five and said it is \"one of those movies that has absolutely no reason to exist, but once you've seen it, you're kind of glad it does.\" Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying \"Monsters University feels not like the work of artists eager to express something but like that of likable pros whose existence depends on getting a rise out the kids. It's like the scares Sully and Mike spring on those sleeping tykes: technically impressive but a job un-anchored to anything more meaningful.\" Leonard Maltin of IndieWire praised the animation and art direction, but wrote that he wished \"the movie was funnier and wasn't so plot-heavy\" and that \"Pixar has raised the bar for animated features so high that when they turn out a film that's merely good, instead of great, they have only themselves to blame for causing critics to damn them with faint praise.\" Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four, saying \"Monsters University, the weirdly charmless sequel to the animated 2001 Pixar hit Monsters, Inc., is no better or worse than the average (and I mean average) time-filling sequel cranked out by other animation houses.\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying that it \"never surprises, goes off in unexpected directions or throws you for a loop in the manner of the best Pixar stories. Nor does it come close to elating through the sheer imagination of its conceits and storytelling.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three stars out of four, and said it \"may not be as inventive as Inc., but it's an amusing and amiable addition to Pixar's roster of animated coming-of-age stories.\" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three stars out of four, saying \"It may be children's terror that powers the movie's fictional universe, but it's the energy of its stars that lights up Monsters University.\" Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A\u2212 and said it \"is exactly the rebound Pixar needed after 2011's Cars 2 left some wondering if the studio had lost its magic.

Two prominent families live in the area: the Monteros, owners of La Aurora, one of the most important sugar mills in the region, and the Santos, owners of an extensive sugarcane plantation. In the past, Fausto Santos (Leonardo Daniel) and Amador Montero (C\u00e9sar \u00c9vora) stopped being friends when their love for Margarita Faberman (Felicia Mercado) came between them. Margarita was a beautiful woman who came from Europe with her younger sister, Dinorah (Azela Robinson). Margarita chose Fausto, married him and had a daughter named Julia with him. For his part, Amador ended up marrying Josefina Rosales (Ang\u00e9lica Arag\u00f3n), the sister of the town's parish priest, Father Refugio (Fernando Balzaretti). Amador and Josefina had a son named Pablo. However, Amador never loved Josefina, a difficult woman. Amador was unfaithful to Josefina and had an affair with a woman named Socorro (Elizabeth Dupeyr\u00f3n), with whom he fathered a son. Through Josefina's intervention, Socorro fled the town and gave her son to Father Refugio. The child was named Juan de Dios. Julia, Pablo and Juan de Dios are best friends, although it is clear that Julia likes Pablo better, and both Pablo and Juan de Dios compete for Julia\u2019s attentions. For her part, Josefina has always been jealous of Margarita, whom she slanders constantly believing that Amador is unfaithful to her with Margarita. But Amador's lover is, in fact, Dinorah, Margarita's sister. The relationship between them escalates to the point that they plan to leave town together. The night they were both planning to escape, they were discovered by Margaita. She locks up Dinorah and then leaves to meet Amador in order to convince him to return with his family. Unfortunately, a strong storm breaks out in the town. Amador and Margarita suffer a serious accident when they returned to San Benito. Amador dies instantly, but Margarita survives a little longer, in time to say a few words to the only witness to the accident, Remedios (Josefina Ech\u00e1nove), the traditional healer of the town. But in addition to Remedios, there are other people who know the truth of the situation. They are Father Refugio (bound by the secret of confession) and Rufino Mendoza (Roberto Ballesteros), a trusted employee of Amador, a vile and unscrupulous man who takes advantage of the situation to blackmail Dinorah and extract favors from her, besides earning Josefina\u2019s trust and serving as a vehicle to fulfill her evil plans. Both Fausto and Josefina believe that their respective spouses had betrayed them. This lie is sustained by Dinorah, who takes advantage of this lie in order to cover up her guilt, sully the memory of her sister, and win the affection of her brother-in-law Fausto, whom she has always loved. Dinorah convinces a depressed Fausto to marry her. For her part, Josefina is dedicated to smearing the memory of Margarita and despising her daughter Julia, whom she considers the same as her mother. Knowing the affection between her son Pablo and Julia, she decides to separate them by sending Pablo to Mexico City with the Elizondo Family, their distant relatives. Ten years later, Julia (Daniela Castro), has become a beautiful woman. Unfortunately, the whole town speaks ill of her because of Josefina's rumors. As if that were not enough, her father despises her because he sees his dead wife Margarita in their daughter, while enduring the hatred of her Aunt Dinorah, who also blames the death of the son she had with Fausto; the truth is that Dinorah's son was actually Amador\u2019s. The only ones that support Julia are her best friend Mireya (Patricia Navidad) (Remedios' granddaughter), her nanny Prudencia (Alma Delfina) and her godparents Don Samuel Aldapa (Jorge Russek) and his wife Amalia (Maria Eugenia R\u00edos), who see Julia as a daughter. Additionally, Juan de Dios (Francisco Gattorno) deeply loves Julia. She rejects him, seeing him as a brother, as well as knowing the feelings Mireya is harboring towards him. One night, Pablo (Juan Soler), returns to San Benito after his long absence. Pablo returns to the town with the intention of informing his mother of his future marriage with Gina Elizondo (Marisol Santacruz). However, reuniting with his native land and his old friends causes Pablo to feel bound to his land, especially after seeing Julia again and seeing the rebirth of the feelings they both had since childhood. But the love story between Julia and Paul faces many obstacles. The first is the hatred between their respective families, and the second, that terrible lie of the past that enveloped their parents and which both will have to discover."

        "content": "Thadeous and Fabious are sons of King Tallious in the Kingdom of Mourne. Fabious is dashing and skilled and Thadeous is lazy and ineffectual. While celebrating victory over the evil sorcerer, Leezar, who has been ravaging Tallious's kingdom, Fabious presents the virgin Belladonna whom he has freed from a tower and wishes to marry. Though his brother makes him best man, Thadeous skips the wedding after overhearing Fabious' Knights Elite, led by Boremont, talk about him negatively. The wedding is then crashed by Leezar, who admits being the one who placed Belladonna in the tower. Leezar re-kidnaps her and flees. Returning to the castle with his servant and best friend Courtney, Thadeous is given an ultimatum: join Fabious on his quest to rescue Belladonna or be banished. Visiting the Great Wize Wizard, Thadeous and Fabious learn that Leezar's goal is to fulfill a prophecy: a warlock having sex with a virgin when the two moons converge, will impregnate her with a dragon that will allow him to take over King Tallious' kingdom. To destroy Leezar, they are given a magic compass that will lead them to the Blade of Unicorn, located within a labyrinth. On the way there, they learn Fabious's eunuch slave, Julie, has been informing Leezar of their progress and the Knights Elite are serving the warlock. After the knights are killed and he escapes, Fabious sends his mechanical bird Simon to warn the king of the betrayal by the Knights Elite, requesting reinforcements. Thadeous, Fabious and Courtney are captured by wild women led by the savage warlord Marteetee, who imprisons them in an arena, where Fabious kills off Marteetee's finest warrior. In retaliation, Marteetee summons a hydra-like monster to kill them. The brothers are rescued by Isabel, a warrior seeking revenge for her father's murder at Marteetee's hands. Later that night, Thadeous learns Isabel is also after Leezar to avenge the slaughter of her brothers. The next day, the party learns too late that Isabel stole the compass from Thadeous. Fabious, finally angered by his brother's selfishness, decides to find the Blade of Unicorn alone. Thadeous and Courtney go to a tavern, where they find Isabel and retrieve the compass. Finding that his brother has been captured by Leezar's men, Thadeous wins Isabel over as they join forces, entering the labyrinth where they encounter a Minotaur. After becoming separated from the others, Thadeous retrieves the Blade of Unicorn and slays the Minotaur. Thadeous and his group make their way to Leezar's castle and free Fabious, giving him the Blade. As the others kill off Julie, Boremont and his men and Leezar's three witches, Fabious impales Leezar with the Blade of Unicorn, preventing him from raping Belladonna. After their victory, Isabel leaves for another quest and the heroes return home. Some time later, Fabious and Belladonna marry, while Thadeous is approached by a returning Isabel, who reveals that she has fallen in love with him. However, for them to have sex, he must first slay the witch who has cast a spell on her, locking her in a chastity belt. Though not in the mood to go out, Isabel's suggestion convinces him to go on a new adventure."

        "content": "The film had been a passion project of Green's for a long time, with him later calling it, \"an entirely self-indulgent dream project for the 11-year-old in me.\" Although marketed as a spoof of '80s fantasy movies, Green has said that this was not his intent. Instead he hoped to, with star Danny McBride, \"put our stamp on it and bring our sensibility to it, but work within the genre.\" Early on, according to Green, Universal was nervous about the prospects of the film, believing it to be a parody. However, their minds were eased when discussing the casting, \"and that we weren't filling it with comedian cameos.\" Filming began in the summer of 2009 in Northern Ireland, at historic locations such as Dunluce Castle, Cairncastle and Shane's Castle, and it concluded in October 2009. Although Green wanted to make the film epic in scale, they were hampered by a limited budget. Ad libbing and improv were encouraged on set, although Green has implied that the extent of this has been exaggerated, adding, \"There was definitely more of a script here than anything I\u2019ve ever worked on\". Still, at least one notable part of the backstory was improvised, which was the idea that the Wizard molested James Franco's character as a youth. McBride has said that he was certain that the scene where this was revealed would be cut, and he was shocked when it appeared in the final film."

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Big budgets and costumes in service of scatalogical jokes may seem funny on paper, but in execution this is a highly monotonous romp that registers only occasional laughs.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 32 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four, calling it \"juvenile excrescence that feels like the work of 11-year-old boys in love with dungeons, dragons, warrior women, pot, boobs and four-letter words.\" Entertainment Weekly gave it a C+, with Natalie Portman favorably reviewed as \"fierce and funny as a babe warrior...good with dirty words\". The L.A. Times noted the \"even but fun sword-and-sandals sendup...is at its best when it's at its silliest\", while the lowbrow humor is \"sometimes witless and sometimes winning comedy...begins with grade-school-level graffiti being scrawled across storybook pages and goes up and down from there. Still, the fun can be infectious...a farce within a farce...tawdry tale of the bothered and bewildered Kingdom of Mourne\". David Edelstein of New York magazine gave a favorable review, describing the film as \"a cunning weave of low and high\". Yahoo! described the \"Raunchy Sex Comedy Wrapped Up in a Noble Quest\" as \"overall, sets and scenery were fantastic and photography was incredible...a awesome, piece of foolishness wrapped up as a Period Piece...more in common with American Pie than it did to Lord of the Rings. Richard Corliss, who admired McBride's and Green's earlier work, said he felt a \"kind of head-swiveling awe in Your Highness\u2018s concentration of aimless inanity, in the purity of its devotion to its own louche principles. Like members of some post-Dadaist collective, the filmmakers have dedicated themselves to memorializing every first, wrong impulse that popped into their heads, while ruthlessly excising any vestige of wit or narrative niceties as being too linear, dude.\" James Franco received a Razzie nomination for Worst Supporting Actor for the film, but lost to Al Pacino in Jack and Jill. James Franco would later poke fun at the film's poor reception during his Comedy Central Roast, saying \"I agreed to do this roast because I wanted to do something I've never done before \u2014 something that has zero artistic value, something nobody will remember three months from now, something that's offensive, homophobic, and stars horrifically untalented people and something that's only a big deal to a handful of teenage stoners on Twitter. You might say, 'James, didn't you just describe Your Highness?' I wouldn't know, I didn't see Your Highness.\" On his first-ever interview on The Howard Stern Show to promote the film Spring Breakers, Franco was surprised to hear Stern compliment Your Highness, asking incredulously, \"you liked that?\" He attributed the film's lackluster performance to its \"tricky\" blend of lowbrow humor and medieval swords and sorcerers, a combination that hadn't worked well since Monty Python and the Holy Grail."

Episodes are filmed on location at Auckland Zoo, Wellington Zoo and Melbourne Zoo, as well as undisclosed beach and farm regions. Since the WotWots' language consists almost entirely of the syllables \"wot\" and \"wotty\", co-creator Martin Baynton also acts as an interactive narrator for the series, serving as a translator both for the aliens' efforts to understand Earth and the human viewership trying to understand them. In the UK, the narrator is played by Nicholas Parsons, and in Poland by Vladimir Press. Baynton also provides the voice for SpottyWot, while South African actress Nathalie Boltt voices DottyWot.

        "content": "13 Reasons Why is an American teen drama streaming television series developed for Netflix by Brian Yorkey, based on the 2007 novel Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. The series revolves around high school student Clay Jensen and the aftermath of high school student Hannah Baker's suicide. Before her death, she leaves behind a box of cassette tapes in which she details the reasons why she chose to end her life as well as the people she believes are responsible for her death. Through its various storylines, the show explores and depicts a wide range of social issues affecting modern youth. The series was produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, That Kid Ed Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners. Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford star as Clay Jensen and Hannah Baker, respectively, alongside an ensemble cast. A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering an adaptation as a limited series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer. The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its themes, subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide, sexual assault, bullying, and rape (along with other mature content) prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card in March 2018 that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about the themes of each season. In July 2019, Netflix edited out the suicide scene in the first season's final episode. In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season due to the success of the initial 13 episodes; the second season was released on May 18, 2018, and generally negative critical reviews. Coinciding with the release of the second season, Netflix released a video with the cast that cautioned viewers on some of the topics covered in the show and provided a support website with crisis numbers for people affected by depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and was released on August 23, 2019. In August 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth and final season, which premiered on June 5, 2020."

The season features flashbacks viewed from Hannah's perspective that offer increasing clarity as to the trauma she faced during her time as a student and what ultimately led up to her own death. In the second season, Hannah's parents sue the school district after Hannah's tapes are released online. The fallout from the events of the first season and the toll it has taken on the lives of Liberty High's students is further shown. At the end of the season, Tyler attempts a school shooting after he is severely traumatized by the bully Monty, but is stopped by Clay and Tony with Tyler's gun given to Clay as Tony drives Tyler away. In the third season, which introduces a new main character Ani Achola and takes place eight months after the events of the previous season, Clay and his friends struggle to keep Tyler's cover of his attempted school shooting and helping him in his recovery. Tensions rise with the tape subjects after Bryce is killed with Clay as a suspect. In the wake of his death, Bryce's past actions and the person he has become in the aftermath of the release of Hannah's tapes is examined. In the fourth and final season, Clay begins to develop mental health issues following the deaths of Bryce and Monty, while the students are planning for their college interviews and nearing graduation."

It received positive reviews, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape (along with other mature content) prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018 on, a video plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes. In July 2019, Netflix edited out the suicide scene in the first season's final episode. Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season in May 2017 due to the success of the initial 13 episodes; filming of the second season began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018. Coinciding with the release of the second season, Netflix released a video with the cast that cautioned viewers on some of the topics covered in the show and provided a support website with crisis numbers for people affected by depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.

        "content": "The first season has received positive reviews, with praise for the acting (particularly that of Minnette, Langford, and Walsh), directing, story, visuals, themes, improvements upon its source material, and mature approach to dark and adult subject matter. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 78% approval rating with an average rating of 7.14/10, based on 63 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"13 Reasons Why complements its bestselling source material with a gripping look at adolescent grief whose narrative maturity belies its YA milieu.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 76 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews. Jesse Schedeen of IGN praised 13 Reasons Why, giving it a 9.2 out of 10, \"Amazing\", stating that the series is \"a very powerful and hard-hitting series\" and \"ranks among the best high school dramas of the 21st century\". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe gave a glowing review for the series, saying, \"The drama is sensitive, consistently engaging, and, most importantly, unblinking.\" Maureen Ryan of Variety asserts that the series \"is undoubtedly sincere, but it's also, in many important ways, creatively successful\" and called it \"simply essential viewing\". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the entire season a score of B+, calling the series \"a frank, authentically affecting portrait of what it feels like to be young, lost and too fragile for the world\". Daniel Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter also praised the series, calling it \"an honorably mature piece of young-adult adaptation\", and citing its performances, direction, relevance and maturity as some of the series' strongest points. The acting, particularly Katherine Langford as Hannah and Dylan Minnette as Clay, was frequently praised in reviews. Schedeen of IGN praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: \"Langford shines in the lead role... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role.\" Gilbert of The Boston Globe praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\". Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter also praises both actors: \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair.\" Ryan of Variety also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as \"career-best work\". Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances as Jessica, Alex and Tony). Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire, who enjoyed the series and gave it a positive score of B+, gave praise to the racial, gender and complex diversity of its supporting cast of teens. Another aspect frequently mentioned within reviews was the series's mature and emotional approach to its dark and adult subject matter. This was favorably reviewed by critics, such as Miller of Indiewire, particularly her statement that \"the adult edges to this story ring with honesty and truth.\" Miller, and Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter, also stated that the series can be difficult to watch at times, while Schedeen of IGN states that it is \"an often depressing and even uncomfortable show to watch... a pretty emotionally draining experience, particularly towards the end as the pieces really start to fall into place.\" Critics also praised several other aspects of the series. Feinberg highlighted the series' directors, saying: \"A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative\", while Gilbert of The Boston Globe praised the storytelling: \"The storytelling techniques are powerful... [as it] builds on the world established in the previous hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new characters. The background on the show keeps getting deeper, richer.\" Conversely, the series has also received criticism over its portrayal of teen angst. Mike Hale of The New York Times wrote a critical review, writing, \"the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement.\" He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: \"It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already.\" Writing for The Guardian, Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the series, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, \"a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me\". Nicholson was skeptical that the series would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life: \"It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note \u2013 and that note is horrifying. 'It has to get better,' implores one student towards the end, but given its fairly open ending, an apparent season two setup, it does not seem as if there's much chance of that happening.\" The Washington Post television critic Hank Stuever wrote a negative review, finding 13 Reasons Why \"contrived\" and implausible: \"There are 13 episodes lasting 13 super-sullen hours \u2013 a passive-aggressive, implausibly meandering, poorly written and awkwardly acted effort that is mainly about miscommunication, delivering no more wisdom or insight about depression, bullying and suicide than one of those old ABC Afterschool Specials people now mock for being so corny.\" He also wrote that he found Hannah's suicide tapes \"a protracted example of the teenager who fantasizes how everyone will react when she's gone. The story... strikes me as remarkably, even dangerously, naive in its understanding of suicide, up to and including a gruesome, penultimate scene of Hannah opening her wrists in a bathtub.\" David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the series a tepid review, saying that it was plagued by character inconsistencies, particularly in Hannah's character. He praised Langford's \"stunning performance\" but noted, \"There are times when we simply don't believe the characters, when what they do or say isn't consistent with who we've been led to believe they are... At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids. At other times, though, relatively minor misperceived slights seem to send her into an emotional tailspin. No doubt, teenagers embody a constant whirl of conflicting emotions, but the script pushes the bounds of credibility here and there.\" He noted that overall, the series worked: \"The structure is gimmicky and the characters inconsistent, but there are still at least 13 Reasons Why the series is worthy.\""

A scene in which the character Tyler is attacked and sexually assaulted with a mop handle during the finale also caused controversy from fans and critics of the series, with some describing it as \"unnecessary\" and \"traumatizing\".

The storyline of Justin Foley being diagnosed with and killed by complications of AIDS generated controversy, with many calling it unfair.

The portrayal of sensitive content such as teen suicide, self-harm, rape and bullying raised criticism, especially for its graphic content, primarily the scene in which Hannah kills herself. Some researchers and medical professionals argue that the series violated guidelines for depicting suicide in the media and might trigger \"imitative\" behaviors among high school students and vulnerable people. Prior to the series' release, scholars had studied the influence of the media on suicide for decades. Evidence to support the existence of a relationship between fictional media exposure and suicide behaviors remained weak and a strict causality had never been established. The effect that fiction can have on suicidal thoughts and behaviors is probably smaller than that of other psychological and social risk factors for suicide. It has been argued that censoring fiction may do more harm than good. After the series' release, a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry found that suicide among teenagers rose by 28.9% in the month after Netflix launched the show."

This community also expressed major concerns about the series like romanticizing suicide, not providing adequate resources at the conclusion of each episode, targeting a young vulnerable audience, and painting mental health professionals as unhelpful and not worth seeing. Mental health experts are also educating the general public on what to do in the situations Hannah Baker goes through, disseminating accurate information surrounding teen suicide, depression, and youth that experience traumatic events through research surrounding the show and mental health resources for help-seeking youth. The release of 13 Reasons Why corresponded with between 900,000 and 1.5million more suicide-related Google searches in the United States, including a 26% increase in searches for \"how to commit suicide,\" an 18% increase for \"commit suicide,\" and a 9% increase for \"how to kill yourself.\" After an initial spike in calls to the Crisis Text Line after the first episode, there was an overall reduction in crisis call volume for the remainder of the series. Although the link between searching for suicide information and suicide risk is unclear, increases in self-harm admissions to one children's hospital were observed. The superintendent of Palm Beach County, Florida schools reportedly told parents that their schools had seen an increase in suicidal and self-harming behavior from students, and that some of those students \"have articulated associations of their at-risk behavior to the 13 Reasons Why Netflix series\". The Australian youth mental health service for 12\u201325 year-olds, Headspace, issued a warning in late April 2017 over the graphic content featured in the series, due to the increased number of calls to the service following the series' release in the country. Netflix however, demonstrably complied with the Australian viewer ratings system, by branding the series as \"MA15+\" when streamed via its own interface. They accompanied its presentation with additional warnings and viewer advice, and ensured that counselling referrals were included and not easily skipped at the conclusion of each episode. Each warning voice over is read by a different cast member at the end of the episode, with Katherine Langford reading in her native Australian accent in her voice-overs. In response to the graphic nature of the series and New Zealand's high youth suicide rate, which was the highest among the 34 OECD countries during 2009 to 2012, the Office of Film & Literature Classification in the country created a new rating, \"RP18\", allowing individuals aged 18 and over to watch the series alone and those below having to watch it with supervision from a parent or guardian. In April 2017, the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) in the United States released a statement regarding the series, saying: \"Research shows that exposure to another person's suicide, or to graphic or sensationalized accounts of death, can be one of the many risk factors that youth struggling with mental health conditions cite as a reason they contemplate or attempt suicide.\" NASP sent a letter to school mental health professionals across the country about the series, reportedly a first for NASP in response to a television series. The following month, the United States Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology (SCCAP) released a statement also noting how strongly the series may serve as a trigger for self-injury among vulnerable youth. They lamented the depiction of mental health professionals as ineffective for youth who have experienced trauma and may have been considering suicide. The statement implored Netflix to add a tag following each episode with mental health resources, and a reminder that depression and suicidal thoughts can be effectively treated by a qualified mental health professional, such as a clinical child psychologist, using evidence-based practice. Similarly, clinical psychologists such as Daniel J. Reidenberg and Erika Martinez, as well as mental health advocate MollyKate Cline of Teen Vogue magazine, have expressed concerns regarding the risk of suicide contagion. However, Eric Beeson, a counselor at The Family Institute at Northwestern University noted that \"it's unlikely that one show alone could trigger someone to attempt suicide.\" Mental health professionals have also criticized the series' depiction of suicide itself, much of which violates widely promulgated recommendations for reporting on actual suicides or not depicting them in fiction, in order to not encourage copycat suicides. The season finale, which depicts Hannah's suicide in graphic detail, has been particularly criticized in this regard.<ref name=\"Slate piece\">{{cite news |last=Martinelli |first=Marissa |title=13 Reasons Why's Controversial Depiction of Teen Suicide Has School Counselors Picking Up the Pieces |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/05/01/school_counselors_talk_netflix_s_controversial_teen_suicide_drama_13_reasons.html |newspaper=Slate |date=May 1, 2017 |access-date=May 2, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502022611/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/05/01/school_counselors_talk_netflix_s_controversial_teen_suicide_drama_13_reasons.html |archive-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref> Nic Sheff, a writer for the series, has defended it as intended to dispel the myth that suicides \"quietly drift off\", and recalled how he himself was deterred from a suicide attempt by recalling a survivor's account of how painful and horrifying it was. Executive producer Selena Gomez, in defense of the controversy surrounding the series, stated: We stayed very true to the book and that's initially what [author] Jay Asher created was a beautifully tragic, complicated yet suspenseful story and I think that's what we wanted to do... We wanted to do it justice and, yeah, [the backlash is] gonna come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about, but I'm very fortunate with how it's doing. The NASP statement also criticized the series' suggestion that bullying alone led Hannah to take her life, noting that while it may be a contributing factor, suicide far more often results from the bullied person having a \"treatable mental illness and overwhelming or intolerable stressors\", along with a lack of adequate coping mechanisms. Alex Moen, a school counselor in Minneapolis, took issue with the series' entire plotline as \"essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have\u2014that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live.\" Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. \"It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police\", she told Slate. In May 2017, the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the American Association of Suicidology. CMHA and CASP did praise the series for raising awareness about \"this preventable health concern,\" adding that, \"Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide.\" Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: \"They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson.\"National Association of School Psychologists. (2017). 13 Reasons Why Netflix series: Considerations for educators (handout). Bethesda, MD: Author. at nasponline.org  Accessed May 8, 2017 A 2019 study showed the overall suicide rate among 10- to 17-year-olds increased significantly in the month immediately following the release of the series."

        "content": "\"The Hungry Earth\" is the eighth episode of the fifth series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast on 22 May 2010 on BBC One. It was written by Chris Chibnall, who had previously written for Doctor Who and its spin-off series, Torchwood. It is the first episode of a two-part story, the second episode being \"Cold Blood\", and features the return of the Silurians, a reptile-like humanoid race last seen in 1984's Warriors of the Deep. In the episode, the Eleventh Doctor\u2014a time travelling alien played by Matt Smith\u2014and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) land in Wales in 2020, where a drilling operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) is drilling deep into the earth and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth. The Silurians cause holes to open in the earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, as it could spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and kidnapped locals Mo (Alun Raglan) and Elliot (Samuel Davies). Executive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger contacted Chibnall and asked him to write a two-part episode involving Silurians and a drill. Moffat wished to redesign the Silurians and worked together with Chibnall to create the idea of distinguishing prosthetics for their faces. Being in the fourth production block of the series, the episode was filmed in October and November 2009, with location filming in Llanwynno, Wales. McIntosh then returned in the series as a recurrent actress, portraying Madame Vastra, another Silurian character. The episode was watched by 6.49\u00a0million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD and received mixed reviews from critics. While some praised the horror, some noted that the story was very simplistic, and critics disagreed about the redesigned Silurians."

        "content": "In the small Welsh hamlet of Cwmtaff in 2020, a driller at a mining operation called Mo is pulled underground after the ground opens during the night shift. The Eleventh Doctor, Amy and Rory land in Cwmtaff instead of their intended destination, Rio de Janeiro. They meet the leader of the operation, Doctor Nasreen Chaudhry, who is studying minerals deep in the earth that have not been seen for over 20 million years. Nasreen is assisted by Mo's father-in-law, Tony Mack. An earth tremor causes the ground to open and sends Tony and Amy falling into it; Tony is rescued but Amy is pulled underground. The Doctor surmises that someone is programming the ground to attack Amy and the others using technology usually seen on jungle planets. The group is soon alerted to the presence of three life forms travelling up the drilling shaft deep below the earth, and they barricade themselves in the church. The Doctor explains Amy's disappearance to Rory and assures him he will get her back. The three beings are discovered to be reptilian humanoids, and in a scuffle, they capture Mo's son Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back into the earth. The Doctor realises the beings are a new form of Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya; she was awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as do all Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as an act of war. The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce; Nasreen accompanies him. Amy awakens to find herself strapped to an examining table, near to where Mo is also ensnared. Mo explains that the Silurians \"dissected\" him, awake, and will do the same to Amy. The Doctor and Nasreen arrive underground in the TARDIS. The show ends on a cliffhanger as the Doctor and Nasreen behold an immense Silurian civilisation in the caverns below the earth."

        "content": "Steven Moffat contacted Chris Chibnall, asking him to return to writing for Doctor Who. Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episode \"42\" as well as episodes of the spin-off series Torchwood. Moffat and executive producer Piers Wenger gave him the brief of Silurians, a drill, and that it was a two-parter. The Silurians were villains who had previously appeared in the 1970 serial Doctor Who and the Silurians and the 1984 serial Warriors of the Deep. For research, Chibnall read the original novel Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters and watched the original serial, noting the freedom writer Malcolm Hulke took with the novel in things he could not have done in the television format. Chibnall wanted there to be a large Silurian city in contrast to the small human village on the surface. Knowing that the Silurians were not as popular and recurring as other villains, Moffat instructed Chibnall to bring the creatures to a new audience, and Chibnall decided to start out with knowing nothing about them and then introducing them in \"the most exciting and scary way possible for people who've never seen them before\". Chibnall also considered bringing back the Silurians' amphibious cousins the Sea Devils, but decided that doing two races of monster was much tougher and the story was \"so clearly about the Silurians and what the Silurians want\". Chibnall, having enjoyed when the Doctor and his companion were separated, made the decision for Amy to be absent for most of the episode. Moffat also thought that, at the point in the middle of the series, it was appropriate to show the Doctor behave differently with other people. A deleted scene, parts of which were shown on the accompanying behind-the-scenes show Doctor Who Confidential, was filmed, depicting Amy discussing with the Doctor how she had seen herself with Rory ten years in the future, and if that would really happen. With the absence of Amy, Chibnall thought that Nasreen became a \"de facto companion\". Meera Syal, who was cast as Nasreen, had been a fan of the series since childhood and had been trying to secure a role in the show since its revival in 2005 and was pleased when she received it. Syal described her character as \"a very high-up, innovative geologist\" who became good friends with the Doctor as the two admired each other's passion."

They were intended to be a different branch of the same species, and so the original Silurians still existed. Chibnall wrote for the redesigned Silurians to be beautiful and it was intended for the redesign to capture the actors' features and allow them to give stronger performances and differentiate themselves. Chibnall believed that it complemented the theme in the two-parter about how the humans and Silurians were alike and different. Due to the expensive prosthetics needed, extra Silurians wore face masks which prevented the need for every actor portraying a Silurian to receive the facial prosthetics. Chibnall also incorporated a poisonous tongue into the new branch of Silurians. \"The Hungry Earth\" and the second part, \"Cold Blood\" made up the fourth production block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno, Wales. In an interview, Syal stated that they did the location filming first. The drill itself was automatic and done by computer. For the scene in which Amy is dragged underneath the ground, Gillan stood on boxes and lowered herself into a stone compartment. Two pieces of rubber were at the opening of the compartment which expanded as she lowered herself down. A layer of soil was spread across the rubber; Gillan's ears were taped over to make sure the soil did not enter her ears. Gillan, initially scared at performing the stunt, put some of her fear and claustrophobia into the scene as she expected Amy felt the same way."

Dan Martin, writing for The Guardian, said that the episode set up an \"interesting quandary\" but, although many elements were introduced, \"not a lot actually seems to happen\". He was also critical of the family members and found he did not care about any of them besides Elliot and Nasreen, and although the scene in which Amy was pulled into the ground was \"effective and poignant\", it left a lack of \"Pond-life\" in the rest of the episode. However, he did commend the prosthetics department for their redesigned Silurians. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph was pleased that it \"didn't disappoint\" him. He praised the choice to show the Doctor's pacifism and Amy's few but memorable \"nightmarish\" scenes. However, he was not favourable to Meera Syal's performance and considered the Silurian's redesign too \"radical and divorced\" from their original appearance, most notably the absence of their third eye. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave the episode a positive review, saying that it felt \"like proper, classic Doctor Who\" in terms of  \"gripping storytelling, terrific pace, spooky direction, a grand idea...a small-scale Earth setting in the near future, characters worth caring about...plenty of meat for the three leads\" and \"a companion in real peril\". He particularly praised the performances of Syal and Smith. He also enjoyed the Silurian's redesign, saying that the old one \"would...look ridiculous today\". Though he \"missed\" the old voice from Peter Halliday, he said he adjusted to Neve McIntosh. AOL TV reviewer Brad Trechak was positive towards the comparisons that could be made between conflicts throughout history to the human-Silurian conflict, but called the episode a \"wasted opportunity\". He felt that it was \"more suspense and adventure than horror\", wishing that it was scarier, and also commented that it was \"very simplistic\" and did not re-introduce the Silurians as well as it would have, had they been part of the overall storyline. IGN's Matt Wales rated the episode 8 out of 10, assessing it as a \"slender but satisfying success\". He said that the narrative was \"simplistic\" without much depth, but that the \"strong supporting cast\" and \"sympathetic characters\" made it a \"refreshingly involving tale\". He also praised Smith's Doctor, who \"delivered admirably\" and carried out the show with the absence of Amy. Ian Berriman for SFX magazine gave the episode three out of five stars, mainly displeased with the redesign of the Silurians, although he was positive toward their \"venomous tongue lash\" and costume. He also criticised the \"clunky\" scripting and questioned some technical aspects. However, he praised the scene of Amy being dragged into the earth, as well as Alaya's hunt for Elliot in the graveyard and the interaction between the Doctor and Elliot."

Quentin Tarantino described the film as \"the best untold story ever\"; he also was a co-executive producer with Lucy Liu and Andy Vajna for the film."

        "content": "Breakout Kings is an American drama television series that aired on the A&E network. It is a production of Fox 21. The series was created, written, and executive-produced by Nick Santora and Matt Olmstead, who previously worked together on Prison Break.  Peter Chernin, Katherine Pope, and Gavin Hood also served as executive producers. Though the guest appearance of Prison Break character Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell confirms a shared continuity between the two series, it is not a direct spin-off. Frank Grillo, who recurred  in Prison Breaks first season as Nick Savrinn, appears in the episode \"Queen of Hearts\" as a different character named Agent Stoltz. The series premiered on March 6, 2011, and was the most-watched original drama series in A&E's history among adults 25\u201354 and adults 18\u201349, delivering 1.6 million adults 25\u201354 and 1.5 million adults 18\u201349. The series follows a task force assembled by the U.S. Marshals to capture prison escapees. Several current convicts are offered a chance to aid in this effort, with the promise of a transfer to a minimum-security prison and a reduction in their sentences for every fugitive they catch. However, if any of them tries to escape, they will all be returned to their original prisons and their sentences will be doubled. The series was picked up for a second season which premiered on March 4, 2012. The second-season finale aired on April 29, 2012, at 9\u00a0p.m. ET/PT and featured two back-to-back episodes, \"Freakshow\" and \"Served Cold\", instead of the usual one-hour installment at 10\u00a0p.m. A&E canceled Breakout Kings on May 17, 2012, after two seasons."

        "content": "Laz Alonso portrays Charlie Duchamp, a Deputy U.S. Marshal and head of the task force. He comes from the Department of Criminal Program Analysis and was assigned to a desk job for six years because of a congenital heart defect. He is under a great deal of pressure to produce results, since any failures in the task force would have led to his being permanently placed on desk work. In the season two premiere episode \"An Unjust Death\", Chief Inspector Craig Renner offers Charlie a promotion, but he turns it down for the sake of the team. He is killed by fugitive Damian Fontleroy near the end of the episode. Domenick Lombardozzi portrays Ray Zancanelli, a former Deputy U.S. Marshal who lost his job after he was convicted of stealing money from a crime scene to buy his daughter a car. This information is originally kept a secret from the other convicts until Shea (see below) overhears Charlie discussing it with Ray. He appears to be able to relate better with the convicts than Charlie because he has been in a position similar to theirs. Ray is on parole throughout season one, living at a halfway house, and has been appointed a Special Deputy U.S. Marshal. As such, he is allowed to carry a firearm, unlike the convicts. Ray is divorced, but maintains a good relationship with his daughter. Prior to his conviction, he came up with the idea for the task force. After Charlie's death, Chief Director Wendell reinstates Ray to his former position, having promised to do so if Charlie accepted a promotion. Malcolm Goodwin portrays Shea Daniels, a former gang leader whose criminal enterprises (drug smuggling, weapons trafficking, etc.) covered most of the United States. His experience and \"street smarts\" allow him to provide a working knowledge of how convicts think and move. He originally comes up with the name \"Breakout Kings\" for the task force and designs a graffiti-style logo for it. In the Season 1 episode \"One for the Money\", he tells his girlfriend Vanessa that he cannot wait for another six years to get out of prison to be with her and that there is another way, but Vanessa replies, \"We can't be fugitives again.\" Serinda Swan portrays Erica Reed, a bounty hunter and expert tracker. She was raised by her father, who himself was a bounty hunter. He was tortured and killed in retaliation for the capture of a gang member, and Erica hunted down and killed five of the six people involved in the murder. Barely 20 at the time, she killed her victims and hid their bodies so flawlessly that she was only convicted of weapons charges. She has a daughter who currently resides with the child's father but she has little to no contact with her, despite her desire to be more involved with her. The murder of her father and the loss of her daughter causes her great pain and anger. In season two, she shows romantic interest in a neighbor Pete Gillies who works on the second floor of their building. She even sleeps with him at some occasions without the team knowing about it. She has proven to be an excellent athlete as well. In season 2 episode 7 she takes down a man three times her size, after he insulted her father, before the man could get a hit on her. Jimmi Simpson portrays Dr. Lloyd Lowery, a former child prodigy and a behaviorist with a bachelor's degree (1993) and M.D. (1997) from Harvard. He provides in-depth psychological evaluations of escaped convicts, which allow him to predict the movements and actions that an escaped convict may undertake before they get away. Lloyd also provides psychological help to Julianne and Erica on their various mental problems whenever possible. Ironically, Lloyd suffers from an addiction to gambling. His crime is not mentioned for most of the series, until he has to confront the families of one of his victims. To cover his gambling debts, he sold illegal prescriptions to college students, and took a plea bargain to surrender his medical license and serve 25 years in prison rather than face the parents of an 18-year-old girl with depression who overdosed on the pills he sold her. Throughout the series he has romantic feelings for Julianne and was at one point jealous of her feelings for Ray. In the episode \"Ain't Love (50) Grand?\", he told her that he is in love with her. Brooke Nevin portrays Julianne Simms, a former student at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. She was first in her class until she was expelled for her various psychological disorders which include social anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. Julianne acts as an analyst, researching and determining the various resources at the disposal of the convicts; such as family, money, and property they may use to aid their escape. She and Ray have a close relationship, even at one point showing romantic interest in Ray. As he was there for her when she was expelled, he requested that she be assigned to the task force. Julianne and Lloyd share a very friendly relationship since Lloyd willfully attempts to help her overcome her disorders. In turn Julianne cares for Lloyd and considers him a very important friend."

The Daily News David Hinckley opened, \"This is what cable dramas can do well: a simple, stripped-down, focused drama with characters we like.\" Jonathan Storm of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \"Breakout Kings, an exciting crime drama that adds to its appeal with some character types we don't often see, will attract a much wider audience, as our flawed heroes seek to round up escapees.\" Mary McNamara of Los Angeles Times opined that \"Breakout Kings starts out with a promising blend of character and plot, action and dialog, sweet and savory\". Maureen Ryan of Huffington Post opined that it \"isn't a particularly creative drama but, as was the case with Prison Break in its early seasons, Breakout Kings is sustained by a workmanlike momentum. It has its share of clunky characters and predictable moments, but it also has a lot of earnest energy. It's enlivened by a terrific performance from Jimmi Simpson, who plays Lloyd Lowery, the show's all-purpose weirdo.\" Rob Owen of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote, \"There are no television breakthroughs in Breakout Kings, a pretty pat procedural that tries a little harder than some of its predecessors. It has all the hallmarks of one of those shows that nobody talks about but plenty of people watch.\" Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter opined, \"Kings is mostly closed-ended with snippets of each con's past revealed in the episodes, so there's enough interest to keep the show moving. The leads' backstories might have some meat on the bone as well. It's not The Wire or The Shield but falls comfortably within that basic-cable safe zone where a little edge and bountiful entertainment pass the time just fine.\" On the contrary, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post opined, \"It doesn't work. There's a bit of banter well-delivered and some artful action, yet Breakout Kings lacks a certain vim and chemistry required for a real breakout series. It's all very quick but rather flavorless. They'll catch the escapee, no doubt, but they can't catch us.\" Robert Bianco of USA Today opined, \"Breakout Kings is an uninspiring attempt by the producers and their network to be the last on the procedural match. It's stamped with many of the Prison hallmarks: the same affection for intricate plot mechanics, the same flair for the dramatic\u2014and the same disdain for logic and character motivation.\" Variety'''s Brian Lowry wrote, \"The premise doesn't really make much sense. It's a tough, competitive cable world out there, and as the cons might testify, coming away with a big score requires risks. By that measure, Breakout Kings doesn't do enough to stand apart, diminishing its chances of breaking out.\" Brian Ford Sullivan from The Futon Critic reviewed Breakout Kings in June 2010, calling the show a \"violent version of Leverage with colorful characters and a great performance by Jimmi Simpson as Dr. Lloyd Lowery, but with some inconsistencies like the character of Brooke Nevin and a bunch of ideas that don't quite fit.\" To garner more publicity, the network screened the show for a number of reviewers in the weeks prior to official airing. One such review came out on SpoilerTV on February 22, 2011 and echoed Sullivan's initial problems with characterization and writing. Indications were that Breakout Kings seems to suffer from rough writing in the pilot, but there was slight improvement in a subsequent episode. However, the overall impression was that the flaws of the show may handicap its success. Echoing these issues, FlickDirect'' review points out that character background or explanation is lacking in many cases."

        "content": "Teenage friends Will McKenzie (Simon Bird),Simon Cooper (Joe Thomas), Jay Cartwright (James Buckley) and Neil Sutherland (Blake Harrison) have just finished their A-levels and are about to leave Rudge Park Comprehensive, much to the relief of their sardonic head of sixth form, Mr Gilbert. Within their final week of school, Jay's grandfather dies; Simon is dumped by his girlfriend Carli D'Amato; Neil is in a relationship with a girl he works beside at ASDA called Nicole and Will's estranged father tells him that he has married his much younger mistress (who was responsible for Will's parents' divorce and is only four years older than Will). To celebrate leaving school, the boys decide to go on a \"lads holiday\" together to Malia, Crete. The boys arrive and are at first put off by their shabby hotel. They venture out to the night time bars where they meet a strange lone man named Richard who tries to befriend the boys and asks them for a can of beer before they reject him. In the town centre, the boys are tricked by an attractive rep into visiting a deserted bar. In there, they meet a group of four girls who were on their bus from the airport: Alison, Lucy, Lisa, and Jane. Their initial meeting does not go smoothly, after the boys first embarrass themselves by dancing comically in an attempt to impress the girls, their conversations with them are equally inadequate; Jay is put off by Jane due to her weight, whilst Simon is too busy talking obsessively about Carli to Lucy to notice her attraction towards him and Neil is mostly silent and dances briefly with Lisa before going off with a portly, middle-aged Northern woman. Will and Alison seem to get on quite well, sharing similar personality traits, however Alison is already in a relationship with a local Greek waiter called Nicos. Despite this, the girls arrange to meet the boys at the girl's hotel the next day. Outside the bar, Simon sees Carli across the street and is at first uncontrollably overjoyed, until he's knocked down by a quad bike driven by Carli's new love interest, James, a cocky, arrogant club rep. Carli reveals that she is going to an all-day boat party later in the week as part of her last day in Malia, and Simon promises to meet her there. While he is happy to see Carli, Simon is still trying to get over his heartbreak from her and is annoyed at Neil after finding out that Neil chose Malia as their holiday destination after Carli told him that she was planning to go. Will and Simon head back to the hotel, whilst Jay and Neil continue partying at the bars. The next day, Will and Simon awaken to the noise of Neil having oral sex from the same middle-aged Northern woman and find Jay has fallen asleep outside on top of an ant hill. The boys meet the girls at their hotel, but after Jay throws a family's towels off their reserved sun beds, along with Will accidentally insulting a family with a wheelchair-using daughter in one of his classic rants, and then Jay throwing an annoying nine-year old Greek boy who couldn\u2019t swim into the pool, they are kicked out. Jay and Simon get into an angered argument over Simon's continuing obsession with Carli and Jay's continual false claims over sexual experiences and they comically brawl in the street, to the amusement of bystanders, until Will and Neil separate the pair. Desperate to buy a ticket for the boat party to try to reconcile with Carli, Simon naively sells all of his clothes to James, including the clothes that he is wearing, but receives no payment for it after waiting hours for him to \"return\" despite Will's objections and the obvious deceit. Meanwhile, it's revealed Jay had bought four boat party tickets the previous night, but he angrily tears up Simon and Will's after the fight. He and Neil later go to a club where they encounter James and his friends and try to befriend them, but James verbally abuses the pair and even threatens Jay, forcing them to leave. Later that evening, the four boys meet back at the empty bar and make up; Simon borrows clothing from the others for the rest of the trip. The girls then turn up and Will and Alison, Simon and Lucy and Jay and Jane all start to grow close to each other while Neil disappears with another older woman. The girls then suggest that they all go skinny dipping at the local beach. Jane attempts to kiss Jay, but when two nearby men poke fun at her being overweight and Jay pulls away embarrassed, she leaves him behind, visibly upset and angered. Alison vows to Will that if she was single later on, she would date him. They share a brief moment of intimacy as they strip naked before Alison takes off Will's glasses and goes into the sea. While trying to find them, Will accidentally stumbles upon her boyfriend, Nicos, having sex with another woman and Alison leaves, distraught. In the sea, Lucy and Simon are about to kiss, but Simon sees Carli on the beach and leaves Lucy alone in the sea, angering her. With all the girls having left in disgust, the boys, feeling down, decide to go out to various bars and clubs and get drunk, starting a trend with their classic elbow dance. The following day is the all-day boat party. The group meet the girls again at the beach, where Alison reconciles with a severely hungover Will and she gives him Nicos' ticket to join her on the boat. Elsewhere, Simon apologises to Lucy. She offers him her boat party ticket so that he can be with Carli; although Simon once again fails to notice her attraction to him and snatches her ticket abruptly, leaving her behind. On board, Simon witnesses an argument between Carli and James. Carli then kisses Simon passionately, and he is elated, until he realises that she is just using him to make James jealous. Finally seeing Carli for her true colours, he leaves her. While it is Carli's last day in Malia, she tells him she will still see him at family events before he says goodbye. Meanwhile, Will and Alison admit their feelings toward each other and Jay apologises to Jane and both start a relationship. Neil meets Richard whose parents came after he had a breakdown and introduces them to Neil before Lisa interrupts and they too begin a relationship although Lisa feels bad about Neil's girlfriend, but he tells her Nicole had dumped him before the holiday and that he was too embarrassed to tell the others. Later, Jay and Jane encounter James who mocks Jane's weight and demands a banknote from Jay so that he can snort cocaine. Jay gets revenge on him by giving James a \u20ac20 note that was secretly concealed in his anus for bribing \"corrupt foreign police\"; as a result, James snorts cocaine, unknowingly walking around with faeces stuck to the end of his nose causing the girls whom he flirts with to walk away from him in disgust, much to his confusion. Simon finally sees that Lucy is more worthy of his attention than Carli, and knowing that he has been less than kind to her, he decides, on encouragement from both the boys and girls, to swim back to shore as a romantic gesture. However, he nearly drowns on the way there. Nevertheless, as he is loaded into an air ambulance and taken back to the beach, Lucy kisses him and they reconcile. During the final credits, the four boys and the girls all spend the rest of their holiday together as couples. When the holiday ends, upon their return to England, the group say goodbye at Gatwick Airport in tears (although the girls aren't) and they introduce the girls to their parents; it is then revealed that Neil lied about his break-up with Nicole, as he quickly runs away with Lisa, after spotting her having come to meet him. In a mid-credits scene, a drunken Mr. Gilbert is seen riding a quad bike through the streets of Malia in his boxer shorts with a tie tied around his head in John Rambo style."

Ian Freer of Empire gave the film four stars out of five, observing that \"Like any holiday, it is episodic and suffers from repetition but this is gag-for-gag the funniest film of the summer and a fitting end to a much-loved series.\" Steve Rose of The Guardian gave the film three stars out of five, giving particular praise to Simon Bird's performance and arguing that the film \"updates the teen summer holiday formula surprisingly entertainingly, considering it doesn't subvert its one iota and the formula was already done previously with Holiday on the Buses and Kevin & Perry Go Large among others.\" Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph also gave a positive assessment of the film, praising it as \"an enormous hit, a Mamma Mia! for the Hangover demographic.\" Screen Daily, on the other hand, gave a mixed review, praising the performances of the main cast and proclaiming the film \"Britain\u2019s delayed riposte to American Pie\", yet simultaneously arguing that it \"can't quite shake off its TV roots, and plot-wise, this is nothing the Greek tourist board would want to advertise.\" Australian critic Margaret Pomeranz from At the Movies called the characters \"gormless\" and said, \"I'm giving this one star really generously.\" She also said that the style of humour in the film was the reason that the British Empire collapsed."

        "content": "\"The Rebel Flesh\" is the fifth episode of the sixth series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast on 21 May 2011 on BBC One and on BBC America in the United States. It is the first episode of a two-part story written by Matthew Graham and directed by Julian Simpson, concluded in \"The Almost People\". In the episode, the TARDIS is hit by a solar storm, sending the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) to a monastery on an island on Earth in the 22nd century, which has been converted into a factory to pump acid off the island. To prevent death from the acid, the workers have utilised a \"programmable matter\" called the Flesh, which creates a doppelg\u00e4nger (called \"Ganger\") controlled by the worker. As the solar storm hits, the Gangers become independent, and the Doctor, Amy and Rory must work to prevent the two groups from breaking into a war. Showrunner Steven Moffat specifically asked Graham to write the episodes about \"avatars that rebel\", although the Flesh and the monastery were Graham's original ideas. The episode was filmed in the late months of 2010 with some location filming at Caerphilly Castle to represent the monastery. Prosthetics were used to create the Gangers' facial features, while doubles of the actors were used for scenes in which a character and their Ganger were both in a scene, but did not both show their face. The episode was seen by 7.35 million viewers in the UK and achieved an Appreciation Index of 85. Reviewers were generally positive about the episode; some praised the setting and characters but others commented that the story had not developed enough even though it was only the first part. The computer-generated effects used for one scene were also disapproved of by a couple of reviewers."

        "content": "The TARDIS is caught in the first waves of a \"solar tsunami\" and materialises on Earth in the 22nd century. The Eleventh Doctor, Amy and Rory find themselves on a remote island, where a factory housed in a former castle monastery pumps a valuable, highly corrosive acid to the mainland. The skeleton crew of the factory uses a self-replicating fluid called the Flesh from which they create doppelg\u00e4ngers of themselves, colloquially called \"Gangers\". The crew control the Gangers from special harnesses to operate in the hazardous environment of the factory. The Doctor, initially posing as a weatherman, fears the worst part of the solar tsunami will strike the solar-powered factory soon, threatening those still remaining, and offers to take the crew in his TARDIS. The foreman, Miranda Cleaves, refuses to shut down the factory until she receives orders from the mainland. As the solar storm begins, the Doctor races to disconnect the solar collector, but the tsunami hits the castle, throwing the Doctor off the tower and knocking everyone inside unconscious for an hour. When the crew awaken, they find themselves out of the control beds with no sign of the Gangers. They soon discover that the Gangers have gained sentience and two Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer, when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond natural human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills a Ganger. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Against Amy's wishes, Rory separates from the group to find Jennifer. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor."

        "content": "Matthew Graham was originally to write a single episode for the previous series, but withdrew because he did not have enough time to write the script. He then received an e-mail from showrunner Steven Moffat, who asked him to write for the next series; Graham agreed. When the two met, Moffat said he would like the episodes to lead into the mid-series finale and that it should deal with \"avatars that rebel\". Initially worried this may seem too similar to the film Avatar, Graham went on to create the Flesh. Graham wanted the Gangers to be scary, but not monsters who wanted \"to take over the world for the sake of it\". He wanted them to appear relatable to the audience as they were humans who deserved rights. Moffat suggested that the avatars work in a factory; attempting to make it different from other factories featured in Doctor Who, Graham proposed to set the story in a monastery, an idea of which Moffat greatly approved. The monastery was inspired by the film The Name of the Rose, while the Gangers were influenced by The Thing; Graham described it as \"The Thing in the context of The Name of the Rose\". In the early drafts of the script, there were \"so many copies of people running around the place\" which made the story too confusing, so Graham and the production crew worked to make it more rational. The episode also contains a subplot in which Rory helps and protects Jennifer as she is scared and affected by the Gangers, which proved a twist in Amy and Rory's relationship. Actor Karen Gillan enjoyed the twist. Amy had previously always had Rory \"in the palm of her hand\" and a different side of the character was shown as she experienced the same emotions Rory felt when she seemed interested in the Doctor. Actor Arthur Darvill also thought it gave Rory a chance to \"man up\" and be a hero by protecting someone."

The cold temperatures at the time were a challenge and caused discomfort. The crew were concerned that the cast, particularly the three lead actors, would fall ill as their costumes were not designed for such weather conditions. Even so, the cast remained healthy. Scenes outside and inside the monastery were filmed at Caerphilly Castle, previously used in Doctor Who in \"The End of Time\" and \"The Vampires of Venice\". The actors each played their respective Gangers, with prosthetics applied to their faces for when the duplicates' faces reverted to the original material of the Flesh. Moffat wanted the Gangers to appear like \"eyeball matter\": white with small capillaries running through them. For the scenes in which both the character and their respective Ganger was in the same shot, a double for each of the actors was used. Most of the shots showed either the character or their Ganger speaking over their counterpart's shoulder, as only the backs of the doubles' head were made to look similar to the actors. The episode also contains several tracks of contemporary music. In the beginning when Amy and Rory are playing darts inside in the TARDIS and the Doctor runs a pregnancy scan on Amy, the song \"Supermassive Black Hole\" by Muse is playing in the background. The Gangers also play \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\" by Dusty Springfield."

        "content": "\"The Rebel Flesh\" received generally positive reviews by critics. Dan Martin, writing for The Guardian, said that \"The Rebel Flesh\" \"is particularly satisfying\" though it seemed that not much had happened due to its being the first part of a two-part story. He praised Graham's \"believable world\" and \"well-drawn\" characters of Cleaves, Buzzer and Jennifer. He later rated it the seventh best episode of the series, though the finale was not included in the list. The Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller called it \"a very traditional-style Doctor Who story\". He noted that Matt Smith gave a more restrained performance that suited the feel of the episode, and also praised the advantage taken with the location filming for the monastery. Radio Times critic Patrick Mulkern considered the episode to be an improvement from Graham's only other Doctor Who episode, \"Fear Her\", though it had \"failed to enthral\" him. In contrast to Martin, Mulkern said that Graham's characters were not \"showing many life signs yet\" with the exception of Jennifer, who was \"marginally sympathetic\". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 8 out of 10, saying it delivered \"a solid and traditional Whovian tale, albeit one at its best\", though it was \"nothing groundbreaking\" yet. He went on to praise the supporting cast that \"managed to sell both their flawed human originals and their progressively bonkers ganger counterparts\" as well as the setting. However, he questioned Rory's willingness to protect Jennifer, as he thought Rory would have learned from his experiences with death to be more careful. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy gave the episode four out of five stars, saying that \"The Rebel Flesh\" \"strikes a satisfying balance between the humorous and the horrific\" from the cold open. He commended Graham for handling the two-part structure by using extra time to explore the characters and themes, and thought the highlight of the episode were Rory's scenes with Jennifer. However, he criticised the CGI used in some scenes, although he called the prosthetics used for the Gangers \"impressive\", as well as the episode for ending in \"a damp squib of a cliffhanger\" that was \"clearly too telegraphed throughout the episode\". SFX magazine reviewer Richard Edwards gave the episode four out of five stars, saying it \"looks fantastic\" and praised choice of the abbey as the factory, which blew \"the clich\u00e9 of a futuristic industrial setting apart immediately, and [made] you feel like you\u2019re watching something new.\" Like Jeffery, he said the visual effects were \"generally pretty good\" but criticised the CGI used for Jennifer's special abilities. Keith Phipps on The A.V. Club graded it as a \"B\" and called it \"just a pretty good episode\". His complaint was that it \"truly [felt] like half a story in the way the best Doctor Who two-parters don't\", though he said it managed to plant intriguing strands for the conclusion."

        "content": "In London, 1837, Queen Victoria is told that England rules the entire ocean, with the exception of the pirates, whom she despises. Meanwhile, the Pirate Captain leads a close-knit group of amateur pirates who are trying to make a name for themselves on the high seas. To prove his worth, the Captain enters the annual Pirate of the Year competition, the winner being whoever can plunder the most gold. After several failed attempts to plunder mundane ships, they come across HMS Beagle and capture its lone passenger, Charles Darwin, who recognizes the crew's pet \"parrot,\" Polly, as the last living dodo. Darwin recommends that they enter her in the Scientist of the Year competition at the Royal Society of London in hopes of impressing Queen Victoria, his love interest. The pirates disguise themselves as scientists to enter the competition, and the dodo display wins the top prize, which turns out to be a meeting with the Queen. The Captain hides Polly just before the meeting. She requests that Polly be put in her petting zoo, but the Captain refuses and accidentally reveals his true identity. The Queen orders him executed, but Darwin steps in to spare the Captain's life, telling the Queen that only he knows where Polly is hidden. The Queen pardons the Captain and orders Darwin to find Polly by any means necessary. Darwin takes the Captain to a tavern with Mr. Bobo, his trained chimpanzee, and they steal the bird. The Pirate Captain chases them into the Tower of London, where the Queen is waiting. She dismisses Darwin and instead offers the Pirate Captain enough treasure to ensure his win as Pirate of the Year in exchange for Polly. He accepts the offer and returns to his crew, assuring them Polly is still safe in his beard. At the Pirate of the Year ceremony, the Captain is announced as the winner, but rival pirate Black Bellamy reveals the Queen's pardon and explains that if pardoned, then one is no longer a pirate and, as such, cannot be Pirate of the Year. The Captain is stripped of his treasure and pirate attire and admits the loss of Polly to his crew, who abandon him. The Captain returns to London and decides to rescue Polly. He reunites with Darwin, learning that the Queen is a member of an exclusive society of world leaders that feast on endangered creatures, and that Polly is to be served at their next banquet. The Pirate Captain and Darwin work together to steal an airship and find the Queen's flagship, the QV1, while Mr. Bobo sets out to find the rest of the Captain's crew to enlist their help. Aboard the QV1, the Queen locates the Captain and Darwin and attempts to kill both of them, but Mr. Bobo and the crew come to the rescue and defeat her. They accidentally mix the ship's stash of baking soda with vinegar, causing a violent reaction that breaks the ship in two. The Captain rescues Polly and they escape safely, leaving behind the furious Queen. His action earns him the highest bounty known to pirates, 100,000 Doubloon bounty placed on his head by the Queen, restoring his pirate reputation as well as marking him as the most dangerous pirate alive. the Pirate Captain and his crew continue to explore the high seas in search of adventure. In the credit, Black Bellamy jealously looks at the new bounty of the Pirate Captain resulting in the loss of his newfound award."

Band of Misfits, as Defoe's books don't have \"the same following outside of the United Kingdom\", so it was not necessary to keep the original title. Hugh Grant, the voice of The Pirate Captain, said that the studio \"didn't think the Americans would like the longer title\". Response from the director of the film, Peter Lord, was that \"some people reckoned the United Kingdom title wouldn't charm / amuse / work in the United States. Tricky to prove eh?\" Quentin Cooper of the BBC analysed the change of the title and listed several theories. One of them is that the British audience is more tolerant for the eccentricity of the British animators. Another is that the film makers did not want to challenge the United States viewers who do not accept the theory of evolution. He also developed his own explanation, in which he notes that the word \"scientist\" is rarely used in the Hollywood films due to it not being \"cool\", representing \"the mad scientist or the dweeby nerd that dress funny, have no social skills, play video games, long for unattainable women\"."

        "content": "During a break from their travels with the Eleventh Doctor, his companions Amy and Rory are sent envelopes summoning them to Utah at a specific time and location. They arrive to meet River Song (who also received an envelope) and the Doctor, who is nearly 200 years older than he was when he last saw Amy and Rory. He offers them a picnic, and then a trip to \"space 1969\". During the picnic, a figure from the lake in an American astronaut suit shoots the Doctor multiple times and his body falls. A man with a can of gasoline called Canton Everett Delaware III arrives, telling Amy, Rory, and River that the dead man is the real Doctor. The Doctor's body is burned in a Viking funeral. Amy, Rory, and River talk at a diner when they discover the fourth envelope was sent to the Doctor, alive and 200 years younger than the one at the lake. The Doctor's companions tell him about space 1969 and Canton, but refuse to tell him about his death or that the sender is the Doctor himself. The Doctor and his companions travel back to 8 April 1969, where the younger Canton, a former FBI operative, is briefed by President Richard Nixon about a series of phone calls Nixon received from a young girl asking for help. The Doctor arrives in Washington, DC and convinces Nixon to give him a few minutes to locate the girl. Based on the phone call and the girl's mention of a \"spaceman\", he tracks down the Florida intersection where the girl is located. Meanwhile, Amy meets and takes a photograph of one of the leaders of the Silence, a group she also saw by the lake which people forget about any time someone stops looking at them. Canton follows the Doctor and the others into the TARDIS as they depart for Florida. Upon arrival at the building where the girl is held, they find pieces of a space suit and alien technology. River and Rory explore a vast network of tunnels that have apparently spread across the planet for centuries, unnoticed by the human population and populated by the Silence. Finding Canton unconscious near a figure in a space suit, Amy picks up Canton's gun and shoots at the suit. However, she realises too late that the helmet's visor has opened to reveal the little girl."

        "content": "The episode was written by Steven Moffat, who took charge of the show in 2010. Moffat wanted the 2011 season to start with a two-part story in an attempt to begin with more gravity and a wider scope in plot, as well as wanting the episodes to be one of the darker ones in the series. \"The Impossible Astronaut\" / \"Day of the Moon\" was the first two-part episode to open a series since the 1985 Sixth Doctor story Attack of the Cybermen. In the Doctor Who Confidential episode following the broadcast of \"The Impossible Astronaut,\" Moffat stated that in his view, it was one of the darker episodes of the series, but still maintained the same level of humour. The inclusion of the Doctor's death felt like a series ender for some of the producers, but was actually there to \"kick it off.\" In writing the death scene of the older version of the Doctor, Moffat wanted to acknowledge to the audience that Time Lords are not invincible, and could still die permanently if killed before regeneration. In creating the Silence, the alien antagonists of the episode, Moffat wanted them to challenge past monsters in terms of \"scariness.\" He felt these creatures are a \"much bigger deal.\" The aliens' design was partially inspired by the figure from the Edvard Munch painting The Scream."

Sheppard described playing Canton as a \"dream job,\" and said he wished to appear in another of Moffat's works, including Sherlock. Even though Sheppard is an English actor, it was his first appearance in a British-made television show. For the scene depicting the older Canton Delaware, the producers originally planned that Sheppard would appear older using makeup effects. However, Sheppard suggested instead that his father and actor, William Morgan Sheppard, play the role, a suggestion that was accepted. American actor Stuart Milligan was cast as President Nixon, which he said he found exciting, having played other presidents in the past, including Dwight D. Eisenhower. Prosthetic pieces were applied on Milligan's cheeks, nose, and ears to make him resemble Nixon as much as possible. He also practiced how Nixon would speak, but initially found it difficult since he had to wear fake teeth. Milligan previously appeared in the animated Tenth Doctor special Dreamland as the voice of Colonel Stark. Chuk Iwuji, who played Carl, previously appeared in the Seventh Doctor audio drama A Thousand Tiny Wings, where he played Joshua Sembeke."

        "content": "This pair of episodes marks the first time that Doctor Who has filmed principal photography footage within the United States; the American-produced TV movie of 1996 was filmed in Canada, and some second unit establishing shots of New York and the Statue of Liberty were filmed on Liberty Island for the episode \"Daleks in Manhattan\", but none of the cast of the episode were involved in the shoot. Filming took place in the state of Utah. For the opening shot for the location, director Toby Haynes wanted it to be epic so that the audience could recognise where the episode was set. Scenes on the roadway were filmed on U.S. Route 163 (several miles east of the coordinates listed on the Doctor's invitations). The crew wanted to add as many American icons as they could into those shots, including a Stetson hat, a 1950s Edsel Villager, and a yellow school bus. Moffat, having enjoyed writing episodes featuring River Song, wanted to give her an impressive entrance. Haynes had actress Alex Kingston block the sunlight from the camera angle and blow smoke from her revolver. The scenes involving the picnic and the future-Doctor dying took place on the shore of Lake Powell. The suit worn by the future-Doctor's killer was a fabricated replica of an Apollo space suit. In filming the death scene the filming crew noticed that Karen Gillan was genuinely upset and \"was acting her heart out.\" In filming the \"Viking funeral\" scene, Haynes wished to film it during the sunset. However, the sun set over the desert, so was instead filmed during sunrise, as the sun rose over the water. Kingston had to genuinely slap Matt Smith several times in a scene because it was difficult to fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence over and over again. The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with the Doctor in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen."

        "content": "The episode was met with generally positive reviews from television critics. Dan Martin of The Guardian reacted positively towards the episode, believing the cast performed better than the previous fifth series. He stated \"Steven Moffat has thrown away the rule book and made Doctor Who as, you imagine, he's pictured it should be his whole life. Killing the Doctor leaves the shape of the series mapped out, raises the bar so that no one is safe, and sees Amy, Rory and River facing a terrible dilemma.\" Martin liked that \"Amy's numbed horror ramps things up to a series-finale level on intensity from the off,\" and then switches \"into an Oval Office comedy of manners,\" and \"morphs into gothic horror and finally flings you to the ground with its cinematic cliffhanger.\" He was also positive towards the American setting, and \"our eccentric British foursome bumbling through it,\" believing the series raised its game with this. With regards to the Silence, Martin believed it was \"a standard Moffat psychological trick, but the most refined to date.\" Martin later rated it the second best episode of the series, though the finale was not included in the list. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy called the episode \"a fantastic launch for the sixth series,\" adding \"the Doctor Who team's US location shooting has certainly paid off, lending these early scenes a grand scale that the series could scarcely have expected to achieve in 2005, let alone in 1963.\" Commenting on the future-Doctor's death, Jeffery said \"seven minutes in, a nation's collective jaw dropped as The Doctor\u00a0\u2014 this show's lead\u00a0\u2014 is mercilessly gunned down. This plot twist is simply stunning, and it's difficult to imagine even casual viewers not sitting up to pay attention at this point.\" Jeffery also believed that the series regulars were on \"top form,\" adding \"the more abrasive aspects of Amy Pond's personality seem to have been toned down this year, and Karen Gillan responds with her best, most sympathetic performance to date. Arthur Darvill also lives up to his recent promotion to full-time companion. His comic timing is simply superb, but he excels too in the episode's darker moments.\" Jeffery rated the episode five stars out of five. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph believed it was \"a cracking start to the first part of the 2011 series, with the shocking ending of Amy seemingly shooting a girl making one keen wait for the conclusion next week to see how it all resolves itself,\" as well as enjoying the concept of the Silence. Rick Marshall of MTV believed that \"Steven Moffat and the Doctor Who crew offer up yet another great episode,\" but also said the \"big cliffhanger will likely cause more than a few fans' heads to explode.\" In addition, Marshall believed the alien antagonists \"give the Weeping Angels a run for their money in scare factor.\" Simon Brew of Den of Geek thought the episode was \"a triumphant return for Doctor Who, bubbling with confidence and throwing down story strands that hint at an engrossing series.\" Brew liked Sheppard's performance as Delaware and Darvill's increasing presence as Rory. Brew also complimented Haynes' work in the United States, saying it was an improvement from \"Daleks in Manhattan\", which featured British actors attempting to play with American accents. Tom Phillips of Metro said the 1969 US setting were \"beautifully used,\" and enjoyed the \"spookiness\" of the Silence. However Phillips felt the episode would be \"a bit hard to get into\" for new viewers. Kevin O'Sullivan of The Sunday Mirror was more negative towards the episode, stating it was \"impossible to understand,\" and for \"strictly sci-fi nerds only,\" adding that Smith \"remains a derivative Doctor who brings nothing new to the party.\""

Written by show runner Steven Moffat, and directed by Toby Haynes, the episode was first broadcast on 30 April 2011 on BBC One in the United Kingdom and on BBC America in the United States. The episode is the second of a two-part story that began with \"The Impossible Astronaut\" on 23 April.

Moffat was keen on incorporating Area 51, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, and President Richard Nixon (played by Stuart Milligan) into the plot.

While the Doctor alters part of the Command Module Columbia of Apollo 11, Canton and Amy visit a nearby orphanage in Florida, hoping to find where the girl in the space suit was taken from. The Silence kidnaps Amy, taking her to an underground control room. Canton shoots and wounds one of the creatures, and from it the Doctor learns the Silence's name. Analysing the now-empty space suit, River realises that the girl possesses incredible strength to have forced her way out of it, and that the suit's advanced life-support technology would have called President Richard Nixon as the highest authority figure on Earth when the girl got scared. The Doctor realises why the Silence have been controlling humanity; by guiding their technological advances, they have influenced humanity into the Space Race for purposes of building a space suit, which must somehow be crucial to their intentions. Meanwhile, Canton interrogates the captured Silence member, who mocks humanity for treating him when \"...you should kill us all on sight\". Canton records this using Amy's mobile phone. The Doctor tracks down Amy's location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live broadcast of the Moon landing. As they watch, the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module Columbia to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silence member into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence in the control room. Amy, telling the Doctor that while she is not pregnant, she worries that if she is pregnant, her travels in the TARDIS might affect her child's development. As the trio sets off, the Doctor discreetly uses the TARDIS scanner to attempt to determine if Amy is pregnant. Six months later, the girl in the space suit is in New York, dying.

        "content": "Steven Moffat, head writer of the new series, said before broadcast that this would be one of the darkest openers to a series ever done for Doctor Who. Director Toby Haynes believed that the darker episodes like \"The Impossible Astronaut\" and \"Day of the Moon\" would allow the series to get into \"more dangerous territory.\" The creation of the Silence was partly inspired by the figure from Edvard Munch's 1893 painting The Scream. Introducing the alien villains became a \"big challenge\" for the producers; it would tie in with the loose \"silence will fall\" arc that carried through the fifth series. Moffat did not wish to end the arc in the previous series, as he felt it would be \"more fun\" to continue it. Elsewhere in the episode, Delaware was written to be deceptively antagonistic towards the protagonists, which was based on actor Mark Sheppard's past as villains for his work in American television. Moffat was also keen on the idea of having the Doctor imprisoned with a beard in Area 51. Smith wore a glued-on beard, which was difficult to peel off. Incorporating Nixon into the plot was accidental; Moffat wanted to set the story during the Moon landing and looked up the United States president during the time. He was initially disappointed that it was such a \"rubbish one\" and briefly considered using a generic, unnamed president, such as the one seen in \"The Sound of Drums\". However, he thought it \"didn't feel right for a story partly about real events\" and realised it could be fun to use Nixon. He believed there was something \"comically awkward\" about him, and it would be interesting for the Doctor to have to work with someone he did not like. The episode makes references to the Watergate scandal and David Frost. Many of the opening scenes of the episode were filmed on location in the United States. The sequence where Delaware chases Amy was shot in the Valley of the Gods in Utah. Gillan found it difficult to run because of the altitude. The scene in which Amy confronts Canton was originally watched by three Silence in the script, but this did not make it to the film version. The sequence where Delaware chases Rory was shot at the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona. The Dam sequence was the final scene to be shot in the States. \"The Impossible Astronaut\" and \"Day of the Moon\" marked the first time that Doctor Who has filmed principal photography footage within the United States. The sequence where Delaware chases River in New York City was shot in central Cardiff. A set was later constructed in a studio for the jump sequence, and Kingston was replaced by a stunt woman to perform the jump. The scenes set in Area 51 were filmed in a large disused hangar in South Wales. The Florida orphanage was filmed at the abandoned Troy House in Monmouthshire. To add the effect that a storm is outside the building, the production crew placed rain machines outdoors and flashing lights to simulate lightning. The Silence were portrayed by Marnix van den Broeke and other performers. The masks caused vision difficulties for the performers, who had to be guided by two people when they had to walk. Van den Broeke did not provide the voices of the Silence, as it was replaced during post-production. The control room set used from \"The Lodger\" was used again for this episode. Moffat wanted the set to be used again, feeling it would be a suitable Silence base. The set was adapted to give it a darker, evil feel."

He later rated it the fourth best episode of the series, though the finale was not included in the list. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy stated \"after the sensational opening gambit that kicked off the series premiere, it's perhaps unsurprising that 'Day of the Moon' starts with a similarly thrilling onslaught of action.\" Jeffery was positive towards the nano-recorder, which provided the episode with \"a number of unsettling moments in which characters listen back to their own terrified exclamations about the Silents.\" However, Jeffery felt the final scenes \"expose this episode's chief flaw\u00a0\u2014 quite simply, too much is left unresolved.\" In conclusion, the reviewer stated \"While 'The Impossible Astronaut' aced the set-up, 'Day of the Moon' falters slightly in providing the resolution.\" Jeffery rated the episode four stars out of five.

He gave the episode a rating of four out of five stars. IGN reviewer Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10, saying it \"maintained the thrills, chills and scalp-scratching plot twists of \"The Impossible Astronaut\", whilst somehow tweaking its predecessor's thundering pace into 45 minutes of near-perfectly plotted TV.\" When comparing it to \"The Impossible Astronaut\", he said it was \"scarier, creepier...and more action packed in every way...[and] also managed to leave things on a suitably epic, mythos-expanding note.\" He concluded, \"the show as a whole has a brand new energy, and we can't wait to see where Who goes from here.\" Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph was more critical with the episode, stating, \"having set up an interesting cliffhanger last week, it was a tad annoying that Steven Moffat did his trick again of taking a swerve with the pre-credits section of this week's episode, and more supposed shock value with the shootings of Amy and Rory,\" but also more annoyed \"that what exactly was going on here, and how it was influenced by the events of the previous episode, were never exactly explained, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks.\" Fuller believed that the plot and ending \"only raised more questions than answers,\" believing that the overarching storyline would \"require the audience's concentration over many weeks; any casual viewer tuning in this week, and I suspect not a few fans, will have been left baffled by the goings-on,\" but still felt the episode \"was interesting and showed just how, when the writers use their imagination, Doctor Who can tell stories in a way little else on television can.\""

        "content": "Production for season 1 began in September 2013 in New York City. Dr. Stanley Burns, founder and CEO of The Burns Archive, served as the on-set medical adviser on the series, and worked closely with production and the actors to make the hospital scenes realistic and authentic to the period. Images from the Burns Archive became important references for everything from the antiseptic atomizers in the operating theater to an early X-ray machine, to the prosthetic worn by a recurring character. Jack Amiel and Michael Begler wrote the majority of the first-season episodes, and Steven Soderbergh directed all 10 episodes in the first season. Soderbergh was also the director of photography and editor, under his usual pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard, respectively. After the conclusion of the second season on December 18, 2015, it was announced that Cinemax had ordered a script for the season three premiere and a season outline, with negotiations for a third season. In a December 2015 interview with director Steven Soderbergh, he confirmed that Dr. Thackery dies in the season two finale, and that it was all planned from the beginning, and Clive Owen only had a two-year contract for the series. Soderbergh also said, \"I told them [Cinemax] that I'm going to do the first two years and then we are going to break out the story for seasons 3 and 4 and try to find a filmmaker or filmmakers to do this the way that I did. This is how we want to do this so that every two years, whoever comes on, has the freedom to create their universe.\" However, Soderbergh decided, depending upon what those future seasons were, he would like to direct them. \"We always envisioned The Knick in two-year increments and with the idea of annihilating what came before every two years. The network was excited about that and said that sounds cool. I just met with [writers Jack Amiel and Michael Begler] yesterday. We're building our idea of what three and four might look like, to get ready to present [to the network]. It's pretty extreme, but I think it should be. If we can achieve what I'm hoping, story-wise, then I'd like to keep going. What I hope will happen is that we will figure something out that I'll feel like I have to do this\". In March 2017, the series was officially canceled by Cinemax. Kary Antholis, Cinemax's program director, stated that \"[d]espite our pride in and affection for the series, as well as our respect for and gratitude towards Steven Soderbergh and his team, we have decided to return Cinemax to its original primetime series fare of high-octane action dramas, many of which will be internationally co-produced.\""

        "content": "Oz the Great and Powerful is a 2013 American fantasy adventure film directed by Sam Raimi and written by David Lindsay-Abaire and Mitchell Kapner from a story by Kapner. Based on L. Frank Baum's early 20th century Oz novels and set 20 years before the events of the original 1900 novel, the film is a spiritual prequel to the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Wizard of Oz. Starring James Franco in the title role, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz, Michelle Williams, Zach Braff, Bill Cobbs, Joey King, William Bock, and Tony Cox, the film tells the story of Oscar Diggs, a deceptive magician who arrives in the Land of Oz and encounters three witches: Theodora, Evanora, and Glinda. Oscar is then enlisted to restore order in Oz while struggling to resolve conflicts with the witches and himself. Kapner began developing an origin story for the Wizard of Oz after a lifelong interest in wanting to create one for the character. Walt Disney Pictures commissioned the film's production in 2009 with Joe Roth as producer and Grant Curtis, Joshua Donen, Philip Steuer and Palak Patel serving as executive producers. Raimi was hired to direct the following year. After Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp declined the titular role, Franco was cast in February 2011 with principal photography commencing five months later. Danny Elfman composed the film's score. Oz the Great and Powerful premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on February 14, 2013, followed by a general theatrical release on March 8, 2013, in Disney Digital 3D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film grossed over $493\u00a0million worldwide against a $200\u00a0million budget, making it the 13th-highest-grossing film of 2013. The film won the Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Live Action Family Film and Kunis won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for her performance as the Wicked Witch of the West."

        "content": "In 1905 Kansas, Oscar Diggs is a magician and con artist in a traveling circus. The circus strongman learns Oscar has flirted with his wife and threatens him. Oscar escapes in a hot air balloon but is sucked into a tornado that takes him to the Land of Oz. There he encounters the na\u00efve witch Theodora, who believes him to be the wizard prophesied to become King of Oz by defeating the Wicked Witch, who killed the previous king. The idea of being a wealthy monarch makes Oscar accept the role. En route to the Emerald City, Theodora falls in love with Oscar though he does not reciprocate her feelings. They encounter the flying monkey, Finley, who pledges a life debt to Oscar when he saves him from a lion. Oscar reveals his deception to Finley and forces him to maintain the idea that he is the wizard. At the Emerald City, Theodora's older sister Evanora tells Oscar that the Wicked Witch resides in the Dark Forest and can be killed by destroying her wand. On the way to the forest they are joined by an orphaned living china doll whose village and family were destroyed by the Wicked Witch. The three reach the forest and discover the \"Wicked Witch\" is the late king's daughter Glinda the Good Witch, and Evanora is the true Wicked Witch. Evanora sees this with her crystal ball and tricks Theodora into thinking Oscar is trying to court all three witches at once. She offers Theodora a magic apple \"to remove her heartache\" but it turns her into a hideous green-skinned creature. Glinda brings Oscar's group to her domain to escape Evanora's army of Winkies and flying baboons. She confides in Oscar that she knows he is not the wizard but still believes he can help stop Evanora. He reluctantly takes charge of an \"army\" of Quadlings, Tinkers and Munchkins. Theodora enters Glinda's domain and angrily reveals her new hideous appearance to Oscar before threatening to kill him and his allies with the Emerald City's well-prepared army. Oscar despairs at his chances of victory, but after telling China Girl about the exploits of his hero Thomas Edison he conceives a plan that relies on trickery. Glinda and her subjects mount a fake attack on the Emerald City using a pulley-rig army of scarecrow puppets hidden by thick fog. The witches are tricked into sending their flying baboons through a poppy field that puts them to sleep, but Glinda is captured in the process. Meanwhile, Oscar infiltrates the Emerald City with his allies but apparently abandons them in a hot air balloon loaded with gold, which Theodora destroys with a fireball. As Evanora and Theodora prepare to kill Glinda, Oscar appears, having faked his betrayal and death. Using a hidden smoke machine and image projector, he presents a giant image of his face as his \"true\" form and a fireworks display to intimidate the Wicked Witches. Evanora fearfully hides in her castle while Theodora flees on her broom, unable to hurt the \"invincible\" wizard. Oscar offers to Theodora that she would be welcome to return if she overcomes her wickedness, but Theodora refuses and flies away to the West laughing maniacally, leaving Oscar saddened. China Girl frees Glinda from her restraints with her wand, and she engages Evanora in a magical duel in the throne room. Glinda destroys Evanora's emerald necklace, revealing her true hag-like appearance, and banishes her from the Emerald City. Evanora is carried away by a pair of flying baboons as she vows revenge. Oscar, now ruler of Oz, uses his projector to sustain the belief that he is a powerful wizard. He presents gifts to his friends: Master Tinker, who helped build his machines, receives Oscar's jackknife while Knuck, the grumpy Munchkin herald who was called \"Sourpuss\" by Oscar as a running gag throughout the movie, receives a mask with a smiley face; the long-suffering Finley receives Oscar's friendship along with his top hat and China Girl accepts her friends as her new family. Finally, Oscar takes Glinda behind the curtains of his projector, thanks her for making him a better person, and they kiss."

        "title": "Oz the Great and Powerful_Continuity",
        "content": "Oz the Great and Powerful features several artistic allusions, homages, and technical parallels to Baum's novels and the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film, The Wizard of Oz. The film's opening sequence is presented in black and white. When Oscar is caught up in the tornado, the audio switches from monaural to stereo and eventually surround sound. The film shifts to full color when Oscar arrives in Oz; additionally, the aspect ratio gradually widens from 4:3 Academy ratio to 2.35:1 widescreen. As in the 1939 film, Glinda travels in giant bubbles, and the Emerald City is actually emerald; in the novel, characters wear tinted glasses to make it appear so, though during the battle preparations sequence Oz can be seen wearing emerald goggles. The iconic green look of the Wicked Witch of the West is closer to her look in the 1939 film, as the Witch is a short, one-eyed crone in the novel. The Wicked Witches are portrayed as sisters, an idea which originated in the 1939 film. Also from the 1939 film is that several actors who play Oz characters make cameos in the Kansas segments, such as Frank, Oscar's assistant whom he refers to as his \"trained monkey\" (Frank's \"Oz\" counterpart is the winged monkey Finley) and a young disabled girl who serves as the Kansas counterpart to China Girl (in Kansas, Oscar is unable to make the wheelchair-using young girl walk, and gets a chance to do so when he repairs China Girl's broken legs); Annie who inspires Oscar to be a good and great person (Annie's \"Oz\" counterpart, Glinda, also inspires Oscar to be a better person) informs him that she has been proposed to by John Gale, presumably hinting at Dorothy Gale's parental lineage. Annie is seen wearing a gingham dress, a pattern famously associated with Dorothy. Other referenced characters include the Scarecrow, who is built by the townspeople as a scare tactic; the Tin Woodman, whose creator is the Master Tinker that can build \"anything\"; and the lion that attacks Finley, a reference to the Cowardly Lion. Similarly, various other races of Oz are depicted besides the Munchkins; the Quadlings, the china doll inhabitants of Dainty China Country, and the Winkies (who went unnamed in the 1939 film). Similarly, Glinda is referred to by her title in the novel (the Good Witch of the South), unlike the 1939 film, where her character's title is \"Good Witch of the North\" (due to her character being merged with the Good Witch of the North). Glinda is also the daughter of the late King of Oz, though in the novels, Ozma is the King's daughter. Theodora's tears leave streak-like scars on her face, reflecting her weakness to water in the original story. Also, Oz is presented as a real place as it is in the novel, and not as a possible dream as the 1939 film implies."

        "content": "After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, Walt Disney planned to produce an animated film based on the first of L. Frank Baum's Oz books. However, Roy O. Disney, the chairman of Walt Disney Productions, was informed by Baum's estate that they had sold the film rights to the first book to Samuel Goldwyn, who re-sold it to Louis B. Mayer in 1938. Ironically, the film was approved due to the success of Snow White. The project was then developed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer into the well-known musical adaptation which was released the following year. In 1954, when the film rights to Baum's remaining thirteen Oz books were made available, Walt Disney Productions acquired them for use in Walt Disney's television series Disneyland which led to the live-action film Rainbow Road to Oz, which was abandoned and never completed. Disney's history with the Oz series continued with the 1985 film Return to Oz, which performed poorly, both critically and commercially, but has developed a cult following since its release by fans of the books who considered it a more faithful adaptation to the Oz books than the 1939 classic. After Return to Oz, Disney lost the film rights to the Oz books and they subsequently reverted to the public domain. In 2005, Disney produced the television film The Muppets' Wizard of Oz which aired on its network ABC."

        "content": "Upon the release of Wicked, screenwriter Mitchell Kapner felt he had missed his opportunity to explore the origins of the Wizard of Oz character. In 2009, he met with producer Joe Roth who turned down his current pitches and asked if he had any other ideas. Kapner, who had been reading the Oz series to his children, outlined the plots of the books. Roth stopped him on the sixth book, The Emerald City of Oz, which had some of the Wizard's backstory. Roth said:  Kapner and co-writer Palak Patel were turned down by Sony Pictures before the project was set up at Walt Disney Pictures in 2009. Disney president Sean Bailey commissioned Oz the Great and Powerful (under the working title \"Brick\") during the tenure of chairman Dick Cook, who was succeeded by Rich Ross, and later Alan Horn, a succession in management rarely survived by a major studio release. David Lindsay-Abaire was later hired to do a re-write. Roth initially sought Robert Downey Jr. for the title role of the Wizard. Sam Raimi was hired to direct in 2010 from a shortlist including Sam Mendes and Adam Shankman. In January 2011, Downey declined the role and it was offered to Johnny Depp, who had previously collaborated with the studio in Pirates of the Caribbean and Alice in Wonderland. Depp liked the role but was already committed to The Lone Ranger. In February, James Franco accepted $7 million to star in the film, five months before filming was scheduled to begin. Franco and Raimi had previously worked together on the Spider-Man trilogy, in which Franco played Peter Parker's best friend Harry Osborn. Franco received training for the role from magician Lance Burton. Kapner adapted the character of the Wizard from the novels to conceptualize an original story, and Raimi ensured that the film would \"nod lovingly\" to the 1939 film by inserting references and homages to it. Disney wanted to reduce the film's production budget to $200\u00a0million. Casting calls were put out for local actors in Michigan."

        "content": "Principal photography for Oz the Great and Powerful began July 25, 2011, at Raleigh Michigan Studios in Pontiac, Michigan, employing 3D cameras. Raimi opted to use practical sets in conjunction with computer-generated imagery during filming. Physical sets were constructed so the actors could have a visual reference, as opposed to using green screen technology for every scene. Chroma key compositing was only used for background pieces. Zach Braff and Joey King were on set, recording their dialogue simultaneously with the other actors, whenever their CG characters were present in a scene. Puppetry was employed for a physical version of the China Girl to serve as a visual key-point for actors to manipulate. Braff wore a blue motion capture suit to create Finley's movements and had a camera close to his face for the flying sequences to obtain facial movements. Art director Robert Stromberg, who worked on Avatar and Alice in Wonderland, drew inspiration from the films of Frank Capra and James Wong Howe to achieve the Art Deco design he envisioned for the Emerald City. Stromberg contrasted the colorful tonal qualities of Oz with the restrained appearance of Alice, affirming that although both films explore similar fantasy worlds, the overall atmosphere and landscape of each \"are completely different.\" In 2011, Stromberg and his team visited the Walt Disney archives during the pre-production phase to reference production art from Disney's animated films such as Pinocchio, Bambi, Fantasia, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, drawing from designs and textures in order to give certain settings in the film an affectionate nod to the Disney style. Costume designer Gary Jones focused on authenticity with his wardrobe designs: \"We started by doing a lot of research and having ideas of the ways (costumes) should look in order to be (historically accurate) but as we went on, we really began creating a whole new world.\" Although the film is a spiritual prequel to the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Wizard of Oz, it was not allowed legally to be considered as such. The filmmakers had to toe a fine line between calling the film to mind but not infringing upon it. To that end, Disney had a copyright expert on set to ensure no infringement occurred. The production team worked under the constraint of abiding by the stipulations set forth by Warner Bros., the legal owner of the rights to iconic elements of the 1939 film (via its Turner Entertainment sister company which purchased the MGM film library in 1986), including the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland. Therefore, Disney was unable to use them nor any original character likenesses from the 1939 film. This extended to the green of the Wicked Witch's skin for which Disney used what its legal department considered a sufficiently different shade dubbed \"Theostein\" (a portmanteau of \"Theodora\" and \"Frankenstein\"). Additionally, the studio could not use the signature chin mole of Margaret Hamilton's portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West nor could they employ the yellow brick road's swirl design for Munchkinland. The expert also ensured that the Emerald City was not too close in appearance to the original Emerald City in the 1939 film. While Warner and Disney did not engage in copyright battle, they did file rival trademarks. In October 2012, Disney filed a trademark on \"Oz the Great and Powerful\" while one week later Warner filed its own trademarks for \"The Great and Powerful Oz.\" The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office suspended Warner's attempt at a trademark because Disney had filed basically the same one a week earlier. In addition to the legal issues, the film was also faced with delays when several cast members went on hiatus due to unrelated commitments and circumstances. Rachel Weisz left halfway through the shoot to film her entire role in The Bourne Legacy, Michelle Williams was required to promote the release of My Week with Marilyn and Franco's father died during production. Roth compared the task of managing overlapping schedules to \"being an air-traffic controller.\" Mila Kunis's makeup and prosthetics were supervised by Greg Nicotero and demanded four hours to apply and another hour to remove, with Kunis taking nearly two months to fully recover from the subsequent removal of the makeup from her skin. Raimi had to edit the frightening nature of several scenes to secure Disney's desired PG-rating from the MPAA. Sony Pictures Imageworks was contracted to create the film's visual effects."

Regarding the tonal quality of the score, Elfman stated, \"We're going to take an approach that's old school but not self-consciously old-fashioned. Let the melodrama be melodrama, let everything be what it is. I also think there's the advantage that I'm able to write narratively, and when I'm able to write narratively I can also move quicker because that's my natural instincts, I can tell a story in the music.\" American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey recorded a promotional single called \"Almost Home\" written by Carey, Simone Porter, Justin Gray, Lindsey Ray, Tor Erik Hermansen, and Mikkel Eriksen (a.k.a.

Worldwide, it was the thirteenth-highest-grossing film of 2013. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $38.4million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues, making it the 13th most profitable release of 2013. It topped the box office on its worldwide opening weekend with $149\u00a0million. Before its theatrical release, several media outlets reported that Oz the Great and Powerful was expected to duplicate the box office performance of 2010's Alice in Wonderland. However, Oz accumulated less than half of Alices worldwide gross. Preliminary reports had the film tracking for an $80\u2013100\u00a0million debut in North America. The movie earned $2\u00a0million from 9 p.m. showings on Thursday night. For its opening day, Oz the Great and Powerful grossed $24.1\u00a0million, the fourth-highest March opening day. During its opening weekend, the film topped the box office with $79.1\u00a0million, the third-highest March opening weekend. Despite the film's solid debut, which was larger than nearly all comparable titles, it clearly lagged behind Alice in Wonderland's opening ($116.1\u00a0million). The film's 3-D share of the opening weekend was 53%. Females made up 52% of the audience. Surprisingly, though, families only represented 41% of attendance, while couples accounted for 43%. The film retained first place at the box office during its second weekend with $41.3\u00a0million. Outside North America, the film earned $69.9\u00a0million on its opening weekend from 46 territories. Among all markets, its highest-grossing debuts were achieved in Russia and the CIS ($14.7\u00a0million), China ($9.06\u00a0million), France and the Maghreb region ($5.77\u00a0million). The film's openings trailed Alice in Wonderland in all major markets except Russia and the CIS. It retained first place at the box office outside North America for a second weekend. In total grosses, Ozs largest countries are Russia and the CIS ($27.4\u00a0million), China ($25.9\u00a0million) and the UK, Ireland and Malta ($23.4\u00a0million)."

        "content": "On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Oz the Great and Powerful received an approval rating of 59% based on 273 reviews, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It suffers from some tonal inconsistency and a deflated sense of wonder, but Oz the Great and Powerful still packs enough visual dazzle and clever wit to be entertaining in its own right.\" On Metacritic the film holds a score of 44 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed to average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Kim Newman, writing for Empire, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, \"If there are post-Harry Potter children who don't know or care about The Wizard Of Oz, they might be at sea with this story about a not-very-nice grownup in a magic land, but long-term Oz watchers will be enchanted and enthralled\u00a0... Mila Kunis gets a gold star for excellence in bewitchery and Sam Raimi can settle securely behind the curtain as a mature master of illusion.\" Critic Alonso Duralde also admired the movie: \"That Oz the Great and Powerful is so thoroughly effective both on its own terms and as a prequel to one of the most beloved movies ever made indicates that this team has magic to match any witch or wizard.\" Leonard Maltin on IndieWire claimed that \"No movie ever can, or will, replace 1939's The Wizard Of Oz, but taken on its own terms, this eye-filling fantasy is an entertaining riff on how the Wizard of that immortal film found his way to Oz.\" IGN rated the film 7.8 and said, \"The film is expansive and larger-than-life in scope and so are the performances, overall. Franco in particular hams it up and is often playing to the balcony\u00a0... The 3D is utilized just as it should be in a children's fantasy epic such as this \u2013 overtly, but with skill. Snowflakes, music boxes and mysterious animals all leap through the screen towards the audience as the story unfolds.\" Justin Chang of Variety had a mixed reaction, writing that the film \"gets some mileage out of its game performances, luscious production design and the unfettered enthusiasm director Sam Raimi brings to a thin, simplistic origin story.\" He also compared the film's scale with the Star Wars prequel trilogy adding, \"In a real sense, Oz the Great and Powerful has a certain kinship with George Lucas's Star Wars prequels, in the way it presents a beautiful but borderline-sterile digital update of a world that was richer, purer and a lot more fun in lower-tech form. Here, too, the actors often look artificially superimposed against their CG backdrops, though the intensity of the fakery generates its own visual fascination.\" /Film rated the film 7 out of 10, saying it had \"many charms\" while considering it to be \"basically Army of Darkness: (Normal guy lands in magical land, is forced to go on quest to save that land.) But just when you see Raimi's kinetic, signature style starting to unleash, the story forces the film back into its Disney shell to play to the masses. We're left with a film that's entertaining, a little scarier than you'd expect, but extremely inconsistent.\" Richard Roeper, writing for Roger Ebert, noted the film's omnipresent visual effects but was largely disappointed by the performance of some cast members; \"...\u00a0to see Williams so bland and sugary as Glinda, and Kunis so flat and ineffectual as the heartsick Theodora\u00a0...\" Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post was unimpressed, writing, \"Oh, it's exciting enough for a six-year-old; anyone older, however, will already have been exposed to so much on TV, at the movies and on the Internet that this will seem like so much visual cotton-candy. Even a sophisticated grade-schooler will find these doings weak and overblown.\" Similarly, Todd McCarthy criticized the characterization, writing that the film's supporting cast \"can't begin to compare with their equivalents in the original\u00a0... so the burden rests entirely upon Franco and Williams, whose dialogue exchanges are repetitive and feel tentative.\" Entertainment Weekly agreed, giving the film a C+ and saying that the \"miscast\" Franco \"lacks the humor, charm, and gee-whiz wonder we're meant to feel as he trades wisecracks with a flying monkey\u00a0... and soars above a field of poppies in a giant soap bubble. If he's not enchanted, how are we supposed to be?\" and complaining that \"while Raimi's Oz is like retinal crack, he never seduces our hearts and minds.\" Alisha Coelho of in.com gave the movie 2.5 stars, saying \"Oz The Great and Powerful doesn't leave a lasting impression, but is an a-ok watch.\""

David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave the show three stars out of five, saying \"The cast here nails their roles, from Wilson down to support players like Emmy winner Margo Martindale as his loyal assistant, Rita. Ehle has a much trickier role and handles it well. It\u2019s a show that wants to say something. Now it needs viewers who want to listen.\" Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said \"with just a few tiny modifications, A Gifted Man could be a smart satiric comedy, but I don\u2019t think that is what Grant is shooting for,\" poking fun at Julie Benz's character's cosmic beliefs and dysfunctional family. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe compared the show to Grey's Anatomy, saying \"[the show] needs to transcend that limited and overused construct, and set the characters free from endless debate over whether Anna is real or not. Let the actors find drama in more earthly concerns. I think they\u2019re up to it.\" Robert Bianco of USA Today says \"Wilson has the magnetism and acting chops to lead a network series.

It was written by lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Jeremy Webb. In the episode, the archaeologist River Song (Alex Kingston) is programmed by the religious order the Silence to kill the alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) to prevent \"the first question\" from being asked on a planet called Trenzalore in the Doctor's future. She refuses, and they end up in an alternative timeline where all of time is running simultaneously and beginning to disintegrate. The Doctor tries to restore the universe with the help of River and the alternative universe versions of his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). It is revealed that he had already planned escape by posing as himself using the shape-shifting Teselecta. \"The Wedding of River Song\" concludes the story arc of the series and reveals what really happened at the start of the season premiere, \"The Impossible Astronaut\". The episode features many returning characters. It also pays tribute to the classic series character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart following the death of the character's actor Nicholas Courtney. One of the last episodes to be filmed for the series, production for \"The Wedding of River Song\" finished in April 2011. The episode was watched by a total of 7.67 million viewers in the UK.

He encounters the shapeshifting robot the Teselecta and its miniaturised crew posing as one of the members of the Silence; they offer him any help within their power as he faces his death. Through them the Doctor is led to Gantok, another Silence member, who takes him to the living head of Dorium Maldovar inside a catacomb. Dorium reveals that the Silence are dedicated to averting the Doctor's future, warning him that that silence must fall when \"the first question\" is asked on the planet Trenzalore, which is \"Doctor who?\" To avoid crossing his own time stream, the Doctor gives the Teselecta crew four invitations to Lake Silencio in 1969 for Amy and Rory, River, Canton Everett Delaware III, and a younger version of himself. The Doctor comes to Lake Silencio, Utah to meet his death by a younger version of River, who is being forced to kill the Doctor in the automated space suit contrived by the Silence. River surprises the Doctor by draining the space suit's weapons systems and averting his death. Time becomes \"stuck\" as a result and begins to disintegrate; all of Earth's history begins to run simultaneously at a fixed moment. On this \"stuck\" Earth (with all of time happening at once) Amy takes the Doctor to Area 52, a pyramid base where the Silence are contained in water-filled cells and Madame Kovarian is held hostage. River is also there; aware of the consequences of her actions, she refuses to allow the Doctor to touch her, an event that would lead to time going back to normal and the Doctor dying at Lake Silencio, Utah. Awakened by the Doctor's presence, the Silence escape their cells and attack the troops defending the pyramid. Amy allows Kovarian to die as revenge for the kidnapping and brain-washing of her daughter Melody (aka River Song). The Doctor and River escape to the top of the pyramid followed by Amy and Rory. The Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers to her to look into his eye. There she sees the miniaturized Doctor and realizes that he is inside the Teselecta ship and will not actually die if time's flow is restored. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. They seal this agreement, and their marriage, with a kiss. Time moves forward and reality returns to normal. River later visits Amy and Rory to tell them the Doctor is still alive. Elsewhere, the Doctor explains to Dorium that the Doctor's perceived death will enable him to withdraw and be forgotten, as he was getting too much attention."

River Song states that she used her hallucinogenic lipstick on President Kennedy, a possession of hers that was introduced in \"The Time of Angels\". One of the Silence calls Rory \"the man who dies and dies again\", a reference to the many times he appears to die. The episode's main plot centres around the damage caused by River when she tries to re-write a fixed point in time. The concept of \"fixed points\" in history which may not be altered, even by the Doctor or his companions, was introduced in The Aztecs (1964) and was named and explored in the new series with episodes such as \"The Fires of Pompeii\" and \"The Waters of Mars\". When River meets Amy for a bottle of wine, she is wearing military fatigues and says that she \"just climbed out of the Byzantium\", and that she saw Amy there.

Despite this, it leaves ambiguous whether the Doctor and River are legitimately married. Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat described it as \"a big roller coaster ride of Doctor Who madness\". One of the \"mad idea[s]\" he included in the episode, \"Live Chess\", came because Moffat wanted to make chess\u00a0\u2014 which he called \"one of the most boring games in the world\"\u00a0\u2014 into a dangerous spectator sport. Originally, the script did not include the brief scene with a Dalek; Moffat had intended to rest the Doctor's most famous adversary for the sixth series. Amy's confrontation with Madame Kovarian, a scene which shows what she might have been like had she not met the Doctor, was also added into the script later. Following the death of actor Nicholas Courtney, the Doctor learns in the episode that Courtney's character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart has died peacefully in a nursing home. Moffat said of the reference, \"In a story about the Doctor going to his death, it seemed right and proper to acknowledge one of the greatest losses Doctor Who has endured.\" Moffat has confirmed that the eye patch-like eyedrives in the episode are also a tribute to Courtney, who wore an eye patch when playing an alternative version of the Brigadier in Inferno (1970). Several characters reappear in the episode, including Charles Dickens (Simon Callow) from \"The Unquiet Dead\", Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) from \"Victory of the Daleks\", the Silurian doctor Malohkeh (Richard Hope) from \"The Hungry Earth\"/\"Cold Blood\", the Teselecta and Captain Carter (Richard Dillane) from \"Let's Kill Hitler\", and the Headless Monks and Dorium (Simon Fisher-Becker) from \"A Good Man Goes to War\". McNeice felt there was room for his character to return, as \"Victory of the Daleks\" had hinted that he and the Doctor knew each other well."

American television hostess Meredith Vieira recorded her report of Churchill's return to the Buckingham Senate in front of a green screen while filming a segment for The Today Show'''s \"Anchors Abroad\" segment in May 2011. Mark Gatiss, who played Gantok, was credited in this episode under the pseudonym \"Rondo Haxton\", a homage to the American horror actor Rondo Hatton on whom the character's look was based; Gatiss underwent prosthetics to play the part. Gatiss, who has written for Doctor Who, also played Professor Richard Lazarus in \"The Lazarus Experiment\" (2007) and provided the voice of Danny Boy in \"Victory of the Daleks\". The cast found working with the eye patches strange as they had to act with one eye; Alex Kingston remarked that it made her \"slightly dizzy\". Actor Karen Gillan was allowed to fire a specially-made machine gun used for films. Churchill's Buckingham Senate was filmed in Cardiff's City Council building. The script called for an Indiana Jones style tunnel for the Headless Monks' chamber, but as that kind of location was not available in Cardiff a set was built instead. The skulls were hand-crafted and required a lot of preparation, so it was one of the first things started for the episode's production."

Dan Martin of The Guardian gave a positive review, believing that the episode \"moves along the bigger, 50-year story and effectively reboots the show\". He particularly praised it for being simplistic, as well as the visuals of all history running together at once. Rachel Tarley, writing for Metro, praising the \"gripping race\" against time and noting that the script was \"snappy and witty throughout, but the episode had its eerie and touching moments where necessary, too\". The A.V. Club Keith Phipps gave the episode an A, calling it \"pretty close to a perfect season finale\" for those not looking for all of the answers. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy wrote, \"As a piece of Saturday night entertainment, it works\u00a0\u2014 packed full of strong performances, stunning visuals and sharp dialogue. And as the resolution to a series-long arc, it's mostly satisfactory\u00a0\u2014 though the episode poses as many questions as it answers.\" Dave Golder of SFX gave the episode four-and-a-half out of five stars, explaining that he was in conflict whether to rate it five or four stars and calling it \"about nine-tenths a great, great episode\". He referred to the many concepts of the episode as a \"sumptuous confection made mostly out of the finest ingredients\" and found the Teselecta resolution a \"cool twist\" at first, but it meant \"the whole episode is just an elaborate version of the classic Star Trek: Voyager alternate timeline shtick complete with reset button\". IGN's Matt Risley rated \"The Wedding of River Song\" 8.5 out of 10, writing it \"managed to tie together plot threads and character arcs without too much Deus Ex Maguffiny predictability and with a whole host of trademark sci-fi spectacle to boot\". Though he thought the wedding \"felt a little too rushed to leave any lingering emotional aftertaste\", he praised other emotional moments in the episode and said the fact that everyone thinks the Doctor is dead will help the show explore a new angle. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph called it an \"uneven ending\"; he praised it for being \"visually clever\" and liked the way the Silence were handled, but thought the Teselecta solution was \"a bit of a cop-out\". Neela Debnath of The Independent'' was displeased with the episode, calling it a \"brainteaser\" that \"refused to tie up the loose ends neatly\", and that as a finale it was \"underwhelming in terms of drama and overwhelming in terms of information\". However, she praised the fact that Moffat appears to be spreading storylines over several series, believing it \"strengthens the show\". On the other hand, HitFix's Alan Sepinwall thought that the resolutions from the wedding on were \"excellent\", but felt it could have done without another alternate universe, as it was similar to the previous finale \"The Big Bang\". Maureen Ryan of TV Squad criticised the episode for having too many \"bells and whistles\" which undermined the emotional moments, especially the wedding, which she did not believe showed that the Doctor was really in love with River. However, she did enjoy \"callbacks\" to previous episodes such as Churchill and Amy and Rory's relationship. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 thought it was better than the previous finale, \"The Big Bang\", as there were more answers, fun, and a satisfying resolution. However, she was critical of the reason River had to kill the Doctor as well as their relationship, and believed that Amy's killing Madame Kovarian was \"no substitute\" for Amy's dealing with what Kovarian had done to her child."

First broadcast on BBC One on 25 December 2011, it is the seventh Doctor Who Christmas special since the show's revival in 2005. It was written by Steven Moffat and directed by Farren Blackburn. Internationally, the special was shown on BBC America in the United States and on Space in Canada the same day as the British broadcast, with ABC1 in Australia showing it one day later. In the special, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) is the caretaker of recently widowed Madge Arwell (Claire Skinner) and her children Lily (Holly Earl) and Cyril (Maurice Cole) during their holiday vacation in 1941 England. The Doctor plans to take them on a treat to a snowy planet through a portal in a present he has placed under the Christmas tree, but Cyril opens it before Christmas and wanders through.  While looking for him, the others learn that the trees of the planet are about to be melted down with acid rain for energy. \"The Doctor, the Widow, and the Wardrobe\" marked the end of Piers Wenger's tenure as executive producer, and the debut of Caroline Skinner in the same position.  Adapting elements of C.S. Lewis's children's novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Moffat intended the episode to be the most \"Christmassy\" of the Doctor Who Christmas specials, while Blackburn felt there was \"magic\" in it. It was filmed in September and October 2011, with some scenes taking place in an authentic Lancaster bomber. \"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\" was watched by 10.77 million viewers in the United Kingdom, making it the third most-watched programme on Christmas Day. Critical reception to the episode was positive, though some felt that the high-profile comedic guest stars Bill Bailey and Arabella Weir were underused."

        "content": "In England on Christmas Eve 1941, the Doctor becomes caretaker to Madge Arwell and her children, Lily and Cyril, as a favour to Madge for helping the Doctor find his TARDIS. Madge has received a telegram that the children's father Reg disappeared over the English Channel a few days earlier, but decides not to tell her children yet, hoping to keep their spirits up through the holiday. That night, Cyril is lured into opening a large glowing present under the Christmas tree, revealing a time portal to a snow-covered forest. The Doctor shortly discovers Cyril's absence and follows him with Lily; they eventually track Cyril to a strange lighthouse-like structure. Madge, finding her children missing, soon follows them into the forest, but is met by three miners in space suits. The miners tell Madge that the forest of the planet they are on is scheduled to be melted by acid rain within minutes, killing anything within it. At the lighthouse, Cyril is met by a humanoid creature made of wood; it places a simple band of metal around his head like a crown. Lily and the Doctor arrive, followed by another wood creature, but find the creatures have rejected Cyril as he is \"weak\", as they do the Doctor. The Doctor concludes that the life forces of the trees in the forest are trying to escape through a living creature, with the crown acting as an interface. Madge safely reunites with her children as the acid rain starts. The wood creatures identify her as \"strong\", and the Doctor realises they consider her the \"mothership\", able to carry the life force safely. Donning the band, Madge absorbs the life force of the forest, allowing her to direct the top of the lighthouse as an escape pod away from the acid rain and into the time vortex. Reg's plane follows the light of the pod through the time vortex and safely arrives outside the house at Christmas, reuniting Reg with his family. The life force of the forest have converted themselves to ethereal beings within the time vortex. Believing that Amy and Rory still think he is dead, the Doctor joins them for Christmas dinner."

        "content": "\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\" was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat, who wanted it to be \"the most Christmassy Christmas special ever\". He stated that \"nothing is more fun to write\" than the Doctor at Christmas, as he considered it \"his kind of day. Everything's bright and shiny, everybody's having a laugh, and nobody minds if you wear a really stupid hat\". The story is partly inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (from The Chronicles of Narnia) by C. S. Lewis. Moffat said that Doctor Who and the Narnia stories \"come from the same impulse that children have of escaping to another world.\" The scene in which the Doctor is showing the Arwells around the house originally included a scene in a \"haunted coal cellar\". The characters of Ven-Garr and Billis are named after outgoing executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis, both of whom served with Moffat. The three tree harvesters are from Androzani Major in the year 5345, a planet which features in the serial The Caves of Androzani (1984). The Doctor mentions the Forest of Cheem, which appeared in the Ninth Doctor episode \"The End of the World\". He mentions that one of them fancied him, and during that episode one sacrificed her life for him. \"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\" marks the debut of Caroline Skinner and sees the end of Wenger as executive producers. The two had previously worked together; Moffat commented it \"will be the smoothest hand-over we've done\". The special was directed by Farren Blackburn, who had previously worked with Skinner on The Fades. Blackburn stated that he was \"daunted, thrilled and excited at the same time\" about the job and that it was \"tough\". Blackburn's favorite sequences to direct was the opening sequence and the scenes set on the winter planet, where he \"really felt like [he] was making a movie\". When asked about the tone he wished to create, Blackburn replied, The BBC announced in September 2011 that production had started for the special and filming was due to be complete by mid October 2011. Filming was disrupted on 30 September by a 24-hour protest at BBC Wales because of compulsory redundancies. The opening sequence set in the corridors of a spaceship was filmed on 20 September 2011 at Uskmouth Power Station. As the conditions were very noisy, the crew had to wear ear protectors. Filming of some scenes involving Alexander Armstrong took place in and around the Lancaster bomber Just Jane at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre on 3 October 2011. External footage of the lighthouse building took place in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. Actor Matt Smith stated, \"It was a really tough shoot. Out in a forest, at night, and because there were children involved, some shooting schedules had to change radically, we'd often have to shoot through, no breaks\u00a0\u2013 you get lunch at midnight or something.\""

Doctor Who Magazine, in its preview of the special, refers to as Madge, Cyril and Lily as companions, with nine-year-old Maurice Cole's Cyril Arwell defined as the youngest companion in the history of the franchise. Arabella Weir previously appeared as an alternate incarnation of the Third Doctor in the Doctor Who Unbound audio drama Exile. Weir was \"genuinely surprised and completely thrilled\" to be offered the part. Bill Bailey was pleased to be given a comedic human character, explaining, \"The fact that I am almost playing a human means the expressions are easier to do. If I was an Ood, with a face full of tentacles, that would have been harder to bring the funny\"."

        "content": "The special received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 100% based on 6 reviews, and an average score of 8.5/10. Dan Martin of The Guardian noted that it was \"the smallest\u00a0\u2013 yet perhaps the most enchanting\u00a0\u2013 Christmas special we've had to date\". Noting that it featured a typical \"doomed spaceship\", the threat was not to the universe but one family's happiness, and the only enemies were \"some misguided and underdeveloped polluters\", he concluded that \"Any other time of year I would gnaw holes all over this, but it's Christmas, and today it felt perfect\". He felt that Claire Skinner held the episode together and the appearance of Amy \"made Christmas all the more special\". However, his \"major niggle\" was that everything was the Doctor's fault, as he left the present while knowing that most children would open their presents before Christmas. Michael Hogan, writing for The Telegraph, gave the special four and a half out of five stars. He thought that the cast of comedians were \"rather under-utilised\" but thought that Skinner \"excelled\" and Smith was also \"brilliant\". Neela Debnath of The Independent described the episode as \"the perfect recipe for a Christmas special\", particularly praising the touching moments. In the same paper's DVD review, Ben Walsh gave \"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\" four out of five stars, calling it \"best Doctor Who Christmas Special for some years\". He commented that \"the eco-message is a bit laboured, but the central tragedy that powers this scatty episode is a poignant one\". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was pleased, despite noting that he had low expectations for the special. He particularly praised Smith's performance, although he noted that the \"heart-warming\" scene with Amy and Rory called for a \"companions shake-up\" next series. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave \"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\" an A-, feeling that it could stand proudly beside \"A Christmas Carol\", the previous Christmas special. IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode an 8 out of 10, calling it more \"classically, indulgently, infectiously Christmassy\" than the previous Christmas specials. He praised the production design and special effects teams for \"creating some dazzlingly memorable special effects, and a winter wonderland that was both recognisably, fuzzily Christmas incarnate and unerringly, tensely alien\" but thought the supporting cast \"triumphed above and beyond\" the plot devices. Like Hogan, Risley commented that the comedian cast of Bailey and Weir as well as Armstrong \"felt lacking\". However, the next year, Risley wrote that he \"got a little carried away with the festive funtimes ... On reflection, the overwhelming Christmassyness of it all was overcompensating for a pretty flimsy, frivolous plot.\" Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the special four out of five stars, praising Smith's acting and Blackburn's Doctor Who directing debut as well as the special effects. However, he thought that the lack of a villain was an \"interesting experiment, but maybe not ideal for Christmas Day\" and Bailey and Weir's forest rangers \"felt like bolt-on comic relief\"."

It was announced on September 29, 2011 that Russell Brand would be the show's first guest.  Other guests during Rosie's premiere week included: Wanda Sykes, Gloria Estefan, Roseanne Barr, Lisa Kudrow, Valerie Harper, and Kevin Bacon. On October 26, 2011, audience member Hollee Chanel was chosen by Rosie to be the new announcer for the show, replacing actress Michelle Blakely. O'Donnell expressed that there would be further changes to the set and format over the show's first few months, as the program finds its vibe during the first season. On December 6, 2011, Rosie announced on her show that she had recently proposed to her girlfriend, New York-based headhunter Michelle Rounds. The news became a national headline and O'Donnell expressed her surprise at the media's overwhelming response. On December 9, 2011, Rosie responded to a joke that David Letterman made on The Late Show about her engagement; as part of the joke, Letterman referred to Rosie as a tow truck driver and sports team coach. In response to what she believed was a form of homophobic bullying, O'Donnell shared the top five reasons why she won't appear on The Late Show. On January 17, 2012, The Rosie Show debuted a brand new set that is smaller, more colorful, and reflective of the host's attempt to establish a more intimate vibe. Rosie says that such changes were completed in just five days and they were inspired by her experience on the set of Bravo's Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. In addition, former announcer Hollee Chanel has been promoted to correspondent, and house band leader Katreese Barnes is now working behind the scenes on song parodies. Google Pete, a regular from Rosie's XM Radio show, is taking the helm as announcer and live tweeter. O'Donnell also addressed controversy sparked by a photo posted online that showed her family catching a hammerhead shark years ago, before they became endangered. Shark enthusiasts and conservationists began an online campaign against the host because of the photo, and Rosie responded with a humorous monologue, which declared her love for animals. This episode was streamed live on Rosie.com at 4/3c. On January 27, 2012, Rosie revealed in a one-on-one interview with Dr. Oz that her fianc\u00e9e Michelle Rounds has been seeing a fertility doctor, as the two are planning on having a child together. On February 8, 2012, in a one-on-one interview with comedian Chelsea Handler, O'Donnell discussed her anxiety surrounding little people, as she said \"I'm a little ashamed about it [but] I have a mild fear or anxiety around little people. The problem with me is I can't put the two things together. This is an adult person, a little person ... it's so hard for me.\" Handler responded with opinions deemed equally or more offensive by many critics. Rosie has since issued numerous public apologies via her Twitter account, including one to Little People, Big World star Amy Roloff, saying \"i am sorry my words hurt u and made u sad - they were ineloquently phrased - i apologize and am pained at my own inadequacy.\" Amy was quick to respond to Rosie's apology by tweeting, \"I appreciate that Rosie. Beginning of further great discussions. Many of us in the LP community were taken back. Let's talk more.\" She later assured the OWN show host in another tweet, \"we all do - mess up comment very public & stirred up many memories in many LPs I'm sure. THANK YOU for apology!

After watching the preview, a staff member of Idolator commented that it \"reminds us of our own family Turkey Day get-togethers: there are people running around in ridiculous attire, someone's crying and the hostess is a (Mother) Monster of sorts.\" In a three-minute teaser trailer, Gaga makes crafts and shares holiday food with third-grade children. The full TV special premiered on November 24, 2011, at 9:30\u00a0pm\u00a0ET."

It attracted 5.749 million viewers and garnered a 1.8/5 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic in its first hour. Gaga's special aired simultaneously with reruns of The Simpsons on FOX, Person of Interest on CBS, and The Secret Circle on The CW. In its second hour, total viewership and ratings declined to 5.388 million viewers and a 1.6/5 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic, despite airing at the same time as a recap of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC and a rerun of The Mentalist on CBS. A Very Gaga Thanksgiving failed to beat other Thanksgiving specials in the ratings, including A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. The program had the highest rating in the 18\u201349 demographic in its time slot. Total viewership increased by 23% (1.3 million viewers) from the previous year's Thanksgiving special, singer Beyonc\u00e9's 2009 concert I Am... World Tour. It gave ABC its best ratings in four years for the Thanksgiving Day time slot."

        "content": "The program was met with general acclaim from television critics. Calling it engaging, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly opined that A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was \"disarmingly direct, sincere, and unpretentious\". Tucker praised Lady Gaga's performances in the television special, saying they were a \"warm, low-key collection of solid performances of her hits and pop standards\". Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times said that while viewers might have thought they were viewing a \"dream or a hallucination\", they were watching \"an actual holiday special\". The Guardian s Hadley Freeman wrote, \"It was all inoffensive, silly and knowing, and laid down the groundwork for what looks likely to be the singer's next career: as America's in-house eccentric, fearless enough to satirize the country's traditions but canny enough to know that while you can deface as many Irving Berlin songs as you like, the turkey is non-negotiable.\" In contrast, A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was panned by Jen Carlson of Gothamist, who felt that it was a \"very transparent marketing ploy for the new Gaga holiday release\". The Washington Post Sarah Anne Hughes wrote that she was shocked at how traditional Gaga was in the television special. Cavan Sieczkowski of the International Business Times described A Very Gaga Thanksgiving as a \"charming throwback to holiday specials of times past\". Sieczkowski praised the outfits and drew comparisons to those of Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner. Joe Drake agreed, writing on TVology: \"This special was [fabulous]. I have nothing bad to say about it. Lady Gaga proves, yet again, that she is the artist of our generation. Her talent, beauty, personality and spirit make her such an incredible person to look up to and respect.\" At the 2012 Dorian Awards, the special was nominated in the category of Best TV Musical Program of the Year but lost to Glee and Gaga's own concert special, Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden."

At their first stop, the National Tramway Museum, Chris confronts a man who is littering, and the man refuses to pick up his rubbish. When they get back to their car, Chris runs him over and kills him. Chris claims that the death was an accident, but smirks after the impact, unseen by Tina. Chris tells Tina that she is his muse. They meet Janice, Ian and their dog Banjo (who resembles Poppy) at a caravan park and Janice reveals that Ian is a published writer, something that makes Chris jealous. The next morning Ian goes for a walk. Chris follows him, hits him in the head with a rock, steals his camera and pushes him off a cliff. Tina takes Banjo with them as they go. Tina finds photos of Ian and Janice on the camera and confronts Chris, who confesses to Ian's murder. Tina accepts this. During a walk through a National Trust park, Banjo defecates on the ground and a tourist tells Tina to clear up the mess. Chris arrives and encourages Tina to claim that the man tried to rape her. A row ensues, and Chris beats him to death. At the next caravan park, Chris meets Martin, an engineer who is testing a mini-caravan that can be attached to the back of a bicycle. During a meal in a restaurant, Tina goes to the bathroom. When she returns, she finds Chris kissing the bride from the hen party at a nearby table as part of a bachelorette dare. Upset, Tina follows the bride outside and kills her by pushing her down a steep hill onto some rocks, observed by Chris. The next morning, instead of visiting a local tourist attraction, Chris says he is helping Martin make some modifications to his caravan. They argue, and Tina drives off alone. Upset, she calls her mother and is about to confess to the murders, when her mother hangs up. Later that night, Tina tries to seduce Chris by talking about their complicity in the murders, but he rejects her. Chris wakes up to find Tina has left him sleeping in the caravan and is speeding down the highway. He calls her and tells her to pull over. Tina notices a jogger and runs him over. Chris is upset with her chaotic approach to the murders, believing himself to be justified in his choice of victims, and they argue before hiding the body at the side of the road. They drive to a mountain, where they set up camp with the Ribblehead Viaduct in sight, the final destination on their holiday. When a hailstorm forces them back inside the caravan, Chris falls asleep and Tina looks at his notebook, finding a drawing of her and Chris standing on the viaduct, about to jump. Martin arrives, with Banjo in the mini-caravan. While Chris is outside, Tina tries to seduce Martin, who is made uncomfortable by her advances and rejects her. When Chris returns, she tells him that Martin propositioned her in a particularly implausible and repulsive manner. Martin returns to his mini-caravan, and Chris and Tina have a fight over whether the dog should be called by the name \"Poppy\" or \"Banjo\". Upset, Tina pushes Martin's mini-caravan off the cliff, with him still in it. She re-enters their caravan and tells Chris that the problem is over. He runs outside, and finds Martin's dead body. He insults Tina and they fight, which ends in them having sex. Chris sets the caravan on fire and kisses Tina. They run to the Ribblehead Viaduct and climb to the top, holding hands. Chris asks Tina if she enjoyed the holiday and she says it was brilliant. He apologises for insulting her and asks if she really wants to kill herself. Just as Chris steps off the viaduct, Tina lets go of his hand, watching as he falls to the ground and dies. Tina stares at her hand as the screen cuts to black."

        "content": "The characters came together seven years before the film came as a stage experience with Lowe and Oram appearing as innocent campers who slowly revealed they were serial killers. A short film was later produced and was sent to several production companies, however despite being found to be funny, the pitch kept getting turned down for being too dark. They put the short online, and it generated some buzz, and Lowe sent the link to Edgar Wright, with whom she had worked on Hot Fuzz. Wright saw potential for a feature and put them in touch with a production company, Big Talk, who, with Wright on board as an executive producer, greenlit the project. Lowe and Oram did research into horror literature and even took a caravanning holiday, in character and with a cameraman, to the locations that would go on to be featured in the film. Ben Wheatley has said that all the locations were very helpful, even after they explained the nature of the film, because they \"tried to make sure that it was open and fair to places, and that they weren\u2019t the butt of jokes.\" The two were also inspired by Withnail and I."

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Director Ben Wheatley and writer-stars Alice Lowe and Steve Oram deliver a wicked road trip movie that successfully walks the line between dark comedy and horror.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Peter Bradshaw reviewed the film twice for The Guardian, first after its preview at Cannes, when he suggested \"Wheatley could be suffering from difficult third album syndrome: this is not as mysterious and interesting as Kill List; its effects are more obvious and the encounters between the naturalistically conceived antiheroes and the incidental, sketch-comedy posh characters is a little uneasy. By the end, I got the sense that in terms of character and narrative the film was running out of ideas \u2013 just a bit.\" However, he viewed it again on its theatrical release and admitted that \"when I first saw it, I think I might have got out of bed the right side\" going on to say \"a second viewing has further revealed just how superb are the effortless performances of Steve Oram and Alice Lowe, who are the movie's writers (working with Wheatley's longtime co-writer Amy Jump), and whose creative ownership makes a purely auteurist comparison with Kill List slightly less relevant.\" He suggests a number of parallels: \"an obvious comparison with Mike Leigh's Nuts in May, and there are even traces of Victoria Wood and Alan Bennett, whose gentler, observational comedy is turned into something nightmarish, bringing in an exquisitely horrible Readers' Wives aesthetic\", concluding that \"[t]he chilling and transgressive flourishes are carried off with deadpan confidence; it's a distinctive and brutally unsettling piece of work.\" Kim Newman wrote in Empire magazine that Sightseers is a \"uniquely British blend of excruciating comedy of embarrassment and outright grue, not quite as disorientating in its mood shifts as Kill List but just as impressive a film.\" The Guardian asked an editor of Caravan Magazine for his opinion and he thought the film, which he described as \"absolutely brilliant\", accurately captured the details of caravanning holidays. However, the praise wasn't unanimous. The Financial Times' Nigel Andrews' conclusion was \"There are a few laughs; a few wise nods. But before the end fatigue arrives and doesn\u2019t go away.\" The film went on to receive seven BIFA Nominations, including best supporting actress for Eileen Davies, and winning the award for Best Screenplay."

David Hinkley of the New York Daily News gave the series 1 out of 5 stars and said \"[it] was clearly designed to be good silly fun. It nails one out of three. It's silly.\" He called the First Family \"annoying... sitcom stereotypes\" and said that it \"mines none of the more subtle and satisfying possibilities of poking fun at a staid institution. It's more like a drug-fueled Saturday Night Live sketch that won't end. Fortunately, 1600 Penn probably will.\" Tim Surette of TV.com said that the show is \"what happens when network executives think a screeching buffoon equals laughs\" and that the jokes elicit responses of \"mostly tumbleweeds and cricket chirps\". Paste'''s Ross Bonaime also criticized the characters and said, \"please, oh please, make the show actually funny... maybe it should just be put out of its misery.\" Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger graded the show a \"D\" and said, \"you'd be forgiven for thinking [it] was a relic of the 1980s or 1990s\", adding that the show was looking for \"viewers who have lax requirements about actual humor in their comedies.\" Paul Meekin of Star Pulse noted that the show was unable to escape the footprint of The West Wing and wondered if it was \"a years-late West Wing parody, a humorous and fresh take on presidential politics, or somewhere in between?\" answering, \"it's neither. It's actually quite godawful.\" One less critical review came from Hank Stuever of The Washington Post, who called it \"formulaic\" but said, \"give a few points to 1600 Penn for trying.\" He also noted that \"there's no danger of a partisan storyline or any resemblance to the current administration.\" Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post called Josh Gad \"by far the best thing about this show\" and hoped that if the show were cancelled, he find a better vehicle for his talents."

It was written by executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Nick Hurran. The episode features the alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) being captured by the Daleks, along with his companions Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), who are about to divorce. They are sent by the Daleks to the Asylum, a planet where insane Daleks are exiled, to enable the Asylum to be destroyed before the insane Daleks can escape. The Doctor is helped along the way by Oswin (Jenna-Louise Coleman), a woman whose spaceship had crashed on the planet a year ago and has been trapped there since then. \"Asylum of the Daleks\" incorporates many of the different varieties of Daleks seen throughout the programme's 50-year history, and was intended to make the Daleks scary again. Coleman makes her first appearance in Doctor Who in this episode, before returning as the Doctor's new companion in the 2012 Christmas special; her appearance was successfully kept a secret from the general public prior to the episode's broadcast, as her casting as the new companion had already been announced. The episode was watched by 8.33 million viewers in the UK, and received attention on BBC iPlayer and international broadcasts.

Joined by him are nearly-divorced Amy and Rory, who have been similarly kidnapped from present-day Earth. The Doctor is surprised when the Daleks ask him for help. The Alaska, a starliner that crashed into a planet housing insane, battle-scarred Daleks called the Asylum, has ruptured the planet's force field, thus risking escape of the insane Daleks. To prevent this, the Parliament wishes to destroy the planet remotely, but the force field is still too strong to allow that. The Daleks task the Doctor, Amy and Rory with deactivating the force field from the planet. After arriving, the Doctor, surmising that the Daleks will destroy the planet as soon as he deactivates the force field, plots an escape via a nearby teleporter which will transport them to the Dalek ship. Oswin, a surviving crew member of the Alaska, agrees to deactivate the force field in return for the Doctor coming to rescue her. Meanwhile, Rory and Amy reconcile their marriage. The Doctor makes his way to Oswin, venturing through a section that holds Daleks who survived encounters with him. Oswin saves the Doctor from these Daleks by removing any memories of him from the Daleks' collective telepathically-shared knowledge. The Doctor enters Oswin's chamber and discovers to his horror that she is a Dalek. Oswin is revealed to have been captured by Daleks after the Alaska crashed on the Asylum and, to preserve her genius-level intellect for Dalek use, was turned into a Dalek. Unable to cope with her conversion, her mind retreated into a fantasy of survival as a human. Oswin fulfils her promise of deactivating the force field, making her final request that the Doctor remember her as the human she once was. The Doctor returns to Amy and Rory, and they teleport back to the TARDIS just as the planet is destroyed. The Daleks fail to recognise the Doctor, revealing the magnitude of Oswin's removal of the Doctor from the Dalek hive intelligence. The Doctor returns Amy and Rory home, where Rory moves back in with Amy."

        "content": "Executive producer Steven Moffat announced in 2011 that he intended to give a \"rest\" to the Daleks. The reason for the rest was that Moffat felt their frequent appearances made them the \"most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe\". Moffat recalled that the Daleks were remembered for being scary, but due to their legacy as British icons they had become \"cuddly\" over the years and their true menace forgotten; with \"Asylum\" he intended to make them scary again, reminding the audience of their intentions. He thought the best way to do this would be to show Daleks that were considered even madder than usual. Actor Karen Gillan admitted that she had not been scared of the Daleks before working on the episode. It is also the first Dalek story Moffat has written for the show; he stated that he \"couldn't resist\" the opportunity. In March 2012, it was announced that Jenna-Louise Coleman would replace Gillan and Arthur Darvill as the next companion, first appearing in the 2012 Christmas special. It was Moffat's idea to have her appear in \"Asylum of the Daleks\" as the character of Oswin; it was not originally planned, and Coleman assumed it was part of her audition at first to see which character fitted her best. He intended to keep her appearance a secret, and thanked the press and fans that it was not leaked. Coleman's scenes were filmed over six days on a closed set with a green screen which she acted to. Whether her later character was the same as Oswin was not confirmed at the time, but her appearance in \"The Snowmen\" makes it clear that there is a connection. Coleman played each version of the character as individuals with \"trust that there would be a payoff\" to her mystery. \"Asylum of the Daleks\" was directed by Nick Hurran, who directed \"The Girl Who Waited\" and \"The God Complex\" of the previous series, as well as the fifth episode of the seventh series. \"Asylum of the Daleks\" contains many of the Dalek types that the Doctor has faced over the years, including the Special Weapons Dalek from the 1988 story Remembrance of the Daleks. According to The Daily Telegraph, the production team located the remaining models of the various versions of the Daleks and shipped them to the studios in Cardiff Bay. This included a Dalek owned by Russell T Davies, Moffat's predecessor. Executive producer Caroline Skinner knew Davies well and asked to borrow his replica. She stated that he was \"thrilled\" that it was canonised. The total number of different Daleks was around 25, with models from 1963 to 2010; Skinner said that \"there was just a real magic and sense of history about having them\". Moffat was concerned about how all the different Daleks would look together, but was pleased once he saw them; he commented that the diversity made them look like a species, rather than identical robots. Many of the props were built from scratch. The snow scenes on the asylum planet were filmed in Spain during the production of \"A Town Called Mercy\". Music featured in the episode are the \"Habanera\" from the Georges Bizet opera Carmen, which is used diegetically, and \"Feel the Love\" by Rudimental is also featured. The Doctor Who logo in the title sequence featured the texture of a Dalek, in keeping with the varied \"blockbuster\" themes for each of the opening titles of the first half of the series."

Dan Martin of The Guardian praised Moffat's \"script packed with ace curveballs and zappy dialogue\" and Nick Hurran's direction. Martin also notes that \"more happened in the opening episode than has been covered in most recent two-parters \u2013 and events were also dealt with in a lot more depth.\" He also was pleased that the asylum setting could explore the Daleks while making it reminiscent of the classic series. The Daily Telegraph reviewer Gavin Fuller gave it four out of five stars, describing it as a \"confident opener\" and highlighting the concept and set design of the asylum. He particularly praised Coleman, whom he called \"the star of the episode\". Michael Hogan, also writing for The Telegraph, gave \"Asylum of the Daleks\" a slightly higher rating of four and a half stars out of five, also commending Coleman as well as many details of the script. Neela Debnath of The Independent commented positively on the show's continuing exploration of the Daleks and the more \"adult tone\", praising the performance of the three leads. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern stated that it \"ticks all [his] boxes as a Doctor Who fan of more than 40 years standing\", describing it as \"clever, fast, funny, eerie, surprising and tearjerking\". Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it a \"strong, cinematically-minded series opener\" which succeeded in making the Daleks scary. He also praised Coleman's debut, Matt Smith's performance, the special effects, and Amy and Rory's emotional subplot. io9 reviewer Charlie Jane Anders noted that the plot \"is mostly just an excuse to explore the Doctor's ongoing relationship with the Daleks, and to show how sad it's gotten\". Both Anders and Mulkern (the latter citing a Doctor Who veteran, Katy Manning) noted that Oswin's fascination with eggs, required for making souffl\u00e9s, is really just a mental trick to block out the \"exterminate\" (\"eggs-terminate\") conditioning; this literary device is woven throughout the episode as a series of subtle hints, as Rory is confused by a dormant Dalek, initially misinterpreting him as saying \"eggs\". Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery also awarded it five stars, though he felt Amy and Rory's breakup was \"a little difficult to buy\" as it was resolved quickly, even if the situation was \"sensitively handled\" and \"deftly performed\". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded \"Asylum of the Daleks\" as a \"B+\", also writing that he had a \"quibble\" with the Ponds' marriage issue as it had not been foreshadowed, but ultimately felt that the episode \"gets the season off to a great start while creating a sense that anything could happen\". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode as 8.5 out of 10, finding that the \"only downside\" was that \"it felt less a tale about the Daleks than an adventure that just happened to have them in it\". Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post'', felt it was a \"ripping start to the season\" that redeemed the Daleks from \"Victory of the Daleks\". While she commended Gillan and Darvill's acting during Amy and Rory's emotional confrontation, she noted that they were not a couple that would break up because of infertility. The episode was nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form), alongside \"The Angels Take Manhattan\" and \"The Snowmen\"."

It first aired on BBC One in the UK on 8 September 2012 and on BBC America on the same date in the United States. It was written by Chris Chibnall and directed by Saul Metzstein. The episode features alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) accompanied by Rory's father, Brian (Mark Williams), Queen Nefertiti (Riann Steele), and John Riddell, a British big-game hunter (Rupert Graves). The group lands on a large spaceship that contains dinosaurs and discover that it is a Silurian ark, though the Silurians have been murdered by Solomon (David Bradley), a black market trader who is intent on finding something of value. \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\" was conceived to be a fun episode, based on a suggestion from the special effects teams about incorporating dinosaurs into Doctor Who. The storyline and characters were developed between Chibnall and head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat. Due to budget limitations, a wider plot had to be developed because the dinosaurs could not be the centrepiece. The dinosaurs were a mix of props and computer-generated imagery.

The ISA plans to destroy it with missiles unless the Doctor stops it first. He takes Queen Nefertiti of Egypt, Edwardian game hunter John Riddell, companions Amy and Rory, and, inadvertently, Rory's father Brian. Amy discovers the ship is a Silurian ark designed to carry the reptilian humanoids to a new planet along with flora and fauna from their time period to escape a destructive impact.  The ship, however, registers no Silurian life forms left on board. After escaping from a group of pterosaurs in the engine room, the Doctor, Rory and Brian are escorted by two robots to a brutal man called Solomon who has been injured in a raptor attack and requires medical help. Solomon reveals himself to be a lawless exotic black market trader who has raided the spaceship in order to steal the dinosaurs. Having had the robots murder all of the Silurians, Solomon was unable to take control of the ship himself and the computer defaulted to its point of origin, causing it to return to Earth. Discovering Queen Nefertiti's identity and value, he decides to kidnap her and leave in his own ship. Though the Doctor refuses, Nefertiti agrees to go with him to save the others. Meanwhile, the ISA proceeds to fire their missiles at the ark, against the Doctor's wishes. While Amy and Riddell shoot hostile dinosaurs with \"anaesthetic\" guns, the Doctor disables Solomon's robots and rescues Nefertiti, then tricks the ISA missiles into targeting Solomon's ship rather than the ark: it is destroyed, taking him with it. Rory and Brian pilot the ark away from the Earth, as the ship can only be piloted by two people of the same gene chain. The Doctor then takes Amy, Rory and Brian back home where Brian, having overcome his fear of travelling, starts a world tour (with one of his postcards showing the dinosaurs on their new home of Siluria). Nefertiti, who has been flirting and clashing with Riddell, opts to go with him rather than return to her own time."

        "content": "Showrunner Steven Moffat said that putting dinosaurs on a spaceship was \"the secret of success\". The idea to use dinosaurs in Doctor Who came from the special effects teams The Mill and Millennium FX. As \"Asylum of the Daleks\" was a darker opening episode, \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\" is more about fun. In Moffat's pitch to writer Chris Chibnall, he proposed, \"Maybe it's a ship heading towards Earth, and Earth is on alert\". Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episodes \"42\" (2007), \"The Hungry Earth\"/\"Cold Blood\" (2010), as well as work for the spinoff series Torchwood. The Doctor had previously encountered dinosaurs in the 1974 serial Invasion of the Dinosaurs. Moffat suggested the spaceship was Silurian, and Chibnall, who had written the return of the Silurians in \"The Hungry Earth\"/\"Cold Blood\", felt that it was \"a nice reveal and shows you more about them, even in a story that isn\u2019t really about them\". Chibnall suggested including a \"bonkers\" gang of characters picked from around time and space. He felt that Doctor Who could have \"collisions of characters that no other show in the world can do\", and that it was about finding a \"disparate\" group of characters who would \"bounce\" off each other. Nefertiti's decision not to return to her own time fits in with the historical record, as the date and cause of her death are unknown. Chibnall asked to introduce Rory's father, as Amy and Rory would be leaving in four episodes and Rory's family life had not been explored yet. Mark Williams who played Rory's father previously appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio adventure The Eternal Summer. Rupert Graves, who played an Edwardian hunter in this episode, previously worked with Moffat on the BBC series Sherlock. David Bradley's character, Solomon, was modelled on a \"well-known nightclub owner with long hair\". Chibnall described him as \"half businessman, half Somali pirate\". Bradley and Williams had previously worked together on the Harry Potter film franchise. Bradley was later cast as the First Doctor William Hartnell for the 50th anniversary documentary drama An Adventure in Space and Time and reprised his role in the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi)'s last Christmas special episode, Twice Upon a Time. Comedy duo Mitchell and Webb provided the voices of Solomon's two robots; executive producer Caroline Skinner called the casting choice \"perfect\". Richard Hope, who played the Silurian Bleytal, previously appeared as Malohkeh in the episodes \"The Hungry Earth\", \"Cold Blood\" and \"The Wedding of River Song\"."

        "content": "\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\" and the following episode, \"A Town Called Mercy\", were the first episodes to be produced for the seventh series, both directed by Saul Metzstein. The two episodes are Metzstein's first Doctor Who credits. The episode contains one of the biggest sets ever built for the show. The scenes in the \"engine room\" were filmed at Southerndown beach, Vale of Glamorgan in late February 2012. The beach had previously been used as \"Bad Wolf Bay\" in \"Doomsday\" (2006) and \"Journey's End\" (2008), and as the planet Alfava Metraxis in \"The Time of Angels\"/\"Flesh and Stone\" (2010). The production team had to be mindful of the series' budget when planning the effects and sets; Chibnall commented that \"it would be very easy to spend \u00a3300m on this but we don\u2019t have it\". As such, the dinosaurs could not dominate the episode, and Chibnall had to tell \"a big other story\". The scene where Amy, Riddell, and Nefertiti stumble upon a sleeping Tyrannosaurus rex was almost cut as it was originally intended to feature computer-generated (CGI) raptors, which were too expensive. However, Millennium FX realised they could use a baby T-Rex that had been in an exhibit they designed. The episode contains a variety of \"favourite\" dinosaurs; some were built from scratch, while others were CGI. Smith had to wear padded trousers when riding the triceratops, and recalled it was \"a painful couple of hours, a laugh though and definitely worth it\". Half of the triceratops was actually built and pushed by crewmen when Smith, Darvill, and Williams were riding it. The rest of it was filled in with CGI by The Mill. The Doctor Who logo in the title sequence featured the texture of a dinosaur's hide, in keeping with the varied \"blockbuster\" themes for each of the opening five episodes of the series. A preview clip of the episode was released at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International."

        "title": "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship_Critical reception",
        "content": "\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\" received generally positive reviews from critics, with a few detractors. Dan Martin of The Guardian described it as \"fun\", with praise to the expensive-looking sets and dinosaurs, the usefulness of Amy and Rory, and the concept of the gang. While he admitted it was \"flimsy\" and \"pretty much a story built around a title\", he thought it was \"the finest episode two from Doctor Who in some time\". However, he was unsettled by the underscore of darkness that was \"almost disturbing enough to ruin everything\". Similarly, Charlie Anders of io9 called it \"the most fun I can remember Doctor Who being in years\", while also noting gradual distancing between the Doctor and the Ponds and identifying a recurrent theme in this season: the Doctor \"not being recognized\". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was pleased that the \"flawlessly realised\" CGI dinosaurs redeemed the ones seen in Invasion of the Dinosaurs. He also praised Bradley's Solomon and the \"fresh slant\" of having the ark built by Silurians, rather than humans as previously seen in the programme. The A.V. Club Keith Phipps gave it a B, finding that it was formulaic but executed well. Unlike Martin, he enjoyed the dark turns. Will Barber \u2013 Taylor of The Consulting Detective, found the episode \"A mixture between good CGI and a rather nicely paced story means that \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\" keeps you hooked to the end.\" Dave Golder of SFX gave the episode four out of five stars, describing it as \"slight and fluffy and silly, with the occasional creaky bit of plotting ... but enormously entertaining\". He was pleased that the guest characters were played \"straight\" rather than for comedy, and found the dinosaur effects \"great\" and the Silurian twist \"enriching continuity\". However, he felt that the teaser was too fast-paced, Nefertiti was \"rather bland\", and wrote that it was unlikely the Doctor would have a friendship with a big game hunter. IGN's Matt Risley rated \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\" 7 out of 10, noting that it \"isn't going to win any awards for scriptwriting or pathos, but it certainly succeeded on a family-friendly level full of whimsy\". Though he wrote that Brian was \"brilliant\", he overall criticised the \"gang\", feeling that they \"served little purpose other than to inject some conveniently timed plot devices when needed\". He also did not like the \"bickering Marvin the Paranoid Android-lite\" robots. However, Neela Debnath of The Independent enjoyed the gang, writing, \"the more companions there are the more variety it adds to the show because each one has their own flaws and backstory\". Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery was more mixed, giving it three stars out of five. He described it as \"rather over-stuffed\", with Riddell and Nefertiti one-dimensional and under-used. He also criticised the robots and felt that the Doctor leaving Solomon to die might have been \"a step too far\". However, he praised the three leads and Brian, as well as the foreshadowing with Amy and Rory. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph was even more negative, only rating it two stars out of five. He described it as \"ultimately a bit of a mess\", calling the contrast between the \"uneasy mix of the humorous and downright daft\" gang and the \"sinister\" Solomon story \"jarring\". Fuller also noted that the dinosaurs were \"a sideshow to the main plot\". Like Morgan, he also felt that the Doctor's actions at the end would \"sit uneasily within the viewers\"."

He rules from Kusawathie city, with his queen Seelawathie (Veena Jayakody) and two sons, Prince Kusa (Jackson Anthony) and Prince Jayampathi (Roshan Ranawana). Kusa is strong and competent in all crafts, including warfare, but he has an ugly, oil-cake-shaped face. Since he realizes that no woman is likely to marry him, he is not interested in marriage. Nonetheless, his parents, especially mother, urge him to marry. Kusa makes a golden sculpture in a woman's shape and tells his mother that he will marry if she can find a woman who looks like the sculpture. The queen orders two royal servants (Mahinda Pathirage and Mahendra Perera) to take the statue to all other countries and find a woman who looks like the statue. After a long, unsuccessful search, the two royal servants arrive at Madura city, the capital of the Madura kingdom, during the season of the spring festival. Madura is a state under the control of Okkaka's empire. They place the statue near the river. Then the nanny of the royal family of Madura kingdom, Kudi ( A hunchbacked woman) (Chandani Seneviratne), comes there and slaps the statue because she recognized the sculpture as the Princess Pabawathie (Pooja Umashankar), the daughter of King Madu (Palitha Silva), the king of Madura Kingdom and his queen (Kusum Renu). Because the woman who looks like the statue has been found, the marriage is arranged. Pabawathie is taken to Kusawathie city, and the wedding is conducted without a groom. Seelawathie tells Pabawathie that there is a tradition in their caste that the wife shall not see the husband until she becomes pregnant. Kusa disguises himself as a workman and sees Pabawathie at a stable of horses and elephants. He jokes. Pabawathie urges Seelawathie to show Kusa. She makes both brothers climb onto an elephant and shows both of them. Pabawathie thinks that handsome Jayampathi is her husband Kusa. When she is bathing in a pond he hides under the waterlily leaves and catches her hand. Then she identifies him as Kusa and realizes that she was cheated. She leaves for her home, Madura. Brokenhearted, Kusa goes to Madura and works as a cook, a potter, and a florist for the royal palace. He prepares and sends delicious food, beautiful pottery, and garlands to Pabawathie. She throws them away after knowing that they were sent by Kusa. News spread in other states that Kusa and Pabawathie are divorced. So seven state kings come to war against King Madu for Pabawathie. Okkaka requests Pabawathie return to Kusawathie. She refuses. Okkaka orders she is cut into seven pieces, and he plans to give those pieces to seven state kings. Just before her death, armed Kusa comes and saves her, stating that she is his wife and no one should harm her. A rain falls. His face's ugliness is washed away. Kusa and Pabawathie happily return to Kusawathi. Okkaka gives the crown to Kusa, making him the emperor."

Rory tries to convince River Song to help, but she insists that she cannot since this battle is where the Doctor will learn of her true identity. At Demon's Run, Amy has been held by Madame Kovarian, and has taken her infant daughter Melody Pond. Amy befriends human soldier Lorna Bucket who had met the Doctor before as a child on her home planet; Lorna gives her a good luck token with Melody's name, written in the language of the Gamma Forests, on it. Aided by additional Silurian and Judoon forces, the Doctor and his allies which owe him debts secure the base, find Amy, and reclaim Melody from Kovarian. The Doctor celebrates his victory, but Madame Vastra informs him that Kovarian had been scanning Melody and found traces of Time Lord DNA; she asks if Melody could have been conceived while Amy and Rory were in flight through the Vortex in the TARDIS. The Doctor realises this is what happened. Lorna arrives too late to warn the group about Kovarian's trap. The TARDIS is blocked by a force field, and her army of Headless Monks attack, killing many Silurians, fatally wounding Strax and Lorna, and beheading Dorium before they can end the battle. Kovarian contacts the Doctor, elated to have been able to fool him twice, and reveals she will use Melody as a weapon against him. She sends a signal to cause Melody, made of Flesh, to disintegrate in Amy's arms, with the real Melody in her possession. River Song arrives and the Doctor berates her for not helping. River shows the Doctor Lorna's token for Amy, and the Doctor sets off in the TARDIS excitedly, telling River to return the survivors of the battle home. Amy demands River explain what the Doctor saw. She shows them Lorna's gift with Melody's name on it, and as the TARDIS translation circuits engage, River explains that Lorna's people in the Gamma Forests have no word for \"pond\", the only water in the forest is the river; the words come out to be \"River Song\".

        "content": "\"A Good Man Goes to War\" is the seventh episode of series six and also the 777th episode of Doctor Who, but there are no seven puns as the production team did not realise this until after shooting. The episode's idea stemmed from lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat wondering if the Doctor, who was typically a pacifist, could be provoked enough to assemble an army. The Headless Monks were first mentioned in \"The Time of Angels\", added to that episode's script to help explain the monastic look of the Delirium Archive the Doctor and Amy were visiting. Similar troops also known as \"Clerics\" appeared in \"The Time of Angels\"/\"Flesh and Stone\"; Moffat stated it seemed many armies in the future in Doctor Who were of religious origin. The possibility of the English word \"doctor\" originating from the Doctor was a notion made by Moffat on Usenet in 1995. Moffat had planned the revelation about River Song \"for a long time\"; when creating Amy, he chose \"Pond\" for her last name to create a link. Moffat intended for the \"answer to be as complicated as the question\". Moffat informed actor Alex Kingston of the secrets of her character at the end of the previous series and she was not allowed to tell anyone; lead actors Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, and Arthur Darvill were unaware of the identity of her character. River's identity was kept in top secrecy; the script read at the read-through had a false ending, and only a select few were issued the real script. The episode sees the return of several minor characters. Dorium previously appeared in \"The Pandorica Opens\", while Henry and Toby Avery from \"The Curse of the Black Spot\" and the Spitfire pilot Danny Boy from \"Victory of the Daleks\" make cameos. Moffat said he planned writing in a cameo for John Barrowman to reprise his role as Jack Harkness, but Barrowman was busy filming Torchwood: Miracle Day and was unavailable. Originally the episode contained a scene with Ood Sigma, previously seen in \"Planet of the Ood\", \"The Waters of Mars\", and \"The End of Time\", but it was cut from the final episode. Russell T Davies is still listed in the credits for creating the Ood."

A Cardiff alleyway was dressed to look like a Victorian street for a brief introduction scene with Vastra, while a hotel bar in Cardiff was used for Dorium's nightclub. Demon's Run was filmed in a military base and hangar in Cardiff. Steam was added to the set to give it a more spaceship-like feel. The army of clerics was made larger with visual effects. The set used for the chamber Amy was kept in was the same used as the Oval Office in \"The Impossible Astronaut\"/\"Day of the Moon\". Baby Melody Pond was played by twins, a common practice used in filming so that one twin can rest while the other is on set. The twins were three months old. Gillan and Darvill were both nervous about holding the infants, but they felt it added to their acting. Gillan stated the episode showed a different side of Amy and thought female viewers would sympathise with her. The Headless Monks were played by stuntmen, and so the actors were free to improvise on their choreography when fighting them. For the scene in which the hoods of the Headless Monks are pulled back, a shoulderpiece was created for actors who were shorter than the ones who normally portrayed the monks. Dan Starkey, who plays the Sontaran Commander Strax, previously appeared as Sontarans in \"The Sontaran Stratagem\" / \"The Poison Sky\" (2008) and \"The End of Time\" (2010). Neve McIntosh, who played the Silurian Warrior Vastra, previously played the sisters Alaya and Restac in \"The Hungry Earth\" / \"Cold Blood\" (2010).

Fuller also noted the revelation of River Song being Amy's grown up child \"is perhaps a narrative strand which would sit uncomfortably with a series where loss has often been brushed off as soon as the next couple of episodes\". However, he did have praise for the performance of Smith's Doctor, commenting \"the last few weeks have seen Matt Smith's Doctor in a welcome generally more serious vein, which he kept up here, with leavening at the right moments where his alien lack of comfort with human emotions, although used to comic effect, rang very true, as did his awkwardness when discovering the truth about River\". Dan Martin of The Guardian was less favourable, stating the producers \"promised us a cliffhanger, and now we're left the whole summer long to contemplate whether our favourite show can really have just dropped the ball. Oh there was plenty to love about this mid-season finale, and even more to pick over. But as an hour of drama it was all over the place\". Because the episode was so fast-paced with little being explained, he did not feel any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket. Unlike Fuller, Martin was not favourable to Smith's Doctor, stating \"the non-event of the battle means the Doctor never really gets to show this dark side we've been hearing so much about\" and that Smith's predecessor, David Tennant, \"got angrier most weeks\". Martin did have praise for the final reveal of the episode, stating that although it had been \"hidden in plain view from the very beginning as soon as it's revealed Amy has called the baby Melody\", he was unable to make the connection and was suitably surprised. Martin later rated it the second-to-worst episode of the series, though the finale was not included in the list. The episode was nominated for the 2012 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form), though it lost to Neil Gaiman's episode \"The Doctor's Wife\". Two of the new characters introduced in the episode, a 19th-century crimefighter Silurian named Madame Vastra and her assistant Jenny Flint have proven quite popular among fans, with numerous forums and SFX calling for the BBC to commission a spin-off series. Moffat stated in an interview that he did not have time to work on a spin-off but was open to the possibility of the characters returning. Vastra and Jenny, as well as a revived Strax, were made a recurring part of the seventh series and given a Big Finish audio spin-off series in 2019."

        "content": "In 1978, con artists Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser have started a relationship, and are working together. Sydney has improved Rosenfeld's scams, posing as English aristocrat \"Lady Edith Greensly\". Irving loves Sydney, but is hesitant to leave his unstable and histrionic wife Rosalyn, fearing he will lose contact with his adopted son Danny. Rosalyn has also threatened to report Irving to the police if he leaves her. FBI agent Richie DiMaso catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam, but offers to release them if Irving can line up four additional arrests. Richie believes Sydney is English, but has proof that her claim of aristocracy is fraudulent. Sydney tells Irving she will manipulate Richie, distancing herself from Irving. Irving has a friend pretending to be a wealthy Arab sheikh looking for potential investments in America. An associate of Irving's suggests the sheikh do business with Mayor Carmine Polito of Camden, New Jersey, who is trying to revitalize gambling in Atlantic City, but has struggled to find investors. Carmine seems to have a genuine desire to help the area's economy and his constituents. Richie devises a plan to make Mayor Polito the target of a sting operation, despite the objections of Irving and of Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen. Sydney helps Richie manipulate an FBI secretary into making an unauthorized wire transfer of $2 million. When Stoddard's boss, Anthony Amado, hears of the operation, he praises Richie's initiative, pressuring Stoddard to continue. Carmine leaves their meeting when Richie presses him to accept a cash bribe. Irving convinces Carmine the sheikh is legitimate, expressing his dislike of Richie, and the two become friends. Richie arranges for Carmine to meet the sheikh, and without consulting the others, has Mexican-American FBI agent Paco Hernandez play the sheikh, which displeases Irving. Carmine brings the sheikh to a casino party, explaining that mobsters are there, and that it is a necessary part of doing business. Irving is surprised to hear that Mafia boss Victor Tellegio, right-hand man to Meyer Lansky, is present, and that he wants to meet the sheikh. Tellegio explains that the sheikh needs to become an American citizen, and that Carmine will need to expedite the process. Tellegio also requires a $10 million wire transfer to prove the sheikh's legitimacy. Richie confesses his strong attraction to Sydney, but becomes confused and aggressive when she drops her English accent and admits to being from Albuquerque. Rosalyn starts an affair with mobster Pete Musane, whom she met at the party. She mentions her belief that Irving is working with the IRS, causing Pete to threaten Irving, who promises to prove the sheikh's investment is real. Irving later confronts Rosalyn, who admits she told Pete and agrees to keep quiet, but wants a divorce. With Carmine's help, Richie and Irving videotape members of Congress receiving bribes. Richie assaults Stoddard in a fight over the money, and later convinces Amado that he needs the $10 million to get Tellegio, but gets only $2 million. A meeting is arranged at the offices of Tellegio's lawyer, Alfonse Simone, but Tellegio does not appear. Irving visits Carmine and admits to the scam, but says he has a plan to help him. Carmine throws Irving out, and the loss of their friendship deeply upsets Irving. The federal agents inform Irving that their $2 million are missing, and that they have received an anonymous offer to return the money in exchange for Irving and Sydney's immunity and a reduced sentence for Carmine. It is revealed that Alfonse Simone, with whom Richie had arranged the wire transfer, was a con man working with Irving and Sydney. Amado accepts the deal, and Stoddard removes Richie from the case, which ends his career. The Congressmen are prosecuted, and so is Carmine, who is sentenced to 18 months in prison. Irving and Sydney move in together and open a legitimate art gallery, while Rosalyn lives with Pete and shares custody of Danny with Irving."

The website's critical consensus reads: \"Riotously funny and impeccably cast, American Hustle compensates for its flaws with unbridled energy and some of David O. Russell's most irrepressibly vibrant direction.\" Metacritic gives a score of 90 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Christy Lemire awarded the film four out of four stars, praising David O. Russell's directing and the relationship between Irving and Sydney, as well as Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Rosalyn. She writes: \"For all its brashness and big personality, American Hustle is a character study at its core\u2014an exploration of dissatisfaction and drive, and the lengths to which we're willing to go for that elusive thing known as a better life.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film an A+, especially complimenting Bradley Cooper's performance and stating that American Hustle was \"the best time I've had at the movies all year\". He later named it the year's best film. Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote: \"American Hustle is an urban eruption of flat-out fun \u2014 the sharpest, most exhilarating comedy in years. Anyone who says otherwise must be conning you.\" Peter Debruge of Variety was critical of the film, calling it \"a sloppy sprawl of a movie\" and complaining that the improvisational performances overwhelm, instead of adding to a coherent plot. He also went on to write that it \"makes your brain hurt \u2014 and worse, overwhelms the already over-complicated Abscam re-telling at the center of the film\"."

In real life, Brodeur has written books including The Zapping of America about the dangers of microwave radiation, but claims that he has never stated that the process removes a food's nutrition. The defendants immediately filed a motion under California's anti-SLAPP statute to strike the complaint and award them attorney fees, which the trial court initially denied. The decision was reversed by the California Court of Appeal, which held that the motion should have been granted because \"the general tenor of American Hustle, the entirely farcical nature of the 'science oven' scene, and the ditzy nature of the character uttering the allegedly defamatory statement, all indicate that an audience would not expect anything Rosalyn says to reflect objective fact\" and that, in view of this, Brodeur \"failed to carry his burden of showing a probability of prevailing on his defamation claim\"."

        "content": "American Hustle is a dramatization of the FBI's \"Abscam\" sting operation in the late 1970s and early '80s that led to the convictions of seven members of the United States Congress, among others. The film does not attempt to directly document the events of Abscam. The names are changed, and the film begins with the on-screen message, \"Some of this actually happened\". Major departures from reality include: In the film, Irving Rosenfeld begins a life of criminality when he smashes storefront windows as a child in order to provide more work for his father's glass-installation business. In real life, Melvin Weinberg began working for his father only as an adult. He did smash windows at that point, and according to one article after Abscam was revealed, it was indeed done to shore up business for Weinberg's father. A later report states that it was done at the behest of the local union, to punish businesses who used non-union glaziers. In the film, Camden Mayor Carmine Polito is shown as a selfless politician who gets involved in the scam only to provide jobs to his constituents; Irving feels so bad for Carmine that he engineers a reduced sentence for him. In reality, Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti had a reputation for committing crimes, despite being widely praised for caring about the people of Camden. During the Abscam operation, he offered to get the fake sheik into illegal businesses such as money counterfeiting and drug smuggling. Though Weinberg developed a fondness for Errichetti as a man who \"didn't beat around the bush\", he made no attempt to protect Errichetti from prosecution. Evelyn Knight, Weinberg's mistress on whom the character of Sydney Prosser is based, was involved in Weinberg's scams, though to a lesser extent than shown in the film; and she was not involved in Abscam. She was also English, not an American impersonating an English woman as shown in the film. Weinberg's wife Cynthia Marie Weinberg, the basis for Rosalyn Rosenfeld, is not known to have had an affair with someone from the mafia, nor did she nearly blow Weinberg's cover. She was also of similar age to Melvin Weinberg, while the character of Rosalyn is portrayed as being significantly younger than her husband. The character of Richie DiMaso is based to some extent on federal agent Tony Amoroso, although in real life Amoroso was just one of a number of agents involved in setting up and executing the scam. In the film, the sheik is impersonated by a Mexican-American FBI agent. In real life, the sheik was played by two different agents: first briefly by an Irish-American, Mike Denehy, who spoke no Arabic, then by a Lebanese-American."

He's lived hard and been on the edge for a long time. Multiple marriages, rehab, even rehab in wine country. Trust me, I've done the research myself.\"  During the time since Simon was divorced by Sydney's mom, he has been married several times, and genuinely wants to be a part of his daughter's life. He adds Sydney to the executive partnership after she improves his business and adds her name to the agency before the start of the series. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Sydney Roberts: Simon's daughter is also a business partner and director at the ad agency. Her character often played the \"straight woman\" to Simon's plans; raised by her mother after Simon was divorced, she does not fault him for being more involved with work than his family. Despite this, Sydney often uses her past growing up as justification for her business decisions. She has romantic feelings for her best friend, Andrew, but she chooses not to date him, as she values their friendship more and is concerned about the consequences of a break-up. James Wolk as Zach Cropper, a copywriter: He is a charismatic but shallow womanizer who does not know much about the advertising business. He has an on again/off again physical relationship with Lauren. His colleagues and he often use good looks as an additional advantage in getting clients. Zach enjoys a natural camaraderie with Simon, often bouncing ideas off of each other and brainstorming together. Hamish Linklater as Andrew Keanelly, an art director: Andrew is well-spoken, smart, and often on Sydney's side as the other voice of reason among the staff at their agency. He has a sarcastic, \"down-to-earth\" personality in contrast to Zach's occasional overconfidence. Andrew also suffers from a lack of confidence, as a part of a larger rural-based family (he refers himself to being \"one of seven sisters\"). He has a crush on Sydney, who reciprocates these feelings, but is hesitant to start a relationship with him, so respects her wishes to stay friends. Amanda Setton as Lauren Slotsky, an assistant: Lauren usually comes across as dim-witted, but is described as \"much smarter than she first appears\", with a vast knowledge of sharks and talent in poetry. She is bisexual as she occasionally likes to date with both men and women."

Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy wrote that \"Williams can't resist falling back on his old bag of tricks on occasion \u2013 cartoon voices, gurning, rambling wordplay \u2013 but there's a decent amount of pathos to his performance as part-buffoon, part-genius Simon Roberts too and the comedy veteran shares a warm, genuine chemistry with his on-screen offspring Gellar.\" Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote, \"Whether The Crazy Ones can come together as a series over time remains an open question, but the pilot offers enough charm and humor to warrant future consideration.\" The Washington Post wrote that the pilot \"leaves you wanting more\", and gave the pilot a grade of B-.  According to Ross Bonaime of Paste, \"I don\u2019t know how it does it, but The Crazy Ones continues to be one of the most boring comedies with one of the most amazing casts on the air today.\"  He continues to say \"The entire show is just treading on 'meh.' It also feels like this show just exists in a vacuum, with nothing in any prior episode really having an effect on anything that comes after it. There are no continuing story arcs, nor any real characters to really bond with.\" The Boston Herald gave the show a negative review, noting that \"Williams seems exhausted.\" The 'pilot' episode's positive reviews were also for guest star Kelly Clarkson; website 'ET Online' claimed she was a 'front runner' for an Emmy nomination in 2014 for Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. Website 'Gold Derby' said that the lack of Golden Globe nominations for the show, for Best Comedy, Lead Actress (for Gellar) and Lead Actor (for Williams) was a 'snub'. David E. Kelley became particularly critical of the show and said: \"The show wasn\u2019t very good. It started off with great ratings, but after watching three or four episodes, I thought the storytelling was pretty bad... Robin Williams was great... but the stories made me want to hold my nose.\u201d"

        "content": "Blade Runner 2049 is a 2017 American neo-noir science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green. A sequel to the 1982 film Blade Runner, the film stars Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, with Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Carla Juri, Lennie James, Dave Bautista, and Jared Leto in supporting roles. Ford and Edward James Olmos reprise their roles from the original film. Gosling plays K, a Nexus-9 replicant \"blade runner\" who uncovers a secret that threatens to destabilize society and the course of civilization. Ideas for a Blade Runner sequel were first proposed in the 1990s, but licensing issues stalled their development. Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson obtained the film rights from Bud Yorkin. Ridley Scott stepped down as the film's initial director and worked as an executive producer, while Villeneuve was later appointed to direct. Blade Runner 2049 was financed through a partnership between Alcon Entertainment and Sony Pictures, as well as a Hungarian government-funded tax rebate. Warner Bros., on behalf of Alcon, distributed the film in North America, while Sony handled distribution in international markets. Principal photography took place mostly at two soundstages in Budapest over four months from July to November 2016. Blade Runner 2049 premiered in Los Angeles on October 3, 2017, and was released in the United States in 2D, 3D, and IMAX on October 6, 2017. The film received acclaim from critics, who praised its performances, direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, musical score, production design, visual effects, and faithfulness to the original film. It was widely considered among the best films of 2017. However, it was a box office disappointment, grossing $259.3million worldwide against a production budget between $150\u2013185million. Blade Runner 2049 was nominated for and won several accolades: at the 90th Academy Awards, the film won Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Production Design. It also received eight nominations at the 71st British Academy Film Awards, including Best Director, and won Best Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects. A sequel series, Blade Runner 2099, is in development at Amazon Studios, with Scott set to return as executive producer."

        "content": "In 2049, bioengineered humans known as replicants are slaves. K (short for his serial number, KD6-3.7), a Nexus-9 replicant, works for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as a \"blade runner\", an officer who hunts and \"retires\" (kills) rogue replicants. He retires Nexus-8 replicant Sapper Morton and finds a box buried under a tree at Morton's protein farm. The box contains the remains of a female replicant who died during a cesarean section, demonstrating that replicants can reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, Lt. Joshi, fears that this could lead to a war between humans and replicants. She orders K to find and retire the replicant child to hide the truth. K visits the Wallace Corporation's headquarters, the successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. Wallace staff members identify the deceased female from DNA archives as Rachael, an experimental replicant designed by Dr. Eldon Tyrell. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner Rick Deckard. Wallace Corporation CEO Niander Wallace wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar colonization. He sends his replicant enforcer Luv to steal Rachael's remains and follow K to Rachael's child. At Morton's farm, K finds 6.10.21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicant memories are artificial, K's holographic AI girlfriend Joi believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. He searches LAPD records and discovers twins born on that date with identical DNA aside from the sex chromosome, but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined San Diego but discovers the records from that year to be missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse where he remembers hiding it. Dr Ana Stelline, a replicant memory designer, confirms that the memory of the orphanage is real, leading K to conclude that he is Rachael's son. At LAPD headquarters, K fails a post-traumatic baseline test, marking him as a rogue replicant; he lies to Joshi by implying he killed the replicant child. Joshi gives K 48 hours to pass the baseline test or he will be 'retired.' Joi hires Mariette, a prostitute replicant, as a surrogate for Joi to have sex with K. Mariette, who is part of the replicant freedom movement, leaves a tracker on K. At Joi's request, K reluctantly transfers her to a mobile emitter so he cannot be tracked through her console memory-files. He has the toy horse analyzed, revealing traces of radiation that lead him to the ruins of Las Vegas. He finds Deckard, who tells him that he is the father of Rachael's child and scrambled the birth records to protect the child's identity; Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement. Luv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves K to die. Using Mariette's tracker, the replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, Freysa, tells him that she helped deliver Rachael's child and that the child was a girl, K understands that he is not Rachael's child, deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the memory of the toy horse is hers, one she implanted amongst those of other replicants whose memories she designed. To prevent Deckard from leading Wallace to Stelline or the freedom movement, Freysa asks K to kill Deckard for all replicants' greater good. Luv takes Deckard to Wallace Corporation headquarters to meet Wallace. Wallace offers Deckard a clone of Rachael in exchange for revealing what he knows. Deckard refuses, and Luv kills the clone. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured and interrogated off-world, K intercepts Luv's shuttle and tries to rescue Deckard. He fights Luv and ultimately drowns her, but he is mortally wounded. He stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the replicant freedom movement before taking Deckard to Stelline's office and handing him her toy horse. As K lies motionless on the steps, looking up at snow falling from the sky, Deckard enters the building and meets his daughter for the first time."

        "content": "Since the 1990s, licensing disputes over Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? had stood in the way of producing sequels to the science fiction drama Blade Runner (1982). Director Ridley Scott conceived two ultimately unrealized projects vaguely connected to the Blade Runner canon in the interim. Scott's second project, a collaboration with his son Luke and younger brother Tony titled Purefold, had been imagined as an episodic webseries examining conceptions of empathy. Nearly three decades after the film's release, Alcon Entertainment co-founders Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson purchased the intellectual property from producer Bud Yorkin. The terms of Alcon's acquisition prohibited the remake of the original Blade Runner film, but entitled the company rights to syndication, franchising, and derivative media such as prequels and sequels. No longer satisfied with the profits of their smaller-budget features, and with investor funding scarce, Kosove and Johnson sought to increase Alcon's output of blockbuster films: \"If you don't have repetitive cash flow, which is a fancy way of saying being in the sequel business, you are going to be in trouble eventually.\" Progress on a new Blade Runner feature soon intensified when Kosove named Christopher Nolan one of his ideal choices to direct. However, Nolan said he never planned to direct, despite being an admirer of the Blade Runner franchise. By August 2011, Alcon announced Ridley Scott's signing as the film's director to the press. The British filmmaker had long desired a sequel to expand upon the subject matter. After securing Scott's services, the studio assigned Michael Green and a returning Hampton Fancher the responsibility for writing the script. Alcon producers provided some insight of their vision but were unsure of how to approach the Blade Runner story, hence they and the normally candid Scott were tight-lipped when questioned further about the sequel's artistic direction in interviews conducted during the pre-production. Ultimately, Scott resigned from his duties once his existing commitment to Alien: Covenant (2017) took precedence, and retained partial oversight as an executive producer. He also made significant contributions to the screenplay, albeit in an uncredited role. Blade Runner 2049 was Alcon's second collaboration with director Denis Villeneuve, who they called for a meeting at a cafe in rural New Mexico to negotiate an offer. They had an existing professional relationship from Prisoners (2013). Villeneuve credits Blade Runner for inspiring his passion for filmmaking, but hesitated to accept the assignment at first as he feared tarnishing the franchise's legacy. Nevertheless, he liked the screenplay and was assured by Fancher's investment in the project. Villeneuve preserved elements of the original film by modernizing Blade Runner retrofuturistic onscreen world, which he saw as imperative for an authentic story. A scene from Steven Spielberg Ready Player One (2018) set in the Blade Runner universe was excluded from the film's finished cut. Spielberg had sought copyright approval during the filming of Blade Runner 2049, which Alcon producers refused as they feared the explicit reference would affect their commercial prospects, even though Ready Player One was released months later."

        "content": "Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling were Blade Runner 2049 first significant casting choices. Gossip about Ford's participation had been circulating in the media since the project's conception, claims which the producers initially denied, having only approached the actor for a part in 2014. Alcon did not publicly announce their signing until the following year. Ford expressed interest in reprising his role in past interviews and was enthusiastic about the Blade Runner 2049 script. The working conditions on set was another aspect of the production Ford was pleased with, a stark contrast from the stressful shooting environment he endured on Blade Runner. Ford stated the thirty five-year passage of time, plus the synthesis of a new story with Deckard's already-established backstory, lent unique context to playing his aged character. The only other returning Blade Runner actor, Edward James Olmos, appears in a supporting part which pivots the main story. The screenwriters tailored K specifically for Gosling, but it was the opportunity to work with Villeneuve and experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, paired with his faith in the script, that convinced the actor to join Blade Runner 2049 in his first leading role in a blockbuster production. Gosling developed a reputation for his discriminating film choices\u2014the prospect of working on big-budget franchise sets never enticed him, yet he trusted the filmmakers' instincts, and the thematic complexity of the film's screenplay furthermore reassured his decision. A longtime Blade Runner fan, the actor said his first viewing experience of the film as a young teenager was profound, remarking, \"It was one of the first films I had seen where it wasn't clear how I was supposed to feel when it was over. It really makes you question your idea of the hero and the villain, the idea of what it means to be human.\" Blade Runner 2049 proved challenging for Gosling because of the production's scope. Ana de Armas auditioned several times before landing the film's female lead. De Armas was an actress of national renown in Spain, aspiring to break into English-speaking roles. After working in her first Hollywood film in Hands of Stone (2016), she settled in Los Angeles in pursuit of a role that did not typecast her ethnicity. De Armas underwent four months of rigorous speech training to master her English before auditioning. Once the studio commenced production of Blade Runner 2049, the actress said her fitness training provided the necessary mental space to prepare for the intense shooting schedule. Villeneuve considered David Bowie, one of the franchise's core influences, for the part of Niander Wallace, but the singer died before the start of filming. Instead, he and the producers looked at Jared Leto, fresh off the filming of Suicide Squad (2016) because they felt he exuded Bowie's rockstar sensibility. Leto refrains from naming specific sources that shaped certain aspects of his character's persona, rather the actor cites real-life friends that work in tech as a general influence. Leto is notorious in the film industry for his unorthodox preparation for his roles, and he continued his unusual practices in Blade Runner 2049 by wearing custom opaque contact lenses to work the set completely blind. Villeneuve recalled his first day shooting with the actor, \"He entered the room, and he could not see at all. He was walking with an assistant very slowly. It was like seeing Jesus walking into a temple. Everybody became super silent, and there was a kind of sacred moment. Everyone was in awe. It was so beautiful and powerful\u2014I was moved to tears.\" A raft of mostly young actors comprise Blade Runner 2049 supporting cast; David Dastmalchian, Sylvia Hoeks, Carla Juri, Mackenzie Davis and Barkhad Abdi were lesser-known stars with years of expertise in indie cinema. Among the few exceptions are Dave Bautista, Hiam Abbass and Lennie James, whose castings were revealed between April and July 2016, and Robin Wright, assigned to one of three major female roles in Blade Runner 2049. Wright's participation had been rumored for weeks, but was not immediately confirmed by the filmmakers because her existing duties to Netflix's political TV thriller House of Cards momentarily stalled the negotiations."

        "content": "The filmmakers embarked on location scouting in April 2016, and principal photography of Blade Runner 2049 commenced that July, lasting four months until November. They first toured London but found no soundstage available for the needs of the production. As a result, Deakins and Villeneuve flew to Hungary for location scouting partly due to Scott's familiarity of the country's network of facilities. They also toured Slovakia to source architectural ideas. Blade Runner 2049 production crew were mostly Hungarian, with some American staff hired to supervise the set. Inserts with Wright and Hoeks were the first scenes filmed on set. Shooting took place mainly at Korda Studios and the Origo Studios backlot in suburban Budapest, where the shoot qualified for a 25% tax rebate on in-state costs from the Hungarian government. The Alcon\u2013Sony partnership allocated $180million ($90million each) for the budget, rebates notwithstanding. Interior shots of the Budapest Stock Exchange's Liberty Square palace doubled for Las Vegas in casino-set scenes, and abandoned Soviet industrial sites such as the Inota Power Plant and the Kelenf\u00f6ld were important filming locations that emphasized Blade Runner 2049 dystopian ethos. The Budapest palace was the film's largest set, occupying at least three floors of the building. Filmmakers revised Deckard's capture by Luv into a simple conversational scene after Ford conveyed to Kosove and Johnson his disapproval of the dialogue. Pitfalls occasionally beset the production. The filmmakers frequently fell behind schedule, and an Origo Studios-employed subcontractor was killed by falling debris when dismantling one of the sets. Gosling's obligation to fulfill a New York City press junket for La La Land (2016) exacerbated the unusual circumstances of the shoot; however, his scenes were able to be filmed in time for the Thanksgiving holiday."

        "content": "Blade Runner 2049 is the third Deakins\u2013Villeneuve collaboration after Prisoners and Sicario (2015). Together with production designer Dennis Gassner, the men brainstormed ideas for the film's visual palette as Villeneuve was editing his science fiction drama Arrival (2016). The sequences were then storyboarded and left for Deakins and Villeneuve to execute. The two were inspired by the architecture of several global cities to develop a hostile, imposing brutalist style for their fictionalized Los Angeles, among them the appearance of Beijing's cityscape in dense smog, the foothills of southern Spain, Bangladeshi shipyards, and certain mid-twentieth century landmarks in London (such as the Barbican Estate and Trellick Tower). For Las Vegas-set scenes, the filmmakers researched intense dust storms in the Sahara, Saudi Arabia and Sydney to replicate the sandy desert ruins Villeneuve sought. It became apparent to Deakins that Blade Runner 2049 would be one of his biggest undertakings because of the technical demands involved realizing the onscreen universe. Deakins exercises full artistic control of his shoots, and the extent of his oversight meant a single-camera setup for the set\u2014the British cinematographer rejected a studio line producer's request for a nine unit-camera setup because he firmly believed said technique would yield sloppy camerawork. Rather he and Villeneuve resumed the practical approach of their previous collaborations to capture the Blade Runner 2049 scenes. They shot the project in 1.55:1 aspect ratio from a single Arri Alexa XT Studio camera with Zeiss Master prime lenses, assisted with an attached crane arm or a dolly. The filmmakers conducted tests with an Alexa 65 camera but preferred the XT Studio's somewhat grainy image quality, and the choice of lenses corresponded to the scale and lighting specifications of the scenes. For example, close-up character scenes were captured in 32mm lenses, but filmmakers captured sweeping cityscape shots with 14mm and 16mm lenses. Occasionally, production filmed with Arri Alexa Mini cameras to capture shots from the spinners, the vehicles used in the film. When Gassner was first approached for Blade Runner 2049, he was called with a request from Villeneuve to observe the shape of passing street sweepers. Redesigning the spinners then became one of his initial responsibilities. He and the filmmakers envisioned a harsh, angular design for the spinners, one intended to evoke a sense of technological innovation. It was also up to Gassner to complete most of the Blade Runner 2049 sets so producers could exercise full artistic control of the shoot. Gassner had known Scott since 1982, when they had been introduced on the set of the Francis Ford Coppola-directed musical One From the Heart. Despite his experience working franchise sets, Gassner felt the creation of distinct, lore faithful work was difficult. He said, \"So you have to be respectful of the world that was already created and integrate that original aesthetic, but also create individuality and stand-alone visuals for the people who haven\u2019t seen the original. It's kind of like you're sitting on the edge of a knife blade.\""

When discussing the film, she stated she did not consider it a fashionable one. \"I made costumes for the dark, wet, polluted, miserable world that Denis [Villeneuve] created. I had to hold myself back and remove anything too avant-garde or outr\u00e9 because it did not help the story. There were no superhero suits because the world needed to be realistic, and the characters relatable.\" When April discussed the film with Villeneuve about what direction she should take the costumes, Villeneuve told her \"brutal\", a similar description he gave to Gassner. \"So I took it from there and made it tougher. Also, we did not want to do something science-fiction. We wanted to do it realistic. I did not want costumes with [lots of] zippers and plastic. So my job was to make the characters believable.\""

It made $11.3million on Saturday and went on to debut to $31.5million, performing below both projections but still finishing first at the box office and marking the biggest openings of Villeneuve and Gosling's careers. Regarding the opening weekend, director Villeneuve said, \"It's a mystery. All the indexes and marketing tools they were using predicted that it would be a success. The film was acclaimed by critics. So everyone expected the first weekend's results to be impressive, and they were shocked. They still don't understand.\" Deadline Hollywood attributed the film's performance to the 163-minute runtime limiting the number of showtimes theaters could have, lack of appeal to mainstream audiences, and the marketing being vague and relying on nostalgia and established fanbase to carry it. In its second weekend, the film dropped 52.7% to $15.5million, finishing second behind newcomer Happy Death Day ($26million) and dropped another 54% in its third weekend to $7.2million, finishing in 4th behind Boo 2! A Madea Halloween, Geostorm and Happy Death Day. Overseas, it was expected to debut to an additional $60million, for a worldwide opening of around $100million. The debut ended up making $50.2million internationally, finishing number one in 45 markets, for a global opening of $81.7million. It made $8million in the United Kingdom, $4.9million in Russia, $1.8million in Brazil and $3.6million in Australia. It debuted in China on October 27, and made $7.7million in its opening weekend, which was considered a disappointment."

        "content": "Blade Runner 2049 was well received by the American press, and various US publications included the film in their end-of-2017 lists. Critical reviews compared the sequel favorably to Blade Runner as a worthy successor advancing the franchise mythos, though some were conflicted over the pacing and tonal shifts of the story, and the film drew occasional disapproval from reviewers who felt it lacked the spectacle and dramatic depth of its predecessor. The film's craftsmanship was the main source of praise from journalists, who routinely singled out Villeneuve for his expertise: The New York Times A. O. Scott viewed Blade Runner 2049 as an introspection of Villeneuve's own sensibilities, the product of a director exuding an \"unnerving calm\", while San Francisco Chronicle Mick LaSalle said the film seemed to employ a similar narrative tone to the director's late period films such as Arrival. The Villeneuve\u2013Deakins collaboration was noted for the creation of cinematography displaying \"the kind of complex artistry one would expect from the profession's top veteran\", with Deakins' work described as \"bleakly beautiful\". Other aspects of Blade Runner 2049, such as the set design, writing, and scoring, were cited among the strengths of the film. The actors' performances were a principal topic of discussion among critics. Critiques of the dynamic of the cast were positive in the media, and reviewers often distinguished Gosling, Ford and Wright for further praise. Gosling's work was described as \"superb, soulful\", and he was considered physically convincing as a replicant in his expression and appearance. Meanwhile, critics from The Hollywood Reporter and from Empire magazine were among those who believed Ford worked a career-best performance. Other journalists, such as Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, viewed the two men as \"double dynamite\" in conversational scenes, in which the film assumes \"a resonance that is both tragic and hopeful\". One particular point of contention in Blade Runner 2049 was characterization: some critics, for example, saw K's romance with Joi as an idea of unrealized potential because the film explores their relationship only superficially, so Joi never seems to develop into a fleshed out character. Some criticized the film's depiction of its female characters as being too submissive. The fate of K in the closing scenes of the film has been a matter of debate; some critics have suggested that his demise is open to interpretation, as it is not explicitly stated in the film that K has died. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, screenwriter Michael Green expressed surprise that K's death had been called into question, referring to the use of the \"Tears in rain\" musical motif in the final scene. The question of whether Deckard is a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the original release of Blade Runner. Ridley Scott has stated that Deckard was a replicant. However, others, including Harrison Ford, disagree, and feel preserving the ambiguity of Deckard's status important to the film. Blade Runner 2049 draws no conclusion to this debate. During various physical struggles, Deckard showed no sign of artificial replicant strength; however, Gaff described Deckard to K as \"retired\"; and replicant maker Niander Wallace tells Deckard that \"You are a wonder to me, Mr. Deckard,\" and that he might have been \"designed\" to fall in love with Rachael. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 442 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Visually stunning and narratively satisfying, Blade Runner 2049 deepens and expands its predecessor's story while standing as an impressive filmmaking achievement in its own right.\" As of May 2021, Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on 54 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Critics who saw the film before its release were asked by Villeneuve not to reveal certain characters and plot points. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 78% overall positive score and a 60% \"definite recommend\"."

        "title": "Blade Runner 2049_Social commentary",
        "content": "Reviewing the film for Vice, Charlotte Gush was critical of its portrayal of women, who she said were \"either prostitutes, holographic housewives\" or victims dying brutal deaths. Sara Stewart, of the New York Post, entitled her review \"You'll love the new Blade Runner - unless you're a woman\". While acknowledging that \"misogyny was part of the dystopia\" in Scott's 1982 original, she stated that the sequel was \"eye-gougingly sexist\". Writing for The Guardian, Anna Smith expressed similar concerns, stating that \"sexualised images of women dominate the stunning futuristic cityscapes\" and questioned whether the film catered heavily to heterosexual men. Rachael Kaines of Moviepilot countered that \"the gender politics in Blade Runner 2049 are intentional\": \"The movie is about secondary citizens. Replicants. Orphans. Women. Slaves. Just by depicting these secondary citizens in subjugation doesn't mean that it is supportive of these depictions \u2013 they are a condemnation.\" Helen Lewis of the New Statesman suggested that the film is \"an uneasy feminist parable about controlling the means of reproduction\" and that \"its villain, Niander Wallace, is consumed by rage that women can do something he cannot\": Fertility is the perfect theme for the dystopia of Blade Runner 2049 because of the western elite anxiety that over-educated, over-liberated women are having fewer children or choosing to opt-out of childbearing altogether. (One in five women is now childless by the age of 45; the rates are higher among women who have been to university.) Feminism is one potential solution to this problem: removing the barriers which make women feel that motherhood is a closing of doors. Another is to take flight and find another exploitable class to replace human females ... Maybe androids don't dream of electric sheep, but some human men certainly dream of electric wombs. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Denis Villeneuve responded that he is very sensitive about his portrayal of women: \"Blade Runner is not about tomorrow; it's about today. And I'm sorry, but the world is not kind on women.\" Quoting from the Variety magazine breakdown of viewer demographics for the film, Donald Clarke for The Irish Times indicated that female audiences seemed alienated from it; just 8% of its audiences were females under 25. Esquire magazine commented on the controversial aspects of the sex scene \u2014 involving K, the holographic Joi and replicant Mariette \u2014 calling it a \"robo-m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\", and contrasted it with the sex scene between Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson in Her (2013). Mackenzie Davis, who portrayed Mariette, argued for the self-awareness of the film's social commentary in an interview with the website Refinery29. Asked how she believed Blade Runner 2049 \"differs [from Blade Runner] in its portrayal of women?\", Davis responded: I think it\u2019s pretty self-aware about a pornographic economy that has reduced the roles of women to sheer consumption. The normalization of women\u2019s roles as things to be consumed, there\u2019s products that are made, just like there are now, the idea of the semi-sentient sex doll is really in line with what\u2019s going on in this Blade Runner universe, about having a thing that fulfills everything you want, but doesn\u2019t talk back and can\u2019t argue with you, but can be a loving, supporting companion and also fulfill all your sexual needs feels like something that\u2019s very contemporary and something the movie is very self-aware about. And then I think that there are female roles in different castes of this society that are able to be more embodied and powerful in conventional ways, and also have cracks in their facade where you see their vulnerabilities. But it seems like this world is so dependent on this caste system of humans perform these roles; replicants perform these roles, human superiors, creators, and those are the ways that women sort of travel between. But there isn\u2019t a lot of upward mobility."

John is depressed and an emotional wreck. He lives in poverty in rural West Virginia, feeding himself by hunting deer. While illegally stalking a deer with a shotgun on Nature Conservancy land, he accidentally shoots and kills a young woman. He then finds a box containing $100,000 in the abandoned van where she was hiding. He hides the woman's body in a shipping container. During the following days, he attempts to reconcile with his wife. He contacts a local attorney to try to negotiate for his wife and son's return home and leaves the attorney several hundred dollars, drawing the attorneys' attention. John visits his son at his wife's apartment and interrupts the babysitter having sex with a recently released convict who has returned home. As he leaves he is threatened by a stranger who resents his glance. Later, while he is in his trailer, someone shoots and kills his dog. In another incident a rock wrapped in a note threatening his family is thrown through the trailer window. John suspects the ex-con is responsible for these events. He enters the ex-con's motel room and is interrupted by the ex-con's return. He hides in the louvered closet. The stranger from outside the diner arrives at the hotel room and asks the ex-con if he's \"gotten the money back\".  The ex-con tells him that the woman who had the money has died and the stranger is furious. John sees him slit the ex-con's throat. The ex-con falls into the closet. He sees John but is unable to talk before he dies. John avoids detection and goes home. He finds someone has trashed his trailer, apparently looking for the money. The dead girl's body is on his bed with a note. His wife shows up and wants to come inside and get her clothing, but John refuses. John visits the attorney and threatens him with a pistol, trying to force him to reveal what he knows. All he learns is that his wife was concerned about where John got the money and wants to talk to him. John returns to his trailer. A friendly local girl brings him something to eat, and while they are eating outside, the radio in the trailer starts playing loudly. John goes inside to investigate, carrying a pistol. He hears the girl scream outside, and returns to find her held captive by the stranger. John is forced to discard his pistol and knife. The stranger asks John where the money is. John says he buried it nearby. The stranger tells him to go get it, but first cuts off John's right index finger and thumb, to be sure he can't use a weapon. John goes to his truck and gets a scoped rifle. Despite his wounds, he successfully kills the stranger. He takes the girl to town and returns to the trailer and a shed outside, which contains a freezer in which he has hidden the dead woman's body. He drags her body up the hill and digs a hole to bury her. Weakened by loss of blood, he's unable to get out of the hole. He pulls the girl\u2032s body into the hole with him and looks up to see a deer looking down at him from the edge of the hole."

Malcolm and John learn that Lester may be seeking to find his ex-girlfriend, Sherry Pierce, an employee of the bank who is suspected of supplying him with a key to the vault, as the money that was stolen was never recovered. Malcolm and John find themselves staking out the home of Sherry's estranged grandmother, Hattie Mae Pierce  an overweight, elderly African American woman, whom her friends affectionately call Big Momma  in Cartersville, Georgia, and soon find that she is about to leave for two weeks to visit her ill friend. Malcolm takes advantage of this by posing as her in order to bring Sherry to her house to get her to confess to her involvement in the bank robbery. To maintain his disguise as Big Momma, Malcolm is forced to maintain the real Big Momma's lifestyle. This includes him dealing with her lecherous boyfriend, assuming her occupation as a midwife, and attending self-defense classes led by dim-witted security guard Nolan, whom the agents are later forced to recruit when he stumbles onto their operation. During this time, Malcolm bonds with Sherry and her ten-year-old son Trent, both in disguise and as himself  posing as Big Momma's handyman  but finds nothing to link her to the robbery, nor to the missing money's location. After attending a church service with them, where he compels in his disguise for Sherry to not hold any secrets, Malcolm finds the missing money in Trent's footlocker after returning home to a surprise birthday party for the real Big Momma. His discovery is witnessed by Sherry, who confess to him that she had no idea what Lester was planning, and didn't report her key was stolen out of fear of being fired. Matters soon become complicated when John discovers that the real Big Momma has returned home prematurely. In his efforts to stop her re-entering the house, he instructs Nolan to lock her out, only for the dim-witted guard to lock out Malcolm by mistake. Lester eventually arrives on the scene, having tracked down Sherry, and soon puts her in danger. Malcolm swiftly breaks into the house, whereupon he tackles with Lester and subdues him after John is shot, but at the cost of his disguise being dropped in front of Sherry and Trent. Although Lester is arrested and the money recovered, Malcolm finds that Sherry and Trent refuse to speak to him after being heartbroken by his deception. Seeking forgiveness, Malcolm attends a Sunday morning church service and confesses in a heartfelt speech to Sherry and Trent that he genuinely loves them. Big Momma forgives Malcolm for his actions, and the church crowd cheers as Malcolm and Sherry kiss, before Big Momma and the choir sing \"Oh Happy Day\" during the film's closing credits."

        "content": "On February 6, 1999, a team of three biologists, led by Professor Jonathan Hoffman, investigate a series of supposed wildlife killings in a wooded area near a small New York town. One of the biologists, Bianca, suspects that the killings may have something to do with a recent earthquake. When Hoffman and the other biologist, Gabriel, go off to investigate the wildlife disappearances, they discover the corpse of a mutilated deer. Upon returning to the campsite, they find that Bianca has discovered a hole in the ground. From this, the group determines that a prehistoric creature that has been frozen for thousands of years was freed by the earthquake, and has been killing the wildlife. The creature appears and kills both Gabriel and Bianca, leaving Hoffman to deduce that it is a \"snow shark\" before it attacks him. Twelve years later, the snow shark has become a town legend. The town's mayor, Shawn Overman, is informed when two residents are killed by the shark, and he and Sheriff Donald Chapman hold a town meeting. During the meeting, one of the residents, Mike Evans, claims that the killings were caused by the shark, despite him having said to have killed the creature seven years earlier. Against Chapman's warnings, he sets out to kill the shark once and for all. That night, Chapman and his son Ethan get into an argument. Ethan leaves to drink beer outside with his friend Doug, and is killed by the shark while urinating. The next day, with the rest of the police force already at the scene, a distraught Chapman sees Ethan's corpse and questions Doug about the incident. When Doug claims that Ethan's death was caused by a shark, Chapman believes him and becomes determined to kill it. Cryptozoologist Lincoln Anderson, biologist Wendy Gardner, and hunter Cameron Caine visit the town and have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills everyone in the party except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron make their way into the woods, armed with a miniature crossbow, a shotgun, and a motion-sensing camera. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers. When Lincoln finds that the camera has not detected any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman shoots Cameron in the head. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can do so. The shark bites off Mike's legs, and Chapman and Lincoln flee. Mike pulls the pin on a hand grenade, causing both him and the shark to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard."

        "content": "Production on Snow Shark began in early 2011, with director Sam Qualiana having created the film's title, poster, and a teaser trailer before finalizing its script. Qualiana has stated, \"I always have had a fear of sharks. Not a lot of things scare me, but sharks terrify and fascinate me at the same time.\" Qualiana viewed the film as a mixture of the 1975 thriller film Jaws and the 1982 science-fiction horror film The Thing. The film began shooting in Buffalo, New York, partially supported by an Indiegogo campaign launched by Qualiana with a fundraising goal of $3,000. Production was met with minor weather-related difficulties, including overcoming cold temperatures and the task of preventing snow from gathering on the lens of the film camera. Aside from instances of blood shown onscreen, the film's visual effects were created without the use of computer-generated imagery. John Renna, who portrays the character Ethan, constructed a full-size shark head to use during filming. Effects artists Andrew Lavin and Arick Szymecki created a miniature shark head, as well as several landscapes, to be used in the film. Some of the film's scenes were shot on weekends in order to prevent the melting of snow due to the arrival of spring. Qualiana noted that \"it was tough getting all the exterior shots before the snow melted. We cancelled some shoots due to warm weather and managed to do some cutaways outside with fake snow\". Production ended in June 2011, in Lockport, New York. Post-production was managed by Qualiana and producer Greg Lamberson, alongside B-movie horror screenwriter Brett Piper and low-budget filmmaker Mark Polonia."

The film was released on DVD and was made available for digital download on December 11, 2012; it was distributed through Independent Entertainment. Brett Gallmann of the website Oh, the Horror! criticized the film's \"amateurism, from the acting to the hastily sloshed upon digital effects\", likening it to a \"no-budget Troma affair\" that \"excels at being mostly forgettable\". John Lyle of the website Bloodbath & Beyond gave the film a score of 0.5/5, criticizing the brief overall time that the snow shark is shown onscreen. Nathaniel Thompson of Mondo Digital wrote that, in regards to \"Jaws rip-offs\", it was \"one of the more entertaining ones in recent years\". Adrian Halen of HorrorNews.net found fault with the film's \"tiring\" dialogue but admired its \"charming\" special effects, writing that it shows \"just enough shark to make us hunger for more\". In a review of the film's DVD release on the website HorrorTalk, the film is referred to as \"bad, real bad, but in all the most awesome ways possible\"."

The houses are then renovated with a low budget and a quick schedule in order to be sold as soon as possible, a process known as flipping. Many of the houses featured on the series are presented as having been vandalized or unkept by the previous tenants, and thus are in need of clean-up or expensive repairs. Scott desires to spend as little money as possible on each house to achieve a maximum profit. However, Amie is passionate about her design choices and frequently makes expensive purchases on upgrades that are not budgeted, and often does so without informing Scott, which upsets him. Scott usually does not agree with Amie's belief that such upgrades help to sell a house. In some episodes, Scott has a project manager oversee renovations for him. Because of various types of delays, workers typically struggle to get each house complete in time for an open house event, during which one of Scott's real estate agents gives tours of the property to potential buyers. Throughout each episode, Scott, Amie, and others speak to the viewer through interview clips to provide information and opinions about each other and about the property featured in that episode."

I was telling them how I had to pull my Glock out on some homeless guys who came at me with needles in one of the houses that was all boarded up. They're like, 'Man, you need your own reality show. We'll make it like a commercial for your website or something.' So I paid their expenses, and they gave it to another friend of ours, who gave it to a guy who worked at Lionsgate.\" The series filmed its pilot in 2009, under the working title of Last House Standing. The second season concluded filming in April 2012. As of November 2013, the show was filming its fifth season. Approximately 120 to 140 hours of footage was shot for each episode, which was then edited down to 43 minutes. Scott Yancey said, \"The houses that are the worst to buy are the ones we save for TV because we know there's a great storyline with it\". Regarding the biggest misconception that viewers may have about the show, Scott Yancey said, \"What the people see is us stressed in a house on an episode. What they don't see is us doing five others at the same time. [...] The TV show usually edits in the drama. They don't see that an hour from now, we're gonna be holding hands walking our dog somewhere. They edit it in a way that's obviously going to be most entertaining. They don't ever show me say 'thank you, good job' to somebody or show us going to a restaurant at night or in the summer on a beach.\" Amie Yancey said, \"The main thing is that in TV land, they speed everything up. They [the viewers] think,  'Oh, wow, it's a breeze. They come in, and it's done.' It takes a long time to put them together, to pick out the fit and finish and work on the quality. They only see a glimpse of it.\""

When Cass realises that the Doctor is a Time Lord, she refuses his aid, ignoring his claims that he has never taken part in the devastating Time War. The Doctor refuses to abandon Cass, and both are killed when the ship crashes. On the planet, the Doctor is taken in by the Sisterhood of Karn, guardians of the Flame and Elixir of Eternal Life, who revive him temporarily; Cass, however, is beyond their help. The Sisterhood offer the Doctor a selection of potions which, if consumed before he expires, will not only trigger his regeneration into a new form, but allow him to choose which characteristics his next incarnation will have. They convince the Doctor that he must take action to end the Time War, which \"threatens all reality\". The Doctor initially refuses, but after seeing Cass's dead body, he agrees there is not much need for a doctor any more and asks for a potion that will turn him into \"a warrior\". Saluting the memory of his past companions, he drinks the potion and regenerates into a new incarnation, known as the War Doctor, who wears Cass's bandolier."

Steven Moffat decided that he wanted to see how this Doctor came into being, with the best story idea being a direct regeneration from the Eighth Doctor, which would have the added benefit of showing the end of the Eighth Doctor, which Moffat had always wanted to see. Having contacted Paul McGann, who indicated his willingness to participate, Moffat then constructed the mini-episode to serve as an additional surprise for the fans, as well as serving as an introductory piece to \"The Day of the Doctor\". \"The Night of the Doctor\" was recorded at Roath Lock on 7\u20138 May 2013; the first day of filming consisted of all scenes taking place on the planet Karn, while the second day consisted of scenes in Cass' spaceship. Rather than a return to the costume from the TV movie or using the new image that Big Finish had introduced, Moffat decided on a variation of the TV movie outfit designed by Howard Burden. The new outfit referenced the previous one, retaining the long green coat and grey waistcoat, but making it appear more of an \"adventurer's\" rather than \"gentleman's\" outfit. At the same time, pictures of McGann in costume were taken on the Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS console room set. An archival photograph of John Hurt as Rodion Raskolnikov in the 1976 BBC adaptation of Crime and Punishment was used to represent the reflection of the young War Doctor."

The episode was made available on the BBC's YouTube site, its iPlayer service, and on the BBC Red Button service. \"The Night of the Doctor\" received over 2.5 million views within the week of its release. McGann's reprise performance was met with acclaim; fans of the episode campaigned for the BBC to grant the Eighth Doctor his own spin-off series, with one petition on Change.org accumulating over 15,000 signatures. BBC America aired the episode on 25 December 2013 as part of an expanded broadcast of \"The Day of the Doctor\" including deleted scenes excluded from the normal US broadcast honouring the 50th Anniversary as well as Matt Smith's final episode which aired immediately following it and his farewell special."

The ministry moved temporarily to La Vega, Dominican Republic. Eventually the school would change names to Caribe Vista School/ Escuela Caribe, settling in Jarabacoa on a remote 30-acre fenced campus that typically housed around 45 students at one time. Blossom developed the school's program, calling it  \"Culture Shock Therapy\" or \"Christian Milieu Therapy\". According to former students of Escuela Caribe, they were subjected to a range of abuses including intense forced labor and repetitive exercise, physical beatings (called \"swats\"), extreme isolation, and various forms of emotional abuse. In 2011, Escuela Caribe and New Horizons closed, transferring the property to another Christian ministry called Crosswinds, which reopened the school under the name Caribbean Mountain Academy. Although their website states their program is not affiliated with New Horizons Youth Ministries, as of 2014 (the year of the film's release) at least five staff members from Escuela Caribe remained employed at the school after the transition."

All of the vampires possess supernatural powers, including levitation and the ability to transform into animals. Viago is a 379-year-old dandy from the 17th century, who originally traveled to New Zealand in the 1910s in search of Katherine, the love of his life; Vladislav is an 862-year-old known as \"Vladislav the Poker\", who is haunted by memories of his nemesis \"the Beast\"; and Deacon is a 183-year-old former peddler and the \"young rebel\" of the group who was turned into a vampire by Petyr\u2014a reclusive, 8,000-year-old vampire who behaves like a feral animal. Each night, Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon take the bus into town and prowl the streets of Wellington for people to kill. Deacon's human familiar, Jackie, runs errands for the vampires and cleans up the gore left behind by their feeding. A married mother, Jackie hopes to attain immortality, but is frustrated that Deacon will not turn her into a vampire as promised. Deacon requests that Jackie bring virgins to the flat so that the vampires can feed on them. She lures a woman who insulted her in primary school and her ex-boyfriend Nick to the flat. Though neither are actually virgins, the woman is killed, and Nick is chased throughout the flat and manages to get outside, only to be caught by Petyr, who turns him into a vampire. Two months later, the vampires accept Nick into their group and bond with his human friend Stu, a computer analyst who introduces them to modern technology. Viago uses the Internet to find Katherine, who is now a 96-year-old widow living in a rest home in Wellington, and also briefly reconnects with his old servant Philip. Despite being able to get his new friends into popular bars and clubs, Nick struggles to adapt to life as a vampire. Nick is also held in contempt by Deacon, who resents Nick's newfound popularity and his careless revealing of his vampirism to strangers he meets. One of these strangers, a vampire hunter, breaks into the flat basement during the day and kills Petyr by exposing him to sunlight. The vampires are furious when they discover Nick has indirectly caused Petyr's death, and Deacon tries to kill Nick before being interrupted by a police welfare check, but Viago hypnotizes them into not noticing anything out of the ordinary. Once the police leave, Nick is banished from the flat by the remaining vampires, though Stu is permitted to come as he pleases. Several months later, the vampires receive an invitation to the annual Unholy Masquerade, hosted for the local undead population of vampires, zombies, and witches. Vladislav refuses to attend after learning that \"the Beast\" will be the guest of honor. When Viago and Deacon arrive at the ball, they find in attendance Nick, Stu and Jackie, the latter of whom has been turned into a vampire by Nick. \"The Beast\" is revealed to be Vladislav's ex-girlfriend Pauline, and when Stu and the camera crew are discovered to be living humans, the party guests threaten to kill and feed on them. Vladislav arrives and fights with Pauline's new boyfriend Julian. Stu impales Julian on a flagpole, and the vampires and camera crew escape the ball with him, only to encounter a rival pack of werewolves who transform under the full moon. Stu and one of the cameramen are mauled. Believing Stu to be dead, the vampires run away and grieve for him. After an indeterminate amount of time, Nick returns to the flat with Stu, who reveals he has survived the attack and transformed into a werewolf. With Stu's urging, the pack visits the vampires along with Stu, and Nick's banishment is rescinded as well. Though momentarily apprehensive, Deacon invites the werewolf pack inside. Viago also reconnects and rekindles his romance with Katherine, whom he turns into a vampire. Scenes during the credits reveal that Vladislav has gotten back together with Pauline, repeating his cycle of self-inflicted torture over his relationship with her; and Jackie's husband is now serving as her familiar. A post-credits scene shows Deacon attempting to hypnotize the audience to forget the events of the film."

Film International, in a positive review, commended the film for noting, with a double of Count Orlok locked in the vampires' basement, that the true vampire film tradition is repressed by the current craze. Variety was more critical, writing that \"Some genre fans who prefer the silly to the satiric may bite, but the anemic pic isn't remotely weird or witty enough for cult immortality.\" However Mark Kermode gave the film a negative review, until a couple years later, when, on the BFI Player, Kermode chose this film on his BFI Player choice's film and gave a positive review."

An Irish bounty hunter, Silas Selleck, arrives and shoots dead the leader. Jay employs the bounty hunter for protection. At a trading post, unbeknownst to Jay, Silas sees a wanted poster offering a $2,000 bounty for Rose and her father. He plans to use Jay to get to the bounty. Another bounty hunter, Victor the Hawk, also takes notice of the poster. Inside, a Swedish couple attempts a robbery which results in the death of the owner and the husband. Jay intervenes and shoots the wife. Silas and Jay gather provisions and leave, abandoning the couple's children outside. In the past, in Scotland, Rose is aware of Jay's affection, but only cares for him as a \"little brother\". Jay's uncle, Lord Cavendish, accidentally dies in an argument with John Ross, Rose's father. Rose and her father leave for America with the bounty on their heads. In the present, Jay abandons Silas and proceeds alone, thinking him a \"brute\". He meets a travelling writer, Werner, who offers to accompany Jay. When Jay wakes the next morning, Werner has left, stealing Jay's horse and equipment. Silas finds Jay and returns Jay's horse and belongings, saying he ran into Werner while looking for Jay. The pair meets Payne, the leader of Silas's old gang, which has taken in the Swedish children. Payne gives Silas and Jay absinthe in a failed attempt to gather information about Rose and her father's whereabouts. While they are asleep, Silas and Jay share a dream of Silas and Rose living together with a child. They awaken to find that Payne has stolen their weapons. Silas discloses the bounty to Jay. They evade Payne's gang in a forest, where Jay is injured by Native Americans. Rose and her father live in a nearby prairie, protected by a Native American called Kotori. Victor, disguised as a priest, tracks them down and kills Rose's father. After reaching the prairie, Silas ties Jay to a tree to keep him from harm. Silas rushes to the house to warn Rose of Payne's gang but is wounded by Victor. Payne and his men murder Victor and assault the house. Jay frees himself and runs to the house. After Kotori and most of Payne's gang are murdered, Rose realizes she has shot Jay in the confusion. While she comforts him, Payne enters the house, and Jay shoots him. As he dies, Silas tells Rose that Jay loved her \"with all his heart\". Silas stays with Rose and the Swedish children."

        "content": "Lightning McQueen is now a 7-time Piston Cup winner and seems to still be at the top of his game. However, this is compromised when next-generation rookies like Jackson Storm, who utilize advanced technology and training methods, start replacing a lot of the veterans. As Storm's success attracts other rookies, many older racers retire or are pushed out. In the final race of the season at Los Angeles, McQueen starts falling behind Storm after both of them pitted. He tries to keep up, but in doing so suffers a violent crash, leaving him badly injured and ending his worst season on record prematurely. After recovering, McQueen decides he will continue racing and calls the Rusteze owners, who reveal they have sold the team to a new owner named Sterling. Sterling assigns McQueen to train under Cruz Ramirez, where McQueen fails to adapt to the modern training methods. Because of this, Sterling tries to force him to retire. Adamant that he can still compete, McQueen instead offers that if he wins the first race of the season, he can decide if he wants to keep racing, otherwise he would retire immediately. McQueen tries to train on nearby Fireball Beach, but ends up spending most of his time teaching Cruz how to drive on the sandy terrain. McQueen then attempts to join a race incognito at a famous dirt track called Thunder Hollow, but inadvertently enters a figure-8-style demolition derby with Cruz, which she wins albeit both of them hiding their identities. McQueen's cover is also blown when Cruz swerves to avoid the water truck causing it to tumble over and spilling its contents on McQueen, therefore adding to his humiliation. Distraught at the apparent waste of training time, McQueen rages at Cruz and in the process accidentally breaks her trophy. Cruz reveals that she had wanted to be a racer just like McQueen all her life, but never started a race due to her feeling intimidated and outclassed by the other racers. She resigns as McQueen's trainer and heads back to the training center. Guilty and with no other options, McQueen calls his friend Mater for advice. He suggests that McQueen track down Doc's mentor Smokey, in Doc's hometown of Thomasville, Georgia, so McQueen catches up to Cruz and convinces her to rejoin him. In Thomasville, McQueen meets up with Smokey, who reveals that despite the fact Doc never raced again, he found new happiness in training McQueen. After McQueen accepts that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and his friends help McQueen learn new tricks to overcome his speed disadvantage, using Cruz as his sparring partner. However, during the final practice race, Cruz suddenly overtakes him and he suffers a flashback to his crash, shaking his confidence. At the race in Florida, McQueen starts at the back, but with assistance from Smokey in the pits, manages to gradually push up the ranks. Sterling, who still believes McQueen can't win, orders Cruz back to the training center to prepare a new racer for the following race, despite her wanting to stay and watch the race. Overhearing the exchange and remembering Cruz's dream of racing, McQueen instead has his crew outfit her to take his place in the race, believing she is the key to defeating Storm. While shaky at first, Cruz is able to push up the ranks thanks to McQueen coaching her from the pits, and eventually ends up right behind Storm. Storm, feeling threatened, tries to intimidate Cruz, even to the point of ramming her against the wall in the final lap. Cruz, using one of Doc's old moves, flips over Storm, overtaking him, and winning the race. As Cruz celebrates her victory, Sterling offers her a role on his team, but she instead takes a counteroffer from the legendary owner Tex Dinoco. Sterling reminds McQueen about his bet, but as McQueen started the race that Cruz finished using the same number, he gets a share of the win, thus winning the bet. Tex then talks with Sterling. Sometime later, McQueen and Cruz return to Radiator Springs, where McQueen reveals that Tex has bought Rust-eze from Sterling. McQueen, now decked in Doc's old racing colors, decides to continue racing, but trains Cruz first for the upcoming Piston Cup season. In a post credit scene, Mater is seen singing a song at his junkyard, and receives a call but accidentally knocks his stand over."

        "content": "Development on Cars 3 began in late 2011 after the release of Cars 2 and by March 2014, pre-production on the film was underway. In October 2014, Pixar's former chief creative officer John Lasseter revealed at the Tokyo International Film Festival that the film would feature a tribute to Hayao Miyazaki's film The Castle of Cagliostro, in a form of an old Citro\u00ebn 2CV. Prior to the film's release, John Lasseter, director of the previous Cars films, stated that the film had a \"very emotional story\", similar in tone to the first film. Co-writer Kiel Murray, who also co-wrote the original Cars, said of the return to the series roots, \"With these franchises you always want to know who it's about. The first movie was about McQueen, and the second movie was a sort of off-ramp to the Mater story. We wanted to get back to the McQueen story. When we looked at what would be next for him, we wondered what that would be like both as an athlete, and also for what he was dealing with in the rest of his life.\" According to director Brian Fee, the production team did a lot of research, and, while they \"looked at athletes in other sports\", the team mainly focused on NASCAR racers. Fee said that they \"even talked to a sports psychoanalyst who explained that many of these drivers can't imagine themselves doing anything else\", an idea that resonated with the team.  Mike Rich said that rookies taking over the sport is a \"kind of endless story in sports\", and compared McQueen to Wayne Gretzky and Misty May-Treanor as well as many others. Fee said that \"being a parent became [his] main resource to find and understand the emotion\" in the film's storyline.  Scott Morse, the film's story supervisor, said that he wanted to highlight the film's emotional core and the character's relationships, wanting the film to feel like a sports film while also focusing on McQueen realizing \"what their relationship meant to Doc\". On January 5, 2017, it was announced that Armie Hammer and Cristela Alonzo would voice Jackson Storm and Cruz Ramirez, respectively. Two months later, Nathan Fillion, Kerry Washington and Lea DeLaria joined the cast. The production utilized a new rendering mode, Rix Integration Subsystem (RIS), which made scenes like the demolition derby race possible. The system was previously used on Pixar's Finding Dory. In previous movies the animators had to first do the animation before the rendering, but RIS allowed animation and rendering to take place simultaneously in a process called \"hardware shading\", making it much easier for the animators to see what a completed scene would look like when finished. Fee said that the film's animation is \"art directed realism\" and stated that it causes the film's characters and sets to \"feel more real and alive than ever before\", while Bill Cone, the film's production designer, said that \"The term [they] use is believability, which is the basis for everything [Pixar does]\".  Global technology supervisor Sudeep Rangaswamy said that his team used an automatic process for the film's shots, which, in his words \"allows a lot of flexibility\" and that \"It made shots that were previously impossible to render possible\".  Director of photography-camera Jeremy Lasky and editor Jason Hudak researched NASCAR footage for the film's race scenes."

Yet in many ways it's the tasteful version of a straight-to-DVD (or streaming) sequel.\" David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the film a positive review, saying: \"There's an emotional resonance to this story about growing old, chasing glory days and the joy of passing the baton that leaves the other two films choking on its digitally rendered dust. The end goal this time out isn't just to sell a few more toys and Lightning McQueen lunchboxes. It's actually tapping into something deeper than a corporate bottom line.\" Mike Ryan of Uproxx called the film 'The Rocky III Of The Cars Franchise,' and wrote \"There's a hint of sadness that seems to be present throughout Cars 3 that gives it a little more weight than the previous installments.\" Alonso Duralde of TheWrap gave the film a mixed review, saying: \"As a spawner of merchandise, Cars 3 fires on all pistons but, as a movie, it's a harmless but never stimulating 109 minutes.\" Vicky Roach gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying: \"Returning to the iconic, backroads nostalgia of the original film, Cars 3 puts the flashy, unpopular middle film squarely in its rear vision mirror. The route that the filmmakers take might be familiar, but after gunning it, they take the corners like pros.\""

Owen Wilson stated at a Cars 3 press event that possible stories have been discussed for a Cars 4, though he would personally like for a fourth Cars film to delve into aspects of the thriller genre, akin to Cars 2. In an interview with Screen Rant, Lea DeLaria expressed interest in reprising her role as Miss Fritter while promoting the release of the short film, Miss Fritter's Racing Skoool with the Cars 3 DVD and Blu-ray release."

        "content": "A Brony Tale (originally titled Brony) is a 2014 Canadian-American documentary film directed by Brent Hodge. The film explores the brony phenomenon, the adult fan base of the children's animated show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic that arose shortly after its premiere in 2010. The film is structured around the journey of Ashleigh Ball, one of the principal voice actresses for the show, including her initial reactions to learning of this older fanbase, and her travel as a Guest of Honor to one of the first fan conventions BronyCon held in New York City in 2012. Hodge, a close friend of and previous collaborator with Ball, was curious as she was as to this phenomenon and opted to film her travel and appearance at the convention for the documentary. Hodge's film gained interest of film producer and publisher Morgan Spurlock who helped to promote wider distribution of the documentary. Initially slated to be shown for Vancouver-area film festivals, the film was highlighted at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, and received critical praise. The film received a wider theater release starting in July 2014, and is currently available on DVD, Blu-ray, Digital Download and On Demand. The film's Blu-ray was sold for the first time at the 2014 New York Comic Con. The film also screened in 290 theaters across Mexico in late 2014."

These fans, who call themselves \"bronies\" and are mostly male, take the show's themes and messages of personal responsibility and friendship to heart. Ball accepts an invitation to attend the Winter 2012 BronyCon, a then-semiannual fan convention held in New York City, as a guest of honor and takes the opportunity to meet the fans. Footage of Ball's interviews and travels is intercut with segments focusing on different fans of the show, including: a burly motorcycle mechanic and former college football player, a United States Army veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, the producer of an Internet radio network, and a husband-and-wife team of psychologists who became interested in the show after learning about it from their son. Andrea Libman and Nicole Oliver, two other members of the voice cast, make brief appearances. The film also includes footage and interviews from the Canterlot Gardens fan convention held during mid-2012 near Cleveland, as well as footage from live performances of Ball's band, Hey Ocean!"

Director Brent Hodge said that he funded the film himself, and felt it was easy to film as he personally knew Ashleigh Ball. He decided to film as a \"fly on the wall\" at the meetups so as to not interfere with the goings on and to see the brony world as it really is. During a panel at BronyCon 2013, Hodge went into detail on the film, and showed a trailer to the audience, and revealed that the idea had come about when Ball was asked to do the convention. In an interview with Everfree News, Hodge went into detail on the film, explaining that it was an outsider view on the brony community that had evolved from simply a documentary on Ball and her voice career."

The film premiere screening at Tribeca was sold out within hours, and its screening there has brought more attention to the film, according to Hodge. The film was picked up in April 2014 by an independent film distribution company, Morgan Spurlock Presents, a collaboration between Spurlock's Warrior Poets, Virgil Films, and Abramorama. A Brony Tale is the first film distributed under this label. Along with the Tribeca premiere and prior to the selected theatrical release, the film had film festival screenings in Vancouver, British Columbia, Seattle, Washington, Wellington, New Zealand, Auckland, New Zealand, and has screenings scheduled in Mexico City, Mexico, Monterrey, Mexico and Guadalajara, Mexico via the brony convention FluttyCon 2014 and The Brony Chef.

Hodge comes closer to making those of us who can't possibly get it at least start to comprehend what is really going on here and why. If we all joined them in not necessarily watching and playing with and dressing up as My Little Pony but at least in following its message and influence, then the planet would be a much better place.\" John Lucas of Straight.com said, \"Brent Hodge's documentary about fans of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic suggests that there is no such thing as a typical \"brony\"; the subjects here include a sensitive Iraq War veteran and a burly motorcycle mechanic...A connecting thread is provided by Vancouver-based voice actor Ashleigh Ball... by the end Ball is touched by the realization that she's an integral part of something much larger than a kiddie show.\" Marina Antunes of Row Three called the film \"the best documentary I've seen on the subject\", and went on to applaud the film, saying that the film \"has the advantage of a filmmaker who understands storytelling and Hodge does an excellent job not only of capturing the energy and passion of the fans but packaging that up in a documentary that is both entertaining and informative.\" IGN gave the film a score of 9.1, praising the portrayal of the fandom, interviews, the scientific study of bronies, and subject of gender roles. However, criticism was voiced regarding the lack of staff from the show, and the story about a military brony having no conclusion."

        "content": "Austrian film producer Joe May conceived the idea for filming The Mistress of the World, which he loosely based on the novel Die Herrin der Welt by author Karl Figdor, in early 1919. May produced The Mistress of the World as a serial film, which Carjels argues was more influenced by the French serials of the time rather than the American 'cliff-hanger' serials. Whereas the popular American serials were filmed over two reels, making them short openers to a feature film, each part of The Mistress of the World was shot over six reels, making them feature length. Another difference to the American serials was the lack of a cliffhanger ending. Each episode of Mistress was a self-contained story, but the end goal was still out of reach, drawing audiences back to find out how the story resolved rather than how the heroine escaped a dangerous situation. Normal prerelease hype for serials was often manufactured through movie tie-ins, serialization in other media and spot prizes given to audience members. May attempted a different approach for The Mistress of the World, which at first appeared to be meager in comparison. He instead released a steady stream of information regarding the production of the film, which included stories around the film's stars, the set design and the process of making the film. This in turn led to massive audience anticipation, making The Mistress of the World one of the first Monumentalfilm, and this promotional technique was embraced by other productions that followed. May continued to feed the entertainment journals with facts from the film in the run up to its release, in an attempt to promote the enormity of the film: a 2,000 page script, 200 days of exterior filming and 150 days of interior filming. A set was created at Woltersdorf in Germany where a crew of 30,000 people fed by 100 cooks were utilised over the entire shoot and by the end of the production the film had cost six million Marks. This steady stream of figures resulted in the series being described as \"a completely new film experience\", and even without the story being unveiled May had given The Mistress of the World a feeling of importance and gravitas."

The more independent cultural publications were less positive, Berliner B\u00f6rsen-Courier wrote that the serial did not rise above the average feature and that it lacked a sense of greatness, strength and depth. George Gottholt, writing in the Freie Deutsche B\u00fchne, was very negative in his views, stating \"This film, and others like, it have a vulgarizing effect on the taste and a dumbing-down effect on the intellect of its audience.\" Carjels compares The Mistress of the World to a modern globe-trotting adventure story more akin to an Indiana Jones or Lara Croft film, rather than a more intellect take such as Madame Dubarry. Although receiving mixed reviews, the public responded positively and The Mistress of the World was the most commercially successful German film of the 1919-1920 season, outstripping The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) in popular appeal."

He and dozens of other young men arrive at Abu Ghraib, a prison located 20 miles from Baghdad. CO Capt. Hayes (Scott Patterson) greets them with a rousing speech about them standing on the front lines of the war against terrorism, but the poor living conditions and boredom begin to wear on the soldiers. Jack requests MP duty, undaunted by the cautionary tale of an earlier volunteer who had the same idea and wound up shooting himself in the foot to escape. With no training, briefing or idea what to expect, Jack is transferred to \"Hard Site\"\u2014a cellblock that supposedly houses hard-core terrorists. His new boss, Sgt. Tanner (Sean Astin), tells him that the Hard Site's guiding principle is \"no compassion\"; their job is to \"soften up\" prisoners for military interrogators. This includes tactics like sensory deprivation, humiliation and isolation. Jack has his reservations about the treatment of detainees at the prison. He strikes up a friendship with one of the detainees Ghazi Hammoud (Omid Abtahi), a London-educated engineer. Just days before they were scheduled to return home, Jack and his unit learn that their tour of duty has been extended by six months. They are devastated but continue their day to day duties. Hammoud is subjected to multiple rough interrogations. The guards shackle him to the cell so he is forced to stand and tell Jack to let him shit himself. When Jack finally confronts his fellow soldiers, defending Hammoud's innocence, he learns that Hammoud has confessed to building a bomb that killed 18 civilians in a coffee shop. Jack confronts Hammoud asking if he killed \"innocent people\" to which Hammoud replies that they were not innocent. Jack breaks down and subsequently adopts a more aggressive posture, treating the detainees less kindly than he had prior to Hammoud's confession. When it is finally time for Jack to go home, he briefs the soldier set to replace him, much like Tanner had briefed him. His replacement takes out a camera and snaps a photo, but Jack tells him to put the camera away. When Jack notices Hammoud has fallen asleep, he drags the prisoner out of the cell and begins yelling at him. Unknown to Jack, the second soldier snaps another picture. After returning home to the US, Jack sees the news coverage of the Abu Graib scandal breaking on live TV, with the pictures snapped of him as he is shopping at a local store with his girlfriend."

On May 8, 2014, ABC picked up the pilot to series for the 2014\u201315 television season. At the Television Critics Association Press Tour in July 2014, it was announced that How to Get Away with Murder would be a limited series with only 15 or 16 episodes per season. The smaller size of episode count stems from the deal for the series star Viola Davis. On October 9, 2014, ABC picked up the series for a full season of 15 episodes. The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015, by ABC. The series was effectively confirmed as earning a second-season renewal for the 2015\u201316 season via a promo succeeding the first-season finale and an earlier statement by Viola Davis also confirming the renewal at the close of shooting for the first season. It would contain 15 episodes, like the previous season. Production began on May 21, 2015, with Shonda Rhimes announcing on Twitter that Peter Nowalk and his writers were in full swing mapping the second season.

That's a long road\". Charlie Weber commented on Frank's whereabouts as he said to Entertainment Weekly \"I think he's hiding, and I think he's alone.

Regarding Laurel, Nowalk said that Laurel's backstory with her family would be explored in the upcoming season, \"I feel like it's very present. The promise of our show is that we won't dangle things out too long. The likelihood is yes. We've raised that question too many times not to answer it sooner than later\".

        "content": "Danny Pink, a former soldier emotionally scarred from his experiences, begins teaching Maths at Coal Hill School in the present. Clara, an English teacher at the school, invites him out for a drink. He agrees. Back at her office, Clara is briefed by the Twelfth Doctor about a damaged Dalek taken aboard the human rebel ship Aristotle in the future that declares its own race must be destroyed. Clara agrees to assist his efforts to help the \"good\" Dalek, despite the Doctor's contention that Daleks cannot be turned good. The Doctor, Clara, and three rebel soldiers are miniaturised so they can enter the Dalek\u2014nicknamed \"Rusty\" by the Doctor\u2014to determine what is making it good. Entering Rusty, they come upon its \"cortex vault\", which the Doctor describes as Dalek technology designed to suppress any developing compassion within the living mutant inside the shell, as well as store all of its memories. Rusty, speaking to the Doctor, relates the beauty it had witnessed in the galaxy, including the creation of a star. Rusty drew from this that Daleks must be destroyed for wanting to destroy that beauty. The Doctor repairs Rusty's power cell. This unintentionally causes it to revert to its normal thinking pattern. Rusty contacts the Dalek mothership, which sends other Daleks to destroy the rebel ship. Inside Rusty, Clara convinces the Doctor to reconsider his conviction that Daleks are irreversibly \"evil\". Inside the cortex vault, Clara awakens Rusty's memory of seeing a star's creation. The Doctor then links his mind to Rusty's consciousness, showing it the beauty of the universe. However, Rusty also assimilates the Doctor's own deep-rooted hatred towards the Daleks. It exterminates its fellow Daleks as they attempt to destroy the rebel ship. After leaving the inside of Rusty, the Doctor is disturbed that Rusty saw only hatred within him; he'd hoped for a \"victory\" in creating a \"good\" Dalek. Rusty responds that the Doctor is a good Dalek, while Rusty is not. Rusty sends a retreat signal to the Dalek mothership, causing it to believe the Aristotle has self-destructed. The Doctor turns down the surviving soldier Journey's offer to travel with him, telling her that he wishes that she was not a soldier. The Doctor returns Clara to her office moments after she left. On leaving, she bumps into Danny, who is glad his being an ex-soldier does not put her off dating him."

Simon Brew of Den of Geek wrote that the episode \"stakes one hell of a claim... as a series highlight,\" and that it was \"a really good, really entertaining episode,\" noting the similarities to 2005's \"Dalek\". Brew praised the new characterisation for Clara and Capaldi's emergence as the Doctor. The Guardian found the episode to be \"better than we might have expected.\" They singled out the character development of Zawe Ashton's character in such a short period of time, and Ben Wheatley for \"evoking a genuine sense of claustrophobic menace.'\" Terry Ramsey of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode four stars out of five, praising Capaldi: \"It may be hard to believe in a good Dalek, but after Saturday night it is easy to believe this will be a good Doctor.\" IGN also praised the episode, particularly Ford and Moffat's  script, stating that it \"evolves along with its characters\". They ultimately labelled the episode \"an entertaining new take on a classic old foe\", awarding it 8.4 out of 10. Neela Debnath of The Independent was positive regarding the episode, calling it \"A classic sci-fi adventure with all the spectacle of a blockbuster,\" while praising the new dynamic between The Doctor and Clara.  Tim Liew of Metro commented, \"I rather enjoyed this episode.\" He was also positive about the character development for Jenna Coleman and noted, \"the tight focus on a single enemy makes this the most menacing Dalek episode since \"Dalek\".\"  Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy felt the episode was an improvement over the series' opening episode and that it \"felt like the proper debut of our new lead.\" He felt the dynamic between Capaldi and Coleman was very similar to that of Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper, and called the episode \"smart, stirring and visually spectacular,\" awarding the episode four stars out of five. Forbes gave a negative review of the episode, criticising the Daleks' appearance so soon after Capaldi's entrance saying, \"It feels like the BBC have a lack of confidence in the public accepting Capaldi as The Doctor,\" and the \"flawed\" concept of the episode.  They were critical of the characterisation of Capaldi's Doctor: \"the modern Doctor is not the irascible, self-centred William Hartnell of those early episodes.\" But they were positive about the characterisation of Clara and overall said, \"Nonetheless, this action-packed second episode made me much more likely to tune in next week than last week\u2019s opener."

Along the way, Mr. Mart\u00ednez hires Elena, a somewhat shy and insecure, but very beautiful young woman. \u00c1ngel secretly writes a book, \"The Memories of Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez\", in which he expresses his true feelings and desires.

Unknown to everyone, she is a secret vigilante who kills local thugs who accost her or when she witnesses them committing crimes. She always carries a small semi-automatic pistol in her purse and speaks in a childlike, innocent manner. She lives by herself in a small house and talks occasionally with her mother over the telephone about what she did during the day. Investigating the vigilante killings is a local sheriff. He soon meets and develops an attraction to Miss Meadows due to her old-fashioned clothing and style of speech. When he begins to suspect that the woman he finds himself drawn to may be the suspect he is looking for, the sheriff is torn between whether to arrest or protect her. When Miss Meadows meets an ex-convict named Skylar, who she learns served time for molesting young children, she begins to fear for her young students' safety. When Miss Meadows approaches and threatens to kill Skylar if he continues hanging around the school or around her kids, he begins stalking her. It is eventually revealed that all of the telephone conversations that Miss Meadows has been having with her mother over the course of the film are imaginary. As a young girl, Mary Meadows witnessed her mother's murder in a drive-by shooting outside a local church after attending the wedding of a family friend. This traumatic incident left Miss Meadows so emotionally scarred that she entered a fantasy world in which she imagined that her mother was still alive, then began to go after and kill criminals whom she viewed as a threat to society. The various criminals that Miss Meadows kills on-screen include a trucker who tries to abduct her at gunpoint in the opening scene, a young man who committed a mass shooting at a local diner, and the town's Catholic priest whom Miss Meadows finds sexually molesting a young boy. When Miss Meadows learns that she is pregnant after a sexual encounter with the sheriff, she decides to accept his proposal of marriage. On the day of the wedding, Skylar kidnaps Heather, one of Miss Meadows's students, from her house, forcing Miss Meadows to go to Skylar's house (wearing her wedding dress) to try to stop him, only to end up a captive herself. When she manages to free Heather and struggle with Skylar over her gun, the sheriff, passing by after leaving the church, sees Heather running from Skylar's house as she shouts for help. Meanwhile, Skylar takes Miss Meadows' gun from her purse, aims it at her and asks, \"Do you really think you can save the world? Well, try saving your self first!\" Just then, the sheriff arrives and fatally shoots Skylar in the head. Seeing Miss Meadows' gun still clutched in Skylar's hand, he notes \"it has his prints now\". He and Miss Meadows proceed back to the church. One year later, Miss Meadows and the Sheriff are married; she still wears her tap shoes and he has taken up the accordion. Now parents to a baby daughter, they are content to be peculiar together. As Miss Meadows prepares to go out before dinner, the sheriff tells her \"be careful\"; she replies \"I always am\", leaves the house, and does one final little tap dance on the sidewalk."

In June 2013, accompanied by columnist Glenn Greenwald and The Guardian intelligence reporter Ewen MacAskill, she travels to Hong Kong with her camera for the first meeting with \"Citizenfour\" in a hotel, who reveals himself as Edward Snowden. Scenes of their meeting take place in Snowden's hotel room, where he maintains his privacy. Shots of Snowden in his bed, in front of his mirror and of the hotel from a distance form the character of Snowden as a trapped political agent. After four days of interviews, on June 9, Snowden's identity is made public at his request. As media outlets begin to discover his location at the Mira Hotel, Snowden moves into Poitras' room in an attempt to elude phone calls made to his room. Facing potential extradition and prosecution in the United States, Snowden schedules a meeting with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and applies for refugee status. After Poitras believes she is being followed, she leaves Hong Kong for Berlin, Germany. On June 21, the US government requests the Hong Kong government extradite Snowden. Snowden manages to depart from Hong Kong, but his US passport is cancelled before he can connect to Havana, stranding him in the Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow for 40 days. On August 1, 2013, the Russian government grants Snowden temporary asylum for a period of one year. Meanwhile, Greenwald returns to his home in Rio de Janeiro and speaks publicly about United States' utilization of NSA programs for foreign surveillance. Greenwald and Poitras maintain a correspondence wherein they both express reluctance to return to the United States. Throughout, the film offers smaller vignettes that precede and follow Snowden's Hong Kong interviews, including William Binney speaking about NSA programs, and eventually testifying before the German Parliament regarding NSA spying in Germany. The film closes with Greenwald, Snowden and Poitras meeting once again, this time in Russia. Greenwald and Snowden discuss new emerging details on US intelligence programs, careful to only write down and not speak critical pieces of information. Greenwald tears these documents creating a pile of scraps, before slowly removing them from the table."

        "content": "Born on June 21, 1983 in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Edward Snowden first became involved with the United States government upon his enrollment in the Army Reserves in the spring of 2004. Snowden claims to have left the program after a few months because he broke his legs in a training accident while a US House of Representatives report claims he had shin splints. He then began working for the CIA in 2006 and was stationed with diplomatic cover at the embassy in Geneva, Switzerland in 2007. After nearly three years with the agency, Snowden resigned his position in February 2009 in order to begin working for a contractor with Dell for the NSA. It was at this point in his career that Snowden could sense that his views were changing; \"I watched as Obama advanced the very policies that I thought would be reined in ... [The NSA] are intent on making every conversation and every form of behaviour in the world known to them\". In 2012, Snowden was reassigned from Yokota base in Japan to the Kunia Operations Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, working for Dell before serving as a consultant to Booz Allen Hamilton. As an \"infrastructure analyst\" at the National Threat Operations Center, he monitored internet communication. In his own words, the longer he continued to work for the NSA, the more he \"worked in secret to resist\" his own feelings regarding the various programs in place at the agency. He had served at the Hawaiian base for approximately 15 months prior to leaving the United States and leaking thousands of classified documents. In 2020 Snowden is still living in exile in Russia and conducted two interviews, one with NPR's Fresh Air segment and one with WIRED Magazine prior to the release of his autobiography Permanent Record on September 17, 2019."

She moved to Berlin, Germany after being detained repeatedly at border controls when entering the US. She edited the film in Germany after flying directly there from Hong Kong with the Snowden footage, to prevent the FBI from showing up with a search warrant for her hard drives. All the film footage is kept on encrypted drives with multiple levels of nested protection. The computer she uses for reading sensitive documents is separated from the internet by an air gap. Greenwald credited her with a \"complete expert level of understanding of how to do a story like this with total technical and operational safety\". Maass called Poitras' security skills \"particularly vital \u2014 and far from the journalistic norm \u2014 in an era of pervasive government spying\", and quotes Snowden stating that \"[i]n the wake of this year's disclosure, it should be clear that unencrypted journalist-source communication is unforgivably reckless.\" Producer Bonnefoy has also discussed the encrypted workflow used in making the film, adding \"if we have a conversation that's particularly confidential, we'll move the electronics out of the room, or we'll just meet somewhere outside of the editing room, without our phones.\" The Film Society of Lincoln Center (which selects films for the New York Film Festival) reported that Poitras changed the location of the initial screening for the NYFF's selection committee several times, in case someone was tracking her movements. The committee was shown a rough cut that had sensitive material redacted, and the NYFF \"had to keep the movie's inclusion in the festival under wraps until mid-September\" and it was \"kept out of festival schedules and documents until we could talk about it openly\". The last-minute inclusion in the festival's main slate was an unprecedented event for the NYFF, and \"tickets for both screenings sold out within just a few hours\". The film's ending credits unusually name several free software projects and security tools, without which \"this film would not be possible\". The programs named include Tor, Tails, Debian GNU/Linux, Off-the-Record Messaging, the GNU Privacy Guard, Truecrypt, and SecureDrop. In October 2014, the Electronic Frontier Foundation published an informational page about the software credited in the film, and in November 2015 Poitras was prominently featured in a Tor fund-raising campaign."

Ronnie Scheib of Variety wrote No amount of familiarity with whistleblower Edward Snowden and his shocking revelations of the U.S. government's wholesale spying on its own citizens can prepare one for the impact of Laura Poitras's extraordinary documentary Citizenfour... far from reconstructing or analyzing a fait accompli, the film tersely records the deed in real time, as Poitras and fellow journalist Glenn Greenwald meet Snowden over an eight-day period in a Hong Kong hotel room to plot how and when they will unleash the bombshell that shook the world. Adapting the cold language of data encryption to recount a dramatic saga of abuse of power and justified paranoia, Poitras brilliantly demonstrates that information is a weapon that cuts both ways. Spencer Ackerman writes in The Guardian: Citizenfour must have been a maddening documentary to film. Its subject is pervasive global surveillance, an enveloping digital act that spreads without visibility, so its scenes unfold in courtrooms, hearing chambers and hotels. Yet the virtuosity of Laura Poitras, its director and architect, makes its 114 minutes crackle with the nervous energy of revelation. Time magazine rated the film #3 out of its top 10 movies of 2014 and called the film \"This Halloween's Scariest Chiller\".

The Hollywood Reporter provided some legal analysis, noting observers opining that Edwards may not have legal standing to pursue the lawsuit. Edwards also challenged the film's Oscar eligibility on the grounds that Poitras' 2013 short film showing Greenwald interviewing Snowden constituted a previous release of Citizenfour, rendering it ineligible under Oscar rules. The Academy rejected the claim, noting that \"The Guardian interview appears in less than two minutes of the documentary\", and ruled that Citizenfour was eligible for Oscar consideration. In February 2015, the filmmakers asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas to dismiss the lawsuit on standing and jurisdictional grounds, and on First Amendment grounds citing Bartnicki v. Vopper. Edwards officially dropped the case on April 3, 2015."

        "content": "Frozen II is a 2019 American computer-animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios as their 58th film and the sequel to Frozen (2013). Directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, written by Lee from a story by Lee, Buck, Marc Smith, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and Robert Lopez, and produced by Peter Del Vecho, the film stars Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, and Jonathan Groff. Set three years after the first film, Frozen II follows sisters Anna and Elsa, Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and the snowman Olaf as they travel to an enchanted forest to unravel the origin of Elsa's magical power. The film was green-lit in March 2015 after a company debate about whether it would be perceived as inferior to the original. It used more-complex, enhanced animation technology than Frozen, and was an interdepartmental collaboration. Anderson-Lopez and Lopez returned as songwriters, and Christophe Beck again composed the music. The film was translated into 46 languages and was accompanied by Into the Unknown: Making Frozen II, a documentary series. Frozen II premiered in Los Angeles on November 7, 2019, and was released in the United States on November 22. The film received generally positive reviews for its craftsmanship, delivery, and themes; its narrative and focus drew some criticism, and the music had a mixed reaction. Frozen II earned $1.450billion worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the third highest-grossing film of 2019, the tenth highest-grossing film of all time, and the second highest-grossing animated film of all time. It had the highest-grossing worldwide opening of all time for an animated film. Frozen II received several awards and nominations: two Annie Awards and nominations for a BAFTA, two Golden Globes, and two Grammys. At the 92nd Academy Awards, the film's \"Into the Unknown\" was nominated for Best Original Song."

        "content": "King Agnarr of Arendelle tells his daughters Elsa and Anna that their grandfather, King Runeard, forged a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in the Enchanted Forest (their homeland). A fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the forest's classical elements of earth, fire, water, and air. The elements disappear, and a wall of mist traps everyone in the forest; Agnarr barely escapes, helped by an unknown savior. Three years after her coronation, Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, the snowman Olaf, the iceman Kristoff, and Kristoff's reindeer Sven. One night, Elsa hears a mysterious voice calling her. She follows it, unintentionally awakening the elemental spirits and forcing everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. The Rock Troll colony arrives, and Grand Pabbie tells them that Elsa and the others must set things right by uncovering the truth about the past. Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven follow the mysterious voice, and travel to the Enchanted Forest. The mist parts at Elsa's touch, while the air spirit appears as a tornado, catching everyone in its vortex before Elsa stops it by forming ice sculptures. She and Anna discover that the sculptures are images from their father's past, and encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers that it is an agitated magical salamander and calms it. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved Agnarr (an Arendellian). They later learn about a fifth spirit, who will unite the people with the magic of nature. Elsa, Anna, and Olaf continue north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river said to explain the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf to safety, and continues alone. She encounters and tames the N\u00f8kk, the water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her is the memory of young Iduna's call; her powers are a gift from nature because of Iduna's selfless saving of Agnarr, and Elsa is the fifth spirit. She learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce Northuldran resources, because of Runeard's contempt for the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to destroy them and incorporate their region into the kingdom. Elsa learns that Runeard began the conflict by killing the unarmed Northuldran leader in cold blood. She sends this information to Anna before she becomes frozen (causing Olaf to fade away) when she ventures into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. Anna concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. She awakens the J\u00f6tunn, and lures them towards the dam. They hurl boulders, destroying the dam and sending a flood down the fjord towards the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom. As the mist disappears, she rejoins Anna and revives Olaf; Anna accepts Kristoff's marriage proposal. Elsa explains that she and Anna are the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna then becomes Queen of Arendelle; Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who visits Arendelle since peace has been restored. In a post-credits scene, Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events to Marshmallow (a snow monster created by Elsa as palace guard) and the Snowgies, miniature snowmen inadvertently generated by Elsa on Anna's nineteenth birthday."

        "title": "Frozen II_Thematic analysis",
        "content": "The indigenous S\u00e1mi people were historically associated with reindeer, and identified with the animals' strength. Trude Fonneland wrote that a female divinity emphasized female contributions with themes including unity, courage, hope, friendship, and truth. Elsa attempted to send Anna away because she was concerned about her sister's safety. In animation, female characters embody female images as a whole. The film's female characters are emotionally diverse, motivated by social status and awakening of feminism. The elegant, noble Elsa wants to be free and live a normal life, and Anna is dreamy, cheerful and enthusiastic; both acted to defend their kingdom from danger. Frozen II has been interpreted as a critique of colonialism and as advocating reparation. Before Elsa and Anna were born, their grandfather King Runeard built a dam for the Northuldra tribe. Ostensibly a gift, the dam weakens the tribe's magical power. Runeard's plot fails after he murders the leader of Northuldra and war breaks out. The forest spirits which preside over Northuldra shroud it in an impenetrable mist, preventing anyone from leaving or entering. The Northuldra are modeled on the S\u00e1mi people, indigenous to Scandinavia and northwestern Russia, who experienced discrimination as pagans reputed to be skilled in magic and witchcraft. In 1609, King Christian IV of Denmark wrote that the S\u00e1mi were adept at magic, and no mercy should be granted in cases involving S\u00e1mi sorcery. Nordic missionaries confiscated or destroyed religious items and sites and built churches to supplant S\u00e1mi shamanism. The Northuldra dam reflects S\u00e1mi history. A hydroelectric power station was built on the Altaelva river in Norway from 1979 to 1981; the controversial Virdnej\u00e1vr Dam flooded a S\u00e1mi village, disrupting traditional hunting and herding. Slate critic Inkoo Kang said that although Frozen II was obviously influenced by S\u00e1mi history, the Northuldra may also be interpreted as representing displaced Native Americans; Arendelle can be seen as representing the United States' colonial past, evocative of the embellished life of Pocahontas. The Northuldra are presented in an appealing way, romanticized as a people with magical power who live in harmony with the spiritual and physical worlds. While Elsa attempts to find out who was calling her, Anna destroys the dam to make amends to the Northuldra for Arendelle's mistakes. Elsa's last-minute intervention prevents the destruction of the kingdom, but Anna destroys the dam in the belief that Elsa is dead. According to Kang, the film promotes reparations for past atrocities. Matt Goldberg wrote that the symbolism of the film's ending is undercut by having Elsa save Arendelle, instead of rebuilding the kingdom elsewhere. Racial issues in Frozen II are mitigated by making Elsa and Anna half Northuldran, and their mother is depicted as a heroine who saved their father (King Agnarr) from death during the battle. Frozen all-white characters were controversial; the sequel's characters are somewhat more diverse, but still stereotypical. Jennifer Baldwin described Frozen II as a film about trauma, transformation, and faith communities' more-active role in environmental repair. Trauma is caused by the dam, which weakens the elemental spirits. Olaf describes the forest as a place of transformation: venturing into the unknown, befriending the spirits and the indigenous Northuldra, and confronting trauma. Elsa gains the trust of the spirits, each leading her closer to the truth and her transformation into one of the elements. Anna employs the trolls (symbolic of the earth) to break the dam (symbolic of trauma and mistrust) and gains her own strength, independent of her relationship with Elsa. According to Baldwin, this encourages the audience to adopt more sustainable practices, make amends, and work together to preserve the natural world. The film can introduce young children to environmental issues, such as climate change. Lauren Dundes describes Elsa's relationship with the mythological horse N\u00f8kk and concludes that \"her skills as a horse whisperer do not threaten men's ascendancy ... These themes show how Disney balked at modernizing Elsa, retreating to outdated conceptions of gender roles\". According to Tia Aprilianti Putri, the film's female characters were uniquely heroic or villainous. Nia Kurniawati wrote that Frozen II feminist message was subtle and realistic."

The following month, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn said that a sequel would not be immediately forthcoming because the studio was focusing on a Broadway musical adaptation of Frozen. In a May 2014 CNBC interview with David Faber, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that the company would not force the development of a sequel, because it was concerned about not living up to the first film. Iger said that the Frozen franchise \"is something that is kind of forever for the company\", similar to The Lion King. On June 10, 2014, Lee confirmed that Walt Disney Studios CCO John Lasseter had authorized her and Buck to explore a possible sequel. While working on the short film Frozen Fever (2015), they realized that they missed the characters. Meanwhile, Del Vecho had been asked by fans about Frozen future. Lee, Buck, and Del Vecho discussed the possibility of a sequel. Buck later said, \"The one thing that we did right away was to figure out what would be satisfying for Anna and Elsa at the end of the movie.\" They decided on ending the sequel with Anna becoming the queen of Arendelle, while Elsa would be \"free\"."

        "content": "Iger, Lasseter, and actor Josh Gad announced at Disney's March 12, 2015, annual shareholders' meeting in San Francisco that Frozen II, a full-length sequel, was in development; Buck and Lee would return as directors, and Del Vecho as producer. The production team traveled to Norway; Finland; and Iceland for background research; they decided to make Elsa a \"mythic hero\" with magic ice powers and Anna a \"fairytale hero\" who lives in a magical world but has no magic powers. They concluded that the first film successfully combined the two elements. Allison Schroeder was hired to assist Lee with the script in August 2018 after Lee succeeded Lasseter as Disney Animation's CCO; Lee was credited as the film's screenwriter, and Schroeder was credited with additional screenplay material. The film's story contributions were made by Lee, Buck, Marc Smith, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and Robert Lopez. Overall, the budget was approximately $150million. Voice recording began in September 2017, although Menzel started a couple of weeks later due to a concert tour. That month, Gad announced his role in the sequel with Buck, Lee, Del Vecho, and Lasseter. In July 2018, Variety reported that Wood and Brown were in talks to join the cast. Their roles were later disclosed as Iduna and Lieutenant Destin Mattias. Wood was cast because her voice resembled Menzel and Bell's. The voice of Agnarr was changed from Maurice LaMarche to Molina. The Voice's four-note call, derived from the Latin sequence \"Dies irae\", is delivered in a manner resembling the Scandinavian music form kulning. Frozen II first completed scenes were shown at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June 2019, where Becky Bresee and effects-animation head Marlon West said that the film was \"still in production, with seven weeks of animation to be completed and 10 weeks of special effects\". The filmmakers collaborated with S\u00e1mi experts on the depiction of the Northuldra tribe with Verdett, an advisory group which was the result of an agreement between the Walt Disney Company, the transnational Saami Council, and the S\u00e1mi parliaments of Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Anderson-Lopez confirmed that Elsa would have no female love interest in the film, despite some fans' desire for one. Lee later explained to The New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd that Elsa's main audience did not seem ready for such a relationship. Lee said in a press conference that Frozen II would not acquire elements from the television series Once Upon a Times non-canonical Frozen storyline: Frozen II underwent significant revisions after its first test screening in San Diego; Disney Animation discovered that although adults liked the film, children found it hard to follow. The production team realized they needed to clarify the identity of the Voice and the point of Elsa's transformation, and add more comedy and shots of Bruni (the fire salamander). A scene of expository dialogue in which the lead characters explained to the people trapped in the Enchanted Forest why they had come there was replaced with Olaf's humorous recap of Frozen. Due to the changes, the animators needed to create 61 new shots and redo another 35. An undisclosed number of shots were cut from the finished film; about a dozen animators and artists worked for two months on an elaborate resurrection scene for Olaf before it was cut. The last major animation scene completed before the production team locked the picture was \"Show Yourself\", the musical number in which Elsa enters Ahtohallan and learns all the secrets she has been seeking. According to Del Vecho, the scene \"required all of the resources at the studio\" to get the film done on time. Lopez said that the first draft of \"Show Yourself\" was very different from its final version. Megan Harding directed an official documentary series on the production of Frozen II, which depicted the process of Del Vecho and Lopez determining The Voice's identity. Once the production team settled on Queen Iduna, the lyrics of \"Show Yourself\" finally began to come together, but then the studio's artists, designers, and animators needed to quickly figure out how to stage the dramatic culmination of Elsa's journey towards becoming the Snow Queen.  The film was edited by Jeff Draheim."

Tony Smeed and Becky Bresee were the film's heads of animation; Hyun-Min Lee replaced Bresee as supervising animator for Anna, while Wayne Unten again served as supervising animator for Elsa as he had done on Frozen. Steve Golberg was the supervising animator for visual effects. Scott Beattie was the director of cinematography layout, while Mohit Kallianpur was the director of cinematography lighting. Frozen II made use of advancements in technology, artistic performance, and skeletal animation. Before the animation began, Unten showed scenes of superheroes like Frozone to Elsa's animators as examples of what to avoid. Creating the personal flurry effect was so difficult for the animators that the directors had Elsa put a permafrost coating on Olaf in Frozen II instead. Elsa's graceful movements were modeled on Frozen and modern dance, particularly Martha Graham's work. In accordance with Disney's preference for a different style for each film and the directors' and production designer's artistic vision, the multi-departmental animation team was instructed to reconstruct the characters so they were slightly different in tone and style from Frozen. They differed in \"very subtle ways\", with a \"through line from the first movie to the second\". As well as making the Enchanted Forest vegetation autumnal, the effects team applied two internally developed applications (Vegetation Asset and Fire Tree) to enhance the film's vegetation and fire animation. Lighting and special effects were applied to glacial ice, spirit magic, and memory. The first step for the animation team was to study the screenplay and understand the characters. Blocking (creating key poses) was next, followed by effects and layout. Effects were proposed for layout before animation process to choreograph the dam-collapse scene. Although Frozen greatest difficulty for Frozen was the winter snow, Frozen II is set in fall; its main challenge was how to consistently depict the wind and \"pass that downstream\". Frozen II animation software was influenced by the software in several other Disney films. Anna's hair was animated with Quicksilver, developed for Moana (2016) to deal with wind; for Elsa's hair, the lighting software Beast was used. A vocal coach instructed the animators on how a singer would breathe. The animators then spent about eight months creating N\u00f8kk, which has a liquid appearance, with effects supervised by Erin Ramos. J\u00f6tunns had a long rigging process to avoid making rocks distracting.  The water simulation was intended to be more realistic than in Moana. To create Gale, the wind spirit, a tool called Swoop was developed. They later received real-time feedback from the supervisors, directors, and producer."

        "content": "Costume and character designs underwent several revisions before they were finalized. According to designer Griselda Sastrawinata-Lemay, the process was the most intricate of any animated film. Technological advancements allowed the designer to create more-detailed outfits, with extra beads and sequins. The team used Marvelous Designer, a computer-generated imagery program, to drape each character's clothing. Anna's outfit was inspired by the Norwegian folk bunad, worn during the 1840s and 1850s. Typically made of wool, it had decorative embroidery. Anna lost the pigtail braid she had in Frozen because she is three years older in Frozen II, and it was replaced by a braid across the back of her head. Aging Elsa three years was inspired by artists Alexander McQueen and Elie Saab. Saab's designs had long trains and cumbersome floor-length hemlines; the designers instead created a tailored coat with a double-panel cape and epaulettes, highlighting Elsa's strength. The animation team used a curve-based method for the intricate embroidery. A program interpreted two-dimensional visual designs as line strokes, rendering them as curves. This allowed quick changes, minimizing manual work during design modifications. It also supported free-form stitching with threads of various widths, colors, and densities, crucial to the production of a variety of embroidery styles."

Lee replied that it was not really a snowflake; the four sides represented the four elemental spirits and its center represented Elsa, the fifth spirit. Disney partnered with 140 other brands worldwide to promote Frozen II, the highest number of brands for a Disney animated film. They marketed Frozen II in the U.S. through internal and external partners, including Enterprise Rent-A-Car, McDonald's, and Lego. To support the film's marketing campaign, the lead voice cast made several public and televised appearances; these included a \"Friendsgiving\" stunt night on ABC, introductions on The Masked Singer, and a Women of Impact program on Nat Geo Wild. In November 2019, the lead voice cast's schedules were so full that Bell said: \"Time [was] not there\". The 104-minute Frozen II premiered on November 7, 2019, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. The film was originally scheduled for general release on November 27, but it was moved up five days. On January 17, 2020, a sing-along version of the film was released. It was localized by Disney Character Voices International into 45 languages by its original theatrical release date; Frozen had been translated into 41 languages. The success of Frozen localized versions led to the release of an album with all versions of \"Let It Go\", and Jik\u014bon 2 (a Northern Sami version) was released to honor the people's contributions. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released Frozen II for digital download on February 11, 2020, and on Blu-ray and DVD on February 25. At the same time, a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Ultimate Collector's Edition, and 4KUHD Blu-ray steelbook edition was released.

The former's critical consensus reads, \"Frozen II can't quite recapture the showstopping feel of its predecessor, but it remains a dazzling adventure into the unknown.\" Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned Frozen II a score of 64 out of 100 score based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", whereas Frozen received a higher 75 score out of 48 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A\u2013 (lower than Frozen A+) on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak rated it 4.5 out of five stars on the film's opening day. Reviews were moderately positive, critics praising the film's craftsmanship, delivery, and themes. The New York Times critic Manohla Dargis called the narrative a \"pink world of adventure and aspirational uplift\", and Nell Minow of RogerEbert.com noted its frank, compelling depiction of issues which were understandable by audiences of all ages. Dargis cited Frozen II engaging visual imagery, balanced by romance and history, and Minow noted the film's autumnal palette. Peter Travers (Rolling Stone), Simran Hans (The Guardian), and Todd McCarthy (The Hollywood Reporter) praised the film. Travers, who enjoyed reconnecting with the characters, called the animation stunning and referred to the music as \"tantalizing earworms\". Hans compared the film's narrative to real-world efforts to mitigate climate change. McCarthy praised its \"catchy songs\", \"easy-to-like characters\", and \"astonishing backdrops\", with humor and a plot driven by \"female empowerment galore\". Frozen II narrative, music, and focus were criticized. In The Wall Street Journal, John Anderson noted that the sequel was not innovative and criticized the film's flawed narrative and low-quality music in comparison with Frozen. In an Empire review, Ben Travis said that the narrative relied too much on mythology and hazy backstories. Minow criticized the film's excessively detailed narrative, and Observer writer Oliver Jones said that the film's energy and originality were overly focused on the sisters. Reviewers for the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post cited Frozen II complicated story and dark tone."

The film was produced by Sidney Bernstein, then with the British Ministry of Information, with Alfred Hitchcock acting as a \"treatment advisor\". The script was written by Richard Crossman and Colin Wills. Soviet filmmaker Sergei Nolbandov was production supervisor.

        "content": "Sidney Bernstein, a cinema entrepreneur, had been an advisor to the Ministry of Information since 1940, and  from 1942 onwards had been in charge of supply of British films to cinemas in areas freed from Axis control. Early in 1945, he began to make inquiries about the availability of Soviet films showing scenes of German atrocities. Bernstein visited the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on 22 April 1945, a week after it was liberated by British forces. What he saw there made him determined to make the film to show to German audiences. Production of the film was ordered by the Psychological Warfare Division (PWD) which was a unit of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). The PWD was responsible for the political activities in Germany of the British Ministry of Information and its U.S. counterpart, the Office of War Information. Bernstein began to assemble his film production team in April 1945.  He and the U.S. Information Control Division were the driving forces behind the film in its early stages. By the time Bernstein had visited Belsen, cameramen from the British Army Film and Photographic Unit had already been filming the early days of Belsen's liberation, including the capture of its commandant, Josef Kramer. Their films were recorded without sound. Recognizing the need to make the films as authentic as possible, he asked a newsreel cameraman from British Movietone News, who had sound equipment, to film interviews with British officials and members of the German SS. Among the German personnel interviewed by the newsreel cameramen were Fritz Klein, later executed for atrocities at Belsen. Klein was interviewed in front of a pile of bodies that included some of his victims. The film eventually utilized both silent footage from combat cameramen in the armed services and sound footage from newsreel cameramen. Fourteen locations were covered by the film, including ten concentration camps and four locations where atrocities had taken place. Among the camps where footage was shot was Belsen, Dachau, Buchenwald, Auschwitz and Majdanek. Bernstein's team included film editors Stewart McAllister, Peter Tanner, and Marcel Cohen, in addition to Crossman, Wills, and Bernstein's friend Alfred Hitchcock. Though Bernstein has described Hitchcock as the film's director, the Imperial War Museum describes Hitchcock as the film's \"treatment advisor,\" noting that his one-month participation did not begin until after the footage was already shot and he was not involved in the rough cut of the film. Tanner also described Hitchcock as an advisor on the film and not as its director. Among the guidance Hitchcock provided was to recommend that the film avoid tricky editing to enhance its credibility, and to use wherever possible long shots and panning. He also recommended that German villagers be shown visiting the camps, and suggested showing scenes at Auschwitz showing piles of hair, wedding rings, spectacles and toothbrushes. Hitchcock told the filmmakers that these steps were necessary because many people would not believe the film and would accuse the Allies of faking the film. After production commenced, film was continually flowing in from the front, as concentration camps were liberated. Ultimately the film incorporated the work of British, American and Soviet camera crews. Their cameras documented piles of dead, as well as starved survivors and burned remains in the ovens of the crematoria, and incorporated Hitchcock's suggestion by showing piles of victims' belongings, teeth, and bags of hair at the Majdanek camp. An immense pile of spectacles was accompanied by narration noting that perhaps one victim in ten wore spectacles. No mention of the Holocaust was made in the production of the film, which might be attributed to the failure of the filmmakers to grasp the full scale of Adolf Hitler's Final Solution  for Europe's Jews. PBS notes that a 1941 British Ministry of Information guideline advised war propagandists to deal with \"the treatment of indisputably innocent people, not with violent political opponents and not with Jews,\" to make their work credible. Footage from the documentary was used in the postwar prosecution of Nazi war criminals  at Nuremberg and at L\u00fcneburg, the site of the trial of Josef Kramer, the Belsen commandant known as the \"Beast of Belsen\". Kramer had claimed that he did not have sufficient food to feed the inmates, which was contradicted by the footage."

        "content": "A rough cut of five reels of the film was screened in September 1945, after which the film was shelved. The Imperial War Museum states that the project from the beginning was beset by \"the practical difficulties of international co-operation and the realities of post-war shortages.\" As a result, the film was delayed \"long enough to be overtaken by other events,\" including completion of two other concentration camp films and changes in occupation policy, \"where the authorities no longer considered a one-hour compilation of atrocity material appropriate.\" British concern about the growing Zionist movement has been cited as a reason for the shelving of the film. Also cited are U.S. Army slowness in providing footage and technical issues, such as the search for an editing machine. The U.S. withdrew from the project in July 1945, shortly before the Psychological Warfare Office and SHAEF were dissolved, leaving the British Ministry of Information in charge. The British military desire for a more congenial approach to relations with Germans and completion of other concentration camp documentaries were also reasons for it not being released. The result was that what had been envisioned originally as a joint project became two separate films: the British German Concentration Camps Factual Survey, which was not released, and Death Mills, directed by Billy Wilder,  titled Die Todesm\u00fchlen in its German-language version, which had a different director and film editor. Death Mills utilized the same footage, was shorter and was released in the American zone of occupation in January 1946. The Guardian describes the 22-minute Death Mills as very different to the \"grieving meditation on inhumanity that Bernstein conceived.\" As a result of the film's shelving, it did not receive the same acclaim as other documentaries on the Holocaust such as Claude Lanzmann\u2019s Shoah (1985), Alain Resnais\u2019 Night and Fog (1956), and Marcel Oph\u00fcls\u2019 The Sorrow and the Pity (1969)."

Work to restore and complete the film commenced after it became apparent that the popular documentary Memory of the Camps (PBS, 1984) needed restoration. The Imperial War Museum decided to complete the original 1945 documentary instead. Work began in December 2008, using the filmmakers' rough cut, script and shot list, and the footage was digitalized by a post-production facility in Wales. The missing sixth reel was reconstructed utilizing the original shot list. All scenes were located except for two maps, one of which was replaced by a new one. The original narration was spoken by actor Jasper Britton, and sound effects were added from the museum's resources. Its world premiere was at the 2014 Berlin International Film Festival. Digitizing the film had the effect of transforming \"the grainy past into a vivid present.\" The restored film was scheduled to be screened in January 2015 at the Metropolis Kino in Hamburg, the Danish Film Institute in Copenhagen, the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, and the Holocaust Memorial Museum of San Antonio, Texas. Cinema screenings in the United Kingdom, commencing in April 2015 at BFI Southbank in London, were planned. The film also was to be screened at the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival in July 2015 and the Holocaust & Human Rights Educator Conference in Dallas in August 2015. In January 2015 it was disclosed that German Concentration Camps Factual Survey was to go into general release to the public sometime during the year, either on DVD or in theaters. Memory of the Camps was due to be shown on the American PBS program Frontline on 14 April 2015, and is available for viewing on the Frontline website."

Missy had rigged their vortex manipulators to make them appear to have died from the Dalek attack, a trick she learned from the Doctor; however, the manipulators have been destroyed. They make their way in through a sewer, which contains a number of decaying and insane Dalek mutants. They capture a Dalek using the mutants in the sewer and steal its casing, which Missy convinces Clara to enter to help them re-enter the city. Once inside, Clara finds any spoken expression of emotion or individual identity is translated into only \"Exterminate!\" or \"I am a Dalek\". Once they access the city, Missy abandons Clara. The Doctor does not believe Clara is dead. While confronting Davros and the Supreme Dalek, the Doctor is knocked unconscious by Colony Sarff. When he wakes, the Doctor is back with Davros, who is attached to numerous cables that provide life-support to him from every Dalek. Davros tempts the Doctor to kill all the Daleks using the cables, but the Doctor reveals he came to express compassion to Davros having abandoned him as a boy in the past. To give Davros enough life to see the sun rise, the Doctor provides some of his regeneration energy, but this travels through the cables to every Dalek, creating new hybrid forms. Missy appears and saves the Doctor while killing Sarff. The Doctor, aware of Davros' plan, notes even the insane Daleks will regenerate. They arise and attack the city, seeking revenge. The Doctor and Missy escape and run into Clara, still within the Dalek casing and unable to identify herself. Missy tries to tell the Doctor that Clara was killed, but the Doctor is able to see through her lies, particularly when the \"Dalek\" asks for mercy. He frees Clara and tells Missy to run. Missy is cornered by a number of Daleks but suddenly claims to have a clever plan. Using his new sonic sunglasses, the Doctor summons the TARDIS, which also had avoided destruction by its automated systems. As the Dalek city is destroyed, the Doctor recalls why the Dalek casing allowed Clara to express a plea for mercy, and realises what he must do. He travels to the battlefield that young Davros was caught in, and uses a Dalek gun to eradicate the \"handmines\" and escort Davros away. The boy asks which side he fights for, and the Doctor replies it does not matter as long as there is mercy."

The Fourth and First Doctors make brief appearances during Missy's exposition of her account of the Doctor's fight with 50 android assassins. Among the past Dalek designs shown in this episode is the Special Weapons Dalek that first appeared in Remembrance of the Daleks (1988). The scene where Clara is being put into the Dalek mirrors a scene from her debut episode, \"Asylum of the Daleks\" (2012). A similar tactic was used by Ian Chesterton in The Daleks (1963\u201364), the first Dalek serial of the original Doctor Who series, and again by Rebec, a Thal, in the Third Doctor serial Planet of the Daleks (1973). Davros informs the Doctor that he has been given 'the only other chair on Skaro...' This references the first Dalek adventure;  the Doctor's companion Barbara comments that on the Daleks' world, 'there wasn't any furniture, now I come to think about it...' The Doctor lost his original sonic screwdriver when it was destroyed in the Fifth Doctor story The Visitation (1982). It wasn't replaced until the Seventh Doctor produced one in the 1996 Doctor Who movie. It remained a part of the Doctor's arsenal ever since, until this two-part episode. When Davros tempts the Doctor with killing every Dalek on Skaro, knowingly committing genocide, he asks \"Are you ready to be a god?\" This echoes the debate the Fourth Doctor has with Davros in Genesis of the Daleks (1975); when the Doctor asks him whether he would knowingly unleash a virus that would destroy all life in the universe, Davros is intrigued at the concept: \"Yes... I would do it. That power would set me up above the gods!\" It also refers back to the climax of Genesis, when the Doctor agonizes over whether he has the moral right to destroy the newly created Daleks, ultimately deciding against genocide. Davros' question to the Doctor \u2013 \"Am I a good man? \u2013 is the same one the Doctor himself asks Clara in \"Into the Dalek\" (2014). Previously, a Hostile Action Displacement System has been referred to as being on the TARDIS. In the Eleventh Doctor story \"Cold War\" (2013), it caused the TARDIS to leave the area. The system was first used in the Second Doctor story The Krotons (1968\u201369), also making the TARDIS dematerialise to avoid destruction."

She hates Eva, and as a manifestation of her morbid nature, she spies on her parents when Miguel vainly tries to make love to his wife. This is another mental torture inflicted on Eva because, in reality, Miguel only pretends to be disabled. Eva, frustrated as a wife, mother, and woman, finds true passion in the arms of \u00c1ngel."

        "content": "The OA is an American mystery drama television series with science fiction, supernatural, and fantasy elements. The OA debuted on Netflix on December 16, 2016. Created and executive produced by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij, the series is their third collaboration. The series consists of two seasons of eight episodes each, nearly all directed by Batmanglij, and is produced by Plan B Entertainment and Anonymous Content. In the series, Marling stars as a young woman named Prairie Johnson who resurfaces after having been missing for seven years. Prairie now calls herself \"the OA\" and can see, despite having been blind before her disappearance. On February 8, 2017, Netflix renewed the series for a second season, dubbed \"Part II\", that was released on March 22, 2019. Although The OA was planned by its creators to be a five-part story told in five seasons, on August 5, 2019, Netflix canceled the series after two seasons, leaving the show with a cliffhanger ending. The OA received generally favorable critical reception, averaging 77% for Part I and 92% for Part II on Rotten Tomatoes. The series' directing, visuals and acting were often singled out, as was its social impact."

Finally, she asks for their help to save the other missing people whom she claims she can rescue by opening a portal to another dimension."

        "content": "The series was conceived by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij and they began working on the concept in December 2012. They spent two years working on The OA on their own, before pitching to studios. From the early stages of development onward, they were telling the story out loud and noting one another's reactions to the story to refine it accordingly. They found it difficult to summarize the series in a written story, so they developed it aurally. When executives read the script of the first hour, they asked if the story \"really [went] somewhere\". Marling and Batmanglij then began to tell the story from beginning to end, playing all the characters and acting out the big moments through many hours. They worked with Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment, which connected with the story and shared notes before it went to networks and studios. Following a multiple-network bidding war, the series was first announced on March 5, 2015, when Netflix ordered eight one-hour long episodes with Plan B and Anonymous Content also on board. The announcement revealed that Marling would star, Batmanglij would direct, and both would write and executive produce. Marling and Batmanglij held similar positions in their previous two collaborations, Sound of My Voice and The East. Rostam Batmanglij, Zal's brother, worked as one of the composers on the series, and he also wrote its theme music. He previously composed for both Sound of My Voice and The East. Choreographer Ryan Heffington created The Movements, which are inspired by interpretive dance. Heffington first professionally worked with them on The East, and had been an acquaintance of both from earlier than that. The final chapter of Part I includes a dedication to Allison Wilke. Wilke, also known professionally as A.W. Gryphon, was a producer on the series who died of breast cancer three days after the series was finished and a month before its release."

Marling wrote that she and Batmanglij were \"deeply sad\" that they would not be able to finish the show. Fans responded with a #SaveTheOA and #TheOAisReal campaign on Twitter, a Change.org petition, and by posting video of themselves performing The Movements from the show. Additionally, the OA fan base raised funds for a digital billboard in Times Square. Marling wrote that she was moved by the fan support. One fan went on a hunger strike outside Netflix's Los Angeles Headquarters to protest for the show's return; Marling and Batmanglij visited her and offered her food and water. Some fans online have put forward a theory that the cancellation announcement was just a meta publicity stunt. Prominent creators of other television series also expressed their love for The OA, including Shonda Rhimes, Sam Esmail and Alex Kurtzman."

        "content": "Part I of The OA garnered a polarized but generally positive response from critics. Rotten Tomatoes assigned the first season a 77% critical approval rating and an average rating of 7.59/10 based on 66 reviews, writing that \"The OA is more than OK.\" Metacritic, based on 17 reviews, assigned the series a rating of 61 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Most reviewers acknowledged the series' ambition and praised its mystery and direction. Reviewers made both favorable and unfavorable comparisons to another Netflix Original, Stranger Things. John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote, \"The OA is Netflix's strongest and strangest original production since Stranger Things. In terms of substantive, original drama, it transcends it. Mind you, it is unclassifiable in the context of drama, mystery, science-fiction and fantasy, since it is straddling all sorts of lines and blurring them. It is outright astounding and brilliant, too.\" Tim Surette at TV Guide said that \"the final moments of Episode 5 \u2013 probably the best episode of the first season \u2013 was some of the most reaffirming television I've ever seen, not just for the show but for life itself. I've never really had this kind of a relationship with a series while watching it, but it's that experience that makes it well worth viewing.\" New York Magazines review was entitled \"Netflix's The OA Is an Extraordinary, Binge-Worthy December Surprise\". Tristram Fane Saunders of The Daily Telegraph gave a mixed review of 3 out of 5 stars and noted the series' potential but criticized its similarity to fellow Netflix Original Stranger Things, claiming that the series was attempting to be \"stranger than Stranger Things but \"on the basis of the first four episodes, the answer is a resounding no\". Saunders's review also highlighted the series' lack of originality and characterization, and derided the dialogue as \"portentous [and] self-consciously literary\". It also criticized the slow pace as \"glacial\". However, Saunders also acknowledged the series told an interesting and compelling story, writing that \"The OA may be utter hokum, but you'll still be hooked.\" Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter gave a negative review, stating that the series was \"a failed, but not wholly worthless, experiment in TV auteurism\". Fienberg added \"the problem, of course, is that telling you what The OA is vaguely like is just another tease and telling you what it actually is is a recipe for disappointment, because after an enticing and somewhat infuriating build-up, The OA becomes something quite ludicrous as it stumbles toward a climax that is, if I'm generous, merely unearned and if I'm not being generous, a series of offensive overreaches.\" Variety published diverging opinions about the series: its TV critic at the time, Sonia Saraiya, gave the show a mixed review that praised the direction and acting but opined that overall \"it is hard to take The OA seriously\", detailing that \"none of it makes any sense\", and concluded that \"[a]s an exercise in vision, The OA is exciting. As that other thing \u2014 a television show \u2014 it\u2019s an especially cryptic attempt to say very little of consequence.\". A few days later, on the other hand, the magazine's chief film critic Peter Debruge wrote an extremely positive column with the headline \"Why The OA is One of the Year's Most Important Films\", stating that the show's first season had \"the most effective ending [he had] ever seen in a TV series\", and that its \"final twist [...] left [him] crying uncontrollably for nearly half an hour\"."

The website's critical consensus reads, \"The OA second season provides satisfying answers to its predecessors' most maddening enigmas, all while maintaining the singular ambience that fans have come to crave.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Critics particularly praised its surrealism, directing and acting. Empire Magazine crowned The OA the best TV show of 2019 (so far) in September 2019. The Playlist stated in their review that: \"The OA: Part II packs each frame so dense with detail, that not one second of the new season's more-than-eight-hour runtime seems wasted, expositional, cheap, or unearned.\" Jesse Scheden of IGN gave The OA: Part II a score of 8.8 out of 10, saying the season is \"bigger, more ambitious and much weirder than its predecessor\". Rachel Syme in The New Republic praised the season, labeling the show as \"the best, most inaccessible show on television\", saying that \"[she wishes] more television was this unafraid to leave its audiences fumbling for understanding.\" Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"The only thing I'm sure of when it comes to The OA is that the process of watching and experiencing an episode is unlike the viewing of any other show on TV and, good or bad, there's value in that.\" Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club echoed that sentiment, saying \"sacrificing your expectations of plausibility feels like a worthwhile price of admission.\" Jen Chaney of New York Magazine called the season a mind-bender and praised the way it depicted the aftermath of a school shooting. Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph, gave it 4 out of 5 stars, and wrote that the show \"truly comes into its own when you stop attempting to piece together the storyline and instead submit to Marling and Batmanglij's vision.\" Emily VanDerWerff of Vox, initially critical of the first season, wrote of the series: \"over time, I kept thinking about it ... until I convinced myself that The OA is kind of genius, while simultaneously being incredibly silly\". Haleigh Foutch of Collider said, \"Netflix has carved out a space for itself as a home for innovative genre storytelling, and The OA might just be their crowning achievement in that regard.\""

Huicho begins to fill his mansion with flamboyant items of bad taste, and wastes his money shamelessly.  The arc of the storyline revolves around him finding a way to balance the seductive aura of his recent wealth - and the beautiful gold-diggers that appear in his life - with not losing the love of his life, his wife Rebeca (Laura Leon). Alongside them is Rosario (Sasha Sokol), a good and noble girl who was adopted by Rebeca and Huicho. She is humiliated and mistreated by Huicho and his two children; however, Rebecca is good and sweet towards her and considers her as her own daughter. Rosario has a boyfriend, (Rodrigo Vidal) Diego, who seems to be the ideal man who loves her too; however, he ends up becoming a villain when his boss, Jorge (Sergio Goyri), an unlucky journalist, falls for Rosario too. The new, rich Huicho begins using his money to attract women and have numerous affairs with the support of his oldest son, Luis Gerardo (Sergio Sendel), who has always been interested in Rosario and becomes another obstacle between her and Jorge, who has two siblings, Lorenzo (Marcelo Buquet) and Sergio (Claudio B\u00e1ez).  Lorenzo is noble and supports the relationship between Rosario and his brother, while Sergio is evil and jealous of Lorenzo.

        "content": "Due to the positive reception of Afterlife with Archie #6, which centered on Sabrina, a solo series starring her was announced in June 2014. The first issue was released in October 2014. The series went on a six-month hiatus before returning in April 2015 under the new Archie Horror imprint. Though the two series are described as \"companion series\" and share several characters, they are each set in their own reality and are not directly related to one another. In issue #8, Sabrina experiences a vision of the Afterlife with Archie versions of herself and Jughead Jones, suggesting some connection between the two continuities. The title is based on a 1972 anthology series, Chilling Adventures in Sorcery As Told By Sabrina, in which Sabrina narrated serious horror tales drawn in the Archie style. That book only lasted two issues, and was rebooted in 1973 by Archie's imprint Red Circle Comics as Chilling Adventures in Sorcery, minus Sabrina and the company's traditional cartooning style."

Unbeknownst to Sabrina, when she was just a year old, she was taken from her mother, Diana, by her aunts with the approval of her father, Edward. Sabrina was told that her mother died; she hasn't seen her father since she was young. While Sabrina is taught witchery by her aunts at home, she lives a relatively normal life in public as a cheerleader and student at Baxter High School. No one, including her boyfriend Harvey, is aware that she is a witch. Hilda Spellman, Sabrina's witch aunt and co-guardian. She is more forbearing than Zelda, though both are strict followers of witch law and the Church of Night. Zelda Spellman, Sabrina's other witch aunt and co-guardian. She is more pragmatic than Hilda, though they both ultimately want the best for their niece, despite keeping the truth about her parents a secret. Madam Satan, formerly known as Iola, Edward's witch girlfriend whom he left for Diana. Heartbroken that he chose a mortal over her, Iola killed herself and wound up in the pits of Gehenna, a place reserved in the circle of Hell for suicides, where she remained faceless until she was accidentally released by two amateur witches. After gaining a new face, she burns the tree that encased Edward and cures Diana of the insanity he inflicted upon her, but leaves her unable to leave the psychiatric facility. Upon discovering their daughter's existence, she makes her way to Greendale where she becomes a teacher at Baxter High as \"Evangeline Porter\" where she can monitor Sabrina and continue her revenge against the Spellman family. Ambrose, Sabrina's bisexual warlock cousin who comes to live with her and her aunts from the Old Country. As punishment by the Witches Council for revealing himself to mortals, he cannot leave the Spellman house. He has two cobra familiars, Nag and Nagaina. Harvey Kinkle, a football player and fellow student at Baxter High School. He is Sabrina's boyfriend but is unaware that she and her aunts are witches. After being set up by Madam Satan, he discovers their true nature and is killed by the other witches. Edward is later resurrected in Harvey's body, though Sabrina only believes it to be Harvey. Salem, Sabrina's familiar who often acts as the voice of reason. Originally a human named Samuel, he was turned into a cat as punishment by the witches of Salem Village for impregnating a witch named Abigail (unaware that she was a witch) and refusing to marry her. At some point as a cat, he attempted to enact the Book of Revelation. He was given to Sabrina by her aunts and was prophesied by the Devil himself that if he were to do his duty and protect her, then he may become human again. Edward Spellman, Sabrina's estranged warlock father and the younger brother of Hilda and Zelda. He quickly rose through the ranks in the Church of Night as a skilled conjuror and eventually became a High Priest. He broke witch-law to marry Diana Sawyer, a mortal, whom he hoped would bear him an heir. When Hilda and Zelda discovered that Edward had been lying to the congregation, they trapped him in a tree as punishment. His ex-lover Madam Satan would go on to vengefully burn the tree, but would also aid in his resurrection into Harvey's body. With Sabrina believing that she brought back Harvey, Edward wonders who could\u2019ve helped her with such strong magic, and why. He vaguely remembers \"Iola\" from his past."

Her husband, Edward, turned her insane after she refused to give up her daughter to his sisters. Madam Satan eventually grants Diana her sanity, but makes sure that she'll never be able to convince the doctors to let her leave. Diana is briefly able to contact Sabrina through a dream, but is stopped and Sabrina soon forgets the encounter. Rosalind, also called \"Roz\" and \"Rossy\" on occasion, a student at Baxter High School who competes with Sabrina for everything from boys to roles in the school play to popularity. Since Rosalind is usually the one losing out, she frequently gossips maliciously about Sabrina to other students. Diana warns Sabrina about Rosalind in a dream, saying that she\u2019s not as she seems, but Sabrina forgets by the next morning. Nag and Nagaina, Ambrose's cobra familiars who were originally humans (a prince and a princess) that were tricked by a sorcerer into trying to murder their father's bride-to-be and were consequently turned into snakes. Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge, young witches from High Priestess Grundy's coven in Riverdale who were trying to summon a succubus to help them settle a blood-rivalry but instead summoned Madam Satan. Later, they visit Greendale with others from Riverdale High and participate in the search for Harvey. While there, Madam Satan recruits them for a resurrection spell. Satan, also known as Lucifer and the Devil, the worshipped figure of the Church of Night. He appears during Sabrina's baptism as a giant humanoid goat. When he appeared to Salem back in 1692, he also displayed a human head. The series also alludes to and features fictionalized versions of numerous real-world figures, namely Rudyard Kipling, Ann-Margret, Aleister Crowley, Giles Corey, John, Benjamin, William, and Elizabeth Proctor, Abigail Williams, Reverend Parris, Mercy Lewis, Sorcar, and Alphonse Louis Constant.

River, who is unfamiliar with his new set of regenerations, fails to recognize the Doctor as she takes him aside and tells him to decapitate Hydroflax so she can claim the Halassi Androvar, the most valuable diamond in the universe, which has become lodged in the king\u2019s brain. However, they are interrupted by Hydroflax, who overhears them. Being a cyborg, he detaches his head from his mechanical body and orders it to kill them. While River defends herself, the Doctor grabs Hydroflax's head and threatens to put him in the garbage disposal, creating a stalemate and allowing Ramone, River's actual husband, to teleport her, the Doctor, and Hydroflax\u2019s head outside. Believing Nardole to have information about River, Hydroflax\u2019s body decapitates him to use his head as its own. River and Ramone track down the TARDIS and attempt to take off with the Doctor, but the ship's safeguards prevent it from taking off when it detects that Hydroflax\u2019s head and body, although separated, are still linked to one another. Left behind, Hydroflax\u2019s body tricks and uploads Ramone before following a homing beacon emitted by his head. Using Ramone, it forces its way inside, causing the TARDIS to travel to the starship Harmony and Redemption, where River requests that the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, Flemming, deadlock seal the baggage hold where the TARDIS landed to prevent Hydroflax\u2019s body from pursuing them further. Rather than return the diamond to the Halassi, River reveals that she intends to sell the diamond to a buyer named Scratch, who has secretly filled the meeting point with members of his own species. After receiving payment, River and the Doctor discover that Scratch and his compatriots worship Hydroflax and are after the diamond in his honour. Despite attempts to hide the bagged head containing the diamond, Flemming stops them from escaping, who was tricked into entering the baggage area by an under-duress Ramone but promises the Doctor's head to Hydroflax's body using River as bait. Sensing that Hydroflax's head will die imminently, his body destroys it, leaving only the diamond. Flemming interrogates River for the Doctor's whereabouts, but she explains that although she loves the Doctor, he does not reciprocate before realizing the Doctor was with her all along. Being a time traveler, River knows the ship is about to be crippled by a meteor strike, which she uses as their escape plan, taking the diamond in the process. The Doctor uses Scratch\u2019s universal bank transfer device to overload Hydroflax\u2019s body before heading to the ship\u2019s bridge. As the ship is crashing, River discovers that they are heading towards the planet Darillium, which the Doctor remembers is where she spends her last night with him before her death. Realizing that they cannot save the ship, River and the Doctor flee into the TARDIS, but the impact knocks her unconscious. Having avoided taking River to Darillium for as long as possible, the Doctor decides to give in to the inevitable. After traveling to the next morning, the Doctor suggests to a man searching for survivors that he build a restaurant with a view of Darillium's Singing Towers, and gives him the diamond to fund its construction. Traveling forward in time once again, the Doctor books a table on the balcony for Christmas Day in four years\u2019 time. When River awakens and exits the TARDIS into the restaurant, she is told that the Doctor is waiting for her. She encounters Hydroflax\u2019s body, since salvaged and now peacefully controlled by Ramone and Nardole's heads, working as a waiter in the restaurant. The Doctor gives River a sonic screwdriver, the same one she has in \"Forest of the Dead\". As the pair admire the Singing Towers, River asks whether this really is their last night together. The Doctor insists that there is no way to avoid the end of their times together and refuses to tell River the future, though he reveals one night on Darillium lasts for twenty-four years."

River doesn't recognise the Twelfth Doctor as the Doctor because \"he has limits\", referring to the Time Lords' twelve-regenerations limit first mentioned in The Deadly Assassin (1976). As he reads River's diary, Flemming relates many of her adventures with the Doctor: the opening of the Pandorica (\"The Pandorica Opens\"), the crash of the Byzantium (first mentioned in \"Silence in the Library\" and shown in \"Flesh and Stone\"), a picnic at Asgard (\"Silence in the Library\"), an encounter with Jim the Fish (\"The Impossible Astronaut\"), and her most recent trip \u2013 to a place called \"Manhattan\" (\"The Angels Take Manhattan\"). The Doctor tells River that \"every Christmas is last Christmas\", repeating what a dream-image Danny Pink tells Clara Oswald in \"Last Christmas\" (2014). When the Doctor argues about River's \"marriages\", River recounts some of the Doctor's own: Elizabeth I (first mentioned in \"The End of Time\" and depicted in \"The Day of the Doctor\"), Marilyn Monroe (\"A Christmas Carol\"), and Cleopatra (mentioned in \"The Wedding of River Song\"). Details of the Doctor's last encounter with River at the singing towers of Darillium, originally mentioned in \"Forest of the Dead\" (2008), are shown here. The Doctor says that he has just had a haircut and is wearing his best suit (\"You turned up on my doorstep, with a new haircut and a suit\"). As the towers sing, the Doctor sheds a tear (\"The towers sang and you cried\"), and he refuses to tell her that this is their final night together before her death (\"You wouldn't tell me why, but I suppose you knew it was time. My time.\") River mentions that the Doctor had postponed it several times, one of which was shown in the mini-episode \"Last Night\". The Doctor uses both of River's catchphrases \u2013 \"Hello, Sweetie\" and \"Spoilers\". River's last line to the Doctor is \"I hate you\", to which the Doctor replies \"No, you don't\". This is banter River and the Eleventh Doctor often used, such as in \"The Impossible Astronaut\". River is also shown as possessing a red fez, a favourite headpiece of the Eleventh Doctor."

Clara finds herself in a dream version of her flat, able to control Bonnie's actions to a small degree due to a telepathic connection between them, giving the Twelfth Doctor and UNIT scientist Osgood time to parachute out of their plane before Bonnie shoots it down. The Doctor and Osgood land on a beach. Controlling Bonnie's hand, Clara sends a message to the Doctor's phone saying \"I'm awake.\" The Doctor video calls Bonnie. From winks Bonnie exhibits, the Doctor recognises that Clara is telling him her pod is in London. In interrogating Clara via their telepathic connection, Bonnie learns the Osgood Box is in the UNIT Black Archive under the Tower of London. Against the wishes of the Zygons who are not aligned with the splinter group, Bonnie intends to start a war against humanity by using the Osgood Box to unmask 20 million Zygons on Earth. UNIT leader Kate Stewart, having survived the encounter with the Zygon in New Mexico, reconvenes with the Doctor and Osgood in London. Bonnie discovers that there are two identical Osgood Boxes in the Archive, only differing by colour. By the time the Doctor, Osgood, and Kate arrive, Bonnie has found that either box's button reveals a second set of two buttons within. When Bonnie prepares to press a button on the blue box, which would either unmask the Zygons or make their human forms permanent, Kate prepares to do the same on the red box, which would destroy either every Zygon or everyone in London. The Doctor tries to talk both of them out of this action \u2013 the Osgood Boxes have been a means to assure peace because of the consequences of declaring a war. Eventually, after the Doctor admits the consequences he had to live with since the Time War, both Bonnie and Kate back off with the former realising the boxes are empty and were only a ploy to avoid a disaster. The Doctor wipes Kate's memories to keep the peace treaty. Bonnie calls off the splinter group and says they will live peacefully. Later, the Doctor offers Osgood a chance to ride in the TARDIS, but she refuses and instead reveals her new duplicate \u2013 Bonnie, who has taken a new form after giving up Clara."

The Doctor also refers to Sullivan as \"the imbecile\", a reference to the Fourth Doctor serial Revenge of the Cybermen, where the Doctor shouted \"Harry Sullivan is an imbecile!\" after Sullivan triggered a rockslide and then tried to remove a Cyberbomb from the Doctor without deactivating the booby trap. UNIT's Black Archive, first seen in \"The Day of the Doctor\" (2013) and containing items from several past episodes, currently has a Mire battle helmet first seen in \"The Girl Who Died\" (2015). The Doctor claims that he himself planned to use a box with a button to commit mass murder. This is a reference to \"The Day of the Doctor\" when three of the Doctor's past incarnations planned to use the Moment, a Time Lord doomsday device, to end the Time War. Osgood says that there has been more than one meaning for the acronym TARDIS. The 'D' in TARDIS has been given as both \"dimension\" and \"dimensions\" during both the classic series and the revival, giving the name TARDIS two different meanings. In \"The Next Doctor\" (2008), Jackson Lake says his 'TARDIS'\u2014in reality, a hot air balloon\u2014stands for \u201cTethered Aerial Release Developed In Style\u201d.

She further praised Coleman's performance by saying that the episode \"could very well be Jenna Coleman's goodbye present\". Mark Rozeman of Paste Magazine awarded the episode a score of 8.8 out of ten, praising Clara and Bonnie's sequences as \"brilliantly conceived\". He also praised Capaldi's performance, stating \"it\u2019s a firm reminder of how lucky we are that an actor of Peter Capaldi\u2019s caliber has taken the titular role and so thoroughly made it his own\". Writing for The Guardian, Dan Martin also heavily praised the episode, specifically the Doctor's anti-war speech in the episode's conclusion. He stated \"This Doctor has never been written better, Capaldi has never channelled Tom Baker more, that sequence is cemented instantly as the 'Capaldi moment' in clip shows for the rest of time\", and while he said that \"It was a risky game to attempt the sort of contemporary allegory\" that the episode did, he soon confirmed that the episode \"knocked [it] out of the park\". Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club also acclaimed the episode, awarding it a perfect \"A\" grade \u2013 the third of the season. He began his review by saying \"The climax of 'The Zygon Inversion' makes explicit something that the best anti-war Doctor Who stories have always understood. Depicting the madness of war doesn\u2019t require an epic scale. If anything, narrowing the focus to a single conflict or moral dilemma clarifies the essential futility of violent conflict\". He then closed his review by claiming \"The simplicity of [the] setup allows this two-parter to be one of the show's strongest ever statements against war, not because the Doctor is challenging us from on high to live up to his standard, but rather because he wants no one else to know his pain\". Den of Geek praised \u2033The Zygon Inversion\u2033 as the best episode of the current series, and named it, \u2033one of the best pieces of screen entertainment of the year, full stop.\u2033 The episode aired a week after the crash of Metrojet Flight 9268 in Egypt, and resulted in 31 complaints to the Office of Communications (Ofcom) because of the scene depicting a plane being shot down. Viewers argued that the scene was inappropriate in the aftermath of the crash, but Ofcom decided not to launch an investigation. The regulator concluded that \"the science fiction nature of Doctor Who and the storyline created a sufficient distinction from recent events\"."

Will Stewart provided additional writing for the film. It stars Sharlto Copley, Danila Kozlovsky, Haley Bennett, and Tim Roth. The film was released theatrically in the United States by STXfilms on April 8, 2016. It received mixed reviews from the US but gained a more positive reception in Russia. Despite grossing $16.8 million worldwide against a $2 million budget, it was considered a box-office bomb in the US, due to STX spending $10 million to acquire global rights to the film."

A scientist, Estelle, tells him his name is Henry, she is his wife, and that he has been revived from an accident that left him amnesiac and mute. She replaces his missing limbs with cybernetic prostheses, but mercenaries led by the psychokinetic Akan raid the ship before she can replace Henry's voice. Akan claims all of Estelle's research is his corporate property. He kills Estelle's scientists, but Henry and Estelle flee in an escape pod, landing in Moscow. The mercenaries follow and abduct Estelle. Henry is rescued by a stranger named Jimmy, who informs him that his cybernetic limbs are running out of power, which will kill him if he cannot recharge. Jimmy is killed by corrupt police paid by Akan, but Henry escapes. He is joined by Jimmy\u2014somehow not dead, now an alcoholic bum\u2014who informs him that one of Akan's associates, Slick Dimitry, has a charging pump which Henry needs to recharge. The two are attacked, and again Jimmy is killed. Henry escapes, and hunts Dimitry through Moscow before capturing him. Just as Dimitry promises him information, he is killed by a sniper. Henry removes the pump and receives a call from Jimmy, who directs Henry to a brothel. Henry meets two more distinct versions of Jimmy who replace his pump. The brothel is attacked by Akan's forces. Akan taunts Henry about Estelle, who is being transported by an armored convoy, before ejecting Henry from the brothel. Outside, Henry encounters another Jimmy, who transports him to Akan's convoy. Henry finds Estelle\u2014and Akan, who kills him and buries him in the woods. Jimmy finds and resuscitates Henry, only to be shelled by a tank. After killing the tank crew and fending off a helicopter, Henry finds another Jimmy, who leads him to an abandoned hotel, where Jimmy is headquartered in a hidden laboratory. Here, the original Jimmy\u2014a quadriplegic scientist\u2014reveals that he is seeking revenge against Akan, who crippled him after his own cyborg super-soldiers failed. The other Jimmys are clones that he can control. Jimmy realizes that Henry has been unknowingly broadcasting his location to Akan, with a strike force closing in, and the clones attack Henry. Fending off Jimmy, Henry convinces him to help. Henry and the clones fight their way out, killing Akan's forces by collapsing the laboratory on them. Jimmy and Henry drive to Akan's headquarters. They fight their way into an elevator, but Jimmy is mortally wounded. Before dying, Jimmy thanks Henry for being a friend, and removes a memory blocker, gradually restoring Henry's memories. Henry fights his way to the highest floor, where he is greeted by Akan and an army of cyborg super-soldiers with Henry's memories. The soldiers chase Henry to the roof. Henry wipes out the entire army. Akan arrives and severely wounds Henry. Shortly after, Estelle arrives as well. It is revealed that Estelle was actually Akan's wife. Everything that happened was an elaborate ruse to field-test their ability to manipulate cyborg soldiers into doing anything to \"rescue\" their \"wife\". Akan and Estelle leave in helicopters, leaving Henry for dead. Henry blacks out, but a memory of his father revives him. Henry reaches Akan and decapitates him. He jumps onto Estelle's helicopter, presenting her Akan's head. Estelle attacks Henry, causing her to stumble out of the helicopter. Henry slams the door, sending her falling to her death."

Between the electronics and the magnet stabilization systems, Naishuller chose the magnets, as he felt that it resembled natural head movement. The recordings from the GoPro cameras were edited to cut the hundreds of shots together into one continuous film. Blender, open-source software, was used for providing most of the visual effects for the film. While it was not the first feature film to exclusively use first-person point of view, the concept for the film came from the \"Bad Motherfucker\" and \"The Stampede\" music videos, which Naishuller made with Valyaev for his band, Biting Elbows. These were also shot with a GoPro from the first-person perspective. The movie was partially funded with Indiegogo."

Daniel Fienberg  of The Hollywood Reporter wrote in his review of the first part of the miniseries: \"In a film festival environment, in which stories of otherness and barrier-breaking are part of the expected tapestry, When We Rise might play as a bit quaint, muted and smoothed out for mainstream audiences, which it very clearly is. But even in 2017, when we like to think that boundaries have been pushed a fair amount and that the voices being heard are as diverse as ever, When We Rise feels like a rather astounding thing to find on network TV.\" James Poniewozik of The New York Times wrote in his review: \"When We Rise, ABC's sweeping four-night history of the gay rights movement, is a rebuttal. As a television drama, it often plays like a high-minded, dutiful educational video. But at its best moments, it's also a timely statement that identity is not just an abstraction but a matter of family, livelihood, life and death.\" Greg Braxton of the Los Angeles Times wrote in his review: \"It could've been a scene from any of the recent protests that have arisen in the stormy first weeks of the Donald Trump presidency. But peering closer\u2014at the '70s garb, the cameras recording the scene\u2014reveals that this was a re-creation of another, similarly tumultuous, time. [...] The writer-director is still optimistic that When We Rise will appeal to a mainstream audience\u2014including Trump supporters\u2014because of its focus on family, emotion and perseverance.\" Danette Chavez of The A.V. Club wrote in her review: \"When We Rise isn't laboring in another production's shadow, though; instead, it tries very hard to bring all of those moments and history makers to light. This is obviously a huge undertaking, one that traces the converging paths of gay activists who thwarted Prop 6, were later devastated by the rise of AIDS, but then rallied back to win marriage equality in 2015. Those battles weren't all fought by the exact same people, which pushes the scope of the miniseries even further. But a central trio of characters anchors the story, which runs through four decades (1971 to 2015, roughly).\" When We Rise received a nomination for Best Miniseries at the 2018 Satellite Awards and won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV Movie or Limited Series at the 29th GLAAD Media Awards."

Taking Grant to the rooftop, the Doctor (whom Grant calls \"Doctor Mysterio\") reveals he accidentally set off a trap for a device he was building, and he enlists Grant to help complete it. However, Grant mistakenly swallows a wish-granting gemstone needed for the device, believing it to be medicine for a cold he has, effectively being granted his wish to be a superhero. Abandoning the device, the Doctor makes Grant promise to not use his new superpowers before he leaves. The Doctor returns to New York in 2016 with Nardole, whom he removed from Hydroflax's body and rebuilt, to investigate Harmony Shoals, a multinational research company. They encounter a news reporter, Lucy Fletcher, who is conducting a similar investigation. The group discovers that it is being secretly run by a group of living alien brains that transplant themselves into any living creature they need for their plans. They witness the killing of the company's owner, Mr Brock, for his body. Tracked down by Dr Sim, an employee the brains already took over, the group is suddenly rescued by a masked superhero named the Ghost, who afterwards transports Lucy close to her home. Returning to her apartment before her, the Ghost transforms back into Grant, who works for Lucy as a nanny. He is shocked to find the Doctor and Nardole waiting for him, having tracked him down via the gemstone fused inside his body. When Lucy returns and interrogates the Time Lord by squeezing a stress toy she calls \"Mr. Huffle\", the Doctor reveals to her that the alien brains colonise planets by taking control of their prominent leaders, with Earth being their next target. Leaving Lucy to prepare for an interview with Grant's alter ego, the Doctor and Nardole track down the alien's ship in a low orbit and board it via the TARDIS. There, they discover that the ship's reactor is in a critical state and realise from Dr Sim that he intends to drop it on New York. Remembering an observation made by Nardole, the Doctor realises the city would be vaporised except for the Harmony Shoals building. World leaders would then take shelter in the company's other buildings within each capital city, believing Earth was under attack, effectively allowing the brains to take them over. After Dr Sim lets slip the ship is to be dropped at a designated time, the Doctor forces its descent ahead of schedule. Ghost and Lucy are captured by the brains during the interview. They plan to transplant themselves into Ghost's body. Ghost flees to deprive the brains of their prize, then returns as Grant to protect Lucy. Unable to change the ship's course during its descent, the Doctor sends Grant a message requesting his help. Grant manages to stop the alien's ship from crashing into the city, but reveals himself as the Ghost to Lucy in the process. Lucy is won over and Grant takes her in tow as he disposes of the ship. The Doctor alerts UNIT, which shuts down Harmony Shoals, unaware that the alien brain in Dr Sims has escaped within one of their soldiers. Back at Lucy's apartment, Grant informs the Doctor he will no longer use his powers and retire his costumed identity. As the Time Lord leaves, Lucy asks him why he is sad. The Doctor gives only a vague answer before departing. Nardole privately reveals that the Doctor is mourning the loss of River Song, but will ultimately recover. He leaves with the Doctor to assist him further."

The Doctor mentions that he usually gets \"an invasion\" every Christmas, a reference to the different invasions of Earth taking place during most Doctor Who Christmas specials. The unnamed brain-swapping aliens last appeared in the 2015 Christmas special \"The Husbands of River Song\", where they were servants of King Hydroflax. Their main agent, Scratch, stated that they represented \"the Shoal of the Winter Harmony.\" The Doctor tells Lucy that he works for Scotland Yard, which he also did in \"The Woman Who Lived\" (2015). Previously, the Tenth Doctor told the guests at Lady Eddison's manor he was a chief inspector from Scotland Yard in \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\" (2008), while the Eleventh Doctor told President Richard Nixon he was an undercover operative from Scotland Yard (code-named \"The Doctor\") in \"The Impossible Astronaut\" (2011). A cinema near Lucy's apartment features a film called The Mind of Evil, the name of a Third Doctor serial. Nardole mentions that the Doctor cut him out of Hydroflax's body, referring to off-screen events following \"The Husbands of River Song\" where he was decapitated and his head was placed inside the artificially intelligent robotic body of King Hydroflax. When the Doctor complains that Grant promised him never to use his powers, Nardole brings up the Time Lord policy of never interfering with other peoples or cultures, first mentioned in the Second Doctor serial The War Games (1969). When clearing out the headquarters of Harmony Shoal, a UNIT officer prepares to contact Osgood, referring to Petronella Osgood who previously appeared in \"The Day of the Doctor\" (2013), \"Death in Heaven\" (2014) and \"The Zygon Invasion\" / \"The Zygon Inversion\" (2015). Both the Doctor and Nardole refer to the final 24-year night the Doctor spent with River Song (\"The Husbands of River Song\") and her eventual death in the Library (\"Forest of the Dead\")."

Grant has roughly the same standard powers of Superman, including flight, super-strength, super-speed, being bulletproof, and possessing X-ray vision, along with other unconventional powers. He gains his abilities from a stellar-powered object (a gemstone made from a star, in the episode), much as Superman gains his from Earth's yellow sun. The Harmony Shoals building in New York featured in the episode has a large globe on top of it, making it resemble the Daily Planet building, a major setting of Superman stories. Grant prefers being called \"mild-mannered\", as Superman's alter ego is often characterized. He also follows the same moral code as Superman when operating as the Ghost, and transforms in a similar fashion by tearing open his shirt to reveal his superhero costume underneath. The special features a number of elements that mimic those from Richard Donner's Superman: The Movie. One scene involves the Ghost voicing his hope that Lucy's close call at Harmony Shoal hasn't put her off journalism, paralleling the same scene in the film in which Superman hopes Lois is not put off from flying after he rescues her from falling out of a helicopter. Lucy also conducts a rooftop interview with the Ghost reminiscent of Lois' interview with Superman in the film. Lucy Fletcher is named after Lois Lane's sister Lucy. Her character is similar to Lois' in that she does not realize that her old high school friend and current nanny is the superhero Ghost. The initials \"L.L.\" used by several characters of the Superman comics (including Lois Lane, Lana Lang, Lex Luthor, Linda Lee, Lori Lemaris, Letitia Lerner, Lena Luthor and Lyla Lerrol) is used in Lucy's married name: Lucy Lombard. Several characters from Marvel Comics decorate the walls of young Grant's bedroom. The Doctor questions Spider-Man's unusual origin of being bitten by a radioactive spider; he opines that radiation poisoning would be the likely result. A \"Joe's Pizza\" is shown within the city, which is where Peter Parker worked briefly in the movie Spider-Man 2. The Doctor counsels Grant that \"with great power comes great responsibility,\" an adage associated with Spider-Man. Batman is briefly referenced after the Ghost drops Lucy off at her apartment building. When the baby monitor he is carrying goes off, Lucy mistakes it for a signal device and asks if the Bat-Signal is now an app. The Doctor uses the augmented reality game app Pok\u00e9mon Go to create a distraction at Harmony Shoal's Tokyo headquarters."

However, he shoots all the students and kills himself; Celeste is later seen to be in one of only three ambulances carrying survivors from the scene.

Soon after, at an event held in memory of the shooting victims, Celeste sings a song that she and Ellie wrote called \"Wrapped Up\". The song becomes an instant hit and Celeste is soon picked up by a manager. Over the next 20 months, Celeste manages and navigates the increasing pressures of her newfound fame in spite of her past trauma. She and Ellie indulge in bouts of partying that soon get in the way of Celeste's work, including the underage Celeste having a one-night stand with an older musician and Ellie having sex with Celeste's manager the night before the September 11 attacks. However, we see that Celeste continues to successfully rise in the music industry, with her songs getting quickly picked up by the radio and rushing the demand for her first music video, \"Hologram (Smoke and Mirrors)\"."

Her manager informs her of the terrorist shooting, and then tells her to prepare for the ensuing press junkets. Before her first interview, Celeste takes her teenage daughter, Albertine (conceived from the encounter with the musician), to lunch. Once there, Celeste unveils her erratic and destructive behavior, aided by alcohol, resulting in Celeste and Albertine getting kicked out of the restaurant by the manager. It is revealed here that 6 years prior, Celeste permanently blinded herself in her left eye due to consuming excessive amounts of methanol while binge-drinking household cleaning products. Celeste then drove under the influence across three state lines, injuring a man in his left leg and pelvis in the process, which resulted in a public lawsuit. After lunch, Celeste has a heated argument with Ellie after finding out Albertine has recently lost her virginity; Ellie has been Albertine's guardian since her birth. The press interviews begin soon after, with Celeste becoming increasingly unhinged after one interviewer mentions the aforementioned driving incident. Her publicist decides to cancel the rest of the interviews scheduled that day and asks Celeste to rest before the concert. However, Celeste and her manager get high on drugs and have sex. That evening, an impaired Celeste heads for the concert venue with her entourage in tow. She then experiences a mental breakdown, with Ellie successfully comforting her before sending her out."

The Master and Missy capture the Doctor, but he had earlier surreptitiously reprogrammed the Cybernet to target Time Lords as well, forcing them to flee. Nardole arrives in a commandeered shuttlecraft to rescue them. The Doctor is electrocuted by a Cyberman, but is saved by Bill. They evacuate to a higher level of the ship containing a solar farm populated by children and a few adults fighting off early Cybermen prototypes. The Doctor recovers, but suppresses the early signs of regeneration. Bill initially remains unaware of her transformation, her strong mind acting like a perception filter, until one of the children inadvertently reveals the truth to her. Bill sheds a tear, which the Doctor calls a hopeful sign. Missy and the Master discover a camouflaged lift, a possible escape route. But when they call for it, an upgraded Cyberman arrives, which the group destroys. The Doctor warns that the time dilation affords the Cybermen more time to evolve and strategize. Nardole discovers the floor directly below the solar farm contains fuel pipes. He is able to trigger controlled explosions, which are used to exaggerate the humans' defensive strength and defeat the Cybermen's initial attack. Knowing this ploy only delays their inevitable defeat, the Doctor instructs Nardole to lead the human community to a solar farm on another floor and remain there to safeguard them. Bill stays to fight with the Doctor. Despite the Doctor's impassioned plea, Missy and the Master abandon them, intending to take the lift to the lowest level and escape in the Master's TARDIS. Missy, however, changes her mind and stabs the Master, which will trigger his next regeneration. He retaliates by shooting her in the back with his laser screwdriver, telling her she will not regenerate. Both laugh over the irony of their mutual betrayal before the Master departs. An army of Cybermen arrive, but are warded off by the Doctor until he falls after being shot. Surrounded, the Doctor ignites all the fuel pipes, engulfing the farm in a fireball and destroying or disabling the Cybermen. The Doctor lies still as Bill kneels beside him. She suddenly finds herself outside of her Cyberman body in her human form. Heather (\"The Pilot\") appears, having found Bill through her tears. She saves Bill by transforming her into an entity like herself. They leave the Doctor inside his TARDIS, and Heather invites Bill to explore the universe with her. Bill sheds tears for the Doctor before leaving with Heather. The TARDIS arrives in a snowy landscape and the Doctor awakens, briefly dazed and confused. Refusing to keep continually changing, he emerges and seemingly stops his regeneration. Within, the cloister bell sounds an alarm as the Doctor encounters his original incarnation."

Alasdair Wilkins from The A.V. Club called the episode a \"perfect finale\", explaining that the Twelfth Doctor is a Doctor who knows who he is, portrayed by an actor who knows exactly how he wants to play the part of the character, both of which are played into the narrative of the story and blending into the storyline of the Doctor refusing to regenerate. He complimented how the multiple storylines of the series were wrapped up and brought to a satisfying conclusion, as well as respecting the reality of the character's emotions, which were performed with only a couple of small missteps. Scott Collura of IGN also praised the dynamic between the two Masters, describing the relationship as a mixture of a \"brother-sister and boyfriend-girlfriend\" relationship and its resultant complexities, and how the intentions of the previous incarnation Master was to draw Missy back into the traditional evil manner of the character. He stated that the story made enough sense that \"Moffat doesn't really even need to write it on the page\". He complimented the appearance of David Bradley as the First Doctor, but stated that extending the storyline of the regeneration out over the two episodes of the finale, as well as the Christmas special, was a great concept but did not work in the context of the episode. Giving the episode a perfect score, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times singled out the performances as one of the strong points about the episode, saying that Capaldi, Simm and Gomez worked perfectly well together within the episode. He stated that Capaldi was as magnificent as he had been through the series, and that \"The Doctor Falls\" was an episode dedicated to him, and how he \"stands tall\" among the competition of Simm's and Gomez's acting. He stated that Simm's Master was not the \"loon\" that was portrayed seven years ago, but complimented him nonetheless, and that Gomez's portrayal of Missy and the character's soul-searching was \"simply superb\". Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror also gave the episode a perfect score, and felt the episode was an immensely satisfying conclusion with great storytelling and epic performances, stating that with all the teasers, build up and trailers that had been released in preparation for the episode, \"The Doctor Falls\" could have resulted in becoming a failure of a series finale, but he complimented how well it turned out. He stated that the episode was an \"immensely satisfying, packed, heart string tugging\" conclusion to the series, that was the result of \"clever storytelling and tremendous acting\". He stated that Capaldi and his performance in the episode \"simply shines\", and that the Twelfth Doctor had never had a better episode through his era.

In his Netflix special Bare (2014), Jefferies performed a routine on gun control, which was previously used in his stand-up and on Legit. The Bare routine has gone viral, especially after mass shootings in the United States. Jefferies revisited the topic in his Netflix special Freedumb (2016), in which he also criticized then-Republican candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Jefferies has since become a commentator, often speaking to newspapers and appearing on television programs to discuss his political opinions. In late 2016, Comedy Central ordered a pilot for the show, which was taped on December 7. The network picked up the show as a weekly half-hour series in March 2017, with ten episodes set to air in the summer. Actor Brad Pitt became a fan of Jefferies after seeing clips of his standup, and called him to ask if he could be part of his new show. He was enthusiastic when Jefferies suggested he be the show's weatherman.

The results are hit and miss, and sometimes it\u2019s a long while between hits.\" However, Hale also praised Jefferies for occasionally delivering \"explosive\" lines in the show. The first season ended with Jefferies listed in Variety's \"Fresh Voices in TV Who Broke Out in 2017\" and the writing team nominated for Best Comedy/Variety Talk Series at the 2018 Writers Guild of America Awards."

        "content": "Wonder Woman 1984 (also known as WW84) is a 2020 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character Wonder Woman. Produced by Atlas Entertainment and The Stone Quarry, and distributed by Warner Bros., it is the sequel to 2017's Wonder Woman and the ninth film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Directed by Patty Jenkins and written by Jenkins, Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham from a story by Johns and Jenkins, it stars Gal Gadot as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, alongside Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig, Pedro Pascal, Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen. Set in 1984 during the Cold War, the film follows Diana and her past love Steve Trevor as they face off against Maxwell Lord and Cheetah. Discussion of a sequel began shortly after the release of the first film in June 2017 and the decision to proceed was confirmed the following month. Principal photography began on June 13, 2018, with filming taking place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in England, as well as the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia in the U.S., London and Duxford in England, Tenerife and Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands and Almer\u00eda in Andalusia, Spain. Production wrapped on December 22, 2018, after a six-month shoot, with additional filming in July 2019. Wonder Woman 1984 was originally scheduled for a wide theatrical release on June 5, 2020, but was delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film premiered on December 15, 2020, via the DC FanDome virtual platform, and was released by Warner Bros. on December 25, 2020, both theatrically and via the HBO Max streaming service. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its depiction of the 1980s, escapist qualities, and Jenkins's direction but criticized the plot and screenplay. The film grossed $166 million worldwide against a production budget of $200 million, failing to break even due to limited theaters during the COVID-19 pandemic but became the most-watched straight-to-streaming film of 2020. Two follow-ups are in development: a sequel with Jenkins and Gadot returning and a spin-off produced by Jenkins focusing on the Amazons of Themyscira."

        "content": "As a young child, Diana participates in an athletic competition on Themyscira against adult Amazons. After being knocked off her horse while looking back at her opponents, Diana takes a shortcut and remounts, but misses a checkpoint. Antiope removes her from the race for cheating, explaining anything worthwhile must be obtained honestly, while her mother Hippolyta advises her to be patient in her pursuit of glory and honor. In 1984, Diana is working at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., while secretly performing heroic deeds as Wonder Woman. New museum employee Barbara Ann Minerva, a shy geologist and cryptozoologist, has trouble getting noticed by her co-workers, but quickly finds a friend in Diana. After the FBI asks the museum to identify stolen antiquities from a robbery that Wonder Woman recently foiled, Barbara and Diana notice one of the artifacts, later identified as the Dreamstone, has a Latin inscription claiming to grant the holder one wish. Neither openly takes the inscription seriously, but Barbara wishes to become like Diana and unintentionally acquires the same superpowers, while Diana yearns for her deceased lover Steve Trevor. He is resurrected in another man's body; the two are reunited at a Smithsonian gala. Failing businessman Maxwell \"Max Lord\" Lorenzano steals the Dreamstone, hoping to use its power to save his nearly bankrupt oil company. His wish is to \"become\" the stone and gain its wish-granting powers; whenever he grants someone else's desire, he is able to take what he wants from the wisher, resulting in worldwide chaos, destruction and instability. Diana discovers that the Dreamstone was created by Dolos/Mendacius, The God of Lies, also known as the Duke of Deception. It grants a user's wish, but exacts an equally strong toll unless they renounce the wish or destroy the stone. Although Diana's powers and Barbara's humanity begin to diminish, neither is willing to renounce their wish. Max visits the U.S President at the White House, who wishes for more nuclear missiles to cow the Soviets, which brings the world to the brink of nuclear war. Max also learns of a new and secret satellite system that can broadcast to anyone in the world; since his powers are causing his body to deteriorate, he plans to grant wishes globally to steal strength and life force from the viewers and regain his health. Diana and Steve confront him, but Barbara betrays Diana and knocks her down, escaping with Max on Marine One. Steve convinces Diana to renounce her wish and let him go, restoring her to full strength. Donning the armor of Asteria, greatest of all Amazon warriors, Diana flies to the satellite headquarters and again battles Barbara, who has transformed into a humanoid cheetah after wishing to become an apex predator. After a brutal fight that ends in a lake, Diana electrocutes Barbara, then pulls her out of the water. She confronts Max and uses her Lasso of Truth to communicate with the world through him, persuading everyone to renounce their wish. She then shows Max visions of his own unhappy childhood and of his son, Alistair, who is frantically searching for his father amid the chaos. Max renounces his wish and reunites with Alistair, and Barbara returns to normal. Sometime later in the winter, Diana meets the man whose body Steve possessed. Meanwhile, Asteria is revealed to be secretly living among humans."

Pictures in a handful of international markets starting on December 16, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States and Canada on December 25 in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema and IMAX while streaming on HBO Max in the United States and via premium video-on-demand in Canada the same day. IMAX theaters showed a version of the film with a taller aspect ratio during select scenes. That version was also seen on HBO Max as well. The film was released theatrically in additional markets through January 28, 2021. It was originally announced for release on December 13, 2019, before being moved up to November 1, 2019, then it was delayed to June 5, 2020. On March 24, 2020, with theatres closed for an uncertain period of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was delayed to August 14, 2020, taking the release date of Malignant. In June 2020, another delay saw the film's release pushed to October 2, 2020, before it was delayed further to the Christmas date in September, following the tepid opening weekend of Warner Bros' Tenet in the United States and in response to the continued closure of theaters in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City at the time. Later, Variety reported the film would be keeping its Christmas release date in theaters, while the film would also premiere digitally on HBO Max in the United States the same day, with the film being available at no extra cost to subscribers, after a staggered theatrical release schedule in most international markets that do not have HBO Max starting on December 16, including Greece, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Shortly after, Deadline Hollywood reported that in order to get exhibitors on board with the day-and-date HBO Max release, Warner Bros. agreed to take a lower cut of the rental revenue than it usually does with a tentpole release, as well as to pull the film from HBO Max after a month so that the second month of the film's run would be exclusive to theaters. The site also said industry analysts had estimated the film's break-even point at $500million and that it was expected to lose money for the studio. Adam Aron, CEO of US theater chain AMC Theatres, supported the simultaneous release strategy, stating, \"Given that atypical circumstances call for atypical economic relationships between studios and theaters and atypical windows and releasing strategies, AMC is fully onboard for Warner Brothers' announcement.\" The film's simultaneous release strategy led to Warner Bros. announcing on December 3, 2020, that its entire slate of 2021 films would be given the same release strategy. This led to many filmmakers, production companies and theater chains (who were not informed and consulted with over the move) to voice their disappointment and displeasure over the move, especially in regards to the special treatment given to the cast and filmmakers of Wonder Woman 1984 that was not given to the other filmmakers and actors with their 2021 films. Despite being paid her bonus by Warner Bros. as a result of the move, Patty Jenkins herself expressed both worry and optimism over the move's impact on the future of theaters and moviegoing. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the film was released on PVOD services as a 48-hour rental for January 13, 2021, due to the lockdown and closure of theaters in response to COVID-19 surges. While in the Philippines, it was released on HBO Go on April 21, 2021, for the same reason. The film was re-added to HBO Max following its premiere on HBO's linear channel on May 13, 2021."

Certainly some of the problems can be pinned on the uninterestingly janky script, a mess of goofy jokes, storytelling clich\u00e9s and dubious politics.\" Alonso Duralde of TheWrap said: \"Even if the notion of wishes \u2014 making them and then takesies-backsies \u2014 isn't quite a cinematic enough concept to support Wonder Woman's final face-off with Lord, Wonder Woman 1984 still brings a freshness and a wit that's often lacking in these gargantuan costumed-hero sagas.\" Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and stated, \"Gadot is terrifically imposing, while Kristen Wiig is the scene-stealing antagonist in Patty Jenkins' epically brash sequel.\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Gadot, saying, \"Her performance here has dignity and earned emotion\" and called her the best thing about the film and \"She was the best thing in the first installment, too, but that was an excellent movie. This one isn't.\" LaSalle concludes \"Often, it's a beautiful-looking film \u2014 but it's beauty without substance.\" In her review for RogerEbert.com, Christy Lemire wrote, \"The quality that made the original film such a delight has been squashed almost entirely.\""

        "content": "The plot point of Steve inhabiting the body of another man, credited as \"Handsome Man\", was criticized for putting his body into dangerous situations and being used without his consent, including a sex scene between Diana and Steve. Criticism was aimed at the film's lack of acknowledgment of what happened to the man while Steve was inhabiting his body, as well as Diana and Steve not appearing to consider the issue of consent, even if Steve coming back but in another man's body was not any of the characters' intention. The Mary Sue described the event as a rape and strongly condemned it. Jenkins replied in agreement to a fan's tweet that tries to explain there were no issues with this plot aspect, that the film was following the trope of a body swap, similar to Big or Freaky Friday. Bonnie Burton, writing for CNet, stated that while this may have been Jenkins' intention, the body swap trope may not be as politically correct in the current period as it was in the 1980s. Roxana Hadadi of Slate criticized the film for what she saw as its negative stereotypical depiction of Arab people."

The filmmaker stated that the plot of the next installment would take place during the modern day. By December 2019, Jenkins expressed that the wait between the second and third films will be longer than the time it took to release the first sequel. In April 2020, Jenkins said she had a story arc that would take in all four Wonder Woman films, including an Amazons film and then a third Wonder Woman film. In late June 2020, speaking to Heroic Hollywood about the third film's status, Jenkins revealed that she had stopped working on the story which she had been developing six months prior so she could see how to absorb the result of the COVID-19 pandemic into the story. In an interview with the Happy Sad Confused podcast in December 2020, Jenkins stated that while she and Geoff Johns had already \"beat out an entire story\" for a third film, she now has doubts about whether she wants to make it with the world's current state, unsure if it will be her next film and if her feelings about it will change. When interviewed by MTV News about what she would want to see in a third film, Gal Gadot stated that she wants the third film to take place in the present, having no interest on revisiting the past as she feels that those time periods on Wonder Woman's life have been handled perfectly. The sequel was officially greenlit on December 27, 2020, with Jenkins and Gadot officially returning and Warner Bros. confirming that the film would have a traditional theatrical release as compared to Wonder Woman 1984."

The plot is loosely based on the Canonical Gospels' accounts of the last week of the life of Jesus Christ, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. The disciple Judas Iscariot is worried that Jesus has become too swept up in the adoration of his followers, rather than focusing on his teachings about taking care of the poor, and that his following has grown too large and outspoken, which could soon provoke the wrath of the Roman Empire (\"Heaven on Their Minds\"). Judas also objects to Jesus spending his time with Mary Magdalene (\"What's the Buzz / Strange Thing Mystifying\"), who advises Jesus to relax (\"Everything's All Right\"). Judas's fears prove justified as priests Caiaphas, Annas and more gather and agree that Jesus and his movement must be crushed (\"This Jesus Must Die\"). Jesus enters Jerusalem filled with exaltation (\"Hosanna\") until he discovers that his temple has become overrun with unscrupulous merchants and money lenders. Overwhelmed by a throng of people needing his assistance, he tells them to heal themselves (\"The Temple\"), and his follower Mary Magdalene attempts to calm him. Fearing that Jesus' movement is getting out of control, Judas goes to the Priests and tells them where Jesus will be the following night. The Priests pay him with 30 pieces of silver. Judas arrives at Jesus' location with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by kissing him on the cheek. The soldiers arrest Jesus and send him to Caiaphas, then Pontius Pilate, King Herod Antipas, and finally back to Pilate, who condemns him to death on the cross."

In a positive review, The New York Timess Noel Murray praised the special saying, \"A conceptual and artistic triumph, NBC\u2019s live telecast of Jesus Christ Superstar on Easter Sunday may have finally justified the recent live musical fad on network TV. Some technical flubs and one mixed-bag lead performance aside, the production was genuinely thrilling, taking chances with the staging of a classic but controversial Broadway show, much more daring than previous live musical broadcasts like The Sound of Music or Peter Pan.\" Offering similar acclaim, The Hollywood Reporters David Rooney said, \"But here's the thing: This was a phenomenally balanced production of Jesus Christ Superstar, in which star power was equaled by depth of feeling and characterization in all the principals. And the immediacy of television, with close-ups capable of bringing us in tight on the performers' faces, gave Jesus and Mary Magdalene a complexity that often is missing from conventional productions.\" Lorraine Ali of The Los Angeles Times also lauded the production saying, \"The show was a collision of religion and theater and pop culture that could have been one holy mess. But by the grace of God, or maybe a great cast and lots and lots of expert staging, a great musical became a great TV production.\" In a more mixed review, Maureen Ryan of Variety said, \"This musical threw together glitter, sequins, leather, writhing hotties, a few big performances pitched to the last row, and camerawork that often felt as though it was hopped up on too many lattes. Actually, the ragged edges of a unifying concept did emerge over the course of the NBC musical\u2019s two-hour-and-20-minute running time: If its philosophy could be summed up in one word, \"excess\" would just about cover it. That's not necessarily a bad thing. But this live show was a lot.\""

They pick Dizzy, granddaughter of Lady Tremaine, Celia, daughter of Dr. Facilier, and Squeaky and Squirmy, the twin sons of Mr. Smee. The day the kids are to be picked up, Mal is concerned about Uma being on the loose, and Ben, Mal's boyfriend and the king of Auradon, proposes to her, and she accepts. Ben's ex-girlfriend Audrey seethes with jealousy, and her grandmother Queen Leah admonishes her for failing to secure the family legacy by marrying Ben. When the barrier is opened for the new VKs, Hades, the god of the underworld, attempts to escape, but Mal beats him back in her dragon form. That night, unable to contain her jealousy of Mal, Audrey steals the Queen's Crown and Maleficent's Scepter from The Museum. The theft and Hades' escape attempt has the citizens panicking. Mal, as future Queen, decides the best way to protect the subjects and restore peace is to close the barrier permanently, meaning no new VKs can come, nor can anyone enter the Isle. Audrey attacks Mal with Maleficent's scepter, turning her into an old hag. Mal and the other VKs go to the Isle to get Hades' ember, the only thing powerful enough to break the scepter's curse. Mal is restored upon entering the Isle due to the suppression of evil magic there. Celia gets Mal into Hades' lair, but he thwarts their effort to steal the ember. He is revealed to be Mal's absentee father and reluctantly gives her the ember, warning her that it mustn't get wet and will not exhibit its full powers for her. While leaving the Isle, Mal and the others are stopped by Uma, Gil, and Harry, who take the Ember. They agree to help after Mal agrees to release all the children from the Isle. In Auradon, Audrey attacks Jane's birthday party with a sleeping curse; Chad aligns himself with Audrey, while Jane escapes into the Enchanted Lake. As the entire kingdom falls under Audrey's spell, she offers to reverse it if Ben will marry her; he refuses, so she turns him into a beast and begins turning people to stone. Mal and Uma, vying for the leadership of the VKs, return to Auradon with their friends. Despite their bickering, they work together to defeat suits of armor animated by Audrey. Uma finds Audrey's diary and learns that she spends time at Fairy Cottage, a contribution for which Mal thanks her. Evie, nervous to define her feelings for Doug, wakes him with \"true love's kiss.\" After finding Ben in beast form, Carlos calms him down until Jane restores him with lake water. As Mal and Uma are thawing towards each other, Audrey traps them in Evie's house; they reverse Audrey's spell by combining their magic, and they all reunite there. At the Fairy Cottage, they find only a shell-shocked Chad. When Mal admits that she plans to seal off the Isle permanently, the group implodes and Celia, learning she can never see her father again, throws the ember in a birdbath, and Uma and Harry leave. After Evie tells Mal how upset she is for lying to her and their friends, they are all suddenly turned to stone, except for Mal. Audrey takes Celia hostage and attacks Mal, who turns into her dragon form. Realizing she is Mal's only hope, Uma combines their magic to reignite the ember; Mal overcomes Audrey, who falls comatose, and the curses are lifted. The ember could revive Audrey, but only in Hades' hands; Ben agrees to send for him, while Uma, Harry, Gil, and Celia plan to return to the Isle. Mal apologizes for lying; her friends and former rivals forgive her as they understood that she was just trying to do the right thing. Hades arrives and revives Audrey, but decries the double standard by which Audrey is immediately forgiven because she is not considered a villain. Mal and Ben apologize to Audrey; in response, Audrey apologizes to Mal. Mal announces that she cannot be the Queen of Auradon unless she can also be the Queen of the Isle because everyone is capable of being good and bad. With Ben and the Fairy Godmother's approval, Mal removes the barrier and creates a bridge, and the people of the newly merged society celebrate. Also, Jane and Carlos become official, Mal and Ben are engaged, and Audrey has eyes for Harry (after Uma rejects him). In the mid-credits scene, Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos are seen looking at the Isle of the Lost; then racing across the bridge to their parents."

Amy has a crush on a girl named Ryan, which Molly urges her to pursue. On the eve of graduation, Molly confronts classmates insulting her bookishness, telling them she got into Yale, but they claim that, despite their partying, they got into prestigious colleges or job recruitments. Furious, Molly tells Amy they should have enjoyed their time in high school more, and Amy reluctantly agrees to go to a graduation party held by classmate Nick. Not knowing the party's address, Molly calls Jared, a wealthy classmate who likes her. He instead takes them to his own party aboard a yacht. Only his drug-crazed friend Gigi is there, and she feeds the girls strawberries before jumping off the yacht. Amy suggests they go home, but Molly calls a \"malala\", their code for unconditionally supporting what the other wants to do. The girls call a cab and are shocked to be picked up by their principal, Jordan Brown. To prepare Amy for possible sex with Ryan, Molly insists they watch pornography, which accidentally plays through the car speakers. Brown drops them off at what they think is Nick's party but it is the home of their classmate George, who is hosting a murder mystery party. They again encounter Gigi, who reveals that the strawberries were laced with powerful hallucinogenic drugs. Amy and Molly experience a bad trip and hallucinate they are plastic fashion dolls. They leave George's house, but Gigi tells Amy that Molly secretly likes Nick, so Amy insists they press on, so that Molly can pursue her crush on Nick. They see pizza boxes in an online video of Nick's party and acquire the address from the pizza delivery man. Molly calls their teacher, Miss Fine, who gives them a ride to Nick's party. Once at the party, Amy and Molly are surprised to find they are warmly welcomed. Molly and Nick flirt over beer pong and Amy spends time with Ryan. Unfortunately, Amy soon finds Ryan making out with Nick. Heartbroken, she finds Molly and calls her own \"Malala\", which Molly refuses because she still thinks she has a chance with Nick. Amy angrily reveals she is not just spending the summer in Botswana but taking an entire gap year because she resents how Molly always tries to control her life. The two have a huge argument in front of the entire party. Amy runs to the bathroom in tears, finding her classmate Hope. They are initially argumentative until Amy kisses her. They start to have sex, but Amy vomits on Hope. Jared and Molly have a heartfelt conversation about how no one at school really knows them. Cops arrive at the party and everyone scatters. Unable to find Amy, Molly is driven home by \"Triple A\", a girl student with a promiscuous reputation. They bond over the stereotyping they both have endured. Waking up on graduation day, Molly checks her phone and discovers her classmates praising Amy for having created a diversion at the party, allowing everyone to escape while getting herself arrested. Molly visits Amy in jail and they reconcile. Learning the pizza delivery man is a serial killer, they trade information to free Amy, and they rush to attend graduation. Molly kisses Jared onstage and gives an improvised valedictorian speech, both enthusiastically applauded. A few days later, as Amy packs for her trip to Botswana, Molly sees Hope visit and give Amy her phone number. Molly drives Amy to the airport where they share a tearful goodbye, but then Amy decides she still has time to hang out before her flight, so they ecstatically decide to get pancakes."

Megan Ellison, Chelsea Bernard, David Distenfeld, Will Ferrell, Adam McKay, and Elbaum would serve as producers on the film. Screenwriter Katie Silberman was hired for more revisions in spring 2018, and to update the story. Silberman explored a new concept: According to Silberman, \"Olivia's mantra to all of us was that high school is war\".

Wilde also urged Feldstein and Dever to live together to develop a rapport. The two actresses were roommates in Los Angeles for ten weeks. Wilde also asked the cast to read the screenplay and signal if they found dialogue that felt \"inauthentic ... [and] rewrite it in your own voice\". Silberman continued to write after casting, finding it easy to come up with dialogue to fit Feldstein and Dever. Silberman particularly credited the complementary language the characters use to Feldstein, who frequently posted \"I have no breath\" to Instagram."

In the United States and Canada, Booksmart was released alongside Aladdin and Brightburn, and was projected to gross around $12 million from 2,505 theaters in its four-day opening weekend. The film made $2.5 million on its first day, including $875,000 from Thursday night previews. It ended up underperforming, debuting to just $6.9 million (a four-day total of $8.7 million), finishing in sixth place. Industry publications insisted that although the targeted young female demographic did turn out to the film, it should have begun with a limited release and expanded, similar to the R-rated, female-led high school comedy Lady Bird in 2017, and that Booksmart failed to stand out in the crowded marketplace. In its second weekend the film made $3.3 million, dropping 52% and finishing in eighth. The film's largest market outside North America was the United Kingdom, where it grossed around US$1.8 million (\u00a31.5 million) after seven weeks in theaters. Director J. J. Abrams asked: \"When you have a movie that's as entertaining, well-made, and well-received as Booksmart not doing the business it should have [the teen comedy underperforming at the box office despite critics' raves], it really makes you realize that the typical Darwinian fight to survive is completely lopsided now.

Alissa Wilkinson of Vox awarded the film a score of four out of five, writing that the \"memorably relatable\" Booksmart is also a \"delightful reminder that growing up is about realizing nobody's a stereotype\".

He orders a participant named Wolfgang to take the child away, and sacrifices her instead. At some point, Malcolm died and the cultists disbanded. Twenty-five years later, an adult Jonathan and his girlfriend Rebecca inherit his late father's estate, where they find several books on magic and a basement full of occult paraphernalia. When they later throw a party and invite their friends, Jonathan recruits them to perform a ritual in the basement for fun. Everyone leaves when nothing happens, but a small creature begins to materialize in the basement. The next day, Jonathan tells Rebecca of his decision to quit college and work on the estate instead, to which she expresses concern. While cleaning up the house, Malcolm's ghost influences Jonathan to go into the basement to perform another ritual. Rebecca's concern grows when Jonathan refuses to eat, explaining that he is fasting. That evening, he conjures several creatures called Ghoulies, and proclaims himself as their master, demanding them to hide their existence from everyone but him. One day, Rebecca comes home to find Jonathan performing a ritual, much to her shock. He explains that he is trying to learn about the parents he never knew, and promises to stop his behavior. While they both lay in bed, a Ghoulie secretly draws an occult diagram under the bed which prompts Jonathan to chant in another language, and a furious Rebecca leaves him. Jonathan summons two dwarves named Grizzel and Greedigut to his service, who promise to give him everything he desires. They explain that he must perform a dangerous ritual with seven other people to obtain the knowledge and power he seeks. Later, Rebecca returns and asks Jonathan to leave with her, but he refuses. He then reveals his glowing eyes to her and she runs away, but the dwarves bewitch her to return to Jonathan. He invites his friends and bewitches them to participate in the ritual. As Jonathan chants, Malcolm is resurrected from the grave. After the ceremony, Jonathan's friends remain oblivious and are invited to stay the night. Malcolm proclaims himself the real master to the Ghoulies and dwarves, and commands them to kill the group. Meanwhile, Jonathan apologizes to Rebecca and breaks the spell by placing the talisman around her neck, but she falls into a deep sleep. She eventually wakes up to see Jonathan in a trance, and runs away. After she removes the talisman around her neck, the Ghoulies attack her and she falls down a flight of stairs. Jonathan brings her to the basement to resurrect her, where he finds the dead bodies of his friends underneath sheets. Malcolm appears with the dwarves, revealing that he used Jonathan to resurrect him in order to capture his youth and sacrifice him. As a battle ensues, Malcolm resurrects Rebecca to distract Jonathan, but the dwarves alert him of the trap. Wolfgang appears with his own magical powers and fights off Malcolm. The house begins to crumble, and Wolfgang defeats Malcolm before they both disappear. Jonathan's friends and Rebecca are resurrected, and they escape to drive away as the dwarves watch. Riding with Jonathan and Rebecca, Mike asks about what happened, but Jonathan assures him it is over. However, Mike is alarmed when the Ghoulies rise behind him."

Principal photography began on January 30, 1984 in Los Angeles, California after being in pre-production for five months. During its fifth week of filming, Hemdale Film Corporation was initially set to handle the film's domestic distribution. However, the company remained uncredited when they later filed a lawsuit against executive producer Charles Band and Ghoulies Productions, citing \"misrepresentation\" after Band allegedly misled the company regarding the home video sales and distribution. Coincidentally, the film was in production at the same time as Joe Dante's film Gremlins (1984) which Warner Bros. briefly sued the filmmakers from using the name, but the latter lost. Halfway through shooting, Band ran out of money and the filmmakers scrambled funds for months, which allowed Gremlins to be released first."

Special effects and production values are mediocre, which in this case is part of the fun.\" Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Cinematographer Mac Ahlberg contributes eerily lit camera work that occasionally achieves surprising atmosphere and delicacy, and John Carl Buechler's creations, the ghoulies themselves\u2014foul, reptilian little beings coated with some obscene glittering, mucous-like moisture\u2014have a certain nauseating charm.

        "content": "Kondo's ideology towards de-cluttering is called the KonMari method. Her process, which she explains in the series, includes having participants go through their homes section by section\u2014\"1) Clothing, 2) Books, 3) Paper, 4) Komono (kitchen, bathroom, garage and miscellaneous) 5) Sentimental items. Then, when the items are gathered together, Kondo asks the participants to go through the individual items one by one and only keep what \"sparks joy\". While her method to cleaning is effective in organizing people's homes and environments, Kondo came to understand that her method was \"far more psychological than it was practical.\" This perspective is supported well by studies done on how people perform and feel in tidy versus messy environments. Research suggests that \"clean organized environments\" have a variety of psychologically beneficial effects\u2014such as clearer thought processes, increased confidence, and abilities. Further research shows that an untidy environment can negatively impact many aspects of human health\u2014such as mood and stress levels, memory capabilities, and even the ability to process other people's facial expressions. When people's personal space is \"de-cluttered,\" they are better able to sleep, focus, and hold feelings of satisfaction with their lives. The evidence that Kondo's show positively affects the mental health of the people featured in it isn't just seen on the show itself, but in interviews given by participants later on. One couple, seen in Episode 1, \"Tidying with Toddlers,\" Kevin and Rachel Friend, said after Kondo's help that, \"Chaos for us doesn\u2019t happen anymore. We\u2019re able to take on things. Nothing overwhelms us anymore. Now, it's just our lifestyle.\""

On the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the show holds a score of 81%, noting that Marie Kondo \"makes for a delightful instructor\". On Metacritic, the show has a score of 69 based on eight critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In The Atlantic, Sarah Archer says that the show is about \"cultivating empathy for the things that surround us\", noting that Kondo's empathy is the key to her success in helping people. In Vice, Nicole Clark writes that by showcasing the inner workings of family homes, the show has unintentionally highlighted differing gender expectations towards tidying and organizing households. Jack Seale in The Guardian is less positive, noting that the show is simply \"a show where a woman just tells people to tidy up.\" He adds that the before and after reveals lack excitement, revealing the same house except tidier. Others have been on the fence, like Kristin van Ogtrop from Time, who wrote about the \"completely bananas\" method Kondo employs, suggesting that while necessary items should still be kept around, it is still a worthwhile endeavor to mentally refocus on what brings one joy."

        "content": "Planet of the Humans is a 2019 American environmental documentary film written, directed, and produced by Jeff Gibbs. The film was executively produced by Michael Moore. Moore released it on YouTube for free viewing on April 21, 2020, the eve of the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day. The film examines the decision of mainstream environmental groups and leaders to partner with billionaires, corporations, and wealthy family foundations in the fight to save a planet said to be in crisis. The film questions whether green energy can solve the problem of society's expanding resource depletion without reducing consumption and population growth, as all existing forms of energy generation require consumption of finite resources. Centrally, the film questions whether renewable energy sources such as biomass energy, wind power, and solar energy are as clean and renewable as they are portrayed to be. Upon its release, Planet of the Humans generated intense controversy. It was criticized by some climate scientists, environmentalists and renewable energy proponents as misleading and outdated. It was removed from YouTube on May 25, 2020, in response to a claim of copyright infringement, which PEN America condemned as censorship. The filmmakers challenged the claim, arguing that the fragment was used under fair use and that free speech was subverted. Twelve days later, YouTube allowed the film to be viewed again. In November 2020, Moore removed it from YouTube where it was available for free and made it available on Amazon, Apple and Google's rental channels. As of May 2021, the original YouTube post from April 2020 was available again for free."

        "content": "Planet of the Humans takes a critical look at the mainstream environmental movement, questioning its leaders' decision to partner with billionaires, corporations, and wealthy family foundations, and to promote renewable energy technology as the solution to climate change. Gibbs admits to being a long-time fan of renewable energy. When Barack Obama directs billions of dollars into renewable energy, Gibbs follows the green energy movement more closely but is disappointed with his initial findings. \"Everywhere I encountered green energy,\" Gibbs says, \"it wasn\u2019t what it seemed.\" Attending General Motors' Chevy Volt press conference in 2010, he learns that the vehicle is being charged by a fossil fuel grid. A visit to his local solar array reveals it could only meet the energy demand of 10 homes over a year. He joins a group of concerned citizens on a hike to a wind turbine construction site in Vermont and finds part of the mountainside being removed. Gibbs asks, \"Can machines made by industrial civilization save us from industrialization?\" This question leads Gibbs to environmental sociologist Richard York\u2019s study published in the journal Nature, which found renewables were not displacing fossil fuels. Gibbs also speaks with author Richard Heinberg and anthropologist Nina Jablonski on why people seek technological fixes. Gibbs then interviews Ozzie Zehner, author of Green Illusions (2012), who reports that solar, wind, and electric vehicle technologies require mined minerals, including rare earths, and heavy industrial processes to produce \u2013 with new mines opening as demand for green technology rises. Gibbs and Zehner travel to Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in the Mojave Desert and show a natural gas line hooked up to the facility. Gibbs speaks to a series of solar industry insiders, an electrical engineer, and a Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner about solar energy\u2019s intermittency limitation and reliance on baseload plants. Zehner reveals that while the Sierra Club\u2019s \"Beyond Coal\" campaign has been successfully closing coal plants, natural gas plants were opening in their wake resulting in the overall expansion of fossil fuel use in the United States during that same time period, citing data from the U.S. Department of Energy. The film shows green tech investor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaking to an oil and gas industry group, stating: \"The plants that we're building, the wind plants and the solar plants, are gas plants.\" Zehner discusses how companies including Apple and Tesla claim to run on 100% renewable energy despite remaining hooked up to the grid and reveals the Koch Brothers' involvement in green technology production. The film contains a three-minute montage set to Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \"The Enemy God Dances with the Black Spirits\", which shows the scale of industrial mining required to create solar, wind, and electric vehicle technology. A bulldozer is shown destroying a 500-yearold yucca plant to clear the land for what became the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility. Gibbs says that solar and wind arrays last only a few decades before \"you tear it down, and start all over again.\" Gibbs visits Steven Running, an ecologist from the University of Montana, who discusses planetary limits \u2013 including global fish production, agricultural land, water irrigation, and ground water. Gibbs ends the section by speaking to social-psychologist Sheldon Solomon positing whether faith in renewables could be a reflection of a fear of death. Gibbs sneaks onto a biomass plant property in Vermont and finds that instead of burning forest residue as advertised, the plant is surrounded by whole trees. A citizen activist in Michigan reveals that her local biomass plant burns PCP and creosote-treated railroad ties shipped in from Canada as well as rubber tires, which cause black snow to appear at the adjacent elementary school. Gibbs explores the practice of universities committing to \"go green\" by opening biomass plants on campus, tracing the practice back to a college in Middlebury, VT, endorsed by Bill McKibben. Gibbs reveals that biomass energy remains the largest percentage of renewable energy in the world. He then explores what he calls the \"language loopholes\" that allow for the continuation of biomass around the U.S. The section ends with Gibbs, as part of a media event at the Climate March in New York City, asking environmental leaders for their stance on biomass including Van Jones, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Bill McKibben, and Vandana Shiva. Only Shiva denounces biomass & biofuels. In the last third of the film, Gibbs explores the partnerships between mainstream environmental groups and Wall Street investors, billionaires, and wealthy family foundations. Gibbs reveals a tax return showing that the Sierra Club accepted 3 million dollars from timber investor Jeremy Grantham. McKibben is shown on stage with former Goldman Sachs executive David Blood, supporting his call to raise $40\u201350 trillion in green energy investments. Gibbs displays U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings of green funds promoted in divestment campaigns by 350.org's, Bill McKibben, and the Sierra Club, which show holdings in mining companies, oil and gas infrastructure, various banks including BlackRock, Halliburton, McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Exxon, Chevron, Gazprom, and Enviva among others. Gibbs shows corporate formation documents indicating that Al Gore partnered with David Blood to start Generation Investment Management \u2013 a sustainability investment fund \u2013 before releasing An Inconvenient Truth. Gibbs then shows Gore lobbying Congress on behalf of the sugarcane ethanol industry in Brazil, juxtaposing footage of indigenous cultures in Brazil being evicted from their land to create more sugarcane fields. Gibbs asserts that \"the takeover of the environmental movement by capitalism is now complete,\" and asks whether it has always been complete. The film shows McKibben stating that 350.org receives funding from The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the V. Kann Rasmussen Foundation. He also shows Gore in multiple interviews defending his decision to sell his American television channel, Current TV, earning him an estimated $100 million pre-tax for the deal, to Al Jazeera which is owned by the State of Qatar, an oil and gas producer. Gibbs attends an Earth Day concert celebration in Washington, DC sponsored by Toyota, Citibank, and Caterpillar, where Dennis Hayes claims the entire event is run on solar energy. Backstage, Gibbs discovers the concert is actually being run by biodiesel generators. The film ends with Gibbs reflecting that \"Infinite growth on a finite planet is suicide\", imploring the audience to take back the environmental movement from billionaires and capitalists. The final scene shows a mother and baby orangutan struggling to survive as the forest is logged and burned around them."

On April 21, 2020, the eve of Earth Day, Moore announced that the film would be available for free on YouTube for 30 days, which was later extended by another month because of high viewership. In an interview held at TCFF, Gibbs stated that \"the film is not expected to be a comfortable beginning to the needed conversation\", especially for those who treat solar and wind energy like \"sacred cows\". The Films For Action website originally promoted the documentary. After protests stating that \"the film is full of misinformation\", they removed the embedded link and published a statement listing multiple falsehoods and errors, including statements about environmental organizations and solar and wind power that were outdated or incorrect. On May 7, Films for Action restored the embedded link, stating their concern that \"taking the film down in the context of Josh's retraction campaign was only going to create headlines, generate more interest in the film, and possibly lead people to think we're trying to 'cover up the truth,' giving the film more power and mystique than it deserves\". On May 25, 2020, the film was temporarily removed from YouTube due to a copyright infringement claim by British environmental photographer Toby Smith over a 4-second segment Gibbs considered fair-use content. The controversial video had more than 8 million YouTube views at the time. Moore and Gibbs called the move a \"blatant act of censorship\" and disputed the claim with YouTube. The producers made the video available for free streaming on the competing Vimeo platform. On November 18, 2020, Moore took it down from his \"rumble\" YouTube channel where it was available for free and instead made it available on Amazon, Apple and Google's rental channels."

        "content": "The movie was criticized as outdated and misleading by climate scientists. The film claims the carbon footprint of renewable energy is comparable to fossil fuels, when taking into account all different stages of its production. However, a large body of research shows the life-cycle emissions of wind and solar are much lower than those of fossil fuels. The film uses footage of a solar field that is up to a decade old, which critics argue may give a false impression of the maturity of the technologies in the present day. One field of solar panels the documentary shows operates with 8% efficiency of sunlight conversion, which is below the typical 15-20% efficiency of solar panels in use in 2020. The film also includes footage of a 10-year-old electric vehicle being recharged from a grid that is 95% powered by coal. The emissions intensity of electric vehicles varies depending on the source of electricity used to power the grid; however, as of 2020, they emit less than internal combustion vehicles in all but a few of the world's regions. As of 2015, electric vehicles emit on average 31% less than internal combustion vehicles for the same distance travelled. The average power grid derived slightly more than 60% of its energy from fossil fuels in 2019. A pie chart is shown in the film with total battery storage compared to yearly energy use, which is a factor of thousand higher. The filmmakers suggest that this amount of energy storage is needed to make sure intermittency of renewables does not lead to power outages. In reality, battery storage is only part of solving intermittency, and using a mix of different energy sources reduces the need for batteries. In a letter, filmmaker and environmental activist Josh Fox and academics including climate scientist Michael Mann have asked for an apology and a retraction of the film. They say the film includes \"various distortions, half-truths and lies\", and that the filmmakers \"have done a grave disservice to us and the planet by promoting climate change inactivist tropes and talking points\"."

Environmentalist Bill McKibben responded to claims made in the documentary about him and the organization he cofounded, 350.org: \"A Youtube video emerged on Earth Day eve making charges about me and about 350.org \u2014 namely that I was a supporter of biomass energy, and that 350 and I were beholden to corporate funding, and have misled our supporters on the costs and trade-offs related to decarbonizing our economy.

Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw called the film \"refreshingly contrarian\" saying that \"it's always valuable to re-examine a sacred cow\" and praising the film for focusing on \"liberal A-listers\" and refraining from attacking Greta Thunberg but criticised the film for being vague about solutions and not examining nuclear power. Gary Mason at The Globe and Mail referred to the film as \"The Michael Moore-backed film enviros are dreading\". Nonfictionfilm.com editor-in-chief, Matthew Carey, wrote: \"Films about environmental issues have long been a staple of the documentary form, a genre that in recent years alone has brought us Before the Flood, Chasing Ice, Chasing Coral and, of course, An Inconvenient Truth. But those documentaries arguably pale in importance to Planet of the Humans\" Julie Ann Grimm of the Santa Fe Reporter praised the film saying that \"Gibbs highlights how the global environmental cost of mining, production and disposal of solar and wind technology don\u2019t get primetime play\" and calling it a \"enjoyable if also gut-rotting indictment of Big Environment and some of its figureheads\" concluding that \"It's ... a must-watch.\" Adrian Hennigan, features editor at Haaretz, called Planet of the Humans a \"provocative documentary about how capitalism has destroyed the environmental movement\" and stated: \"This cri de coeur from American producer-composer-editor Gibbs may lack balance and counterarguments, but it convincingly makes the case that 'less must be the new more' if humankind is to have any chance of not being wiped out due to overpopulation and overconsumption.\" The Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial page wrote of the movie, \"As Mr. Moore and Mr. Gibbs have uncovered, renewable energy proponents have been much better at making promises than keeping them\", noting that \"they aren\u2019t the only ones who\u2019ve noticed that renewable energy is heavily dependent on things that aren\u2019t so renewable,\" pointing to an article in the Wall Street Journal by Mark P. Mills. However, they were less positive about the film's scepticism of companies, saying: \"But the duo seem particularly aghast ... that any transition to green energy will require massive investment from evil industrialists and capitalists who might turn a profit. Who knew?\" For Resilience, Heinberg has also written: \"[The film] starts a conversation we need to have, and it's a film that deserves to be seen\" and \"Mainstream enviros will hate this movie because it exposes some of their real failings. By focusing on techno-fixes, they have side-lined nearly all discussion of overpopulation and overconsumption.\" Dennis Harvey in Variety claimed \"Gibbs' dull monotone makes him a poor narrator\", \"there's nothing particularly elegant about the way Planet of the Humans arrives at its downbeat thesis,\" and \"though well-shot and edited, the material here is simply too sprawling to avoid feeling crammed into one ungainly package.\""

Jacobin wrote that the film \"embraces bad science on renewable energy and anti-humanist, anti\u2013working class narratives of overpopulation and overconsumption\", concluding that by \"focusing on industrial civilization and 'overpopulation' as the cause of environmental problems, Moore and Gibbs distract us from the real problem: the untrammeled market.\" Ted Nordhaus, an environmental policy writer and proponent of nuclear energy and industrial agriculture,  noted that the bias in portraying renewables in the film \"is a mirror image of the misinformation that the anti-nuclear movement has trafficked in for decades\" and concluded the overall message of the film is neomalthusian.

Unable to remember much of her life before or connect with her husband, businessman Laurence, Jennifer is intrigued by a letter she finds between \"J\" and \"Boot\". She decides to try and remember what happened to her by following clues from the letter. In modern day London, Ellie Haworth, who recently broke up with her long-time boyfriend, has to write an article about the recently-deceased editor of her paper. Getting past the formal archivist Rory to access the editor's archive, she finds a misfiled love letter, to someone identified as \"J\", from \"Boot\". Moved by the passionate feelings between the mysterious couple, Ellie becomes determined to learn their identities and how their love story ended. In the past a pre-accident Jennifer and her husband Laurence travel to the French Riviera for a summer vacation. Foreign correspondent Anthony O'Hare arrives to interview Laurence about his business success. At the party Laurence is condescending to both Jennifer and Anthony. Afterwards a drunk Anthony complains about the awful company to a fellow guest and is caught out by Jennifer. Anthony returns the next morning with a written apology which Jennifer forces him to read aloud. Anthony invites the Stirlings out to eat the next day, but Laurence is called away on a sudden business trip, leaving Jennifer and Anthony to spend the summer together until his return. They begin writing letters to each other, under the pennames \"J\" and \"Boot\" (or \"B\"). Neither act on their growing electricity, until Jennifer impulsively tries to kiss him. When he pulls away, she flees. Some days later, a letter penned by Anthony reaches her, proposing to meet at Postman's Park in London. They start a whirlwind affair, spending moments together where Jennifer can safely be with Anthony. Finally, he proposes she run off with him to New York. Jennifer is hesitant to leave, in fear of being treated as outcast by her family and friends. After Anthony sends her a letter that he will be waiting for her at the train station on the night of his departure, Jennifer rushes off to meet him. Just before she can arrive, she gets into a car accident, with a blow to her head causing partial amnesia. Anthony leaves for New York, believing that Jennifer has rejected him. Six months after the car accident, Laurence hides the last letter Jennifer received from Anthony in effort to prevent her from remembering the affair. Jennifer feels lost as she struggles to recover her memories. She begins finding several of the love letters from \"Boot\" hidden in her house, leading her to discover a postal box in her name that Laurence had closed. Jennifer confronts Laurence, who claims Anthony had died in the crash. Four years later, Jennifer bumps into Anthony, restoring her memories of their time together. Anthony once again pleads for her to run away with him, but she refuses out of consideration for her two-year old-daughter. Enraged at Laurence for his lies, Jennifer asserts that she will stay with him because of their daughter, but vows to leave if he mistreats her. In turn, Laurence threatens to ruin Jennifer's reputation and gain sole custody of their daughter, as she would only be seen as an adulteress by the court of law. This prompts Jennifer to escape with their daughter to go with Anthony. After finding out he has checked out of his hotel, she tries finding him at his workplace, but is informed by the editor that Anthony has already left. Forced to return to Laurence, Jennifer gives the bundle of love letters to the editor to be sent to Anthony if they hear back from him. In the present day, Ellie and Rory grow closer as they uncover more of the love letters. After spending the night with Rory, Ellie distances herself from him. She learns that Jennifer and Anthony are both alive and goes to speak with them. After hearing their regrets and pain over their lost romance, Ellie decides to enter into a relationship with Rory, choosing to give romance another try and not live with regrets. Ellie returns to Anthony and encourages him to write one last letter to Jennifer, in which he asks her to meet him once again at Postman's Park.

Each episode includes narration by actress Julie Andrews, who voices the anonymous and ever-scandalous newsletter columnist known as Lady Whistledown, who possesses knowledge of all the information in London, drawing everyone's interest, even Queen Charlotte. Unlike the series of novels, Bridgerton is set in an alternate history with a racially integrated London where people of color are members of the ton, some with titles granted by the sovereign. Creator Chris Van Dusen was inspired by historical debate over the 1940s African ancestry claims of Queen Charlotte \"...to base the show in an alternative history in which Queen Charlotte's mixed race heritage was not only well-established but was transformative for Black people and other people of color in England.\" Van Dusen says the series is not \"color-blind\" because \"that would imply that color and race were never considered, when color and race are part of the show.\""

Although the series takes place in London, most street scenes were filmed in Bath, York, and Chatham. The grounds of Wilton House were used for Hyde Park and the grounds of Somerley were used for Hampstead Heath. Garden scenes were filmed at Painshill near Cobham and the Commissioner's House in Chatham. Filming locations included Ranger's House in Greenwich (standing in for the Bridgerton House exterior); Halton House at RAF Halton (Bridgerton House interior, Featheringtons' interior); Wilton House (Simon's Hastings House, Clyvedon estate interior, throne room); Syon House and Badminton House (Hastings House); Castle Howard (Clyvedon estate); Coneysthorpe (Clyvedon village); Hampton Court Palace and Lancaster House (St. James's Palace); Holburne Museum (Lady Danbury's estate); Hatfield House (Featheringtons' interior); No. 1 Royal Crescent (Grosvenor Square); Queen's House and Somerley (Somerset House); and Dorney Court (coaching inn). Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens no longer exists in its entirety. The production team recreated it for Lady Danbury's ball by combining the remaining parts with Castle Howard and Stowe Park. The banqueting room at the Guildhall, Bath was used for another ball as well as the Great Hall at Leigh Court in Somerset. Anthony Bridgerton and Simon Basset meet in the real life Reform Club on Pall Mall in central London. The scene in which Lady Featherington takes Marina to the slums was filmed at Chatham Dockyard in Kent. Boxing scenes were also filmed here in addition to Normansfield Theatre in Teddington. Theatre scenes were filmed at the Hackney Empire. A caf\u00e9 in Bath, Pickled Greens, was used as the site of the Modiste shop and the Bathrooms at No.5 store on Trim Street became the site of Gunter's Tea Shop. The costuming effort was spearheaded by Ellen Mirojnick and involved over two hundred people and five months of preparation to create 5,000 costumes. Production on the second season began in March 2021. In May 2021, it was reported that the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead have refused permission to build a film set for the second season in Sunninghill Park near Windsor, despite royal approval. On July 15, 2021, production on the second season was paused for 24 hours when a crew member tested positive for COVID-19, but resumed the following day. However, on July 17, production was halted indefinitely following a second positive test. Production resumed in August 2021. Production for the second season wrapped on November 20, 2021."

Also included are Celeste's \"Strange\" performed by Bowers, and Taylor Swift's \"Wildest Dreams\" performed by Duomo. Bowers also included modern interpretations of classical music, such as Bach's Cello Suite No. 6 in D major from Peter Gregson's Recomposed by Peter Gregson: Bach \u2013 The Cello Suites and Vivaldi's The Four Seasons from Max Richter's Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi \u2013 The Four Seasons.

What we\u2019re really doing with the show is marrying history and fantasy in what I think is a very exciting way. One approach that we took to that is our approach to race\". The aristocratic Bridgerton family, Lady Whistledown and most of the other characters in the show are entirely fictional. The theory that Queen Charlotte may have had African ancestry has been characterized as an unhistorical assertion by most scholars. In an interview with Insider magazine, American historian Marlene Koenig said the show's representation of Regency-era London was more diverse than it was in reality, adding that \"diversity as we know what the word means did not exist\" in Britain during that period. Some classical music pieces used in the first season were composed later than 1813, the year the first season was set in. Examples include Dmitri Shostakovich's Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2, which was written in 1938, and \"Belle nuit, \u00f4 nuit d'amour\" from Jacques Offenbach's 1881 opera The Tales of Hoffmann."

Tecteun, a space explorer, found a \"timeless child\" with the capacity to regenerate. She adopted the child and studied her, successfully grafting her regeneration capacity into the Shobogans, transforming them into Time Lords; they chose to limit a Time Lord's regenerations to twelve. The Master reveals that the Doctor is the \"timeless child\". Tecteun and the child were inducted into a clandestine organisation called the Division, the details of which were redacted from the Matrix. The Doctor's memories were subsequently erased, prior to the childhood she remembers; only snippets remain, masked as the story of the Irish Garda Brendan. With the Doctor trapped in the Matrix, the Master lures Ashad to Gallifrey and shrinks him with his tissue compression eliminator, taking the Cyberium. With its knowledge and the bodies of the Time Lords he had killed on his arrival to Gallifrey, the Master creates a race of regenerating Cybermen, aiming to use them to take over the universe. In the Matrix, a vision of the previously unseen Doctor restores the Doctor\u2019s belief in herself. The Doctor escapes by overloading the Matrix with all of her memories from her past incarnations. On board the Cyber-carrier, Bescot is killed, while Yaz and Graham successfully hide from the invading Cybermen in empty Cyber-armor. They subsequently save the lives of Ryan, Ethan, and Ko Sharmus from Cybermen forces sent to the planet by Ashad. The group gather and agree to go through the portal to Gallifrey. The Doctor regroups with her companions, and discovers Ashad's miniaturized body contains a \"Death Particle\" capable of destroying all organic life on a planet. The Doctor and her friends blow up the Cyber-carrier, destroying Ashad's army in the process and foiling his plot to rebuild the Cyber-Empire. Finding unused TARDISes, she programs one to take her allies home. The Doctor takes one of Ko Sharmus' explosives to set off the particle. She is unable to trigger it when goaded by the Master, but Ko Sharmus appears and takes it, as penance for failing to suitably hide the Cyberium. The Doctor escapes in another TARDIS as the explosion consumes Gallifrey. The Doctor's allies arrive on contemporary Earth in their TARDIS. The Doctor lands the other TARDIS near her own, but as she prepares to take off, she is arrested by the Judoon and teleported to a prison located inside an asteroid."

DiMarco cited the inspiration for the series to be conversations with friends while attending Gallaudet about a reality television show reflecting their unique college experience. He said that while on spring break students from elsewhere were interested in partying with him and his friends and learning about deaf culture and sign language. During the development process, the casting department cast students who had strong Deaf identities. DiMarco also encouraged casting students who did not have a strong Deaf identity growing up so different stories could be told and compared. He said with the final cast, \"They knew that it was going to be on Netflix, but they weren't sure if this was something that would really tell their story. They were worried that the show could potentially cause them some harm in the future.\" One of the students, Daequan, hesitated to be involved with the series, not feeling \"deaf enough\", but DiMarco said he found Daequan's story pertinent to include. Variety reported one of the producers, Naimah Holmes, sharing \"that it was a challenge for the creative team to find students who were willing to both spare their time and be vulnerable in front of the camera\". On the lack of black women in the cast, she said the crew did not want to force that \"into the group based on need for diversity as a token\" and hoped to feature more women of color if a second season was greenlighted. Deaf U was produced by Hot Snakes Media. Eric Evangelista and Shannon Evangelista from Hot Snakes served as executive producers alongside  DiMarco and Brandon Panaligan. DiMarco said he intended that a significant portion of the crew be deaf, aiming for 30%, and said that the final portion turned out to be an unprecedented 50%.

TV Guides Megan Vick said Deaf U is \"an immediately engaging series thanks to the excellent casting\" and compared the docuseries to Netflix's Cheer and Love on the Spectrum. Vick commended Deaf U in how it \"expertly balances unscripted hallmarks... with heart\". The critic summarized, \"The hook of Deaf U is obviously the inside look at how a community has created a rich and dynamic culture with an identity that the outside world has often only considered a disability, and the show delivers on that front. The reason to stay though is that the true value of the show is in getting to know these students as the beautiful work-in-progresses that they are and get invested in who they are aiming to become.\" Inkoo Kang of The Hollywood Reporter said Deaf U was \"more impressive as a representational leap than as a reality series\". Kang did not find the series \"particularly involving\" beyond \"the discussion of deaf politics and culture\". The critic noted, \"The heavy focus on demographic diversity \u2014 and the Elite girls \u2014 does render the near-complete lack of women of color rather conspicuous.\" Kang found the episodes too short to explore potentially \"ambitious material\", \"never quite delivering on emotional impact or entertainment value\". The critic summarized, \"Deaf U illustrates aplenty that deaf kids can be hornily confused, too. But more context would have made its representational milestones more satisfying.\" Aaron Barnhart, reviewing for Primetimer, said Deaf U \"will strike you at first as exceedingly trivial, another MTV-style docuseries about sex and drinking among collegiates\". Barnhart said, \"I think the program's overarching interest in its subjects' sex lives \u2014 rather than their academic pursuits and life goals \u2014 will strike many as the exact opposite of a deep or layered treatment.\" He found Deaf U to have \"intriguing characters, and fascinating exploration of deaf subculture \u2014 albeit one that doesn't exactly cast deaf people in a very favorable light \u2014 is a worthwhile drive-by docuseries\". NPR's Eric Deggans described Deaf U as \"a series whose rebelliousness is embodied in the wordplay of its title, shines most when it shows how typical challenges college students face are amplified by the unique contours of Deaf culture\". The critic said, \"'Deaf U' deftly explores these gossipy coming-of-age challenges - how to be true to yourself without hurting others, how to bring something new into your life, like hearing aids or cochlear implants, without being judged by those who see such changes as turning away from your identity as a Deaf person.\" Deggans said he was generally cynical about docuseries as reductionist and concluded, \"But if the moments shown in 'Deaf U' are true, it's a fascinating look at a community rarely seen with such depth and humanity on television.\""

        "content": "At the Australian Wildlife Park in Sydney, zookeeper Chaz Hunt has a show that demonstrates scary and deadly animals. Maddie, a venomous inland taipan, appears regularly at the show, but is greatly feared by the public, much to her dismay. She is supported by Jackie, a motherly saltwater crocodile, who tells her and her three best friends \u2014Frank, a funnel-web spider, Zoe, a thorny devil, and Nigel, a marbled scorpion\u2014 about the Outback, a place recognizable with three mountains where creatures like them belong. One day, after an incident involving Jackie and Chazzie, the zookeeper's son, Jackie is removed from the zoo. Saddened, Maddie remembers what Jackie told them about the Outback and decides to escape. During the escape, Pretty Boy, a cute and popular but arrogant koala, tries to alert the park's security, but is paralyzed by Nigel. Reluctantly, they decide to take him with them. While crossing Sydney Harbour, they run into Jacinta, a great white shark, who is part of the Ugly Secret Society (USS) where animals considered \"monsters\" help each other upon hearing a password. When they reach Circular Quay, Pretty Boy tries to get the attention of the city for rescue, but finds that the world believe he is dead and his popularity has been taken by a quokka, convincing him to tag along with them in the journey. At a school in the outer suburbs, they get a ride on an excursion bus that takes them to the Blue Mountains. Chaz and Chazzie catch up and have the bus pulled over to search the vehicle for the creatures, but a girl allows them to escape. Just after Pretty Boy goes on a tirade about how Maddie and the other creatures ruined his life, Chaz ambushes them and almost sedates Maddie, but Pretty Boy says the USS password, which alerts some Tasmanian devils to their presence. After the animals escape, Chaz reveals to Chazzie that his adventurous and Aussie wildlife expert history was all a lie and he only moved from Florida to Australia after being inspired by television shows featuring Australian zookeepers. He decides to make it up to Chazzie by really going after the animals and bringing them back to the park, though Chazzie is no longer sure about the mission. Over the next few days, the animals are helped by many creatures of the USS on their way to the Outback, while Pretty Boy bonds more with the creatures. One night, Maddie sings a lullaby that was her only memory of her mother: she was washed out of the nest as an egg by a flood and was found on the road by Chaz. Pretty Boy reveals that he was also orphaned, with his mother being killed by a moving car. The next day, Pretty Boy finds a tree of koalas and leaves the other creatures. Eventually, Maddie and the others reach the three mountains. Not long after they arrive, Chaz rounds up and captures Frank, Zoe, and Nigel. Chazzie runs into Maddie and is initially scared of her, but warms up to her upon seeing that she is just as scared as he is of her. Chaz captures Maddie as well and places the creatures in boxes in the back of a truck, but Chazzie sets Maddie free without his father looking. Maddie tries to get the animals of the land to help her rescue them, but they initially refuse due to the fact none of them have ever left before. However, Pretty Boy, having found life with the other koalas not as great as he thought, returns to join her in a rescue. Using a fire truck, they catch up to the truck and break them out. When Maddie, Pretty Boy, and the other creatures save Chazzie from falling over the edge of a canyon, Chaz fully sees that these creatures as heroes rather than dangers and decides to let them return to the wild. At the three mountains, they reunite with Jackie, who is revealed to have escaped and started the USS and join the life in the Outback."

In an interview with TheWrap, Cripps said that Larrikins had \"focused on the cute animals, and so I didn't want to go back down that same road, I went to the dark side.\" Clare Knight, whose previous animated film experience includes her work as Lead Editor of the Kung Fu Panda franchise, said \"A lot of executives would say to us, 'A snake? Snakes aren't huggable. Does your lead have to be a snake?' And it was a challenge for us that we really wanted to make these animals appealing.\" Initially, while Netflix was concerned about the \"huggability of the animal cast\", both Knight and Cripps said that working for the streaming giant's animation unit was positively heavenly. \"It's been great. Again, we're first-time directors, so Netflix is willing to give us a shot and give us a voice, so we really feel great. We would've felt if this was DreamWorks, we possibly would've been pigeonholed as writer and editor and not necessarily been given this chance. And the fact that we reached such a big, global audience with this great depiction of Australia I think, is a wonderful thing for us.\""
