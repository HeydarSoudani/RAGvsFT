        "content": "}}Evil Dead II (also known in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi. It is a sequel to the 1981 horror film The Evil Dead. The film is written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel. Evil Dead II was produced by Robert Tapert and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who vacations with his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods. He discovers an audio tape of recitations from a book of ancient texts, and when the recording is played, it unleashes a number of demons which possess and torment him. After the critical and commercial failure of Crimewave (1985), Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell began work on a sequel to The Evil Dead at the insistence of their publicist Irvin Shapiro. Having endorsed the original film, author Stephen King brought the project to the attention of producer Dino De Laurentiis, with whom he had been making his directorial debut Maximum Overdrive (1986); De Laurentiis agreed to provide financial backing, and assigned the filmmakers a considerably larger budget than they had worked with on the original film. Although Raimi had devised a premise set in the Middle Ages and involving time travel, De Laurentiis requested that the film be similar to its predecessor.Evil Dead II was shot in Wadesboro, North Carolina and Detroit, Michigan in 1986, and featured extensive stop-motion animation and prosthetic makeup effects created by a team of artists that included Mark Shostrom, Greg Nicotero, Robert Kurtzman and Tom Sullivan, the latter of whom returned from the original film. The finished film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987; due to its high level of violence, it was released through a pseudonymous distributor to curb an anticipated X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Like The Evil Dead, it was widely acclaimed by critics, with praise being reserved for its humor, Raimi's direction and Campbell's performance. Despite being given a somewhat limited release, it was a minor box office success, grossing just under $6 million in the US alone. As with the first film, Evil Dead II has accumulated a large, international cult following. A direct sequel utilizing Raimi's original premise, Army of Darkness, followed in 1992. It was later followed by a soft reboot and continuation, Evil Dead, which was released in 2013, and a television series, Ash vs Evil Dead, which aired from 2015 to 2018."

        "content": "Ash Williams and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of archaeologist Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Book of the Dead, Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force (also known as the Kandarian Demon) that kills and later possesses Linda, turning her into a \"deadite\". Ash is then forced to decapitate her with a shovel and bury her near the cabin. At dawn, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. He briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the force is gone, and he returns to normal. He attempts to flee the area, but finds that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. The spirit chases him back to the cabin where Linda's revived head attacks him, biting his hand. He brings her head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw, but he overpowers and slashes the deadite Linda to death. His right hand becomes possessed and tries to kill him, and he severs it with his chainsaw before attempting to shoot it with a shotgun, but the hand mocks him and ultimately escapes. Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the Necronomicon, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist locals Jake and Bobby Joe to find another route to the cabin, where they find an embattled Ash and, mistakenly concluding that he murdered the Knowbys, lock him in the cellar. The four new arrivals listen to a recording of Knowby detailing that his wife Henrietta was possessed by the Kandarian Demon, and that he killed her and buried her in the cellar. Henrietta, now a deadite, possesses Ed; Ash dismembers him with an axe. Bobby Joe attempts escape but the demon trees attack and drag her to her death. Annie translates two of the Necronomicons pages before Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, forcing them at gunpoint to find Bobby Joe. Ash becomes possessed once again and incapacitates Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake (mistaking him for the possessed Ash) and drags him to the cellar door, where Henrietta kills him. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self upon seeing Linda's necklace. With Annie's help, Ash modifies the chainsaw and attaches it to the stump where his right hand had been. After finding the missing pages of the Necronomicon in the cellar, Ash kills Henrietta. The trees outside begin to destroy the cabin. Annie reveals that she has only read the first half of the incantation. The woods attack the house as Annie starts to read the second half. As she reads it, Ash's severed hand uses the Kandarian dagger to stab her in the back. She falls to the floor and manages to complete the incantation before succumbing to her wound. The incantation opens up a whirling temporal vortex/portal which not only draws in the demon, but also nearby trees along with Ash and his Oldsmobile Delta 88. Ash and his Oldsmobile land in the Middle Ages. A group of knights confront him and initially mistake him for a deadite, but are quickly distracted when a real harpy-like deadite appears. Ash blasts it with his shotgun and they hail him as a hero who has come to save them, causing him to break down and scream in anguish."

        "content": "The concept of a sequel to The Evil Dead was discussed during location shooting on the first film; Irvin Shapiro, the film's publicist, pushed writer/director Sam Raimi to devise a premise for such a film. Working with screenwriter Sheldon Lettich, Raimi settled on a story in which Ash was sucked through a time portal to the Middle Ages, where he would encounter more deadites. Shapiro loved the concept, and in May 1984 took out advertisements in trade magazines to promote the project, then titled Evil Dead II: Evil Dead and the Army of Darkness. After Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox passed on it, the sequel was shelved in favor of Raimi's next film, Crimewave (1985), a comedy/crime film co-written with Joel and Ethan Coen. After Crimewave was released to critical and audience disinterest, Raimi and his partners at Renaissance Pictures, producer Robert Tapert and actor/co-producer Bruce Campbell, took Shapiro up on his sequel offer, knowing that another flop would further stall their already-lagging careers. Development of Evil Dead II initially began in collaboration with Embassy Pictures, which had co-financed and distributed Crimewave, but the filmmakers eventually felt that they were being stalled after five months' pre-production work, and began conducting interviews with prospective cast and crew members. Around this time, producer Dino De Laurentiis, the owner of production and distribution company De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG), asked Raimi if he would be interested in directing an adaptation of the Stephen King novel Thinner. Raimi turned down the offer, but De Laurentiis remained in touch with the young filmmaker. The Thinner adaptation was part of a deal between De Laurentiis and King to produce several adaptations of King's successful horror novels and short stories. At the time, King was directing the first such adaptation, Maximum Overdrive (1986), based on his short story \"Trucks\". He had dinner with a crew member who had been among those interviewed by Raimi and his colleagues about Evil Dead II, and told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a glowing review of the first film that helped it become an audience favorite at Cannes, called De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film. Although initially skeptical, De Laurentiis met with Renaissance, who highlighted the first film's extremely high revenue in the Italian market. Within twenty minutes, De Laurentiis agreed to finance Evil Dead II for $3.6 million. Raimi and Tapert had desired $4 million for the production, but De Laurentiis requested a film that was similar to its predecessor instead of their original medieval-themed proposal, which was instead used for the second sequel, Army of Darkness (1992)."

        "content": "Though they had only recently received the funding necessary to produce the film, the script had been written for some time, having been composed largely during the production of Crimewave. Raimi contacted his old friend Scott Spiegel, who had collaborated with Campbell and others on the Super 8 mm films they had produced during their childhood in Michigan. Most of these films had been comedies, and Spiegel felt that Evil Dead II should be less straight horror than the first. Initially, the opening sequence included all five of the original film's characters; however, in an effort to save time and money, all but Ash and Linda were cut from the final draft. The film went through several other drafts, including a group of escaped convicts holding Ash captive in the cabin while searching for buried treasure. Spiegel and Raimi wrote most of the film in their house in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California, where they were living with the aforementioned Coen brothers, as well as actors Frances McDormand, Kathy Bates, and Holly Hunter (Hunter was the primary inspiration for the Bobby Jo character). Due both to the distractions of their house guests and the films they were involved with, Crimewave and Josh Becker's Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except, the script took a long time to finish. Among the film's many inspirations include The Three Stooges and other slapstick comedy films; Ash's fights with his disembodied hand come from a film made by Spiegel as a teenager, entitled Attack of the Helping Hand, which was itself inspired by television commercials advertising Hamburger Helper. The \"laughing room\" scene, where all the objects in the room seemingly come to life and begin to cackle maniacally along with Ash, came about after Spiegel jokingly used a gooseneck lamp to visually demonstrate a Popeye-esque laugh. Spiegel's humorous influence can be seen throughout the film, perhaps most prominently in certain visual jokes; for instance, when Ash traps his rogue hand under a pile of books, on top is A Farewell to Arms. While Raimi and Campbell have stated that Evil Dead 2 was intended as a direct sequel, there are differences between the first movie and the recap at the beginning of the second: for example, the Necronomicon is destroyed in a fire by Ash during the conclusion of The Evil Dead yet remains intact in Evil Dead 2. The corpses of Ash's friends from the first movie are absent, and they are never mentioned. The cabin itself remains perfectly intact until the events of this film despite much of it having been destroyed in the original film."

        "content": "With the script completed, and a production company secured, principal photography began. The production commenced in Wadesboro, North Carolina, not far from De Laurentiis' offices in Wilmington. De Laurentiis had wanted them to film in his elaborate Wilmington studio, but the production team felt uneasy being so close to the producer, so they moved to Wadesboro, approximately three hours away. Steven Spielberg had previously filmed The Color Purple in Wadesboro, and the large white farmhouse used as an exterior location in that film became the production office for Evil Dead II. Most of the film was shot in the woods near that farmhouse, or J.R. Faison Junior High School, which is where the interior cabin set was located. The film's production was not nearly as chaotic or strange as the original film's production, largely because of Raimi, Tapert and Campbell's additional film making experience. However, there are nevertheless numerous stories about the strange happenings on the set. For instance, the rat seen in the cellar was nicknamed \"Se\u00f1or Cojones\" by the crew (\"cojones\" is Spanish slang for \"testicles\"). Even so, there were hardships, mostly involving Ted Raimi's costume. Ted, director Sam's younger brother, had been briefly involved in the first film, acting as a fake Shemp, but in Evil Dead II he gets the larger role of the historian's demonically-possessed wife, Henrietta. Raimi was forced to wear a full-body, latex costume, crouch in a small hole in the floor acting as a \"cellar\", or on one day, both. Raimi became extremely overheated, to the point that his costume was literally filled with liters of sweat; special effects artist Gregory Nicotero describes pouring the fluid into several Dixie cups so as to get it out of the costume. The sweat is also visible on-screen, dripping out of the costume's ear, in the scene where Henrietta spins around over Annie's head. The crew sneaked various in-jokes into the film itself, such as the clawed glove of Freddy Krueger (the primary antagonist of Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street series of slasher films) which hangs in the cabin's basement and tool shed. This was, at least partially, a reference to a scene in the original A Nightmare on Elm Street where the character Nancy Thompson (portrayed by Heather Langenkamp) dozes off watching the original Evil Dead on a television set in her room. In turn, that scene was a reference to the torn The Hills Have Eyes poster seen in the original Evil Dead film, which was itself a reference to a torn Jaws poster in The Hills Have Eyes. The real life clawed glove appearing in Evil Dead II has been attributed to Mark Shostrom, who was also working on A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors at around the same time as Evil Dead II, suggesting he borrowed it from the Dream Warriors set for a day. At the film's wrap party, the crew held a talent contest, where Raimi and Campbell sang The Byrds' \"Eight Miles High\", with Nicotero on guitar."

        "content": "Like the original film, Evil Dead II had censorship difficulties due to its high level of violence. As DEG was a signatory to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), Raimi was contractually obliged to shoot the film with the intention of it earning an R rating. Upon reviewing the completed film, DEG's executives felt that Evil Dead II would almost certainly receive an X rating, thereby limiting its commercial prospects. Lawrence Gleason, the company's president of marketing and distribution, felt that if it were to be cut for an R, the film \"would have been about 62 minutes long\" and that both Raimi's vision and the audience's enjoyment would have been sabotaged as a result. Ultimately, DEG decided not to submit Evil Dead II to the MPAA for review or be credited onscreen for their involvement in it. Instead, a shell company run by De Laurentiis' son-in-law Alex De Benedetti, Rosebud Releasing Corporation, was set up to handle the film's US release, allowing it to be shown unrated. Although Rosebud technically did not have a distribution network, DEG had already booked the film in 340 cinemas across the country, and had created and paid for the film's advertising campaign. Rosebud's logo, a rose blooming in time-lapse photography against a painted sky backdrop, was designed and shot by Raimi himself."

The site's consensus reads: \"Evil Dead 2s increased special effects and slapstick-gore makes it as good \u2013 if not better \u2013 than the original.\" On the similar website Metacritic, it holds a score of 69 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Empire magazine praised the film, saying \"the gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel uses every trick in the cinematic book\" and confirms that \"Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods\". Caryn James of The New York Times called it \"genuine, if bizarre, proof of Sam Raimi's talent and developing skill.\" Leonard Maltin originally rated the film with two stars, but later increased the rating to three stars. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"a fairly sophisticated satire, that makes you want to get up and shuffle.\" He praised the film's sense of surrealism, comedic timing, and \"grubby, low-budget intensity.\" Ebert states that \"if you know it's all special effects, and if you've seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at Evil Dead 2.\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post wrapped up his review stating that \"the acting is straight out of '50s B-movies. The exposition is clumsy, the sound track corny, the denouement silly. Then again, who said bad taste was easy?\" Conversely, Pat Graham of Chicago Reader disliked the mix of horror and comedy, writing in his review that \"The pop-up humor and smirkiness suggest Raimi's aspiring to the fashionable company of the brothers Coen, though on the basis of this strained effort I'd say he's overshot the mark.\"Entertainment Weekly ranked the film #19 on their list of the \"Top 50 Cult Films\".Sight and Sound ranked it #34 on their 50 Funniest Films of All Time list. In 2008, Empire magazine included Evil Dead II on their list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, ranked #49. J.C. Ma\u00e7ek III of PopMatters wrote, \"Equal parts remake and sequel, the second film brought back Bruce Campbell as Ash and was every bit as gory and horrific as the first film with more tree rape and dismemberment and blood splatters than ever. On the other hand, Evil Dead II is also an absolutely hilarious and uproarious intentional comedy.\" In 2016, James Charisma of Playboy ranked the film #12 on a list of 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals."

The film tells the story of two victims of traumatic childhoods who become lovers and mass murderers, and are irresponsibly glorified by the mass media. The film is based on an original screenplay by Quentin Tarantino that was heavily revised by Stone, writer David Veloz, and associate producer Richard Rutowski. Tarantino received a story credit though he subsequently disowned the film. Jane Hamsher, Don Murphy, and Clayton Townsend produced the film, with Arnon Milchan, Thom Mount, and Stone as executive producers. The film was released on August 26, 1994 in the United States, and screened at the Venice Film Festival on August 29, 1994. It was a box office success, grossing $110 million against a production budget of $34 million, but received a mixed critical reception. Some critics praised the plot, acting, humor, and combination of action and romance, while others found the film overly violent and graphic. Notorious for its violent content and inspiring \"copycat\" crimes, the film was named the eighth most controversial film in history by Entertainment Weekly in 2006."

        "content": "Mickey Knox and his wife Mallory stop at a diner in the New Mexico desert. A duo of rednecks arrive and begin sexually harassing Mallory as she dances by a jukebox. She initially encourages it before beating one of the men viciously. Mickey joins her, and the couple murder everyone in the diner, save one customer, to whom they proudly declare their names before leaving. The couple camp in the desert, and Mallory reminisces about how she met Mickey, a meat deliveryman who serviced her family's household. After a whirlwind romance, the couple had murdered Mallory's sexually abusive father and neglectful mother before having an unofficial marriage ceremony on a bridge. Later, Mickey and Mallory hold a woman hostage in their hotel room. Angered by Mickey's desire for a threesome, Mallory leaves, and Mickey rapes the hostage. Mallory drives to a nearby gas station, where she flirts with a mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but after Mallory suffers a flashback of being raped by her father and the mechanic recognizes her as a wanted murderer, Mallory kills him. The pair continue their killing spree, ultimately claiming 52 victims in New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada. Pursuing them is detective Jack Scagnetti, who became obsessed with mass murderers at the age of eight after having witnessed the murder of his mother at the hand of Charles Whitman. Beneath his heroic fa\u00e7ade, he is also a violent psychopath and has murdered prostitutes in his past. Following the pair's murder spree is self-serving tabloid journalist Wayne Gale, who profiles them on his show American Maniacs, soon elevating them to cult-hero status. Mickey and Mallory become lost in the desert after taking psychedelic mushrooms, and they stumble upon a ranch owned by Warren Red Cloud, a Navajo man who provides them food and shelter. As Mickey and Mallory sleep, Warren, sensing evil in the couple, attempts to exorcise the demon that he perceives in Mickey, chanting over him as he sleeps. Mickey, who has nightmares of his abusive parents, awakens during the exorcism and shoots Warren to death. As the couple flee, they feel inexplicably guilty and come across a giant field of rattlesnakes, where they are badly bitten. They reach a drugstore to purchase snakebite antidote, but the store is sold out. A pharmacist recognizes the couple and triggers an alarm before Mickey kills him. Police arrive shortly after and accost the couple and a shootout ensues. The police end the showdown by beating the couple while a news crew films the action. One year later, the imprisoned Mickey and Mallory are thought to be criminally insane and are scheduled to be transferred to psychiatric hospitals, with Scagnetti overseeing their transfer. Warden Dwight McClusky tells Scagnetti that he should kill the Knoxes during their transfer and claim that they had tried to escape. Meanwhile, Gale has persuaded Mickey to submit to a live interview that will air after the Super Bowl. During the interview, Mickey declares himself a \"natural born killer,\" inspiring the other inmates to start a prison riot. After McClusky terminates the interview, Mickey is left alone with Gale, the film crew and several guards. He manages to overpower a guard and kill most of the people in the room, taking Gale and several others hostage. Gale and his crew give a live television report that profiles the riot. Meanwhile, when Scagnetti attempts to seduce Mallory in her cell, she beats him viciously before another guard subdues her with tear gas. Mickey and Gale reach Mallory's cell, where Mickey kills the guards and engages in a Mexican standoff with Scagnetti before Mallory murders him. Gale's entire television crew is killed trying to escape the riot, while Gale himself begins indulging in violence, shooting at prison guards. Mickey and Mallory steal a van and escape into the woods with Gale, to whom they give a final interview before declaring that he must die. He attempts various arguments to change their minds, appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one survivor. Mickey informs him that they are leaving a witness to tell the tale: his camera. Gale accepts his fate and is shot to death. Unbeknownst to the three, the entire exchange is transmitted to a horrified news anchor through Gale's in-ear microphone. Several years later, Mickey and Mallory, still fugitives, travel in an RV, as a pregnant Mallory watches their two children play."

        "content": "One of the central themes of Natural Born Killers is the relationship between real-life violence and the mass media's coverage of it. This thematic preoccupation was declared in the film's promotional materials, with its theatrical poster advertising it as a \"bold new film that takes a look at a country seduced by fame, obsessed by crime, and consumed by the media.\" The character of Wayne Gale, the television host of American Maniacs, functions in the film as a figurehead of lurid true crime television documentaries, which recycle real-life incidents of violence and criminal activity into entertainment for the general public. On several occasions, expressionistic jump cuts featuring Gale as a blood-soaked Satan are interspersed into the film, which Muir suggests emphasizes the film's assertion that mass media and crime mutually reinforce one another. Media representation of the nuclear family has been identified as another theme in the film, particularly with the depiction of Mallory's dysfunctional family life, which includes a neglectful mother and a sexually abusive father. Muir notes that the sequence depicting Mallory's home life\u2014presented as a television sitcom with the title I Love Mallory (a parody of I Love Lucy)\u2014charts \"the colossal gulf between the imagery sold to America regarding family life and the truth, for many Americans, of such family life in the 1990s.\" The \"sitcom\" representation of Mallory's household results in a visual dichotomy between her \"life as she imagined it should be (replete with an oppressive laugh track eradicating any scary sense of ambiguity)\" and the \"grim truth of it.\" Ian Cooper wrote that Mickey Knox's prison interview \"parodies Geraldo Rivera's jailhouse interview with [Charles] Manson.\""

        "content": "Natural Born Killers was based on a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino, in which a married couple suddenly decide to go on a killing spree. Tarantino had sold an option for his script to producers Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy for $10,000 after he had tried, and failed, to direct it himself for $500,000. Hamsher and Murphy subsequently sold the screenplay to Warner Bros. Around the same time, Oliver Stone was made aware of the script. He was keen to find something more straightforward than his previous production, Heaven & Earth (1993), a difficult shoot which had left him exhausted. David Veloz, associate producer Richard Rutowski, and Stone rewrote Tarantino's script, keeping much of the dialogue but changing the focus of the film from journalist Wayne Gale to Mickey and Mallory. The script was revised so drastically that Tarantino was credited for the story only. In a 1993 interview, Tarantino stated that he did not hold any animosity towards Stone, and that he wished the film well. Initially, when producers Hamsher and Murphy had first brought the script to Stone's attention, he had envisioned it as an action film; \"something Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud of.\" As the project developed however, incidents such as the O. J. Simpson case, the Menendez brothers case, the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident, the Rodney King incident, and the Federal assault of the Branch Davidian sect all took place. Stone came to feel that the media was heavily involved in the outcome of all of these cases, and that the media had become an all-pervasive entity which marketed violence and suffering for the good of ratings. As such, he changed the tone of the film from one of purely action to a \"vicious, coldhearted farce\" on the media. Coloring Stone's approach to the material, and contributing to the violent nature of the film, were the anger and sadness he felt at the breakdown of his second marriage. He also said in an interview that the film was influenced by the \"vitality\" of Indian cinema."

        "content": "Stone cast Woody Harrelson partly because, \"frankly, he had that American, trashy look. There's something about Woody that evokes Kentucky or white trash.\" At the time, Harrelson was primarily known for his comedic performances, namely his role on the sitcom Cheers, and Stone was compelled to cast him against type. Stone cast Lewis for similar reason, noting that, despite her success as portraying a defiled teenage daughter in Cape Fear (1991), he felt she could \"pull off white trash, too. Juliette has malice in her eyes. She's got adorable eyes, but they jump and they gleam. I just felt they [were both] right. They didn't feel like they were upper-class people.\" Stone tried to convince Lewis to gain muscle mass for her role as Mallory so that she looked tougher, but she refused, saying she wanted the character to look like a pushover, not a bodybuilder. Robert Downey Jr. was cast as Wayne Gale, the reporter chronicling the Knoxes; Downey prepared for his role as reporter Wayne Gale by spending time with Australian TV shock-king Steve Dunleavy, and later convinced Stone to allow him to portray Gale with an Australian accent. Tom Sizemore was cast as Detective Jack Scagnetti, the psychotic police officer with murderous impulses himself, while Tommy Lee Jones was cast as Dwight McClusky, a prison warden who appears in the last act of the film. Rodney Dangerfield, primarily known as a stand-up comedian, portrayed Mallory's rapist father, and was allowed by Stone to rewrite all of his own character's lines."

        "content": "Principal photography took 56 days to shoot. Filming locations included the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge just west of Taos, New Mexico, where the wedding scene was filmed, and Stateville Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois, where the prison riot was filmed. In Stateville, 80% of the prisoners are incarcerated for violent crimes. For the first two weeks on location at the prison, the extras were actual inmates with rubber weapons. For the subsequent two weeks, 200 extras were needed because the Stateville inmates were on lockdown. According to Tom Sizemore, during filming on the prison set, Stone would play African tribal music at full blast between takes to keep the frantic energy up. While shooting the POV scene wherein Mallory runs into the wire mesh, director of photography Robert Richardson broke his finger and the replacement cameraman cut his eye. According to Oliver Stone, he was not popular with the camera department on set that day. For the scenes involving rear projection, the projected footage was shot prior to principal photography, then edited together, and projected onto the stage, behind the live actors. For example, when Mallory drives past a building and flames are projected onto the wall, this was shot live using footage projected onto the facade of a real building. An alternate ending was filmed but not used, in which Mickey and Mallory are shot dead by Arliss Howard's character. Stone decided against using this ending because he believed \"the 1990s were a time when the bad guys got away with it\". The famous Coca-Cola polar bear ad is seen twice during the film. According to Stone, Coca-Cola approved the use of the ad without having a full idea of what the film was about. When they saw the completed film, they were furious."

        "content": "Natural Born Killers was filmed and edited in a frenzied and psychedelic style and features both color and black and white cinematography, as well as animation (directed by Mike Smith), and other unusual color schemes and visual compositions. Editing of the film lasted  approximately 11 months, with the final film containing almost 3,000 cuts (most films have 600\u2013700). The film also employs a wide range of camera angles, featuring Dutch tilts prominently throughout, with the camera rarely angling along a horizontal field of vision. Film scholar Robert Kolker notes that the Dutch angle's employment in the film is \"the visual equivalent of a profound dislocation, a loss of object constancy, the slipperiness of subjectivity itself.\" Kolker comments that, unlike such films as Bonnie and Clyde from which Natural Born Killers draws influence, \"from the very beginning...\u00a0 the viewer is forced into a dual situation, neither one of which allows easy access to the main characters. One situation, continued throughout the film, is a kind of rhythmic attention created by a startling flow of images. Stone builds his visuals on unexpected linkages and disorienting juxtapositions within the shots and edits.\" Because the film is thematically preoccupied with media, Stone sought to implement visual elements of popular television into the film's visual tableau: \"It had never quite been done before\u00a0\u2013 a mixture of stocks and styles. I was influenced, I have to say, by MTV and some of the styles I saw in the early '80s and '90s on television. But no one had tried that style over the course of 90, 100 minutes.\" Commercials which were commonly on the air at the time of the film's release make brief, intermittent appearances as well. Concurrent with Stone's preoccupation with television as both a visual and thematic reference point, portions of the film are narrated through parodies of popular television series, including a sequence presented in the style of a sitcom about Mallory's dysfunctional family (titled I Love Mallory), a parody of I Love Lucy. In the film's final montage, splices of real-life television news coverage of various criminal cases of the time are included, such as the O. J. Simpson case, the Menendez brothers, and the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident. Film scholar John Kenneth Muir notes this inclusion as an \"exclamation point\" concluding the film's thesis: \"It seems to say, 'Welcome to the tabloid-TV culture of America in the 1990s, where crime pays and pays well.'\""

It grossed an estimated $60 million internationally for a worldwide total of $110 million against its $34 million budget. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 49% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Natural Born Killers explodes off the screen with style, but its satire is too blunt to offer any fresh insight into celebrity or crime \u2013 pummeling the audience with depravity until the effect becomes deadening.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average weighted score of 74 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, \"Seeing this movie once is not enough. The first time is for the visceral experience, the second time is for the meaning.\" On his television show, his partner Gene Siskel agreed with him, adding extra praise to the scene featuring Rodney Dangerfield."

        "content": "Other critics found the film unsuccessful in its aims. Much of the criticism centered around the perception that the film was not effective as a satire and its message was muddled. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \"While 'Natural Born Killers' affects occasional disgust at the lurid world of Mickey and Mallory, it more often seems enamored of their exhilarating freedom. If there is a juncture at which these caricatures start looking like nihilist heroes, then the film passes that point many times.\" Hal Hinson of The Washington Post voiced a similar concern, saying \"'Killers' is intended as a gonzo critique of the mass media and, by extension, of the bloodthirsty legions of couch potatoes whose prurient taste guarantees that the garbage rises to the top of the charts. But the film doesn't make it as a piece of social criticism. Primarily this is because the movie's jittery, psychedelic style is so obviously a kick for Stone to orchestrate. Bloody, pulpy excess is his thing; it's what he does best.\u201d Hinson noted the film also loses its \"symbolic footing\" when it transitions into a prison film. Some critics felt the film's focus on the mass media as the main culprit of society's ills rang hollow, or the film did not adequately hold the characters of Mickey and Mallory accountable for their actions. Maslin continued, \"for all its surface passions, Natural Born Killers never digs deep enough to touch the madness of such events, or even to send them up in any surprising way. Mr. Stone's vision is impassioned, alarming, visually inventive, characteristically overpowering. But it's no match for the awful truth.\" James Berardinelli gave the film a negative review but his criticism was different from many other such pans, which generally said that Oliver Stone was a hypocrite for making an ultra-violent film in the guise of a critique of American attitudes. Berardinelli noted that the movie \"hits the bullseye\" as a satire of America's lust for bloodshed, but repeated Stone's main point so often and so loudly that it became unbearable. Stone got in trouble with the Native American community for the use of Russel Means. At the 1994 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, Harrelson was nominated for Worst Actor but lost to Bruce Willis for Color of Night and North. The film was nominated for Worst Picture but lost to North."

Bramesco wrote, \"With every public bloodbath [in the news today], discourse inches closer to accepting their root cause as a combination of lax gun laws and an undercurrent of psychosis endemic to those feeling marginalized from society. Stone\u2019s inquest may have been a shock to the system at the time, but his tracing of that psychosis back to the evils of television scans as borderline reactionary to present-day sensibilities.\" Bramesco also noted the film's inclusion of Native American mysticism into its plot felt like a \"white understanding of native culture.\" In contrast, critic Owen Gleiberman said the film still \"captures how our parasitical relationship to pop culture can magnify the cycle of violence...'Natural Born Killers' was the movie that glimpsed the looking glass we were passing through, the new psycho-metaphysical space we were living inside \u2014 the roller-coaster of images and advertisements, of entertainment and illusion, of demons that come up through fantasy and morph into daydreams, of vicarious violence that bleeds into real violence.\u201d"

        "content": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a 1974 American horror film produced and directed by Tobe Hooper from a story and screenplay by Hooper and Kim Henkel. It stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen, who respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor, and Leatherface. The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate; although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by the crimes of murderer Ed Gein, its plot is largely fictional. Hooper produced the film for less than $140,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, so that he could finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor, but it was eventually acquired by Louis Perano of Bryanston Distributing Company. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was banned in several countries, and numerous theaters stopped showing the film in response to complaints about its violence. While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics, it was highly profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office, equivalent with roughly over $150.8 million as of 2019, selling over 16.5 million tickets in 1974. It has since gained a reputation as one of the best and most influential horror films. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons, the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure, and the killing of victims. It led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, prequels, a remake, comic books and video games."

Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker, who talks about his family who worked at the old slaughterhouse. He borrows Franklin's pocket knife and cuts himself, then takes a single Polaroid picture of Franklin, for which he demands money. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo, and slashes Franklin's left arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refill their vehicle, but the proprietor tells them that the pumps are empty. They continue toward the homestead, intending to return to the gas station once it has received a fuel delivery. When they arrive, Franklin tells Kirk and Pam about a local swimming hole, and the couple go to find it. They stumble upon a nearby house, and Kirk calls out for gas, entering through the unlocked door, while Pam waits outside. Leatherface, a large mute man wearing a mask made from human skin, suddenly appears and kills Kirk with a hammer. Pam enters soon after and trips into a room filled with furniture made from human bones. She attempts to flee, but Leatherface catches her and impales her on a meathook, making her watch as he butchers Kirk with a chainsaw. Jerry heads out to look for Pam and Kirk at sunset. He sees the house and finds Pam, still alive, inside a freezer. Before he can react, Leatherface kills him. With darkness falling, Sally and Franklin set out to find their friends. As they near the neighboring house and call out, Leatherface lunges from the darkness and kills Franklin with a chainsaw. Sally runs toward the house and finds the desiccated remains of an elderly couple upstairs. She escapes from Leatherface by jumping through a second-floor window, and she flees to the gas station. The proprietor calms her with offers of help, but then he ties her up, gags her, and forces her into his truck. He drives to the house, arriving at the same time as the hitchhiker, now revealed as Leatherface's brother. The hitchhiker recognizes Sally and taunts her. The men torment the bound and gagged Sally while Leatherface, now dressed as a woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the hitchhiker bring down one of the desiccated bodies from upstairs, that of their Grandpa. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut on Sally's finger. They decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer, but he is too weak. In the ensuing struggle, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing truck. Leatherface attacks the truck with his chainsaw, and, when the driver stops to help, he knocks Leatherface down with a pipe wrench, causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes in the back of a passing pickup truck as Leatherface maniacally flails his chainsaw in the air in anger and defeat."

        "title": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_Development",
        "content": "The concept for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre arose in the early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an assistant film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on murderer Ed Gein, who committed his crimes in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991). During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface. Hooper has cited changes in the cultural and political landscape as central influences on the film. His intentional misinformation, that the \"film you are about to see is true\", was a response to being \"lied to by the government about things that were going on all over the world\", including Watergate, the 1973 oil crisis, and \"the massacres and atrocities in the Vietnam War\". The \"lack of sentimentality and the brutality of things\" that Hooper noticed while watching the local news, whose graphic coverage was epitomized by \"showing brains spilled all over the road\", led to his belief that \"man was the real monster here, just wearing a different face, so I put a literal mask on the monster in my film\". The idea of using a chainsaw as the murder weapon came to Hooper while he was in the hardware section of a busy store, contemplating how to speed his way through the crowd. Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the screenplay and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel as president and Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of the cast and crew that he would have to defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value."

Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her picture in the Austin American-Statesman. For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes. Icelandic-American actor Gunnar Hansen was selected for the role of Leatherface. He regarded Leatherface as having an intellectual disability and having never learned to speak properly. To research his character in preparation for his role, Hansen visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke. John Larroquette performed the narration in the opening credits."

        "content": "The primary filming location was an early 1900s farmhouse located on Quick Hill Road near Round Rock, Texas, where the La Frontera development is now located. The small budget and concerns over high-cost equipment rentals meant the crew filmed seven days a week, up to 16 hours a day. The environment was humid and the cast and crew found conditions tough; temperatures peaked at 110\u00b0F (43\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 26. Hansen later recalled, \"It was 95, 100 degrees every day during filming. They wouldn't wash my costume because they were worried that the laundry might lose it, or that it would change color. They didn't have enough money for a second costume. So I wore that [mask] 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for a month.\" The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was mainly shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera with fine-grain, low-speed film that required four times more light than modern digital cameras. Most of the filming took place in the farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house. The special effects were simple and limited by the budget. The on-screen blood was real in some cases, such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds \"Grandpa\". The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood to come out of its tube, so instead Burns's index finger was cut with a razor. Burns's costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was \"virtually solid\" by the last day of shooting. The scene in which Leatherface kills Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within  of Vail's face. A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim's head. Still, the shoot was somewhat dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury. He stated that \"everyone hated me by the end of the production\" and that \"it just took years for them to kind of cool off.\""

Sources differ on the film's final cost, offering figures between $93,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and $300,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted). A film production group, Pie in the Sky, partially led by future President of the Texas State Bar Joe K. Longley  provided $23,532 (about $ inflation-adjusted) in exchange for 19% of Vortex. This left Henkel, Hooper and the rest of the cast and crew with a 40.5% stake. Warren Skaaren, then head of the Texas Film Commission, helped secure the distribution deal with Bryanston Distributing Company. David Foster, who would later produce the 1982 horror film The Thing, arranged for a private screening for some of Bryanston's West Coast executives, and received 1.5% of Vortex's profits and a deferred fee of $500 (about $ inflation-adjusted). On August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston agreed to distribute the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, \"We made a deal with the devil, [sigh], and I guess that, in a way, we got what we deserved.\" They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),\u2014and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid\u2014only $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjusted) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits."

It screened nationally in the United States as a Saturday afternoon matin\u00e9e and its false marketing as a \"true story\" helped it attract a broad audience. For eight years after 1976, it was annually reissued to first-run theaters, promoted by full-page ads. The film eventually grossed more than $30 million in the United States and Canada ($14.4 million in rentals), making it the 12th highest-grossing film initially released in 1974, despite its minuscule budget. Among independent films, it was overtaken in 1978 by John Carpenter's Halloween, which grossed $47 million. Hooper reportedly hoped that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) would give the complete, uncut release print a \"PG\" rating due to its minimal amount of visible gore. Instead, it was originally rated \"X\". After several minutes were cut, it was resubmitted to the MPAA and received an \"R\" rating. A distributor apparently restored the offending material, and at least one theater presented the full version under an \"R\". In San Francisco, cinema-goers walked out of theaters in disgust and in February 1976, two theaters in Ottawa, Canada, were advised by local police to withdraw the film lest they face morality charges. After its initial British release, including a one-year theatrical run in London, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was initially banned on the advice of British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) Secretary Stephen Murphy, and subsequently by his successor, James Ferman. While the British ban was in force the word \"chainsaw\" itself was barred from movie titles, forcing imitators to rename their films. In 1998, despite the BBFC ban, Camden London Borough Council granted the film a license. The following year the BBFC passed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre for release with an 18 certificate (indicating that it should not be seen or purchased by a person under 18), and it was broadcast a year later on Channel 4. When the 83-minute version of the film was submitted to the  Australian Classification Board by distributor Seven Keys in June 1975, the Board denied the film a classification, and similarly refused classification of a 77-minute print in December that year. In 1981, the 83-minute version submitted by Greater Union Film Distributors was again refused registration. It was later submitted by Filmways Australasian Distributors and approved for an \"R\" rating in 1984. It was banned for periods in many other countries, including Brazil, Chile, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and West Germany. In Sweden, it would also symbolize a video nasty, a discussed topic at the time."

        "content": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre received a mixed reaction upon its initial release. Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times called it \"despicable\" and described Henkel and Hooper as more concerned with creating a realistic atmosphere than with its \"plastic script\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said it was \"as violent and gruesome and blood-soaked as the title promises\", yet praised its acting and technical execution. Donald B. Berrigan of The Cincinnati Enquirer praised the lead performance of Burns: \"Marilyn Burns, as Sally, deserves a special Academy Award for one of the most sustained and believable acting achievements in movie history.\" Patrick Taggart of the Austin American-Statesman hailed it as the most important horror film since George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968). Variety found the picture to be well-made, despite what it called the \"heavy doses of gore\". John McCarty of Cinefantastique stated that the house featured in the film made the Bates motel \"look positively pleasant by comparison\". Revisiting the film in his 1976 article \"Fashions in Pornography\" for Harper's Magazine, Stephen Koch found its sadistic violence to be extreme and unimaginative. Critics later frequently praised both the film's aesthetic quality and its power. Observing that it managed to be \"horrifying without being a bloodbath (you'll see more gore in a Steven Seagal film)\", Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle called it \"a backwoods masterpiece of fear and loathing\". TV Guide thought it was \"intelligent\" in its \"bloodless depiction of violence\", while Anton Bitel felt the fact that it was banned in the United Kingdom was a tribute to its artistry. He pointed out how the quiet sense of foreboding at the beginning of the film grows, until the viewer experiences \"a punishing assault on the senses\". In Hick Flicks: The Rise and Fall of Redneck Cinema, Scott Von Doviak commended its effective use of daylight shots, unusual among horror films, such as the sight of a corpse draped over a tombstone in the opening sequence. Mike Emery of The Austin Chronicle praised the film's \"subtle touches\"\u2014such as radio broadcasts heard in the background describing grisly murders around Texas\u2014and said that what made it so dreadful was that it never strayed too far from potential reality. It has often been described as one of the scariest films of all time. Rex Reed called it the most terrifying film he had ever seen. Empire described it as \"the most purely horrifying horror movie ever made\" and called it \"never less than totally committed to scaring you witless\". Reminiscing about his first viewing of the film, horror director Wes Craven recalled wondering \"what kind of Mansonite crazoid\" could have created such a thing. It is a work of \"cataclysmic terror\", in the words of horror novelist Stephen King, who declared, \"I would happily testify to its redeeming social merit in any court in the country.\" Critic Robin Wood found it one of the few horror films to possess \"the authentic quality of nightmare\". Based on 63 reviews published since 2000, the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 89% of critics gave it a positive review, with an average score of 8.10/10. The site's critical consensus states, \"Thanks to a smart script and documentary-style camerawork, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre achieves start-to-finish suspense, making it a classic in low-budget exploitation cinema.\""

        "content": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is considered one of the greatest\u2014and most controversial\u2014horror films of all time and a major influence on the genre. In 1999, Richard Zoglin of Time commented that it had \"set a new standard for slasher films\". The Times listed it as one of the 50 most controversial films of all time. Tony Magistrale believes the film paved the way for horror to be used as a vehicle for social commentary. Describing it as \"cheap, grubby and out of control\", Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times declared that it \"both defines and entirely supersedes the very notion of the exploitation picture\". In his book Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film, David Hogan called it \"the most affecting gore thriller of all and, in a broader view, among the most effective horror films ever made ... the driving force of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is something far more horrible than aberrant sexuality: total insanity.\" According to Bill Nichols, it \"achieves the force of authentic art, profoundly disturbing, intensely personal, yet at the same time far more than personal\". Leonard Wolf praised the film as \"an exquisite work of art\" and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence. Leatherface has gained a reputation as a significant character in the horror genre, responsible for establishing the use of conventional tools as murder weapons and the image of a large, silent killer devoid of personality. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said, \"In our collective consciousness, Leatherface and his chainsaw have become as iconic as Freddy and his razors or Jason and his hockey mask.\" Don Sumner called The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a classic that not only introduced a new villain to the horror pantheon but also influenced an entire generation of filmmakers. According to Rebecca Ascher-Walsh of Entertainment Weekly, it laid the foundations for the Halloween, Evil Dead, and Blair Witch horror franchises. Wes Craven crafted his 1977 film The Hills Have Eyes as an homage to Massacre, while Ridley Scott cited Hooper's film as an inspiration for his 1979 film Alien. French director Alexandre Aja credited it as an early influence on his career. Horror filmmaker and heavy metal musician Rob Zombie sees it as a major influence on his work, including his films House of 1000 Corpses (2003) and The Devil's Rejects (2005). The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was selected for the 1975 Cannes Film Festival Directors' Fortnight and London Film Festival. In 1976, it won the Special Jury Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in France. Entertainment Weekly ranked the film sixth on its 2003 list of \"The Top 50 Cult Films\". In a 2005 Total Film poll, it was selected as the greatest horror film of all time. It was named among Times top 25 horror films in 2007. In 2008 the film ranked number 199 on Empire magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". Empire also ranked it 46th in its list of the 50 greatest independent films. In a 2010 Total Film poll, it was again selected as the greatest horror film; the judging panel included veteran horror directors such as John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and George A. Romero. In 2010, as well, The Guardian ranked it number 14 on its list of the top 25 horror films. It was also voted the greatest horror film of all time in Slant Magazine 2013 list of the greatest horror films of all time. It was also voted the scariest movie of all time in a 2017 list by Complex and voted the best horror movie of all time in a 2017 list by Thrillist. It was also voted the scariest movie of all time in a 2018 list by Consequence of Sound and voted the best horror movie of all time in a 2018 list by Esquire. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was inducted into the Horror Hall of Fame in 1990, with director Hooper accepting the award, and it is part of the permanent collection of New York City's Museum of Modern Art. In 2012, the film was named by critics in the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound magazine as one of the 250 greatest films. The Academy Film Archive houses the Texas Chain Saw Massacre Collection, which contains over fifty items, including many original elements for the film."

        "content": "Critic Christopher Sharrett argues that since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963), the American horror film has been defined by the questions it poses \"about the fundamental validity of the American civilizing process\", concerns amplified during the 1970s by the \"delegitimation of authority in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate\". \"If Psycho began an exploration of a new sense of absurdity in contemporary life, of the collapse of causality and the diseased underbelly of American Gothic\", he writes, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre \"carries this exploration to a logical conclusion, addressing many of the issues of Hitchcock's film while refusing comforting closure\". Robin Wood characterizes Leatherface and his family as victims of industrial capitalism, their jobs as slaughterhouse workers having been rendered obsolete by technological advances. He states that the picture \"brings to focus a spirit of negativity\u00a0... that seems to lie not far below the surface of the modern collective consciousness\". Naomi Merritt explores the film's representation of \"cannibalistic capitalism\" in relation to Georges Bataille's theory of taboo and transgression. She elaborates on Wood's analysis, stating that the Sawyer family's values \"reflect, or correspond to, established and interdependent American institutions\u00a0... but their embodiment of these social units is perverted and transgressive.\" In Kim Newman's view, Hooper's presentation of the Sawyer family during the dinner scene parodies a typical American sitcom family: the gas station owner is the bread-winning father figure; the killer Leatherface is depicted as a bourgeois housewife; the hitchhiker acts as the rebellious teenager. Isabel Cristina Pinedo, author of Recreational Terror: Women and the Pleasures of Horror Film Viewing, states, \"The horror genre must keep terror and comedy in tension if it is to successfully tread the thin line that separates it from terrorism and parody\u00a0... this delicate balance is struck in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in which the decaying corpse of Grandpa not only incorporates horrific and humorous effects, but actually uses one to exacerbate the other.\""

        "title": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_Violence against women",
        "content": "The underlying themes of the film have been the subject of extensive critical discussion; critics and scholars have interpreted it as a paradigmatic exploitation film in which female protagonists are subjected to brutal, sadistic violence. Stephen Prince comments that the horror is \"born of the torment of the young woman subjected to imprisonment and abuse amid decaying arms... and mobiles made of human bones and teeth.\" As with many slasher films, it incorporates the \"final girl\" trope\u2014the heroine and inevitable lone survivor who somehow escapes the horror that befalls the other characters: Sally Hardesty is wounded and tortured, yet manages to survive with the help of a male truck driver. Critics argue that even in exploitation films in which the ratio of male and female deaths is roughly equal, the images that linger will be of the violence committed against the female characters. The specific case of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre provides support for this argument: three men are killed in quick fashion, but one woman is brutally slaughtered\u2014hung on a meathook\u2014and the surviving woman endures physical and mental torture. In 1977, critic Mary Mackey described the meathook scene as probably the most brutal onscreen female death in any commercially distributed film. She placed it in a lineage of violent films that depict women as weak and incapable of protecting themselves. In one study, a group of men were shown five films depicting differing levels of violence against women. On first viewing The Texas Chain Saw Massacre they experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety; however, upon subsequent viewing they found the violence against women less offensive and more enjoyable. Another study, investigating gender-specific perceptions of slasher films, involved 30 male and 30 female university students. One male participant described the screaming, especially Sally's, as the \"most freaky thing\" in the film. According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, the lack of explicit violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they play a central role in imagining. Nonetheless\u2014citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium\u2014Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level."

        "content": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has appeared on various home video formats. In the US, it was first released on videotape and CED in the early 1980s by Wizard Video and Vestron Video. The British Board of Film Classification had long since refused a certification for the uncut theatrical version and in 1984 they also refused to certify it for home video, amid a moral panic surrounding \"video nasties\". After the retirement of BBFC Director James Ferman in 1999, the board passed the film uncut for theatrical and video distribution with an 18 certificate, almost 25 years after the original release. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was initially released on DVD in October 1998 in the United States, May 2000 in the United Kingdom and 2001 in Australia. In 2005 the film received a 2K scan and full restoration from the original 16mm A/B rolls, which was subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2014 a more extensive 4K restoration, supervised by Hooper, using the original 16mm A/B reversal rolls, was carried out. After a screening in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, this was also released on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide. Dark Sky Films' US 40th Anniversary Edition was nominated for Best DVD/BD Special Edition Release at the 2015 Saturn Awards. In 1982, shortly after The Texas Chain Saw Massacre established itself as a success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls. As one of the first horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it. The film has been followed by eight other films to date, including sequels, prequels and remakes. The first sequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), was considerably more graphic and violent than the original and was banned in Australia for 20 years before it was released on DVD in a revised special edition in October 2006. Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) was the second sequel to appear, though Hooper did not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts with another film, Spontaneous Combustion. Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, was released in 1995. While briefly acknowledging the events of the preceding two sequels, its plot makes it a virtual remake of the 1974 original. A straight remake, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was released by Platinum Dunes and New Line Cinema in 2003. It was followed by a prequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, in 2006. A seventh film, Texas Chainsaw 3D, was released on January 4, 2013. It is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, with no relation to the previous sequels, or the 2003 remake. Another prequel, Leatherface, was released exclusively to DirecTV on September 21, 2017, before receiving a wider release on video on demand and in limited theaters, simultaneously, in North America on October 20, 2017. Another sequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was released exclusively on Netflix on February 18, 2022."

        "content": "The Big Lebowski () is a 1998 black comedy crime film written, produced, and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped, and he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release; the plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the ransom money. Sam Elliott, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Peter Stormare, and Ben Gazzara also appear, in supporting roles. The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, \"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story \u2013 how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant.\" The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers. The Big Lebowski received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Over time, reviews have become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A spin-off, titled The Jesus Rolls, was released in 2020, with Turturro reprising his role and also serving as writer and director."

        "content": "In the early 1990s, Los Angeles slacker Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski is assaulted in his home by two enforcers for porn kingpin Jackie Treehorn, who is owed money by the wife of a different Jeffrey Lebowski.  One of the goons urinates on the Dude's favorite rug before they realize they have the wrong man and leave. Advised by his bowling partners, Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak and Donny Kerabatsos, the Dude visits wealthy philanthropist Jeffrey (\"Big\") Lebowski, demanding compensation for the rug. Big refuses, but the Dude tricks Big's assistant Brandt into letting him take a similar rug from the mansion. Outside he meets Bunny, Big's trophy wife, and her German nihilist friend Uli.  Soon after this, Bunny is apparently kidnapped and Big hires The Dude to deliver the requested ransom money, one million dollars. That night, a different pair of thugs accost the Dude, taking his replacement rug on behalf of Big's daughter Maude, who has a sentimental attachment to it. The kidnappers arrange to collect the ransom. Convinced that Bunny \"kidnapped herself\", Walter concocts a scheme to keep the ransom money by substituting it with a briefcase full of his dirty laundry. Although things do not go entirely according to Walter's plan, the kidnappers leave with Walter's laundry, and Walter and The Dude return to the bowling alley, leaving the ransom money in the trunk of his car. While the bowlers bowl, the car is stolen from the parking lot. Revealing Bunny is one of Treehorn's actresses and lovers, Maude agrees that Bunny staged her own abduction and asks for the Dude's help to recover the money, which her father illegally withdrew from the family's foundation. Later, the Dude is separately confronted for his failure to deliver the ransom by both Big and a trio of German nihilists who identify themselves as the kidnappers.  Maude is able to confirm that the Germans are Bunny's friends. The Dude's car, minus the briefcase, is recovered by police. Driving home after a meeting with Maude, the Dude finds homework stuffed down in the seat, signed \"Larry Sellers.\" Walter and the Dude confront Larry at his father's home, interrogating him about the missing briefcase. When he is unresponsive, Walter bashes a new sports car parked outside, thinking the teen had used the money to buy it. The car's actual owner, a neighbor, appears and retaliates by bashing the Dude's car, mistaking it for Walter's. The Dude returns home, where he finds Maude wearing only a robe. They have sex, and Maude tells the Dude that her father has no money of his own; the family fortune belonged to her late mother who left him none, the final piece of information which The Dude needs to work out the entire scheme: after Bunny left town, her nihilist friends faked her kidnapping to extort money from her husband. Big withdrew the ransom from the family trust but kept it for himself, not caring what happened to his wife, giving the Dude a briefcase containing phone books instead. In a final confrontation outside of the bowling alley, the nihilists set the Dude's car on fire, and demand the ransom money. Walter violently fends them off, but during the scuffle, Donny dies from a heart attack. Before scattering Donny's ashes from a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Walter delivers a eulogy that turns into a diatribe about the Vietnam War. He scatters the ashes, which an updraft blows back over himself and the Dude. The Dude chastises Walter for the eulogy and Walter apologizes; the two go bowling."

        "content": "The Dude is mostly inspired by Jeff Dowd, an American film producer and political activist the Coen brothers met while they were trying to find distribution for their first feature, Blood Simple. Dowd had been a member of the Seattle Seven, liked to drink White Russians, and was known as \"The Dude\". The Dude was also partly based on a friend of the Coen brothers, Peter Exline (now a member of the faculty at USC's School of Cinematic Arts), a Vietnam War veteran who reportedly lived in a dump of an apartment and was proud of a little rug that \"tied the room together\". Exline knew Barry Sonnenfeld from New York University and Sonnenfeld introduced Exline to the Coen brothers while they were trying to raise money for Blood Simple. Exline became friends with the Coens and in 1989, told them all kinds of stories from his own life, including ones about his actor-writer friend Lewis Abernathy (one of the inspirations for Walter), a fellow Vietnam vet who later became a private investigator and helped him track down and confront a high school kid who stole his car. As in the film, Exline's car was impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department and Abernathy found an 8th grader's homework under the passenger seat. Exline also belonged to an amateur softball league but the Coens changed it to bowling in the film, because \"it's a very social sport where you can sit around and drink and smoke while engaging in inane conversation\". The Coens met filmmaker John Milius when they were in Los Angeles making Barton Fink and incorporated his love of guns and the military into the character of Walter. John Milius introduced the Coen Brothers to one of his best friends, Jim Ganzer, who would have been another source of inferences to create Jeff Bridges' character. Also known as the Dude, Ganzer and his gang, typical Malibu surfers, served as inspiration as well for Milius's film Big Wednesday. Before David Huddleston was cast as \"Big\" Jeffrey Lebowski, the Coens considered Robert Duvall (who didn't like the script), Anthony Hopkins (who wasn't interested playing an American), Gene Hackman (who was taking a break from acting at the time), Norman Mailer, George C. Scott, Jerry Falwell, Gore Vidal, Andy Griffith, William F. Buckley, and Ernest Borgnine. The Coens' top choice was Marlon Brando, but he was unable to star in the film due to health issues. Charlize Theron was considered for the role of Bunny Lebowski. According to Julianne Moore, the character of Maude was based on artist Carolee Schneemann, \"who worked naked from a swing\", and on Yoko Ono. The character of Jesus Quintana, an opponent of The Dude's bowling team, was inspired in part by a performance the Coens had seen John Turturro give in 1988 at the Public Theater in a play called Mi Puta Vida in which he played a pederast-type character, \"so we thought, let's make Turturro a pederast. It'll be something he can really run with,\" Joel said in an interview. The film's overall structure was influenced by the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, \"We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling \u2013 like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes.\" The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, \"He is a little bit of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain.\" The significance of the bowling culture was, according to Joel, \"important in reflecting that period at the end of the fifties and the beginning of the sixties. That suited the retro side of the movie, slightly anachronistic, which sent us back to a not-so-far-away era, but one that was well and truly gone nevertheless.\""

        "content": "The Coen Brothers wrote The Big Lebowski around the same time as Barton Fink. When the Coen brothers wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for Roseanne and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film Wild Bill. The Coens decided to make Fargo in the meantime. According to Ethan, \"the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter\", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in Barton Fink. They also came up with the idea of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski \"is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges\". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often \"encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies.\" In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an \"effete art-world hanger-on\", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino."

        "content": "PolyGram and Working Title Films, which had funded Fargo, backed The Big Lebowski with a budget of $15\u00a0million. In casting the film, Joel remarked, \"we tend to write both for people we know and have worked with, and some parts without knowing who's going to play the role. In The Big Lebowski we did write for John [Goodman] and Steve [Buscemi], but we didn't know who was getting the Jeff Bridges role.\" Mel Gibson was originally considered for the role of The Dude, but he didn't take the pitch too seriously. In preparation for his role, Bridges met Dowd but actually \"drew on myself a lot from back in the Sixties and Seventies. I lived in a little place like that and did drugs, although I think I was a little more creative than the Dude.\" The actor went into his own closet with the film's wardrobe person and picked out clothes that he had thought the Dude might wear. He wore his character's clothes home because most of them were his own. The actor also adopted the same physicality as Dowd, including the slouching and his ample belly. Originally, Goodman wanted a different kind of beard for Walter but the Coen brothers insisted on the \"Gladiator\" or what they called the \"Chin Strap\" and he thought it would go well with his flattop haircut. For the film's look, the Coens wanted to avoid the usual retro 1960s clich\u00e9s like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music and for it to be \"consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy\", Joel said in an interview. For example, the star motif, featured predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he \"came up with the idea of just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior\". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. \"Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars\", remembers Heinrichs. For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be Inca-themed, with a \"very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men walk around with appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it.\" Cinematographer Roger Deakins discussed the look of the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece."

        "content": "Actual filming took place over an eleven-week period with location shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the Hollywood Star Lanes (for three weeks) and the Dude's Busby Berkeley dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar. According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges \"was when he would come over at the beginning of each scene and ask, 'Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?' I'd reply 'Yes' usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start rubbing his eyes to get them bloodshot.\" Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on The Lost World: Jurassic Park. She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997 while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech. The scenes in Jackie Treehorn's house were shot in the Sheats-Goldstein Residence, designed by John Lautner and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills. Deakins described the look of the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, \"it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty\" with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp look, he used an orange sodium-light effect. The Coen brothers shot much of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic. To achieve the point-of-view of a rolling bowling ball the Coen brothers mounted a camera \"on something like a barbecue spit\", according to Ethan, and then dollied it along the lane. The challenge for them was figuring out the relative speeds of the forward motion and the rotating motion. CGI was used to create the vantage point of the thumb hole in the bowling ball."

        "content": "The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a veteran of all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' \"Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)\", the Gipsy Kings' cover of \"Hotel California\", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, \"T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac.\" Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's \"The Man in Me\". However, he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Dead Flowers\", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, \"It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful.\" Burnett was going to be credited on the film as \"Music Supervisor\", but asked his credit to be \"Music Archivist\" because he \"hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management\". For Joel, \"the original music, as with other elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of the Sixties and early Seventies\". Music defines each character. For example, \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" by Bob Nolan was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was \"Lujon\" by Henry Mancini for Jackie Treehorn. \"The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So there's a musical signature for each of them\", remarked Ethan in an interview. The character Uli Kunkel was in the German electronic band Autobahn, an homage to the band Kraftwerk. The album cover of their record Nagelbett (bed of nails) is a parody of the Kraftwerk album cover for The Man-Machine and the group name Autobahn shares the name of a Kraftwerk song and album. In the lyrics the phrase \"We believe in nothing\" is repeated with electronic distortion. This is a reference to Autobahn's nihilism in the film."

The website's critics consensus reads, \"Typically stunning visuals and sharp dialogue from the Coen Brothers, brought to life with strong performances from Goodman and Bridges.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Many critics and audiences have likened the film to a modern Western, while many others dispute this, or liken it to a crime novel that revolves around mistaken identity plot devices. Peter Howell, in his review for the Toronto Star, wrote: \"It's hard to believe that this is the work of a team that won an Oscar last year for the original screenplay of Fargo. There's a large amount of profanity in the movie, which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps.\" Howell revised his opinion in a later review, and in 2011 stated that \"it may just be my favourite Coen Bros. film.\" Todd McCarthy in Variety magazine wrote: \"One of the film's indisputable triumphs is its soundtrack, which mixes Carter Burwell's original score with classic pop tunes and some fabulous covers.\" USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and felt that the Dude was \"too passive a hero to sustain interest,\" but that there was \"enough startling brilliance here to suggest that, just like the Dude, those smarty-pants Coens will abide.\" In his review for The Washington Post, Desson Howe praised the Coens and \"their inspired, absurdist taste for weird, peculiar Americana\u00a0\u2013 but a sort of neo-Americana that is entirely invented\u00a0\u2013 the Coens have defined and mastered their own bizarre subgenre. No one does it like them and, it almost goes without saying, no one does it better.\" Janet Maslin praised Bridges' performance in her review for The New York Times: \"Mr. Bridges finds a role so right for him that he seems never to have been anywhere else. Watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out-to-lunch character played with fine comic flair.\" Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote: \"The result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved. I doubt that there'll be anything else like it the rest of this year.\" In a five star review for Empire Magazine, Ian Nathan wrote: \"For those who delight in the Coens' divinely abstract take on reality, this is pure nirvana\" and \"in a perfect world all movies would be made by the Coen brothers.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"weirdly engaging.\" In a 2010 review, he raised his original score to four stars out of four and added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list. However, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote in the Chicago Reader: \"To be sure, The Big Lebowski is packed with show-offy filmmaking and as a result is pretty entertaining. But insofar as it represents a moral position\u2014and the Coens' relative styling of their figures invariably does\u2014it's an elitist one, elevating salt-of-the-earth types like Bridges and Goodman ... over everyone else in the movie.\" Dave Kehr, in his review for the Daily News, criticized the film's premise as a \"tired idea, and it produces an episodic, unstrung film.\" The Guardian criticized the film as \"a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random. The film is infuriating, and will win no prizes. But it does have some terrific jokes.\""

        "content": "Since its original release, The Big Lebowski has become a cult classic. Ardent fans of the film call themselves \"achievers\". Steve Palopoli wrote about the film's emerging cult status in July 2002. He first realized that the film had a cult following when he attended a midnight screening in 2000 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles and witnessed people quoting dialogue from the film to each other. Soon after the article appeared, the programmer for a local midnight film series in Santa Cruz decided to screen The Big Lebowski and on the first weekend they had to turn away several hundred people. The theater held the film over for six weeks, which had never happened before. An annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in Louisville, Kentucky, United States in 2002 with 150 fans showing up, and has since expanded to several other cities. The festival's main event each year is a night of unlimited bowling with various contests including costume, trivia, hardest- and farthest-traveled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands the night before the bowling event as well as a day-long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths and games. Various celebrities from the film have even attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges who attended the Los Angeles event. The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as The Dude Abides and is held in London. Dudeism, a religion devoted largely to spreading the philosophy and lifestyle of the film's main character, was founded in 2005. Also known as The Church of the Latter-Day Dude, the organization has ordained over 220,000 \"Dudeist Priests\" all over the world via its website. Two species of African spider are named after the film and main character: Anelosimus biglebowski and Anelosimus dude, both described in 2006. Additionally, an extinct Permian conifer genus is named after the film in honor of its creators. The first species described within this genus in 2007 is based on 270-million-year-old plant fossils from Texas, and is called Lebowskia grandifolia. Entertainment Weekly ranked it 8th on their Funniest Movies of the Past 25 Years list. The film was also ranked No. 34 on their list of \"The Top 50 Cult Films\" and ranked No. 15 on the magazine's \"The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83\" list. In addition, the magazine also ranked The Dude No. 14 in their \"The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\" poll. The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association. The Big Lebowski was voted as the 10th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: \"The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list.\" Empire magazine ranked Walter Sobchak No. 49 and the Dude No. 7 in their \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" poll. Roger Ebert added The Big Lebowski to his list of \"Great Movies\" in March 2010."

The center piece of this viewpoint was that Walter Sobchak is \"a neocon,\" citing the film's references to then President George H. W. Bush and the first Gulf War. A journal article by Brian Wall, published in the feminist journal Camera Obscura, uses the film to explain Karl Marx's commodity fetishism and the feminist consequences of sexual fetishism. In That Rug Really Tied the Room Together, first published in 2001, Joseph Natoli argues that The Dude represents a counter narrative to the post-Reaganomic entrepreneurial rush for \"return on investment\" on display in such films as Jerry Maguire and Forrest Gump. It has been used as a carnivalesque critique of society, as an analysis on war and ethics, as a narrative on mass communication and US militarism and other issues."

        "content": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. Primarily developed during live performances, the band premiered an early version of the suite several months before recording began. The record was conceived as an album that focused on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental health problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work. The group employed multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers, including experimentation with the EMS VCS 3 and a Synthi A. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry, who appears on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". A concept album, The Dark Side of the Moon explores themes such as conflict, greed, time, death and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew are featured alongside philosophical quotations. The sleeve, which depicts a prism spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson in response to keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design, representing the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\". The Dark Side of the Moon is among the most critically acclaimed records in history, often featured on professional listings of the greatest albums of all time. The record helped propel Pink Floyd to international fame, bringing wealth and plaudits to all four of its members. A blockbuster release of the album era, it also propelled record sales throughout the music industry during the 1970s. It has been certified 14\u00d7 platinum in the United Kingdom, and topped the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, where it has charted for 962 weeks in total. With estimated sales of over 45\u00a0million copies, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album, and one of the best-selling albums worldwide. In 2012, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

        "content": "Following Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December that year. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters conceived an album that dealt with things that \"make people mad\", focusing on the pressures associated with the band's arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental health problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with the 1969 concert suite The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: \"I think we all thought and Roger definitely thought that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.\" For the most part, all four members approved of Waters' concept for an album unified by a single theme. Waters, Gilmour, Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright participated in the writing and production of the new material, and Waters created the early demo tracks at his Islington home in a small studio built in his garden shed. Parts of the album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of \"Breathe\" came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of The Body, and the basic structure of \"Us and Them\" was borrowed from an original composition, \"The Violent Sequence\" by Wright for Zabriskie Point. The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by the Rolling Stones, and then at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel quadraphonic output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three lorries; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour. The album had been given the provisional title of Dark Side of the Moon (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). However, after discovering that title had already been used by another band, Medicine Head, it was temporarily changed to Eclipse. The new material premiered at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference. Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it was then known, was performed in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 more than a year before its release at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as \"bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.\" Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote \"The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast.\" Melody Maker was less enthusiastic: \"Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo.\" The following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed in the same order in which it was eventually sequenced on the album release; differences included the lack of synthesisers in tracks such as \"On the Run\", and Clare Torry's vocals on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" being replaced by readings from the Bible. Pink Floyd's lengthy tour through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make continual improvements to the scale and quality of their performances. Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band travelled to France and recorded music for French director Barbet Schroeder's film La Vall\u00e9e. They then performed in Japan and returned to France in March to complete work on the film. After a series of dates in North America, the band flew to London to begin recording, from 24 May to 25 June. More concerts in Europe and North America followed before the band returned on 9 January 1973 to complete the album."

        "content": "The Dark Side of the Moon built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings, but it lacks the extended instrumental excursions which, according to critic David Fricke, had become characteristic of the band following founding member Syd Barrett's departure in 1968.  Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as \"that psychedelic noodling stuff\". He and Waters cited 1971's Meddle as a turning point towards what would be realised on the album. The Dark Side of the Moons lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death and insanity, the latter inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state. The album contains musique concr\u00e8te on several tracks. Each side of the album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience and, according to Waters, \"empathy\".  \"Speak to Me\" and \"Breathe\" together highlight the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life \"Don't be afraid to care\". By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesiser-driven instrumental \"On the Run\" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying. \"Time\" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane pursuits; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in \"Breathe (Reprise)\". The first side of the album ends with Wright and vocalist Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". Opening with the sound of cash registers and loose change, the first track on side two, \"Money\", mocks greed and consumerism using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related sound effects. \"Money\" became their most commercially successful track, and has been covered by several artists in subsequent years. \"Us and Them\" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. \"Any Colour You Like\" tackles the illusion of choice one has in society. \"Brain Damage\" looks at mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line \"and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes\" reflects the mental breakdown of former bandmate Syd Barrett.  The album ends with \"Eclipse\", which espouses the concepts of alterity and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity."

        "content": "The Dark Side of the Moon was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973.  Pink Floyd were assigned staff engineer Alan Parsons, who had worked as assistant tape operator on their fifth album, Atom Heart Mother (1970), and gained experience as a recording engineer on the Beatles' Abbey Road and Let It Be. The Dark Side of the Moon sessions made use of advanced studio techniques; the studio was capable of 16-track mixes, which offered greater flexibility than the eight- or four-track mixes Pink Floyd had previously used, although they often used so many tracks that to make more space available second-generation copies were made. The first track recorded was \"Us and Them\" on 1 June, followed six days later by \"Money\". Waters had created effects loops from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio; these were rerecorded to take advantage of the band's decision to record a quadraphonic mix of the album. Parsons later expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders. \"Time\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" were recorded next, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour across the United States. The recording sessions were frequently interrupted; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point. In an interview in 2003, Gilmour said: \"We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on.\" On returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded \"Brain Damage\", \"Eclipse\", \"Any Colour You Like\" and \"On the Run\", while fine-tuning the work from the previous sessions. A group of four female vocalists was assembled to sing on \"Brain Damage\", \"Eclipse\" and \"Time\", and saxophonist Dick Parry was booked to play on \"Us and Them\" and \"Money\".  With director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii. Once the recording sessions were complete, the band began a tour of Europe."

Mason received a rare solo composing credit for \"Speak to Me\". The sound effects on \"Money\" were created by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which were used to create a 7-beat effects loop (later adapted to four tracks to create a \"walk around the room\" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album). At times the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and band to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously, to mix down the intricately assembled multitrack recordings of several of the songs (particularly \"On the Run\"). Along with the conventional rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent synthesisers to their sound. For example, the band experimented with an EMS VCS 3 on \"Brain Damage\" and \"Any Colour You Like\", and a Synthi A on \"Time\" and \"On the Run\". They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as an assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during \"On the Run\"), and a specially treated bass drum made to simulate a human heartbeat (during \"Speak to Me\", \"On the Run\", \"Time\" and \"Eclipse\").  This heartbeat is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on \"Time\" and \"On the Run\". \"Time\" features assorted clocks ticking, then chiming simultaneously at the start of the song, accompanied by a series of Rototoms. The recordings were initially created as a quadraphonic test by Parsons, who recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop. Although these recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of this material were eventually used in the track."

        "content": "Several tracks, including \"Us and Them\" and \"Time\", demonstrated Richard Wright's and David Gilmour's ability to harmonise their voices.  In the 2003 Classic Albums documentary The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon, Waters attributed this to the fact that their voices sounded extremely similar. To take advantage of this, Parsons used studio techniques such as the double tracking of vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself.  The engineer also made prominent use of flanging and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with reverb, and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the quadraphonic mix of \"On the Run\", when the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker rapidly swirls around the listener). The album's credits include Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road. She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, one of which convinced Parsons to invite her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do. Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band only to find them delighted with her performance. Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. For her contribution she was paid \u00a330, her standard session fee, equivalent to about \u00a3 in . In 2004, she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for 50% of the songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, with all post-2005 pressings crediting Wright and Torry jointly. Snippets of voices between and over the music are another notable feature of the album. During recording sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on flashcards.  The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3, and shown such questions as \"What's your favourite colour?\" and \"What's your favourite food?\", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death).  Questions such as \"When was the last time you were violent?\", followed immediately by \"Were you in the right?\", were answered in the order they were presented. Roger \"The Hat\" Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid.  Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied \"...\u00a0give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock\u00a0...\" When asked about death he responded \"live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me\u00a0...\" Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: \"I've been mad for fucking years absolutely years\". The band's road manager Peter Watts (father of actress Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during \"Brain Damage\" and \"Speak to Me\".  His second wife, Patricia \"Puddie\" Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the \"geezer\" who was \"cruisin' for a bruisin used in the segue between \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\", and the words \"I never said I was frightened of dying\" heard halfway through \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". Several responses \"I am not frightened of dying.  Any time will do: I don't mind.  Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it\u00a0\u2013 you've got to go sometime\" and closing words \"there is no dark side in the moon, really.  As a matter of fact it's all dark\" came from the studios' Irish doorman, Gerry O'Driscoll. Paul and Linda McCartney were also interviewed, but their answers were judged to be \"trying too hard to be funny\", and were not included on the album. The McCartneys' Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line \"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time\"."

He had worked with Beatles producer George Martin, and was an acquaintance of Pink Floyd's manager, Steve O'Rourke. All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a \"dry\" and \"clean\" mix that made more use of the non-musical elements, and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more \"echoey\" mix. Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating \"There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out. It was a very creative atmosphere. A lot of fun.\" Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas's intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product. Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on \"Us and Them\".  He was also present for the recording of \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" (although Parsons was responsible for hiring Torry). Interviewed in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio, Waters said:"

        "content": "The album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie.  Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words.  Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band.  For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something \"smarter, neater more classy\". The design was inspired by a photograph of a prism with a colour beam projected through it that Thorgerson had found in a photography book. The artwork was created by their associate, George Hardie.  Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of seven designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best. The final design depicts a glass prism dispersing light into colour. The design represents three elements: the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design.  The spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold an idea that Waters came up with. Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colours, missing indigo compared to the traditional division of the spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.  Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers.  One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photograph of the Great Pyramids of Giza, created by Powell and Thorgerson. The band were so confident of the quality of Waters' lyrics that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve."

        "content": "As the quadraphonic mix of the album was not then complete, the band (with the exception of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the band, and the stereo mix of the album was played over a poor-quality public address system. Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; Melody Makers Roy Hollingworth described side one as \"so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow\", but praised Side Two, writing: \"The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night.\" Steve Peacock of Sounds wrote: \"I don't care if you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd unreservedly recommend everyone to The Dark Side of the Moon\".  In his 1973 review for Rolling Stone magazine, Loyd Grossman declared Dark Side \"a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement\". In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clich\u00e9d and its music pretentious, but called it a \"kitsch masterpiece\" that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry's saxophone, and studio effects which enhance Gilmour's guitar solos. The Dark Side of the Moon was released first in the US on 1 March 1973, and then in the UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US. Throughout March 1973 the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart's number one spot on 28 April 1973, and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour."

        "content": "Much of the album's early American success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd's US record company, Capitol Records.  Newly appointed chairman Bhaskar Menon set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band's 1971 studio album Meddle.  Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with CBS president Clive Davis, on Columbia Records.  The Dark Side of the Moon was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract.  Menon's enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of \"Us and Them\" and \"Time\". In some countries notably the UK Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968's \"Point Me at the Sky\", and unusually \"Money\" was released as a single on 7 May, with \"Any Colour You Like\" on the B-side. It reached number\u00a013 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1973.  A two-sided white label promotional version of the single, with mono and stereo mixes, was sent to radio stations.  The mono side had the word \"bullshit\" removed from the song leaving \"bull\" in its place however, the stereo side retained the uncensored version.  This was subsequently withdrawn; the replacement was sent to radio stations with a note advising disc jockeys to dispose of the first uncensored copy. On 4 February 1974, a double A-side single was released with \"Time\" on one side, and \"Us and Them\" on the opposite side. Menon's efforts to secure a contract renewal with Pink Floyd were in vain however; at the beginning of 1974, the band signed for Columbia with a reported advance fee of $1M (in Britain and Europe they continued to be represented by Harvest Records)."

Although it held the number one spot in the US for only a week, the album remained in the Billboard 200 albums chart for 736\u00a0nonconsecutive weeks (from 17 March 1973 to 16 July 1988). The Dark Side of the Moon made its final appearance in the Billboard 200 albums during its initial run on the week ending 8 October 1988, in its 741st charted week. The album re-appeared on the Billboard charts with the introduction of the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in the issue dated 25 May 1991, and was still a perennial feature ten years later. It reached number one on the Pop Catalog chart when the 2003 hybrid CD/SACD edition was released and sold 800,000\u00a0copies in the US. On the week of 5 May 2006 The Dark Side of the Moon achieved a combined total of 1,716\u00a0weeks on the Billboard\u00a0200 and Pop Catalog charts. Upon a change in chart methodology in 2009 allowing catalogue titles to be included in the Billboard 200, The Dark Side of the Moon returned to the chart at number 189 on 12 December of that year for its 742nd charting week. It has continued to sporadically appear on the Billboard 200 since then, with the total at 962 weeks on the chart as of February 2022. \"On a slow week\" between 8,000 and 9,000\u00a0copies are sold. As of April 2013, the album had sold 9,502,000 copies in the US since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales for Billboard. One in every fourteen people in the US under the age of\u00a050 is estimated to own, or to have owned, a copy. In terms of US sales certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), The Dark Side of the Moon was released before the introduction of platinum awards in 1976. It therefore held only a gold certification by the RIAA until 16 February 1990, when it was certified 11\u00d7 platinum. On 4 June 1998, the RIAA certified the album 15\u00d7 platinum, denoting sales of fifteen million in the United States making it their biggest-selling work there (The Wall is 23\u00d7 platinum, but as a double album this signifies sales of 11.5\u00a0million). \"Money\" has sold well as a single, and as with \"Time\", remains a radio favourite; in the US, for the year ending 20 April 2005, \"Time\" was played on 13,723\u00a0occasions, and \"Money\" on 13,731\u00a0occasions. In 2017 The Dark Side of the Moon was the seventh-best-selling album of all time in the UK and the highest selling album never to reach number one. In 2013 industry sources suggested that worldwide sales of The Dark Side of the Moon totalled about 45\u00a0million. \"The combination of words and music hit a peak,\" explained Gilmour. \"All the music before had not had any great lyrical point to it. And this one was clear and concise. The cover was also right. I think it's become like a benevolent noose hanging behind us. Throughout our entire career, people have said we would never top the Dark Side record and tour. But The Wall earned more in dollar terms.\" As one of the blockbuster LPs of the album era (1960s\u20132000s), The Dark Side of the Moon also led to an increase in record sales overall into the late 1970s."

        "content": "In 1979, The Dark Side of the Moon was released as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and in April 1988 on their \"Ultradisc\" gold CD format. The album was released by EMI and Harvest on the then-new compact disc format in Japan in June 1983, in the US and Europe in August 1984, and in 1992 it was re-released as a remastered CD in the box set Shine On. This version was re-released as a 20th anniversary box set edition with postcards the following year. The cover design was again by Storm Thorgerson, the designer of the original 1973 cover. On some pressings, a faintly audible orchestral version of the Beatles' \"Ticket to Ride\" can be heard after \"Eclipse\" over the album's closing heartbeats. The original quadraphonic mix, created by Alan Parsons, was commissioned by EMI but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix. To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons' quadraphonic mix (done shortly after the original release), and instead had engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1\u00a0channel surround sound mix on the SACD format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since co-producing and engineering their eleventh album, The Wall, and had previously worked on surround versions of The Wall for DVD-Video and Waters' In the Flesh for SACD.  Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting that Guthrie was \"possibly a little too true to the original mix\", but was generally complimentary. The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003, and has since sold more than 800,000\u00a0copies. The cover image was created by a team of designers including Storm Thorgerson. The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the exact dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colours of the original. The idea is derived from the \"sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound\u00a0...\" The image was created out of a desire to be \"the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognisable prism design, but was different and hence new\". The Dark Side of the Moon was also re-released in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and included slightly different versions of the posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th anniversary poster. In 2007 the album was included in Oh, by the Way, a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd, and a DRM-free version was released on the iTunes Store. In 2011 the album was re-released as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, featuring a remastered version of the album along with various other material."

        "content": "The success of the album brought wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars. Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project.  Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: \"I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it.  But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't.\" Part of the legacy of The Dark Side of the Moon is its influence on modern music and on the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs; moreover, the record gave rise to the \"Dark Side of the Rainbow\" theory, according to which the album matches up perfectly with the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz when they are played simultaneously. The album's release is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes made with Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, including a premise explored by Ben Schleifer in Speak to Me': The Legacy of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (2006) that the two albums share a theme that \"the creative individual loses the ability to function in the [modern] world\". In a 2018 book about classic rock, Steven Hyden recalls concluding, in his teens, that The Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zeppelin IV were the two greatest albums of the genre, vision quests \"encompass[ing] the twin poles of teenage desire\". They had similarities, in that both album's cover and internal artwork eschew pictures of the bands in favor of \"inscrutable iconography without any tangible meaning (which always seemed to give the music packaged inside more meaning)\". But whereas Led Zeppelin had looked outward, toward \"conquering the world\" and was known at the time for its outrageous sexual antics while on tour, Pink Floyd looked inward, toward \"overcoming your own hang-ups\" and seemed so sedate and boring that, Hyden commented, the scene in Live at Pompeii where they take a lunch break at the studio might well have been the most interesting part of recording The Dark Side of the Moon. In 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Rankings The Dark Side of the Moon frequently appears on professional rankings of the greatest albums. In 1987, Rolling Stone ranked the record 35th in its list of the \"Top 100\u00a0Albums of the Last 20\u00a0Years\". In 2003, the album was ranked number 43 on the magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", maintaining the ranking in a 2012 revision of the list, but dropping to number 55 in a 2020 revision of the list (the band's highest-charting album on the list). Both Rolling Stone and Q have listed The Dark Side of the Moon as the best progressive rock album. In 2006, it was voted \"My Favourite Album\" by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's audience.  NME readers voted the album eighth in their 2006 \"Best Album of All Time\" online poll, and in 2009, Planet Rock listeners voted the album the \"greatest of all time\". The album is also number two on the \"Definitive 200\" list of albums, made by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers \"in celebration of the art form of the record album\". It ranked 29th in The Observers 2006 list of \"The 50 Albums That Changed Music\", and 37th in The Guardians 1997 list of the \"100 Best Albums Ever\", as voted for by a panel of artists and music critics. In 2014, readers of Rhythm voted it the seventh most influential progressive drumming album. It was voted number 9 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). Based on such rankings, the aggregate website Acclaimed Music lists The Dark Side of the Moon as the 21st most acclaimed album in history, the seventh most acclaimed of the 1970s, and number one of albums from 1973. The album's cover has also been lauded by critics and listeners alike, with VH1 proclaiming it the fourth greatest in history."

        "content": "In 1995, Chuck Noland, a systems analyst executive, travels the world resolving productivity problems at FedEx depots. He lives with his girlfriend Kelly Frears in Memphis, Tennessee, but his workaholism interferes with their relationship. During a family Christmas dinner, Chuck is summoned to resolve a work problem in Malaysia. The FedEx cargo plane he is on gets caught in a storm and crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Chuck is the only survivor and escapes with an inflatable life raft. The next day, he washes up on an uninhabited island. Over the next few days, several FedEx packages wash ashore, as well as the corpse of one of the FedEx pilots, whom Chuck buries. Chuck tries to signal a passing ship and escape in the damaged life raft, but the incoming surf tosses him onto a coral reef, injuring his leg. He is able to find sufficient food, water, and shelter. Chuck opens most of the FedEx packages, finding several useful items, but does not open a package with a pair of golden angel wings painted on it. While attempting to start a fire, Chuck cuts his hand. He furiously throws several objects from the packages, including a Wilson Sporting Goods volleyball, leaving a bloody imprint. After calming down, Chuck draws a face into the smeared blood, names the ball Wilson, and begins talking to it. He continues to talk to it regularly during the rest of his time on the island. Four years later, Chuck has moved into a cave. After a large section from a portable toilet enclosure washes up on the island, he builds a raft, using the plastic as a sail. Chuck successfully launches the raft that he has stocked with water and the unopened FedEx package. Chuck and the raft survive a storm but, afterwards, Wilson falls off the raft and floats away. Chuck awakes and futilely attempts to rescue Wilson, but is left to grieve over Wilson's loss. Soon after, he is rescued by a passing container ship. Upon returning to civilization, Chuck learns that he was declared dead by his family and friends. Kelly has since married and has a daughter. Chuck goes to Kelly's house and reunites with her. They say they are still in love with each other, but both know that Kelly cannot abandon her family. She gives Chuck his old Jeep, and they sadly part ways. Chuck drives to Texas to return the unopened FedEx package to its sender. Finding no one home, he leaves the package at the door with a note saying that the package saved his life. He departs and stops at a remote crossroads. A woman in a pickup truck stops and gives information about where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices an angel wing painted on the tailgate of her truck, identical to the one on the parcel. He looks down each road, trying to decide which way to go. In the end, Chuck then stares down the road the woman took, and smiles."

Hanks gained  during pre-production, for the purpose of making his transformation more dramatic. After most of the film was shot, production was paused so he could lose the weight and grow his hair and beard to look like he had been living on the island for years. Another four-month production halt preceded the filming of the return scenes. During the year-long hiatus, Zemeckis used the same film crew to make another film, What Lies Beneath. Cast Away was filmed on Monuriki, one of the Mamanuca Islands in Fiji. It is in a subgroup of the Mamanuca archipelago, which is sited off the coast of Viti Levu, Fiji's largest island. The island became a tourist attraction after the film's release.  After Chuck's return, it is identified by Kelly as being \"about  south of the Cook Islands,\" but there is no land between the southernmost Cook Islands of Mangaia and Antarctica. The film begins and ends in the same location, on the Arrington Ranch in the Texas Panhandle south of the city of Canadian, Texas."

The film's soundtrack is most notable for its lack of score and creature sound effects (such as bird song or insect sounds) while Chuck is on the island, which is intended to reinforce the feeling of isolation. Cast Away contains no original musical score until Chuck escapes the island. However, there is a Russian choral piece heard near the start of the film that was not composed or even recorded by Silvestri, so it does not appear on the film's soundtrack list. It is a traditional Russian song written by Lev Knipper called \"Oh, My Field\" (\"Polyushko, Polye\") and it is available on various collections of Red Army hymns. The official soundtrack CD is an anthology of musical pieces from all films up to that point directed by Zemeckis and scored by Silvestri. The only track from Cast Away itself is the theme from the end credits. The Cast Away soundtrack consists of 10 tracks with the like of performances by Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Charles Brown."

Named after the volleyball's manufacturer, Wilson Sporting Goods, the character was created by screenwriter William Broyles Jr. While researching for the film, he consulted with professional survival experts, and then chose to deliberately strand himself for one week on an isolated beach in the Gulf of California, to force himself to search for water and food, and obtain his own shelter. During this time, a volleyball washed up on shore, providing the inspiration for the film's inanimate companion. From a screenwriting point of view, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue to take place in a one-person-only situation. It is rumored, but not true, that one of the original volleyball props was sold at auction for $18,500 to the ex-CEO of FedEx Office, Ken May. At the time of the film's release, Wilson launched its own joint promotion centered on its products \"co-starring\" with Tom Hanks. Wilson manufactured a volleyball with a reproduction of the bloodied handprint face on one side. It was sold for a limited time during the film's initial release and continues to be offered on the company's website."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four. In his review, he praised Hanks for doing \"a superb job of carrying Cast Away all by himself for about two-thirds of its running time\" by \"never straining for effect, always persuasive even in this unlikely situation, winning our sympathy with his eyes and his body language when there's no one else on the screen.\" However, he also mentioned how he felt that the film is \"a strong and simple story surrounded by needless complications, and flawed by a last act that disappoints us and then ends on a note of forced whimsy.\""

At the beginning of 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. The band was forced to fire their original producer and produce the album by themselves, after spending half of the album's budget on drugs, alcohol, and food. Despite the poor production, the album was a well-received effort that obtained strong reviews in various music publications. Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! played an essential role in establishing thrash metal as an authentic subgenre of heavy metal music. It explores themes of death, occultism, and violence. The album features the track \"Mechanix\", a song that frontman Dave Mustaine would perform with Metallica during his time in the band, and a controversial cover of the 1965 song \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\". A deluxe edition, completely remixed and remastered with several bonus tracks, was released through Loud Records on February 5, 2002. It features vastly different artwork, with its cover based on the version originally designed by Mustaine in 1985. All songs from the album were performed frequently during Megadeth's initial tour but have been steadily dropped from the setlist since. A new remastered version of the album called Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill was released on June 8, 2018, which includes a remastered version of \"These Boots\", redone to Lee Hazlewood's version."

        "content": "Dave Mustaine was the original lead guitarist for Metallica. However, due to drinking, substance abuse, violent behavior, and personality conflicts with bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, Mustaine was eventually fired from Metallica. Two months after being fired from Metallica, Mustaine met bassist David Ellefson and together they formed Megadeth in Los Angeles. Mustaine later recalled: \"After getting fired from Metallica, all I remember is that I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them.\" Fueled by the desire for revenge, Mustaine elevated the intensity of Megadeth's music in order to challenge his former band. He sped up existing songs such as \"Mechanix\", which Metallica's new line-up adapted into the slower paced \"The Four Horsemen\". Mustaine included his original version of the song on the album to \"straighten Metallica up\", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk, and said that he could not play guitar. After not being able to search for a vocalist for nearly six months, Mustaine decided to handle the vocal duties himself, while also serving as the band's primary lyricist, main songwriter, and co-lead and rhythm guitarist. Megadeth recorded a three-song demo tape early in 1984 titled Last Rites, engineered by Karat Faye, and released it on March 9, 1984. On the strength of the demo, the band was asked to sign with the New York-based independent label Combat Records in November 1984. Early in 1985, Megadeth was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. However, this proved not to be enough, and the band was given a further $4,000. Instead, a majority of the budget was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food, prompting the group to fire the original producer, and produce the record themselves. The album was successfully recorded at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California."

        "content": "The album's artwork, featuring a plastic skull with tinfoil, was not intended to be the original artwork. Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone conversations with Combat Records to get the cover artwork properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own improvised and low-budget replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified. Megadeth began with live performances before the record was released. Although not a member of the band, Kerry King of Slayer played lead guitar for a short period because Mustaine had not recruited a full-time guitarist yet. In mid-1985, the group toured the United States and Canada for the first time, supporting Killing Is My Business... with Canadian speed metal band Exciter. During the tour, guitarist Chris Poland abruptly left the band, and was replaced by touring guitarist Mike Albert. However, Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, and stayed with the band up after the tour of the next album. The album was released on June 12, 1985. To date it remains the only Megadeth album that did not chart on the Billboard 200, primarily because it was released through an independent label with little promotion. Nevertheless, the album still went on to become one of Combat Records' highest selling releases. Later that year, Capitol Records signed Megadeth as they began working on their second album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, released the following year. A limited edition of Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was released in 2009. The CD itself is pressed on black plastic with grooves on the top to imitate an LP. This version's cover is redesigned to match Mustaine's original sketch, and the song \"These Boots\" was removed. Over 254,000 copies of the album were sold in the United States since the beginning of the Nielsen SoundScan era. On April 6, 2018, it was announced that the album would once again be remixed and remastered, this time by Mark Lewis and Ted Jensen. Titled Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill, the deluxe reissue features new mixes and masters of the original album, a new version of \"These Boots\" featuring Lee Hazlewood's original lyrics (albeit with the song downtuned as a result), the original 1984 demos featured on the 2002 remix, and newly-discovered live tracks sourced from VHS tapes found in Dave Mustaine's attic. The new remaster was released on June 8, 2018."

Steve Huey of AllMusic opined that the music on Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is predominantly \"chaotic\", accompanied by \"lightning-fast\" solo sections. Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno said that the original pressing greatly suffered from the poor production, which made the record difficult to listen to. However, he noted that the music is performed at rapid speed, with precise riffing by both Poland and Mustaine. In his book Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal, editor Jeff Wagner wrote the album displayed unusual rhythms and unorthodox guitar riffs, which carried \"like a runaway train\". Speaking about the intensity of the record, Ellefson said that \"extreme speed was deemed the cool factor in thrash metal back in those days\". Although Ellefson considers the album as a solid debut release, he wanted some of the songs to be recorded in slower tempo. The album explores gloomy lyrical subjects such as death, violence, and occultism. Speaking about the themes on the album, author Bob Larson asserted that Megadeth \"cranks out songs about spilling blood and stomping guts with venomous anger\". The album's title, as well as its lyrics, led to accusations whether the band was promoting Satanism. These allegations were rigidly denied by Mustaine, who said that the band consciously kept away from the Satanic image. \"I mean, it's great to thrash and pound, cut yourself up, scream and have fun, but you don't have to take out a Pagan attitude. Why support the Devil? He's already there. I'd rather just fucking thrash and be a metalist and listen to whatever I want to than be forced to listen to one style of music.\""

        "content": "The album's opening track, \"Last Rites/Loved to Death\", consists of two parts. The first part, \"Last Rites\", is an instrumental segue featuring a piano intro, a reinterpretation of J.S. Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. Mustaine explained that \"Loved to Death\" was his \"version of a love song\" to his girlfriend at the time. The title track was inspired by The Punisher comic book, and tells of a paid assassin. The song caused minor media controversy when a man posted an online request to a radio station to play the tune, saying it was \"good music to go postal and kill a bunch of people to\". The man was later arrested under suspicion of commencing a potential shooting spree. \"The Skull Beneath the Skin\" was developed under the working title \"Self Destruct\". The song graphically describes a horrendous human torture, while also probing into the occult and black magic. Mustaine pointed that the creation of Vic Rattlehead was explained throughout that track. \"Rattlehead\", according to Dave Mustaine, was dedicated to the band's mascot and their fans. \"Looking Down the Cross\" was penned by Mustaine in 1983 under the working title \"Speak No Evil\". The song tells about the temptation of Jesus Christ, using religious metaphors and imagery. \"Chosen Ones\" was partially inspired by Tim the Enchanter from the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. \"Mechanix\" was originally written by Mustaine before his tenure in Metallica. He would perform the song with them during his time in the band and, after his departure, the music and lyrics were modified to create \"The Four Horsemen\". Lyrically, \"Mechanix\" is about having sex at a gas station. The album features the first of many covers performed by Megadeth: a speed metal version of Nancy Sinatra's classic \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\", with lyrics altered by Mustaine. The song sparked controversy in later years when the song's original author, Lee Hazlewood, deemed Mustaine's changes to be \"vile and offensive\" and demanded that the song be removed from the album. Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from all pressings released after 1995. In 2002, the album was re-released with a modified version of the song; the altered lyrics were censored because Hazlewood had not given permission to the band to release the cover in its original version. In the liner notes of the album's reissue, Mustaine was strongly critical of Hazlewood, noting that he received royalties for almost ten years before objecting to the altered version."

Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, called the album a \"ferocious blast of high-energy thrash metal\", weakened by a thin production. Similarly, Steve Huey from AllMusic observed that the album is \"as raw as Megadeth gets\". However, Huey noted that the riffs and compositions weren't completely developed, and called Mustaine's vocals \"amateurish at best\". Chad Bowar from About.com said that Megadeth were still \"finding their way\" on their debut album, but remarked that the band showed great potential through angry and passionate musicianship. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters dismissed the original recording, but praised the re-release, writing that the album \"blazes on at a furious pace\". According to him, the record greatly influenced the heavy metal genre in the upcoming two decades. Sputnikmusic staff member Mike Stagno agreed with the praise for the remaster, saying that the \"fuzzy\" sound of the original release was replaced with a clearer production. Even so, he opined that the album still retained the \"thrashy\" sound characteristic for the band during this period. Mike Marsh of Drowned in Sound recommended the music \"for people who want it loud, fast and brutal\". In a retrospective review for KNAC, Frank Meyer said that the album put Megadeth at the forefront of heavy metal scene in the early 1980s and credited it for paving the way for thrash metal's arrival. CMJ New Music Report praised Mustaine's \"masterful\" wordplay and called the record a representative of \"the golden age of speed metal\"."

        "content": "The Deer Hunter is a 1978 American epic war drama film co-written and directed by Michael Cimino about a trio of Slavic-American steelworkers whose lives were changed forever after fighting in the Vietnam War. The three soldiers are played by Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage, with John Cazale (in his final role), Meryl Streep, and George Dzundza playing supporting roles. The story takes place in Clairton, Pennsylvania, a working-class town on the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, and in Vietnam. The film was based in part on an unproduced screenplay called The Man Who Came to Play by Louis A. Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, about Las Vegas and Russian roulette. Producer Michael Deeley, who bought the script, hired writer/director Michael Cimino who, with Deric Washburn, rewrote the script, taking the Russian roulette element and placing it in the Vietnam War. The film went over-budget and over-schedule, and ended up costing $15 million. The scenes depicting Russian roulette were highly controversial after the film's release. EMI Films, who produced the film, released the film internationally while Universal Pictures handled its distribution in North America. The film received acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for Cimino's direction, the performances of its cast (particularly from De Niro, Walken, Cazale, and Streep), and its screenplay, realistic themes and tones, and cinematography. It was also successful at the box office, grossing $49 million. At the 51st Academy Awards, it was nominated for nine Academy Awards, and won five: Best Picture, Best Director for Cimino, Best Supporting Actor for Walken, Best Sound, and Best Film Editing. The film marked Meryl Streep's first Academy Award nomination (for Best Supporting Actress). It has been featured on lists of the best films ever made, such as being named the 53rd-greatest American film of all time by the American Film Institute in 2007 in their 10th Anniversary Edition of the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1996, as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\""

(They seem to be Slavic Americans and could be Russian Americans, Ukrainian Americans, Rusyn Americans, etc.) Mike, Steven and Nick are preparing to leave for military service in Vietnam. Steven is engaged to Angela, who is secretly impregnated by another man. Mike and Nick are close friends who live together and both love Linda, who will be moving into their home to escape from her abusive and alcoholic father. During Steven and Angela's wedding, Nick asks for Linda's hand in marriage, and she accepts. As the newlyweds drive away, Nick asks Mike to not abandon him in Vietnam. Mike, Nick and their friends make a final deer hunt. As is his custom, Mike fires a single shot, which successfully takes a deer. In Vietnam in early 1969, Mike is suddenly reunited with Nick and Steven, but the trio, along with other soldiers, are captured by the Viet Cong. They are imprisoned in a cage along a river and forced to rotate participating in a torturous game of Russian roulette against other prisoners while the jailers place bets. Steven yields to fear and exhaustion and fires his round at the ceiling. As punishment for breaking the rules, Steven is thrown into a separate cage (a \"water dungeon\") that is immersed in a river filled with rats and dead bodies. Mike convinces Nick to attempt an escape by inserting three rounds into the revolver's cylinder; after convincing their tormentors with the increased risk, they kill the captors and free Steven from the cage. Making their escape, the three float along the river's current on a large tree trunk. When they reach a suspension bridge, they are rescued by an American helicopter, but Steven is extremely weak and falls into the water. Mike immediately jumps in to save Steven, while Nick is held back by the helicopter crew. Steven's legs are broken in the fall, and Mike carries him until they meet a caravan of South Vietnamese soldiers and refugees fleeing to Saigon. Nick is admitted to a U.S. military hospital for physical and psychological trauma.  Once released, Nick ventures into Saigon. In his wandering, he hears gunshots emanating from a gambling den and attempts to leave, reminded of his previous torture experience. However, French businessman Julien Grinda persuades him to come inside and play for him. Nick rebuffs Julien and insults the participants by interrupting a game of roulette by pulling the trigger on the gun and grabbing a stack of cash. Mike happens to be present in the den as a spectator and recognizes Nick, but is unsuccessful in getting his attention as Nick and Julien hurriedly leave, with Nick throwing the cash into the streets. In 1970, Mike returns home, but immediately has difficulty reintegrating into civilian life. He fails to appear at a welcome-home party organized by Linda and his friends, opting instead to stay alone overnight in a hotel up the highway. He visits Linda the next morning and learns that Nick has deserted. Mike then visits Angela, who is now the mother of a child, but has slipped into catatonia following the return of Steven, who has been rendered an invalid. Stan, Axel and John remained stateside and their distance with Mike is evident, as they seem to understand nothing of war or what Mike has gone through.  The following days further prove Mike's disorientation; he is unable to shoot a deer during a hunting trip and is later outraged to see Stan jokingly threatening Axel with a handgun. To make Stan understand the gravity of his gesture, Mike violently grabs the gun out of Stan's hand.  Leaving one round in the cylinder, Mike points the gun at Stan's forehead and pulls the trigger on an empty chamber. Mike visits Steven at a veterans' hospital; both of Steven's legs have been amputated, and he has lost the use of an arm. Steven refuses to come home, saying he no longer fits in.  He tells Mike that he has been regularly receiving large sums of money from Vietnam. Mike suspects that Nick is the source of these payments, and forces Steven to return home to Angela.  Mike returns to Vietnam in search of Nick. Wandering around Saigon, which is now in a state of chaos shortly before its fall, Mike finds Julien and persuades him to take him to the gambling den. Mike finds himself facing Nick, who has become a professional in the macabre game and fails to recognize Mike. Mike attempts to bring Nick back to reason, but Nick, who is now a heroin addict, is indifferent. During a game of Russian roulette, Mike invokes memories of their hunting trips. Nick recalls Mike's \"one shot\" method and smiles before pulling the trigger and killing himself as Mike tearfully looks on. Mike and his friends attend Nick's funeral, and the atmosphere at their local bar is dim and silent. Moved by emotion, John begins to sing \"God Bless America\" in honor of Nick, as everyone joins in."

Producer Deeley pursued De Niro for The Deer Hunter because he felt that he needed De Niro's star power to sell a film with a \"gruesome-sounding storyline and a barely known director\". \"I liked the script, and [Cimino] had done a lot of prep,\" said De Niro. \"I was impressed.\" De Niro prepared by socializing with steelworkers in local bars and by visiting their homes. Cimino introduced De Niro as his agent, Harry Ufland. No one recognized him. De Niro claims this was his most physically exhausting film. He explained that the scene where Mike visits Steven in the hospital for the first time was the most emotional scene that he was ever involved with. For the film, he received his first one-million-dollar fee. De Niro was a last-minute replacement for Roy Scheider, who dropped out of the production two weeks before the start of filming due to \"creative differences\"; Universal managed to keep Scheider to his three-picture contract by forcing him to do Jaws 2 (1978). Christopher Walken as Corporal Nikanor Chevotarevich (\"Nick\"). His performance garnered an Academy Award, for Best Supporting Actor. John Savage as Corporal Steven Pushkov. John Cazale as Stanley (\"Stan\"/\"Stosh\"). All scenes involving Cazale, who had terminal cancer, were filmed first. Because of his illness, the studio initially wanted to fire him, but Streep, with whom he was in a relationship, and Cimino threatened to walk away if they did. He was also uninsurable, and according to Streep, De Niro paid for his insurance because he wanted Cazale in the film. This was Cazale's last film, as he died shortly after filming wrapped. Cazale never saw the finished film. Meryl Streep as Linda. Prior to The Deer Hunter, Streep was seen briefly in Fred Zinnemann's Julia (1977) and the eight-hour miniseries Holocaust (1978), which she took a role in, in order to help with Cazale's cancer treatment. In the screenplay, Streep's role was negligible. Cimino explained the set-up to Streep and suggested that she write her own lines."

In addition to attracting buyers, Deeley felt De Niro was \"the right age, apparently tough as hell, and immensely talented.\" Hiring De Niro turned out to be a casting coup because he knew so many actors in New York. De Niro brought Meryl Streep to the attention of Cimino and Deeley. With Streep came John Cazale. De Niro also accompanied Cimino to scout locations for the steel mill sequence as well as rehearsed with the actors to use the workshops as a bonding process. Each of the six principal male characters carried a photo in his back pocket depicting them all together as children, to enhance the sense of camaraderie amongst them. Additionally, director Cimino instructed the props department to fashion complete Pennsylvania IDs for each of them, including driver's licenses, medical cards, and various other pieces of paraphernalia, to enhance each actor's sense of his character."

Deeley purchased the first draft of a spec script called The Man Who Came to Play, written by Louis A. Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, for $19,000. The spec script was about people who go to Las Vegas to play Russian roulette. \"The screenplay had struck me as brilliant,\" wrote Deeley, \"but it wasn't complete. The trick would be to find a way to turn a very clever piece of writing into a practical, realizable film.\" When the movie was being planned during the mid-1970s, Vietnam was still a taboo subject with all major Hollywood studios. According to producer Michael Deeley, the standard response was \"no American would want to see a picture about Vietnam\". After consulting various Hollywood agents, Deeley found writer-director Michael Cimino, represented by Stan Kamen at the William Morris Agency. Deeley was impressed by Cimino's TV commercial work and crime film Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974). Cimino was confident that he could further develop the principal characters of The Man Who Came to Play without losing the essence of the original. After Cimino was hired, he was called into a meeting with Garfinkle and Redeker at the EMI office. According to Deeley, Cimino questioned the need for the Russian roulette element of the script, and Redeker made such a passionate case for it that he ended up literally on his knees. Over the course of further meetings, Cimino and Deeley discussed the work needed at the front of the script, and Cimino believed he could develop the stories of the main characters in the first 20 minutes of the film."

He recalls, \"We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired.

Cimino and Washburn's revised script distilled the three aspects of Merle's personality and separated them out into three distinct characters. They became three old friends who grew up in the same small industrial town and worked in the same steel mill, and in due course were drafted together to Vietnam. In the original script, the roles of Merle (later renamed Mike) and Nick were reversed in the last half of the film. Nick returns home to Linda, while Mike remains in Vietnam, sends money home to help Steven, and meets his tragic fate at the Russian roulette table. A Writers' Guild arbitration process awarded Washburn sole \"Screenplay by\" credit. Garfinkle and Redeker were given a shared \"Story by\" credit with Cimino and Washburn. Deeley felt the story credits for Garfinkle and Redeker \"did them less than justice.\" Cimino contested the results of the arbitration. \"In their Nazi wisdom,\" added Cimino, \"[they] didn't give me the credit because I would be producer, director and writer.\" All four writers\u2014Cimino, Washburn, Garfinkle, and Redeker\u2014received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay for the film."

All scenes were shot on location (no sound stages). \"There was discussion about shooting the film on a back lot, but the material demanded more realism,\" says Spikings. The cast and crew viewed large amounts of news footage from the war to ensure authenticity. The film was shot over a period of six months. The Clairton scenes comprise footage shot in eight different towns in four states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Ohio. The initial budget of the film was $8.5 million. Meryl Streep accepted the role of the \"vague, stock girlfriend\", in order to remain for the duration of filming with John Cazale, who had been diagnosed with lung cancer. De Niro had spotted Streep in her stage production of The Cherry Orchard and had suggested that she play his girlfriend Linda. Before the beginning of principal photography, Deeley had a meeting with the film's appointed line producer Robert Relyea. Deeley hired Relyea after meeting him on the set of Bullitt (1968) and was impressed with his experience. However, Relyea declined the job, refusing to disclose his reason why. Deeley suspected that Relyea sensed in director Cimino something that would have made production difficult. As a result, Cimino was acting without the day-to-day supervision of a producer. Because Deeley was busy overseeing the production of Sam Peckinpah's Convoy (1978), he hired John Peverall to oversee Cimino's shoot. Peverall's expertise with budgeting and scheduling made him a natural successor to Relyea, and Peverall knew enough about the picture to be elevated to producer status. \"John is a straightforward Cornishman who had worked his way up to become a production supervisor,\" wrote Deeley, \"and we employed him as EMI's watchman on certain pictures.\""

St. Theodosius' Father Stephen Kopestonsky was cast as the priest at the wedding. The reception scene was filmed at nearby Lemko Hall. The amateur extras lined up for the crowded wedding-dance sequences drank real liquor and beer. The scenes were filmed in the summer, but were set in the fall. To accomplish a look of fall, individual leaves were removed from deciduous trees. Zsigmond also had to desaturate the colors of the exterior shots, partly in camera and in the laboratory processing. The production manager asked each of the Russian immigrant extras to bring to the location a gift-wrapped box to double for wedding presents. The manager figured if the extras did this, not only would the production save time and money, but the gifts would also look more authentic. Once the unit unwrapped and the extras disappeared, the crew discovered to their amusement that the boxes weren't empty but filled with real presents, from china to silverware. \"Who got to keep all these wonderful offerings,\" wrote Deeley \"is a mystery I never quite fathomed.\" Cimino originally claimed that the wedding scene would take up 21 minutes of screen time. In the end, it took 51 minutes. Deeley believes that Cimino always planned to make this prologue last for an hour, and \"the plan was to be advanced by stealth rather than straight dealing.\" At this point in the production, nearly halfway through principal photography, Cimino was already over budget, and producer Spikings could tell from the script that shooting the extended scene could sink the project."

The woman who was given the task of casting the extras in Thailand had much difficulty finding a local to play the vicious-looking individual who runs the game. The first actor hired turned out to be incapable of slapping De Niro in the face. The casting agent then found a local Thai man, Somsak Sengvilai, who held a particular dislike of Americans, and so cast him. De Niro suggested that Walken be slapped by one of the guards without any warning. The reaction on Walken's face was genuine. Producer Deeley has said that Cimino shot the brutal Vietcong Russian roulette scenes brilliantly and more efficiently than any other part of the film. De Niro and Savage performed their own stunts in the fall into the river, filming the thirty-foot drop fifteen times in two days. During the helicopter stunt, the skids caught on the rope bridge as the helicopter rose, which threatened to seriously injure De Niro and Savage. The actors gestured and shouted to the crew in the helicopter to warn them. Footage of this is included in the film. According to Cimino, De Niro requested a live cartridge in the revolver for the scene in which he subjects John Cazale's character to an impromptu game of Russian roulette, to heighten the intensity of the situation. Cazale agreed without protest, but obsessively rechecked the gun before each take to make sure that the live round was not next in the chamber. While appearing later in the film, the first scenes shot upon arrival in Thailand were the hospital sequences between Walken and the military doctor. Deeley believed that this scene was \"the spur that would earn him an Academy Award\". In the final scene in the gambling den between Mike and Nick, Cimino had Walken and De Niro improvise in one take. His direction to his actors: \"You put the gun to your head, Chris, you shoot, you fall over and Bobby cradles your head.\""

It is a brilliant symbol because, in the context of this story, it makes any ideological statement about the war superfluous.\" Film critic and biographer David Thomson also agrees that the film works despite the controversy: \"There were complaints that the North Vietnamese had not employed Russian roulette. It was said that the scenes in Saigon were fanciful or imagined. It was also suggested that De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage were too old to have enlisted for Vietnam (Savage, the youngest of the three, was thirty). Three decades later [written in 2008], 'imagination' seems to have stilled those worries\u00a0... and The Deer Hunter is one of the great American films.\" In her review, Pauline Kael wrote \"The Vietcong are treated in the standard inscrutable-evil Oriental style of the Japanese in the Second World War movies\u00a0...

All's fair in love and war.\" Producer Spikings, while proud of the film, regrets the way the Vietnamese were portrayed. \"I don't think any of us meant it to be exploitive,\" Spikings said. \"But I think we were\u00a0... ignorant. I can't think of a better word for it. I didn't realize how badly we'd behaved to the Vietnamese people\u00a0...\" Producer Deeley, on the other hand, was quick to defend Cimino's comments on the nature and motives of the film: \"The Deer Hunter wasn't really 'about' Vietnam. It was something very different. It wasn't about drugs or the collapse of the morale of the soldiers. It was about how individuals respond to pressure: different men reacting quite differently. The film was about three steel workers in extraordinary circumstances. Apocalypse Now is surreal. The Deer Hunter is a parable\u00a0... Men who fight and lose an unworthy war face some obvious and unpalatable choices. They can blame their leaders.. or they can blame themselves. Self-blame has been a great burden for many war veterans. So how does a soldier come to terms with his defeat and yet still retain his self-respect? One way is to present the conquering enemy as so inhuman, and the battle between the good guys (us) and the bad guys (them) so uneven, as to render defeat irrelevant. Inhumanity was the theme of The Deer Hunter's portrayal of the North Vietnamese prison guards forcing American POWs to play Russian roulette. The audience's sympathy with prisoners who (quite understandably) cracked thus completes the chain. Accordingly, some veterans who suffered in that war found the Russian roulette a valid allegory.\""

        "content": "Upon its release, The Deer Hunter received acclaim from critics, who considered it the best American epic since Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. The film was praised for its depiction of realistic working-class settings and environment; Cimino's direction; the performances of De Niro, Walken, Streep, Savage, Dzundza and Cazale; the symphonic shifts of tone and pacing in moving from America to Vietnam; the tension during the Russian roulette scenes; and the themes of American disillusionment. The film holds an approval rating of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 79 reviews, with an average score of 8.60/10. The consensus reads: \"Its greatness is blunted by its length and one-sided point of view, but the film's weaknesses are overpowered by Michael Cimino's sympathetic direction and a series of heartbreaking performances from Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken\". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and called it \"one of the most emotionally shattering films ever made.\" Gene Siskel from the Chicago Tribune praised the film, saying, \"This is a big film, dealing with big issues, made on a grand scale. Much of it, including some casting decisions, suggest inspiration by The Godfather.\" Leonard Maltin also gave the film four stars, calling it a \"sensitive, painful, evocative work\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times called The Deer Hunter \"a big, awkward, crazily ambitious motion picture that comes as close to being a popular epic as any movie about this country since The Godfather. Its vision is that of an original, major new filmmaker.\" David Denby of New York called it \"an epic\" with \"qualities that we almost never see any more\u2014range and power and breadth of experience.\" Jack Kroll of Time asserted it put director Cimino \"right at the center of film culture.\" Stephen Farber pronounced the film in New West magazine as \"the greatest anti-war movie since La Grande Illusion.\" However, The Deer Hunter was not without critical backlash. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote a positive review with some reservations: \"[It is] a small minded film with greatness in it\u00a0... with an enraptured view of common life\u00a0... [but] enraging, because, despite its ambitiousness and scale, it has no more moral intelligence than the Eastwood action pictures.\" Andrew Sarris wrote that the film was \"massively vague, tediously elliptical, and mysteriously hysterical\u00a0... It is perhaps significant that the actors remain more interesting than the characters they play.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum disparaged The Deer Hunter as an \"Oscar-laden weepie about macho buddies\" and \"a disgusting account of what the evil Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans\". John Simon of New York wrote: \"For all its pretensions to something newer and better, this film is only an extension of the old Hollywood war-movie lie. The enemy is still bestial and stupid, and no match for our purity and heroism; only we no longer wipe up the floor with him\u2014rather, we litter it with his guts.\" In a review of The Deer Hunter for Chicago magazine, Studs Terkel wrote that he was \"appalled by its shameless dishonesty,\" and that \"not since The Birth of a Nation has a non-Caucasian people been portrayed in so barbaric a fashion.\" Cimino's dishonesty \"was to project a sadistic psyche not only onto 'Charlie' but to all the Vietnamese portrayed.\" Author Karina Longworth notes that Streep \"made a case for female empowerment by playing a woman to whom empowerment was a foreign concept\u2014a normal lady from an average American small town, for whom subservience was the only thing she knew\". She states that The Deer Hunter \"evokes a version of dominant masculinity in which male friendship is a powerful force\". It has a \"credibly humanist message\", and that the \"slow study of the men in blissfully ignorant homeland machismo is crucial to it\". During the 29th Berlin International Film Festival in 1979, the Soviet delegation expressed its indignation with the film which, in their opinion, insulted the Vietnamese people in numerous scenes. Other communist states also voiced their solidarity with the \"heroic people of Vietnam\". They protested against the screening of the film and insisted that it violated the statutes of the festival because it in no way contributed to the \"improvement of mutual understanding between the peoples of the world\". The ensuing domino effect led to the walk-outs of the Cubans, East Germans, Hungarians, Bulgarians, Poles and Czechoslovakians, and two members of the jury resigned in sympathy."

The failure of Heaven's Gate led several critics to revise their positions on The Deer Hunter. Canby said in his famous review of Heaven's Gate, \"[The film] fails so completely that you might suspect Mr. Cimino sold his soul to the Devil to obtain the success of The Deer Hunter, and the Devil has just come around to collect.\" Andrew Sarris wrote in his review of Heaven's Gate, \"I'm a little surprised that many of the same critics who lionized Cimino for The Deer Hunter have now thrown him to the wolves with equal enthusiasm.\" Sarris added, \"I was never taken in\u00a0... Hence, the stupidity and incoherence in Heaven's Gate came as no surprise since very much the same stupidity and incoherence had been amply evident in The Deer Hunter.\" In his book Final Cut: Dreams and Disaster in the Making of Heaven's Gate, Steven Bach wrote, \"critics seemed to feel obliged to go on the record about The Deer Hunter, to demonstrate that their critical credentials were un-besmirched by having been, as Sarris put it, 'taken in.'\" Film critic Mark Kermode described it as \"a genuinely terrible film\".

He nagged, charmed, threw parties, he created word-of-mouth\u00a0\u2013 everything that could be done in Hollywood to promote a project. Because he had no apparent motive for this promotion, it had an added power and legitimacy and it finally did start to penetrate the minds of the Universal's sales people that they actually had in their hands something a bit more significant than the usual.\" Deeley added that Carr's promotion of the film was influential in positioning The Deer Hunter for Oscar nominations. On the Sneak Previews special \"Oscar Preview for 1978\", Roger Ebert correctly predicted that The Deer Hunter would win for Best Picture while Gene Siskel predicted that Coming Home would win. However, Ebert incorrectly guessed that Robert De Niro would win for Best Actor for Deer Hunter and Jill Clayburgh would win for Best Actress for An Unmarried Woman while Siskel called the wins for Jon Voight as Best Actor and Jane Fonda as Best Actress, both for Coming Home. Both Ebert and Siskel called the win for Christopher Walken receiving the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. According to producer Deeley, orchestrated lobbying against The Deer Hunter was led by Warren Beatty, whose own picture Heaven Can Wait had multiple nominations. Beatty also used ex-girlfriends in his campaign: Julie Christie, serving on the jury at the Berlin Film Festival where Deer Hunter was screened, joined the walkout of the film by the Russian jury members. Jane Fonda also criticized The Deer Hunter in public. Deeley suggested that her criticisms partly stemmed from the competition between her film Coming Home vying with The Deer Hunter for Best Picture. According to Deeley, he planted a friend of his in the Oscar press area behind the stage to ask Fonda if she had seen The Deer Hunter. Fonda replied she had not seen the film, and to this day she still has not. As the Oscars drew near, the backlash against The Deer Hunter gathered strength. When the limos pulled up to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on April 9, 1979, they were met by demonstrators, mostly from the Los Angeles chapter of Vietnam Veterans Against the War. The demonstrators waved placards covered with slogans that read \"No Oscars for racism\" and \"The Deer Hunter a bloody lie\" and thrust pamphlets berating Deer Hunter into long lines of limousine windows. Washburn, nominated for Best Original Screenplay, claims his limousine was pelted with stones. According to Variety, \"Police and The Deer Hunter protesters clashed in a brief but bloody battle that resulted in 13 arrests.\" De Niro was so anxious that he did not attend the Oscars ceremony. He asked the Academy to sit out the show backstage, but when the Academy refused, De Niro stayed home in New York. Producer Deeley made a deal with fellow producer David Puttnam, whose film Midnight Express was nominated, that each would take $500 to the ceremony so if one of them won, the winner would give the loser the $500 to \"drown his sorrows in style.\""

The Deer Hunter unleashed a new, raw dynamic in combat and action, paving the way for Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and Clint Eastwood's Iwo Jima films.\" In a 2011 interview with Rotten Tomatoes, actor William Fichtner retrospectively stated that he and his partner were silenced after seeing the film, stating that \"the human experience was just so pointed; their journeys were so difficult, as life is sometimes. I remember after seeing it, walking down the street \u2014 I actually went with a girl on a date and saw The Deer Hunter, and we left the theater and walked for like an hour and nobody said anything; we were just kind of stunned about that.\" The deaths of approximately 25 people who died playing Russian roulette were reported as having been influenced by scenes in the movie."

Jan Scruggs, a Vietnam veteran who became a counselor with the U.S. Department of Labor, thought of the idea of building a National Memorial for Viet Nam Veterans after seeing a screening of the film in March 1979, and he established and operated the memorial fund which paid for it.

        "content": "Attention-craving Mysto the Magician rudely interrupts a world-famous opera singer, Butch the Great Poochini (a pun on opera composer Giacomo Puccini), in the midst of his rehearsal to let him perform an opening act at the show that night. Mysto's tricks primarily come from his magic wand, which can summon flowers and rabbits. After Mysto performs a poorly executed dance and asks him if he gets the job, an annoyed and the unimpressed Poochini emphatically says \"NO!\" as he kicks Mysto out the door into the alley. While on the ground, the self-pitying Mysto plays with his magic wand, but soon realizes he can pass it off as a conductor's baton; being further inspired by seeing himself in place of the conductor in a promotional poster outside the door and plans to get revenge on Butch. Later, as the performance is starting he freezes the conductor, steals his tuxedo, nose and hair; then takes his place in front of the orchestra to conduct the Butch, who is unaware of the imposter in front of him. During the performance, in which Butch (performed by the Colombian baritone Carlos Julio Ram\u00edrez) sings Largo al factotum from Gioacchino Rossini's 1816 opera The Barber of Seville, Mysto unleashes a variety of tricks with his wand. He begins tamely by summoning rabbits and flowers, then turning Poochini into a ballet dancer, an Indian, a tennis player, a prisoner rock-breaker, and a football player. Mysto's revenge gets more brutal as he throws a cymbal on Butch's head, turning him Chinese(Song unknown); and next transforming him into a country singer and sings \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\". After levitating Butch to the ceiling and slamming him down to the stage, Mysto turns him into a square dance caller. Butch actually continues his performance for a good 20 seconds after this without interruption, except for the \"hair gag\". Poochini is then transformed into a Shirley Temple-esque child (who sings \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\" before the balloon blows up and pops), then a Carmen Miranda-type singer, singing \"Mam\u00e3e Eu Quero\" (with two rabbits accompanying him on guitar) after an irritated audience member hurls an armload of fruit onto Butch's head where it piles up like Miranda's headdress. The same man later sprays black ink on Butch from a fountain pen, turning him into Bill Kenny from the Ink Spots, then drops an anvil on top of him, crushing him into a shorter height and deepening his voice to that of the Ink Spots' bass, \"Hoppy\" Jones (parodying the Ink Spots' famous \"Top & Bottom\" format).  After a rabbit hoses off Butch's face and another rabbit works his arm like an automobile jack to get him back up to full height, the fun continues as he is transformed into a Hawaiian singer with two rabbits for harmony. Reaching the end of the number, Mysto's plan is finally revealed to Butch as his wig falls off. Mysto quickly puts the wig back on, but it's too late. Now set for revenge of his own, Butch furiously grabs the hairpiece and puts it on while a now defeated and exposed Mysto cowardly tries to flee; but Poochini, having also grabbed the magic wand, stops the magician by using the wand on him as placing Mysto to the stage and unleashes the same gimmicks on the hapless magician at high speed. A red curtain with the words \"The End\" then falls on the magician and the rabbits (at the end of the Hawaiian singer shtick) thus ending the cartoon."

        "content": "The concept of cartoons with insinuating situations is hardly new\u2014Tex Avery especially featured a few quick jokes of this nature in his cartoons. Magical Maestro, for example, shows Poochini with a male and female rabbit on each arm. He lowers his arms behind his back and when he raises them again, he now has an additional dozen baby rabbits on them, six on each arm. This cartoon features a gimmick only seen in Tex Avery films, the \"hair gag\". Because cartoons were shown originally in movie theatres, the film strip, if loaded incorrectly, would rub against the gate mechanism, shaving off tiny \"hairs\" of celluloid. These hairs would get caught in the \"gate\" of the projector. Sometimes it would skitter across the projection light, resulting in a gigantic hair appearing on the movie screen. In this cartoon, the opera singer pauses mid-song to pluck the offending hair from the film and tosses it aside, one of Avery's many ways of his characters breaking the fourth wall. It wasn't the first time Avery used this gag: it was also used in Aviation Vacation (1941). The role of Poochini is portrayed by Butch the Irish dog, a frequent star of Avery's cartoons of that era (often alongside Droopy)."

        "content": "In Stratford, Ontario, in 1904, William Spence (Fredric March), a medical student on the verge of becoming a doctor, receives \"The Call\" while passing a Methodist church one Sunday. His bride-to-be, Hope Morris (Martha Scott), accepts his decision to enter the ministry with a whole heart despite the disappointment of her prominent and affluent parents. Will \"dives right in,\" but, with no vacancies in Canada, is posted as a circuit minister to a small town in rural Iowa, beginning a life for them of frequent moves around the district, dingy parsonages, and scraping a living from poor boxes and performing weddings. Hope yearns for a decent parsonage and a sense of permanence for their children, but uncomplainingly provides them a good life and a supportive home for Will. For his part, Will understands his own nature and laughs at his own foibles, bending where he can in good conscience. He often enters situations in anger or to instruct but leaves humbled and renewed in spirit. While Will sincerely lives by and teaches by example (which includes his family) the tenets of the Methodist Discipline, he also learns from his congregations to be flexible and change with the times. When their third child, a boy, is born, Hope and Will cannot agree on a name and he remains unbaptized for three months. Hope wants to name the baby William Spence Jr., but Will does not like the idea of his son going without a middle name as he did. He wants the boy to have and be called in \"the good old Canadian custom\" by the middle name of Frazer. Will seems to give in to Hope but the following Sunday baptizes him William Frazer Spence. Hope serenely accepts the change. Oldest son Hartzell (named for Will's guiding bishop) has a hard time coping with the idea that a minister's son should be an example to the other boys. Will explains that \"a pastor's family walks a tightrope, balancing with one foot on earth and one foot already in Heaven.\" After learning that Hartzell has been sneaking into the movies, a pastime seemingly forbidden by the Discipline, Will takes him to the theater to point out why the film is bad for him. They see a western but rather than finding it sinful, Will is impressed by its moral. The following Sunday he preaches a sermon advising his congregation that young people may have something to teach their elders. In the 1920s, the family is assigned to a church in Denver, Colorado, that, despite having many well-heeled members, is old, uncomfortable and decrepit. In a time of economic prosperity for the country, the Spences cope with possibly their most dilapidated parsonage yet. Will has come to appreciate his wife's serenity with life and resolves to provide her a decent parsonage by building a new church. His plans at first are thwarted by power struggles among several snobbish members of the church. He loses one wealthy patron, Mrs. Sandow (Beulah Bondi), to the Baptists when he refuses to stop ministering to her chauffeur (Harry Davenport), and another, influential banker Preston Thurston (Gene Lockhart), after organizing a children's choir to replace the off-key church choir, run for years by Mrs. Thurston (Laura Hope Crews), her family and social circle. Soon after, Hartzell (Frankie Thomas) is expelled from school because of a gossip campaign falsely accusing him of making a young girl pregnant and forcing her family to move to San Francisco. A deeply discouraged Will investigates a job offer in California that offers the beautiful church and parsonage he and Hope have always dreamed of but discovers that he cannot surrender in his struggles with the Thurstons. He seeks out the girl's family and learns that there is no truth to any part of the rumor. Returning to Denver, Will confronts Mrs. Thurston and her circle, who started the rumors to punish Will, and suggests that if they don't contribute substantially to the building of the new church, he will call them out in his sermons. A repentant Mrs. Sandow begs to return to the church and Will inveigles from her the stained glass window, new Skinner organ, and carillon that as luxuries are being cut from the plans to finance a recreation center for the church. A year later, their dream church and parsonage finished, Will accepts the challenge of returning to Iowa to aid a small church in trouble, confident that he leaves behind a revitalized church when its members, including all those with whom he locked horns, gather spontaneously on a weekday morning to sing \"The Church's One Foundation\" as he plays it on the new carillon."

Raymond Massey was Hartzell Spence's choice to play his father while his mother preferred Fredric March. The studio's decision to cast March was made independently of the family's wishes. The Reverend Norman Vincent Peale was hired as a technical advisor on the film. The film which Spence goes to see with Hartzell is William S. Hart's 1917 Western The Silent Man. At the Hollywood premiere of the film, Hart was a guest of honor. In an uncredited role, Gig Young made one of his earlier on-screen performances as a dog groomer seeking a license. The book on which the movie is based takes place and ends well before 1939. However, the use of \"Methodist Church\" in the film is an impossibility because Methodist faith in America did not unify under the name \"Methodist Church\" until after the terms of reunification of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Methodist Protestant Church were agreed upon and voted upon in Kansas City in 1939."

        "title": "Pet Sounds_Summary",
        "content": "Pet Sounds is the eleventh studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released May 16, 1966 on Capitol Records. It was initially met with a lukewarm critical and commercial response in the U.S., peaking at number 10 on Billboards Top LPs chart. In the UK, the album was lauded by critics and reached number 2 on the Top 40 Albums Chart, remaining in the top ten for six months. Promoted there as \"the most progressive pop album ever\", Pet Sounds garnered recognition for its ambitious production, sophisticated music, and emotional lyrical content. It is considered to be among the greatest and most influential albums in music history. The album was produced, arranged, and almost entirely composed by Brian Wilson with guest lyricist Tony Asher. It was recorded largely between January and April 1966, a year after Wilson quit touring with his bandmates. His goal was to create \"the greatest rock album ever made\"\u2014a cohesive work with no filler tracks. It is sometimes considered a Wilson solo album that builds upon the advancements of The Beach Boys Today! (1965). Lead single \"Caroline, No\" was issued as his official solo debut. It was followed by two singles credited to the group: \"Sloop John B\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (backed with \"God Only Knows\"). Incorporating elements of pop, jazz, exotica, classical, and the avant-garde, Wilson's Wall of Sound-based orchestrations mixed conventional rock set-ups with elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, found sounds, and instruments never before associated with rock, such as bicycle bells, French horn, flutes, Electro-Theremin, string sections, and beverage cans. The album could not be replicated live and was the first time a group departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format for a whole LP. An early concept album, it consists mainly of introspective songs like \"I Know There's an Answer\", a critique of LSD users; and \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\", the first use of a theremin-like instrument on a rock record. The album's unprecedented total production cost exceeded $70,000 (equivalent to $ in ). An expanded edition, The Pet Sounds Sessions, was released in 1997 with isolated vocals and instrumental versions, session highlights, and the album's first true stereo mix. Pet Sounds revolutionized the field of music production and the role of producers within the music industry, introduced novel approaches to orchestration, chord voicings, and structural harmonies, and furthered the cultural legitimization of popular music, a greater public appreciation for albums, the use of recording studios as an instrument, and the development of psychedelic music and progressive/art rock. It has topped several critics' and musicians' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by NME, Mojo, Uncut, and  The Times. In 2004, it was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating over one million units sold."

        "content": "The July 1964 release of the Beach Boys' sixth album All Summer Long marked an end to the group's beach-themed period. From then, their recorded material took a significantly different stylistic and lyrical path. In January 1965, to focus his efforts on writing and recording, 22-year-old Brian Wilson declared to his bandmates that he would not accompany them on future concert tours. The rest of the group \u2013 Brian's brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine \u2013 continued to tour without Wilson, who was replaced on the road by Bruce Johnston of Bruce & Terry. Wilson immediately showcased great advances in his musical development with the 1965 albums The Beach Boys Today! and Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!). Released in March, Today! signaled a departure from the Beach Boys' previous records with its orchestral approach, intimate subject matter, and abandonment of themes related to surfing, cars, or superficial expressions of love. Wilson also directed his new lyrical approach toward the autobiographical, with his songs written from the perspective of vulnerable, neurotic, and insecure narrators. Summer Days followed three months later and represented a bridge between Wilson's progressive musical conceptions and the group's traditional pre-1965 approach. In April, after consuming a full dose of LSD, Wilson had what he considered to be \"a very religious experience\" and claimed to have seen God. A week after his first LSD trip, he began suffering from auditory hallucinations and for the remainder of the year experienced considerable paranoia. In addition to worsening his mental state, Wilson's progressive drug habits exacerbated the strain on his recent marriage to 18-year-old singer Marilyn Rovell. He believed that LSD influenced the writing of Pet Sounds because it \"brought out some of the insecurities in me, which I think went into the music.\" Wilson also attributed his greater sense of creative freedom to his use of marijuana. On July 12, Wilson recorded a backing track for \"Sloop John B\", but after laying down a rough lead vocal, he set the song aside for some time, concentrating on the recording of what became their next LP, the informal studio jam Beach Boys' Party!, in response to their record company Capitol's request for a Beach Boys album for the Christmas 1965 market. In October, Wilson and his wife moved from a rented apartment in West Hollywood to a home on Laurel Way in Beverly Hills, where he said he spent the subsequent months contemplating \"the new direction of the group\". In a 1977 interview, Wilson stated, Wilson devoted the last three months of 1965 to polishing the vocals of \"Sloop John B\" and recording six new original compositions. \"The Little Girl I Once Knew\", released as a standalone single in November, was the last original Beach Boys song issued before any Pet Sounds tracks. In December, Capitol issued the Party! track \"Barbara Ann\" as a single without the group's knowledge or approval. Brian expressed to reporters that the song was not a \"produced\" record and should not be considered indicative of the group's upcoming music. From January 7 to 29, the rest of the band went away on a concert tour of Japan and Hawaii."

        "content": "While at a recording studio in Los Angeles in 1965, Wilson met Tony Asher, a 26-year-old lyricist and copywriter working in jingles for an advertising agency. The two exchanged ideas for songs, and soon after, Wilson heard of Asher's writing abilities from mutual friend Loren Schwartz. In December, Wilson contacted Asher about a possible lyric collaboration, wanting to do something \"completely different\" with someone he had never written with before. Asher accepted the offer, and within ten days, they were writing together, starting with \"You Still Believe in Me\". Wilson and Asher wrote together over a two-to-three week period at Wilson's home, likely between January and February 1966. A typical writing session started either with Wilson playing a melody or chord patterns that he was working on, by discussing a recent record that Wilson liked the feel of, or by discussing a subject that Wilson had always wanted to write a song about. They referred to their rough musical sketches as \"feels\", per the vernacular of the time. To inspire creativity, they sometimes smoked marijuana together. The lyrics to their songs were finished before the recording of any backing tracks (except for \"You Still Believe in Me\") and recording started virtually as soon as the compositions were written. Asher maintained that he served mainly as a source of second opinion for Wilson as he worked out possible melodies and chord progressions, although the two did trade ideas as the songs evolved. On his role as co-lyricist, he said, \"The general tenor of the lyrics was always his\u00a0... and the actual choice of words was usually mine. I was really just his interpreter.\" Contrary to the popular conception that Wilson composed all of the music to Pet Sounds, Asher claimed significant musical contributions to \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\", \"Caroline, No\", and \"That's Not Me\". In Marilyn's recollection, Brian worked on Pet Sounds virtually nonstop, and that when he was home, \"he was either at the piano, arranging, or eating.\" Asher differed, \"I wish I could say Brian was totally committed [to writing the songs]. Let's say he was ... um, very concerned.\" After their songs were completed, Asher visited a few of the recording sessions, most of which were string overdub dates. Wilson wrote two more songs with other collaborators. \"I Know There's an Answer\", which predated the collaboration with Asher, was co-written by Wilson with the Beach Boys' road manager Terry Sachen.  In 1994, Mike Love was awarded co-writing credits on \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"I Know There's an Answer\", but with the exception of his co-credit on \"I'm Waiting for the Day\", his songwriting contributions are thought to have been minimal."

        "content": "Pet Sounds incorporates elements of pop, jazz, classical, exotica, and avant-garde music. According to biographer Jon Stebbins, \"Brian defies any notion of genre safety ... There isn't much rocking here, and even less rolling. Pet Sounds is at times futuristic, progressive, and experimental.\u00a0... there's no boogie, no woogie, and the only blues are in the themes and in Brian's voice.\" Conversely, Bruce Johnston identified \"a tremendous amount\" of doo-wop and R&B influence on the music.  Journalist D. Strauss challenged the notion of whether Pet Sounds should be regarded as rock music. He argued that the album's quality and subversion of rock traditions is \"what created its special place in rock history; there was no category for its fans to place it in ... But placed within the Easy Listening genre-i.e., elevator music-it becomes a historically grounded, if incredibly ambitious, release.\" Genres that have been attributed to Pet Sounds as a whole include progressive pop, chamber pop, psychedelic pop, and art rock. Wilson himself thought of the album as \"chapel rock\u00a0... commercial choir music. I wanted to make an album that would stand up in ten years.\" Although it has been called \"baroque pop\", the often-specious term was not used in critical discussions about Pet Sounds until rock critics in the 1990s began adopting the phrase in reference to artists that the album had influenced. No contemporary press material referred to Pet Sounds as \"baroque\"; instead, commentators used \"progressive\" as their descriptor of choice. Writing in 2021, academic John Howland argued that the album's \"baroque-pop aesthetics\" was limited to \"God Only Knows\"."

        "content": "Commentators and historians frequently cite Pet Sounds as a concept album. Academic Carys Wyn Jones attributes this to the album's \"uniform excellence\" rather than a lyrical theme or musical motif. Brian described Pet Sounds as an \"interpretation\" of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production technique. He stated: \"If you take the Pet Sounds album as a collection of art pieces, each designed to stand alone, yet which belong together, you'll see what I was aiming at.\u00a0... It wasn't really a song concept album, or lyrically a concept album; it was really a production concept album.\" For Pet Sounds, Brian desired to make \"a complete statement\", similar to what he believed the Beatles had done with their newest album Rubber Soul, released in December 1965. The version of the album that he heard was the alternate US edition that was configured by Capitol to have a cohesive folk rock sound. Wilson was impressed that the album appeared to lack filler tracks, a feature that was mostly unheard of at a time when 45\u00a0rpm singles were considered more noteworthy than full-length LPs. Many albums up until the mid-1960s lacked a cohesive artistic goal and were largely used to sell singles at a higher price point. Wilson found that Rubber Soul subverted this by having a wholly consistent thread of music. Inspired, he rushed to his wife and proclaimed, \"Marilyn, I'm gonna make the greatest album! The greatest rock album ever made!\" Comparing Pet Sounds to Rubber Soul, author Michael Zager wrote that Pet Sounds has more in common with Spector's productions, and that the album recycles many of Spector's Wall of Sound production watermarks. Wilson said that he was especially fascinated by the process of combining sounds \"to make another\", and for Pet Sounds, sought to emulate those aspects of Spector's productions. In a 1988 interview, Wilson said that his goal for the album was to \"extend\" Spector's music, as he believed that, \"in one sense of the word\", the Beach Boys were Spector's \"messengers\". On another occasion, Wilson credited Rubber Soul as his \"main motivator\" for Pet Sounds. He explained that he wanted to create music \"on the same level\" as Rubber Soul, but was not interested in copying the Beatles' music style. In 2009, he said that although \"Rubber Soul didn't clarify my ideas for Pet Sounds\", the Beatles' use of sitar inspired his choice of instrumentation for the album. Discussing their songwriting goals, Asher disputed the notion that they were following the Beatles or rock music in general. Rather, \"Brian had defined it as wanting to write something closer to classical American love songs, like Cole Porter or Rodgers and Hammerstein.\" During the writing sessions, Asher and Wilson regularly introduced different albums and types of music to each other. In particular, Asher said that Wilson \"was blown away\" after being played jazz records including Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Lady\" and Lionel Hampton's rendition of \"All the Things You Are\". He remembered that Wilson had minimal awareness of Tin Pan Alley songs and \"hadn't given much thought to the structure or instrumentation of orchestral jazz compositions.\" Having had experience with recording orchestras, Asher encouraged Wilson to employ instruments such as violins, cellos, and bass flutes. In a March 1966 article, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying that they had influenced his work and the group's evolution, \"but so has my own scene.\" Conversely, Marilyn recalled that Brian was only consumed by thoughts of creating the greatest rock album ever and \"did not think about what music was there on the market, or what was happening in the industry.\" In 1996, he said that he and Asher were \"kind of like on our own little wavelength\" and were not concerned with overtaking Phil Spector or Motown, \"It was more what I would call exclusive collaboration not to specifically try to kick somebody's butt, but just to do it the way you really want it to be. That's what I thought we did.\""

He wrote that Pet Sounds shows \"comparatively little advance from what Brian had already accomplished or shown himself capable of accomplishing. Most of the songs use unusual harmonic progressions and unexpected disruptions of hypermeter, both features that were met in 'Warmth of the Sun' and 'Don't Back Down.'\" Granata referred to Pet Sounds as the culmination of Wilson's songwriting artistry, although his \"transition from writing car and surf songs to writing studious ones\" had already \"exploded in 1965\". Pet Sounds includes tempo changes, metrical ambiguity, and unusual tone colors that, in the opinion of author James Perone, remove the album from \"just about anything else that was going on in 1966 pop music\". He cites the album's closer \"Caroline, No\" and its use of wide tessitura changes, wide melodic intervals, and instrumentation which contribute to this belief; also Wilson's compositions and orchestral arrangements which experiment with form and tone colors. Wilson's arrangements combined traditional rock set-ups with unconventional selections of instruments and complex layers of vocal harmonies. His orchestrations, in terms of the choices of instruments themselves and the stylistic appropriation of foreign cultures, were similar to those by exotica producers such as Martin Denny, Les Baxter, and Esquivel. Many of the instruments were alien to rock music, including glockenspiel, ukulele, accordion, Electro-Theremin, bongos, harpsichord, violin, viola, cello, trombone, Coca-Cola bottles, and other odd sounds such as bicycle bells. The number of unique instruments for each track average to about a dozen. Electric and acoustic basses were frequently doubled, as was typical for the era's pop music, and played with a plectrum. Drums were not arranged in a traditional manner of keeping time, but instead, to provide \"rhythmic texture and color\". Two tracks are instrumentals: \"Let's Go Away for Awhile\" and \"Pet Sounds\". They were originally recorded as backing tracks for existing songs, but by the time the album neared completion, Wilson decided that the tracks worked better without vocals. Arranger Paul Mertens, who collaborated with Wilson on live performances of the album, believed that although there are string sections on Pet Sounds, \"what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, he was trying to get classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra.\" Wilson tended to write vertically, in block chords, rather than in the horizontal manner of classical composition."

        "content": "In the estimation of musicologist Phillip Lambert, the album's \"overall unity\" is strengthened by \"strong musical relationships among songs\", for example, the use of 4\u20133\u20132\u20131 stepwise descents and the reverse. Perone concurred that the album contains musical continuity. On \"You Still Believe in Me\", he references a \"stepwise falloff of the interval of a third at the end of each verse\" as a typically \"Wilsonian\" feature that recurs throughout the album, along with a \"madrigal sigh motif\" that can be heard in \"That's Not Me\", where the motif concludes each line of the verses. An overwhelming majority of the chords used on the album are slashed, diminished, major seventh, sixths, ninths, augmented, or suspended. Simple (major or minor triad) chords are invoked minimally. The album's bass lines were written melodically and tend to play parts that avoid focusing on tonic notes. According to Lambert,  one of the album's few recurring compositional features that did not reflect a recent trend in Wilson's songwriting were bass lines that descend from 1 to 5. Only four tracks feature a single strongly established key. The rest feature a primary and secondary key or a weak tonal center. Tertian key modulations feature throughout the album and many of the choices of key signatures in themselves were unusual.  For example, \"You Still Believe in Me\" is in B, which keyboardists avoid due to the number of sharps/flats, while \"That's Not Me\" is in F, the most distant key from C. Submediants, major or minor, are invoked in a manner that Lambert calls \"an important source of overall unity\". With the exception of \"God Only Knows\", every composition on the album that shifts keys or has an ambiguous tonal center \"uses essentially the same tonic\u2013submediant relation.\" Fusilli offered that Wilson's tendency to \"wander far from the logic of his composition only to return triumphantly to confirm the emotional intent of his work\" is repeated numerous times in Pet Sounds, but never to \"evoke a sense of unbridled joy\" as Wilson recently had with \"The Little Girl I Once Knew\". Compared to previous Beach Boys albums, Pet Sounds contains fewer vocal harmonies, but the types of vocal harmonies themselves are more complex and varied. Instead of simple \"oo\" harmonies, the band showed an increasing engagement in multiple vocal counterpoints. There is also a greater occurrence of doo-wop style nonsense syllables, appearing more times than in any previous album. Wilson invokes his signature falsetto seven times on the album. With the exception of Today!, this was the most he had on a Beach Boys album since 1963's Surfer Girl."

This absolute need to relate.\" Carl Wilson offered: \"The disappointment and the loss of innocence that everyone had to go through when they grow up and find everything's not Hollywood are the recurrent themes on that album.\" Wilson drew on his recent marital struggles for much of the album's pessimistic and dejected lyric content. His then-wife Marilyn felt that her relationship with Brian was a central reference within the album's lyrics, namely on \"You Still Believe in Me\" and \"Caroline, No\".  According to Asher, he and Wilson had many lengthy, intimate discussions centered around their \"experiences and feelings about women and the various stages of relationships and so forth\". This included Wilson's doubts about his marriage, his \"sexual fantasies\", and \"his apparent need to get with [his sister-in-law] Diane.\" It is sometimes suggested that the tracks follow a formal narrative that documents the unraveling of a romantic relationship. Critics Richard Goldstein and Nik Cohn noted a disparity between the album's music and lyrics. Cohn suggested that Pet Sounds was composed of \"sad songs about loneliness and heartache; sad songs even about happiness.\" Rolling Stone editor David Wild compared the lyrics to the songs of Tin Pan Alley: \"intelligent and moving, but they're not pretentious.\" Journalist Seth Rogovoy felt that Pet Sounds \"upends and overturns every Beach Boys clich\u00e9, exposing the hollowness at their core.\" Even though Pet Sounds has a somewhat unified theme in its emotional content, there was not a predetermined narrative. Asher said that there were no conversations between him and Wilson that pertained to any specific album \"concept,\" however, \"that's not to say that he didn't have the capacity to steer it in that direction, even unconsciously.\" Lambert argued that Wilson must have intended the album to have a narrative framework due to the likelihood of his familiarity with similar \"theme albums\" by Frank Sinatra and the Four Freshmen. Responding to the songwriters' denials of a conscious lyric theme, Nick Kent observed the album's lyrics show \"the male participant's attempts at coming to terms with himself and the world about him\" and that every song \"pinpoints a crisis of faith in love and life\" with the exception of \"Sloop John B\" and the two instrumental pieces. Writing in his book The Making of Pet Sounds (2003), Charles Granata referenced \"Sloop John B\" and \"Pet Sounds\" as the tracks that undermine the album's \"thematic thread\" and supposed lyrical narrative, yet \"contribute to the marvelous pacing\"."

The album's psychedelic qualities are demonstrated by the invocation of \"greater fluidity, elaboration, and formal complexity\", \"a cultivation of sonic textures\", \"the introduction of new (combinations of) instruments, multiple keys, and/or floating tonal centers\", and the occasional use of \"slower, more hypnotic tempos\". Despite containing psychedelic features, most people hesitate to name the Beach Boys in discussions of psychedelic music. Wilson himself felt that while psychedelic elements are present in a number of the songs, \"the album itself is mostly not psychedelic\". Stebbins writes that the album is \"slightly psychedelic\u2014or at least impressionistic.\" In his book The Acid Trip: A Complete Guide to Psychedelic Music, Vernon Joyson agreed that Pet Sounds contained psychedelic gestures, but chose not to devote significant coverage to the album because he felt that the Beach Boys had \"essentially predated the psychedelic era\". Jim DeRogatis, author of a book about psychedelic music, surmised that Wilson's LSD use led him to write more introspective work, a contrast from the Beatles, who after taking LSD began addressing problems in the world around them. According to academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell, Pet Sounds has a \"personal intimacy\" that sets it apart from the Beach Boys' contemporaries in psychedelic culture and the San Francisco Sound, but still retains a \"trippy feel\" that resulted from Wilson's experimental use of LSD. They attribute this to Wilson's \"eclectic mixture of instruments, echo, reverb, and innovative mixing techniques learnt from Phil Spector to create a complex soundscape in which voice and music interweave tightly\". DeRogatis compared the album's repeated listening value to a heightened psychedelic awareness, writing that its melodies \"continue to reveal themselves after dozens of listens, just as previously unnoticed corners of the world reveal themselves during the psychedelic experience\". On the subject of psychedelic records in the 1960s, Sean Lennon stated that \"psychedelic music is a term that pretty much refers to these sort of epic, ambitious long-form records\u00a0... the reason Pet Sounds is considered a psychedelic journey or whatever is because it's like opening a door and stepping through and entering another world and you're in that other world for a period of time and then you come back.\""

        "content": "With the exception of three tracks, Pet Sounds was recorded from January 18 to April 13, 1966 and spanned 27 session dates. Instrumental sessions were conducted at Western Studio 3 of United Western Recorders, except for a few tracks that were recorded at Gold Star Studios and Sunset Sound Recorders. Wilson produced the sessions with his usual engineer, Western's Chuck Britz. Although Phil Spector created all of his recordings at Gold Star, Wilson preferred working at Western for the studio's privacy and for the presence of Britz. For the backing tracks, Wilson used an ensemble that included the classically trained session musicians frequently employed on Spector's records, a group later nicknamed \"the Wrecking Crew\". Wilson had been employing the services of session musicians due to the increasingly complex nature of his arrangements and because his bandmates were often away playing concerts. Carl, who had occasionally played guitar alongside these musicians at Brian's sessions, commented that his contributions were not as significant as before and that \"It really wasn't appropriate for us [the band] to play on those [Pet Sounds] dates\u2014the tracking just got beyond us.\" Wilson said that he \"was sort of a square\" with his musicians, starting his creative process with how each instrument sounded one-by-one, moving from keyboards, drums, then violins if they were not overdubbed. A backing track session would last for three hours at minimum. Britz remembered how most of the time was spent perfecting individual sounds: \"[Brian] knew basically every instrument he wanted to hear, and how he wanted to hear it. What he would do is call in all the musicians at one time (which was very costly), but still, that's the way he would do it.\" Although Wilson often had entire arrangements worked out in his head, they were usually written in a shorthand form for the other players by one of his session musicians. He also took advice and suggestions from his musicians and even incorporated apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative.  Session drummer Hal Blaine stated, \"Everyone helped arrange, as far as I'm concerned.\" On notation and arranging, Wilson explained: \"Sometimes I'd just write out a chord sheet and that would be for piano, organ, or harpsichord or anything.\u00a0... I wrote out all the horn charts separate from the keyboards. I wrote one basic keyboard chart, violins, horns, and basses, and percussion.\" Discussing Spector's Wall of Sound technique, Wilson identified the tack piano and organ mix in \"I Know There's an Answer\" as one example of himself applying the method.  Compared to Spector, Brian produced tracks that were of greater technical complexity by using state-of-the-art four-track and eight-track recorders. Most backing tracks were recorded onto a Scully four-track 288 tape recorder before being later dubbed down (in mono) onto one track of an eight-track machine. Wilson typically divided instruments by three tracks: drums\u2013percussion\u2013keyboard, horns, and bass\u2013additional percussion\u2013guitar. The fourth track usually contained a rough reference mix used during playback at the session, later to be erased for overdubs such as a string section. \"Once he had what he wanted,\" Britz said, \"I would give Brian a 7-1/2 IPS [tape] copy of the track, and he would take it home.\""

When the others returned to the studio on February 9, they were presented with a substantial portion of a new album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style. With the exception of Mike Love, who had been previewed tracks over the phone by Wilson, the other members were not consulted on any aspect of the record. Jardine explained that \"it took us quite a while to adjust to [the new material] because it wasn't music you could necessarily dance to\u2014it was more like music you could make love to.\" Adding to their concerns was the album's complexity and the implausibility of recreating the music in their live performances. According to various reports, the group fought over the new direction. Wilson recalled that the group \"liked [the new music] but they said it was too arty. I said, 'No, it is not!\" Marilyn said: \"When Brian was writing Pet Sounds, it was difficult for the guys to understand what he was going through emotionally and what he wanted to create.\u00a0... they didn't feel what he was going through and what direction he was trying to go in.\" Tony Asher remembered: \"All those guys in the band, certainly Al, Dennis, and Mike, were constantly saying, 'What the fuck do these words mean?' or 'This isn't our kind of shit!' Brian had comebacks, though. He'd say, 'Oh, you guys can't hack this.'...\u00a0But I remember thinking that those were tense sessions.\" Most of the objections pertained to the lyrical content; the band members did not dislike the music itself. Love said that his only disagreement pertained to the lyrics of \"Hang On to Your Ego\". On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: \"Mike was very confused\u00a0... Mike's a formula hound \u2013 if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.\u00a0... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before.\" Dennis denied that the group disliked Pet Sounds, calling the rumors \"interesting\". He said that there was \"not one person in the group that could come close to Brian's talent\" and \"couldn't imagine who\" would have resisted Brian's leadership. Carl said: \"We knew this was good music. ... I loved every minute of it. He [Brian] could do no wrong. He could play me anything, and I would love it.\" In defense of Love, Asher said that \"he never was critical about what [the album] was, he was just saying it wasn't right for the Beach Boys.\" He said that Jardine voiced the same concerns. Brian believed the band was worried about him separating from the group, and elaborated: \"it was generally considered that the Beach Boys were the main thing\u00a0... with Pet Sounds, there was a resistance in that I was doing most of the artistic work on it vocally\". Love wrote that he \"would have liked to have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with.\" Brian acknowledged that he had taken up most of the vocals \"because I thought, in a way, I wanted people to know it was more of a Brian Wilson album than a Beach Boys album.\" He said the conflicts were resolved when his bandmates \"figured that it was a showcase for Brian Wilson, but it's still the Beach Boys. In other words, they gave in. They let me have my little stint.\""

        "content": "Vocal overdubs were tracked at Western and CBS Columbia Square. The Beach Boys rarely knew their parts before arriving in the studio. Britz: \"Most of the time, they were never ready to sing. They would rehearse in the studio. Actually, there was no such thing as rehearsal. They'd get on mike right off the bat, practically, and start singing.\" According to Jardine, each member was taught their individual vocal lines by Brian at a piano. He explains, \"Every night we'd come in for a playback. We'd sit around and listen to what we did the night before. Someone might say, well, that's pretty good but we can do that better.\" This process proved to be the most exacting work the group had undertaken yet. During recording, Mike Love often called Brian \"dog ears\", a nickname referencing a canine's ability to detect sounds far beyond the limits of human hearing. Love later summarized: For microphones, they used two Neumann U-47s for Dennis, Carl and Jardine and a Shure 545 for Brian's leads. Love sang most of the album's bass vocals, and necessitated an extra microphone due to his low volume range. By the time of Pet Sounds, Wilson was using up to six of the eight tracks on the multitrack master so that he could record the voice of each member separately, allowing him greater control over the vocal balance in the final mix. After mixing down the four-track to mono for overdubbing via an eight-track recorder, six of the remaining seven tracks were usually dedicated to each of the Beach Boys' vocals. The last track was usually reserved for additional elements such as extra vocals or instrumentation. The vocals for five of the album's songs were recorded at Columbia because it was the only facility in Los Angeles with an eight-track recorder."

        "content": "Similar to subsequent experimental rock LPs by Frank Zappa, the Beatles, and the Who, Pet Sounds featured countertextural aspects that called attention to the very recordedness of the album. Tape effects were limited to slapback echo and reverb. Archivist Mark Linett notes: \"to my ears, it sounds more like the plate [reverberators] rather than chambers. It should be mentioned that you get a significantly different sound from a chamber when you record it 'live' as opposed to doing it off tape, and one reason these records sound the way they do is that the reverb was being printed as part of the recording \u2013 unlike today where we'll record 'dry' and add the effects later.\" One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", \"You Still Believe in Me\", and \"Don't Talk\". On April 13, 1966, the album's final vocal overdubbing session, for \"Here Today\", concluded a ten-month-long recording period that had begun with \"Sloop John B\" in July 1965. The album was mixed three days later in a single nine-hour session. Most of the session was spent mixing down the vocals to fit with the instrumentals, which had already been locked into one mono track. The album's original mono master ultimately featured many technical flaws that contrast the refined arrangements and performances. One of the most prominent examples occurs in \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", where an audible tape splice is heard between the chorus and Mike Love's vocal entrance in the bridge. A similar anomaly is heard in the instrumental break of \"Here Today\", where a distant conversation was accidentally captured during a vocal overdub. In David Leaf's view, \"It's not sloppy recording, it's part of the music.\" A true stereophonic mix of Pet Sounds was not considered in 1966 largely because of mixing logistics. In spite of whether a true stereo mix was possible, Wilson intentionally mixed the final version of his recordings in mono (as did Spector). He did this because he felt that mono mastering provided more sonic control over the final result, irrespective of the vagaries of speaker placement and sound system quality. Another and more personal reason for Brian's preference for mono was his almost total deafness in his right ear. At the end, the total cost of production amounted to a then-unheard of $70,000 (equivalent to $ in )."

        "content": "At the suggestion of Al Jardine, Wilson arranged a version of \"Sloop John B\", a traditional Caribbean folk song that Jardine had learned from listening to the Kingston Trio. His arrangement blended rock and marching band instrumentation  with the use of flutes, glockenspiel, baritone saxophone, bass, guitar, and drums. Jardine likened the result to John Philip Sousa. Wilson elected to change the original lyrics from \"this is the worst trip since I've been born\" to \"this is the worst trip I've ever been on\". This may have been done as a deliberate reference to acid trips. Brian included \"Sloop John B\" on Pet Sounds to appease Capitol Records, who voiced concerns that the album required the inclusion of a hit single in order to sell. The song is often said to disrupt the album's lyrical flow, as author Jim Fusilli explains: \"It's anything but a reflective love song, a stark confession or a tentative statement of independence like the other songs on the album. And it's the only song on Pet Sounds Brian didn't write.\" Fusilli posits that the track fits musically with the album, citing the track's chiming guitars, doubletracked basses, and staccato rhythms.  Noting that a sense of self-doubt, concern for the future of a relationship, and melancholy pervades Pet Sounds, Perone says the song successfully portrays a sailor who feels \"completely out of place in his situation\", a quality that is \"fully in keeping with the general feeling of disorientation that runs through so many of the songs.\""

When questioned about the cover in 2016, Wilson could not recall who thought of going to the zoo.  Jardine remembered that the Pet Sounds title had already been decided, and that until arriving to the photo shoot, he thought that \"pet\" referred to slang for making out (\"petting\"). He credited Capitol's art department with the idea. Some sources claim that Remember the Zoo was another working title, but the name was actually part of a hoax that had originated from a Beach Boys fanzine in the 1990s. The cover photo was taken on February 10, 1966 by photographer George Jerman. Local reporters from KFMB-TV filmed the shoot, although the crew's footage was lost and later rediscovered in 2021.  According to a contemporary report by the San Diego Union, the group \"came down from Hollywood to take a cover picture for their forthcoming album Our Freaky Friends.\u00a0... Zoo officials were not keen about having their beloved beasts connected with the title of the album, but gave in when the Beach Boys explained that animals are an 'in' thing with teenagers. And that the Beach Boys were rushing to beat the rock and roll group called The Animals.\" The group was subsequently banned from the zoo, as the staff had accused them of mishandling the animals. Johnston said, \"The goats were horrible!\u00a0... The zoo said we were torturing the animals but they should have seen what we had to go through. We were doing all the suffering.\" A taped conversation from the March 1966 dog barking session for \"Caroline, No\" reveals that Brian considered photographing a horse belonging to Carl in Western Studio 3 for the album cover. Wilson told biographer Byron Preiss that the album was named \"after the dogs\u00a0... That was the whole idea\". Love credited himself with titling the album Pet Sounds, a claim supported by Wilson and Jardine in a 2016 interview. In 1996, Love recalled that he came up with the name while he and his bandmates were standing in the hallway of Western or Columbia studio. He said, \"we didn't have a title.\u00a0... We had taken pictures at the zoo and\u00a0... there were animal sounds on the record, and we were thinking, well, it's our favorite music of that time, so I said, 'Why don't we call it Pet Sounds?'\" Wilson subsequently consulted Asher, who did not have a favorable reaction to the album's title, thinking that the name had \"trivialized what we had accomplished\". In the 1990s, Brian credited Carl with the title. Carl said with uncertainty that the name might have come from Brian: \"The idea he [Brian] had was that everybody has these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.\" Brian commented that the title was a \"tribute\" to Spector by matching his initials (PS). Wilson's 1991 memoir, Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story, writes that the title was inspired by Love asking \"Who's gonna hear this shit? The ears of a dog?\" Love denied the veracity of that claim."

The single peaked at number 32 during a seven-week stay. On March 21, \"Sloop John B\" (B-side \"You're So Good to Me\") was released as a single, credited to the Beach Boys, and reached number 3.  After Pet Sounds was assembled, Brian brought a complete acetate to Marilyn, who remembered, \"It was so beautiful, one of the most spiritual times of my whole life. We both cried. Right after we listened to it, he said he was scared that nobody was going to like it. That it was too intricate.\" Capitol executives were less impressed and discussed plans to scrap the album when they heard it. Following several meetings \u2013 the last of which had Brian appearing with a tape recorder and responding to their questions with eight pre-recorded responses \u2013 Capitol accepted the album as the Beach Boys' next LP. Pet Sounds was released on May 16 and debuted on the Billboard charts at 106. It sold 200,000 copies shortly thereafter. Compared to their previous albums in the US, Pet Sounds achieved somewhat less commercial success, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard LP chart, on July 2, during a ten-month stay. Although total sales were estimated at around 500,000 units, Pet Sounds was not initially awarded gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) \u2013 a first for the group since 1963. For the album's promotion in the US, Capitol ran full-page advertisements in Billboard that did not distinguish the record from earlier Beach Boys offerings and relied on the group's familiar public image instead of rebranding. This was also true for the promotional spots that were recorded by the Beach Boys themselves and disseminated to radio stations. Like they had done for previous spots, the members performed a comedy skit without any indication of what the record they were promoting sounded like. Instead, they relied on their name recognition. Johnston blamed Capitol for the album's underwhelming sales and alleged that the label did not promote the album as heavily as previous releases. Carl shared this view and said that Capitol did not feel a need to promote the band since they were getting so much airplay. Others assumed that the label considered the album a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience the Beach Boys built their commercial standing on. Within two months, Capitol assembled the group's first greatest hits compilation, Best of the Beach Boys, which was quickly certified gold by the RIAA. Capitol A&R director Karl Engemann theorized that because the marketing department \"didn't believe that Pet Sounds was going to do that well, they were probably looking for some additional volume in that quarter.\" There were reports that when record shops ordered copies of Pet Sounds, they instead received Best Of. On July 18, \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (B-side \"God Only Knows\") was released as a single, peaking at number 8 on September 2. Billboard ultimately ranked the album at number 43 on its \"Top Pop Albums of 1966\" list."

        "content": "In the UK, the band had little commercial success until March 1966, when \"Barbara Ann\" and Beach Boys Party! rose to number 2 on the nation's respective Record Retailer charts. In April, two singles were released: \"Caroline, No\" (no chart showing) and \"Sloop John B\" (number 2). In response to the band's growing popularity among the British, two music videos were filmed set to \"Sloop John B\" and \"God Only Knows\" for the UK's Top of the Pops, both directed by Taylor. The \"Sloop John B\" video premiered on April 28. EMI planned to release the record in November to coincide with the band's tour of Britain. From May 16 to 21, Bruce Johnston and Derek Taylor holidayed at central London's Waldorf Hotel with the intention of promoting the album around local music scenes. Thanks to the connections of London-based producer Kim Fowley, a number of musicians, journalists, and other guests (including John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Keith Moon) gathered in their hotel suite to listen to repeated playbacks of the album. Fowley said that they had arranged \"a horde of press, so it looked like the Beatles had just arrived at La Guardia airport in 1964. Bruce Johnston was like Jesus Christ in tennis shoes, and Pet Sounds represented the Ten Commandments.\" Moon himself involved Johnston by helping him gain coverage in British television circuits, and connecting him with Lennon and McCartney. Due to popular demand, EMI rush-released Pet Sounds on June 27. It peaked at number 2, and remained in the top-ten positions for six months. Taylor is widely recognized as having been instrumental in this success, due to his longstanding connections with the Beatles and other industry figures in the UK. The music press there carried advertisements saying that Pet Sounds was \"The Most Progressive Pop Album Ever!\" According to Wilson biographer Peter Ames Carlin, Rolling Stones manager Andrew Oldham, who was also the Beach Boys' publisher in England, took out a full-page advertisement in Melody Maker in which he lauded Pet Sounds as \"the greatest album ever made\". On July 22, \"God Only Knows\" (B-side \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\") was released as the third UK single, peaking at number 2. Pet Sounds was one of the five best-selling UK albums of 1966. In response to the success of the Beach Boys' singles \"Barbara Ann\", \"Sloop John B.\" and \"God Only Knows\", EMI flooded the market with other albums by the band, including Party!, Today! and Summer Days. In addition, Best of the Beach Boys was number 2 there for five weeks through to the end of the year. The Beach Boys became the strongest selling album act in the UK for the final quarter of 1966, dethroning the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles."

        "title": "Pet Sounds_Contemporary reviews",
        "content": "Early reviews for the album in the U.S. ranged from negative to tentatively positive. Billboards terse review, published uncharacteristically late, called it an \"exciting, well-produced LP\" with \"two superb instrumental cuts\", and highlighted the \"strong single potential\" of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\". Biographer David Leaf wrote in 1978 that the album received \"scattered\" instances of praise from American reviewers; the group's fans initially considered Pet Sounds too challenging, and \"quickly passed the word to 'stay away from the new Beach Boys album, it's weird.'\" By contrast, the reception from music journalists in the UK was highly favourable due in part to the promotional efforts of Taylor, Johnston, and Fowley. Rolling Stone founding editor Jann Wenner later recalled that fans in the UK identified the Beach Boys as being \"years ahead\" of the Beatles and declared Wilson a \"genius\"   Penny Valentine of Disc and Music Echo admired Pet Sounds as \"Thirteen tracks of Brian Wilson genius\u00a0... The whole LP is far more romantic than the usual Beach Boys jollity: sad little wistful songs about lost love and found love and all-around love.\" Writing in Record Mirror, Norman Jopling reported that the LP had been \"widely praised\" and subjected to \"no criticism\". He prefaced his review as \"unbiased\" and wrote that his only \"real complaint\" with the album was the \"terribly complicated and cluttered\" arrangements. Jopling predicted: \"It will probably make their present fans like them even more, but it's doubtful whether it will make them any new ones.\" A reviewer in Disc and Music Echo disagreed: \"this should gain them thousands of new fans. Instrumentally ambitious, if vocally over-pretty, Pet Sounds has brilliantly tapped the pulse of the musical times. ... A superb, important and really exciting collection from the group whose recording career so far has been a bit of a hotchpotch.\" Melody Maker ran a feature in which many pop musicians were asked whether they believed that the album was truly revolutionary and progressive, or \"as sickly as peanut butter\". The author concluded that \"the record's impact on artists and the men behind the artists has been considerable.\" Among the musicians contributing to the 1966 Melody Maker survey: Spencer Davis of the Spencer Davis Group said: \"Brian Wilson is a great record producer. I haven't spent much time listening to the Beach Boys before, but I'm a fan now and I just want to listen to this LP again and again.\" Then a member of Cream, Eric Clapton, reported that everyone in his band loved the album, adding that Wilson was \"without doubt a pop genius\". Andrew Oldham told the magazine: \"I think that Pet Sounds is the most progressive album of the year in as much as Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade was. It's the pop equivalent of that, a complete exercise in pop music.\" Three of the nine people who are quoted in the Melody Maker survey (Keith Moon, Manfred Mann's Michael D'Abo, and the Walker Brothers' Scott Walker) did not agree that the album was revolutionary. D'Abo and Walker favored the Beach Boys' earlier work, as did journalist and television presenter Barry Fantoni, who expressed a preference for Beach Boys' Today! and stated that Pet Sounds was \"probably revolutionary, but I'm not sure that everything that's revolutionary is necessarily good\". Pete Townshend of the Who opined that \"the Beach Boys new material is too remote and way out. It's written for a feminine audience.\" In other issues of Melody Maker, Mick Jagger stated that he disliked the songs but enjoyed the record and its harmonies, while John Lennon said that Wilson was \"doing some very great things\". At the end of 1966, the magazine crowned Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Revolver as the joint \"Pop Album of the Year\". The paper's spokesman wrote, \"We argued, argued and argued and still the MM pop panel couldn't agree which was the Pop Album of the Year. The voting was evenly divided ... Cups of coffee were drunk and sheets of paper were torn up before we finally agreed to compromise and vote for both The Beatles and Beach Boys on top.\""

        "content": "Wilson later said that despite the positive reception afforded to the album in Britain, he still felt deeply hurt when Pet Sounds did not sell as highly as he expected and interpreted the poor sales as the public's rejection of his artistry.  Marilyn supported that the lackluster response \"really destroyed Brian\" before adding: \"He just lost a lot of faith in people and music. ... then when people would talk about it later, tell him how great it was, even if it was just a year later, he didn't want to hear about it. It reminded him of failing. And then he was more tortured.\" Carl also remembered Brian's disappointment and said that the album was \"so much more than a record ... it was like going to church and a labor of love.\" In mid-1966, Brian began writing songs with lyricist Van Dyke Parks for a new album, Smile, that was never finished but would have included \"Good Vibrations\". Wilson touted the album as a \"teenage symphony to God\" that would have surpassed Pet Sounds. During the project's sessions, Wilson revisited the idea of a psychedelic comedy album, previously explored with the \"Dick\" and \"Fuzz\" outtakes from Pet Sounds. In October, \"Good Vibrations\" was issued as a single and became an immediate worldwide hit. As Wilson's mental health deteriorated, his involvement with the Beach Boys reduced, and the group instead released follow-up records that were less ambitious and largely ignored by critics. Wilson referred to the band's 1968 release Friends as his second \"solo album\", following Pet Sounds. It was a commercial failure and, in the words of a Mojo writer, caused the band's fanbase to lose \"any hope that Brian Wilson would deliver a true successor to [Pet Sounds]\". The Beach Boys Love You (1977) saw Wilson's brief reemergence as the band's principal songwriter and singer, becoming a spiritual successor to Pet Sounds. In 1988, Wilson released his first solo album, Brian Wilson, which was an attempt to recapture the sensibilities of Pet Sounds, such that co-producer Russ Titelman touted the album as Pet Sounds '88. It included \"Baby Let Your Hair Grow Long\", a sequel to \"Caroline, No\". The Beach Boys, accompanied by Timothy B. Schmit, re-recorded \"Caroline, No\" with a new multi-part vocal arrangement for the 1996 album Stars and Stripes Vol. 1. Shortly after that album, there were tentative plans for what biographer Mark Dillon nicknamed \"Pet Sounds, Vol. 2\", an album that would have involved the band teaming with Sean O'Hagan, leader of the avant-pop band the High Llamas. Although many record companies expressed interest in the project, it never progressed past the planning stages. In the late 1990s, Wilson and Asher rekindled their writing partnership and wrote at least four songs together. Only two were released: \"This Isn't Love\" and \"Everything I Need\"."

        "content": "Pet Sounds was not nominated for the 1967 Grammy Awards. In his 1969 Pop Chronicles series, John Gilliland stated that the album was almost overshadowed by the Beatles' Revolver, released August 1966, and that \"a lot people failed to realize that Brian Wilson's production was as unique in its own way as the Beatles'\". In his 1971 reappraisal of the Beach Boys for Melody Maker, Richard Williams wrote that although Pet Sounds had \"defied criticism\" and \"dwarfed all the rest of pop music put together\", whatever continued recognition Wilson would have received was immediately diverted to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, released 12 months after Pet Sounds. Geoffrey Cannon wrote in his late 1967 column for Listener that the group were \"lesser than the Beatles\" chiefly due to a lack of \"emotional range; all their ballads, in evidence especially on Pet Sounds, are juvenile or specious. And none of their albums makes a collective statement.\" Writing in Jazz & Pop magazine in 1968, Gene Sculatti recognized the album's debt to Rubber Soul, saying that Pet Sounds was \"revolutionary only within the confines of the Beach Boys' music\", although later in the piece he commented: \"Pet Sounds was a final statement of an era and a prophecy that sweeping changes lay ahead.\" According to author Johnny Morgan, a \"process of reevaluation\" of Pet Sounds was underway from the late 1960s onward, with a 1976 NME feature proving especially influential.  Ben Edmonds of Circus wrote in 1971 that the \"beauty\" of Pet Sounds had aged well against \"the turbulence of the past few years\", adding that \"many consider it not only the Beach Boys' finest achievement, but a milestone in the progression of contemporary rock as well.\" In a 1972 review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Davis called Pet Sounds \"by far\" Brian Wilson's best album and said that its \"trenchant cycle of love songs has the emotional impact of a shatteringly evocative novel\". He argued that the album had changed \"the course of popular music\" and \"a few lives in the bargain\". Melody Makers Josh Ingham said in 1973 that the album was \"ignored by the public\" but inspired many critics to label Wilson a genius, \"not least for being a year ahead of Sgt Pepper in thinking.\" Ingham concluded that, \"With hindsight, of course, Pet Sounds has become the classic album.\" After 1974, Pet Sounds went out-of-print. In Granata's description, the album subsequently \"fell into obscurity\" and was \"relegated to the cutout bins\" for decades. Sociomusicologist Simon Frith wrote in 1981 that Pet Sounds continued to be largely regarded by \"the music world\" as a \"'weird' record\". Writing in the first edition of The Rolling Stone Record Guide (1979), Dave Marsh gave the album four stars (out of a possible five) and described it as a \"powerful, but spotty\" collection on which the least experimental songs proved to be the best. In 1985, he wrote that the album was now considered a \"classic\", elaborating: \"Pet Sounds wasn't a commercial flop, but it did signal that the group was losing contact with its listeners (a charge that could not be leveled against the Beatles during the same period)\". Granata offered that, by the time the album reappeared on compact disc in 1990, it was \"embraced by hard-core fanatics\" yet \"still considered an insider's record\u2014a quasi-cult classic\". Historian Michael Roberts states that \"the album's induction into the canon of popular music\" arguably followed the release of its 1997 expanded edition, The Pet Sounds Sessions."

        "content": "Pet Sounds has since appeared in many \"greatest records of all time\" lists and has provoked extensive discourse regarding its musicianship and production. By the 1990s, three British critics' polls featured Pet Sounds at or near the top of their lists. Those who deemed it \"the greatest album of all time\" included the writing staffs of NME, The Times, and Uncut. In 1998, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences inducted the album into the Grammy Hall of Fame.  In Music USA: The Rough Guide (1999), Richie Unterberger and Samb Hicks deemed the album a \"quantum leap\" from the Beach Boys' earlier material, and \"the most gorgeous arrangements ever to grace a rock record\". In 2000, Pet Sounds was voted number 18 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2004, Pet Sounds was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" That year, Pet Sounds also overtook Revolver as the top album on Acclaimed Music, a website that statistically aggregates hundreds of published lists. It has maintained this ranking ten-plus years on. Wilson himself felt bemused by the album's continued acclaim. In a 2002 documentary about the album, he commented, \"It keeps going back to Pet Sounds here in my life, and I'm going, 'What about this Pet Sounds? Is it really that good an album?' It's stood the test of time, of course, but is it really that great an album to listen to? I don't know.\" Music journalist Robert Christgau, writing in 2004, felt that Pet Sounds was a good record, but believed it had become looked upon as a totem.  By 2006, more than 100 domestic and international publications and journalists had lauded Pet Sounds as one of the greatest albums ever recorded. In 2000, Pitchfork founder Ryan Schreiber gave Pet Sounds then-latest reissue a 7.5 (out of 10) and decreed that while Pet Sounds had been \"groundbreaking enough to permanantly  alter the course of music\", its \"straight-forward pop music\" had become \"passe and cliched\", especially when compared to  Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), My Bloody Valentine's Loveless (1991), and Radiohead's OK Computer (1997).  For the album's 40th Anniversary edition, Pitchfork ran another review, this time written by Dominique Leone, who awarded the album a 9.4 score. Leone opined that the work had aged well and deserved its continued praise, although he preferred the band's post-Pet Sounds recordings. He wrote: In Chris Smith's 2009 book 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music, Pet Sounds is evaluated as \"one of the most innovative recordings in rock\" and as the work that \"elevated Brian Wilson from talented bandleader to studio genius\". Music historian Luis Sanchez viewed the album as \"the score to a film about what rock music doesn't have to be. For all of its inward-looking sentimentalism, it lays out in a masterful way the kind of glow and sui generis vision that Brian aimed to expand in a radical way with Smile.\" Music critic Tim Sommer, referencing other albums that are often labeled \"masterpieces\", such as Thick as a Brick (1972), Dark Side of the Moon, and OK Computer, commented that \"only Pet Sounds is written from the teen or adolescent point of view.\" It has been viewed by some writers as the best pop rock album of all time, including Sommer, who deemed it \"the greatest album of all time, probably by about 20 or 30 lengths\". Musician Atticus Ross, who composed the soundtrack to the 2014 Brian Wilson biopic, referred to \"an element of clich\u00e9 that's grown around\" the album, exemplified in a comedy sketch from the television show Portlandia in which \"your classic hipster musicians\u00a0... are building a studio and everything is like 'this is the mike they used in Pet Sounds.' This is exactly the same as Pet Sounds.'\" In 2016, commentator C.W. Maloney opined: \"The songs on Pet Sounds are great, but you have to wonder, given all the hype and mythology and our love of shallow nostalgia, what we mean when we call it a classic or Wilson a genius. Consider what [Frank] Zappa was doing in 1966, to say nothing of Miles [Davis]. Wilson's high reputation is evidence of our obsession with childlike innocence and the victory of boring poptimism.\""

        "content": "Pet Sounds is recognized as an ambitious and sophisticated work that advanced the field of music production in addition to setting a higher standard in music composition and numerous precedents in its recording. Philip Lambert, a professor of music at the CUNY Graduate Center in New York, wrote that the album was \"an extraordinary achievement \u2013 for any musician, but especially for the 23-year-old Wilson\". Singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb described it as \"a musician's album\", \"an engineer's album\", and \"a songwriter's album\". Paul McCartney declared that \"no one is educated musically 'til they've heard that album.\" To explain why the album \"was one of the defining moments of its time\", composer Philip Glass referred to \"its willingness to abandon formula in favor of structural innovation, the introduction of classical elements in the arrangements, [and] production concepts in terms of overall sound which were novel at the time\". Edmonds believed that the album's \"most impressive\" feature was \"the fully integrated use of orchestration, an area glossed over all too lightly in those days.\" Although not originally a big seller, Pet Sounds was \"enormously\" influential from the moment of its release. No other artist of Wilson's stature had written, arranged, and produced an album on the scale of Pet Sounds, and Granata writes that Wilson's \"authoritative approach affected his contemporaries\" and thus \"redefined\" the role of the producer. Producer Lenny Waronker, who later became president of Warner Bros. Records, supported that Pet Sounds likely contributed to a higher emphasis on studio artistry among West Coast artists. \"Creative record-making took a giant step and it affected everybody who was caught up in it. It was a landmark record\". Similarly in Britain, many groups responded to the album by increasing the studio experimentation on their records. In 1971, publication Beat Instrumental & International Recording wrote: \"Pet Sounds took everyone by surprise. In terms of musical conception, lyric content, production and performance, it stood as a landmark in a music genre whose development was about to begin snowballing.\" In rock music, Pet Sounds marked the first occasion in which doubling was used for virtually every instrument, a technique previously limited to classical composers and orchestrators. It was also the first time that a group departed from the usual small-ensemble electric rock band format for an entire album. \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" was the first piece in popular music to incorporate the Electro-Theremin as well as the first in rock music to feature a theremin-like instrument. According to D. Strauss, the Beach Boys were also the first major rock group to openly challenge contemporary music trends \"and declare that rock really didn't matter.\" Cue magazine reflected in 1971 that Pet Sounds made \"the Beach Boys among the vanguard\" and anticipated trends that were not widespread in rock music \"until 1969\u20131970\". Cultural historian John Robert Greene stated that \"God Only Knows\" remade the ideal of the popular love song, while \"Sloop John B\" and \"Pet Sounds\" broke new ground and took rock music away from its casual lyrics and melodic structures into what was then uncharted territory. He also credited Pet Sounds (as well as Rubber Soul, Revolver, and the 1960s folk movement) with spawning the majority of trends in post-1965 rock music. Many Los Angeles record producers imitated the album's orchestral style, which became a component to the sunshine pop acts that followed. Discussing the smooth soul genre, Chicago Reader Noah Berlatsky argued that the Beach Boys helped bridge a gap between the polished pop harmonizing of the Drifters and the experimentation of the Chi-Lites, particularly with \"Sloop John B\", whose \"fussy\" arrangements, \"pure\" harmonies, and \"childish vulnerability\" he says \"come out of a tradition of pop R&B\". \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" was similarly influential to power pop with respect to its \"happy\"-sounding music underpinned by a sense of yearning and longing. Pet Sounds is often cited as one of the earliest entries in the canon of psychedelic rock. Scholar Philip Auslander writes that even though psychedelic music is not normally associated with the Beach Boys, the \"odd directions\" and experiments in Pet Sounds \"put it all on the map.\u00a0... basically that sort of opened the door\u2014not for groups to be formed or to start to make music, but certainly to become as visible as say Jefferson Airplane or somebody like that.\" DeRogatis said that it was one of the first psychedelic rock masterpieces, along with The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators (1966) and Revolver."

        "content": "Pet Sounds marked the origins of progressive pop, a genre that gave way to progressive rock. Tidal contributor Ryan Breed cited the album's \"non-rock instrumentation (strings, brass, Theremin, harpsichord, tack piano), dizzying key changes and complex vocal harmonies\" as features that informed prog-pop. Journalist Troy Smith similarly cited \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" as \"the first taste of progressive pop\" subsequently elaborated upon by bands such as the Beatles, Queen, and Supertramp. The album also furthered the \"rock as art\" concept heralded by Rubber Soul. In the belief of music journalist Barney Hoskyns, \"If the Beatles' Rubber Soul was the first album to make a case for pop music as a maturing art form, 1966's Pet Sounds was a quantum leap into the unknown\". According to Gary Graff, Pet Sounds \"can be seen as a launch pad for the album era\", alongside Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited (1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966). Composer and journalist Frank Oteri recognized Pet Sounds as a \"clear precedent\" to the birth of album-oriented rock and progressive rock. Bill Martin, an author of books about prog-rock, felt that the album represented a turning point for prog as the Beach Boys and the Beatles transformed rock music from dance music into music that was made for listening to, bringing \"expansions in harmony, instrumentation (and therefore timbre), duration, rhythm, and the use of recording technology\". Asked in a 1968 interview about the Beatles' role in rock's \"progress toward an art form\", Led Zeppelin founder Jimmy Page responded, \"I think the Beach Boys tried to do it first. I think there were lots of Beach Boy things on the Revolver album. Especially, the vocal harmony. Wilson really said a lot in his Pet Sounds album.\" Gang of Four's Andy Gill argued that \"so many rock bands took [Pet Sounds] as a green light to get clever\u2014to start playing with the time signatures, to go prog. You know, 'Let's put a french horn in there!' Before you know it, you've got Queen.\" In the wake of Pet Sounds, Wilson was heralded as the leading figure of the \"art-rock\" movement. Pet Sounds is viewed as the first work of art rock by Leaf, Jones, and Frith. Rolling Stone writers described the album as heralding the art rock of the 1970s. Sommer writes that \"Pet Sounds proved that a pop group could make an album-length piece comparable with the greatest long-form works of Bernstein, Copland, Ives, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.\" Bill Holdship said that it was \"perhaps rock's first example of self-conscious art\". According to Jim Fusilli, author of the 33\u2153 book on the album, it raised itself to \"the level of art through its musical sophistication and the precision of its statement\", while academic Michael Johnson said that the album was one of the first documented moments of ascension in rock music. In 2010, Pet Sounds was listed in Classic Rock's \"50 Albums That Built Prog Rock\"."

Journalist Liel Leibovitz called Pet Sounds and Blonde on Blonde \"two strands in the same conversation, the one that turned American popular music, for one fleeting moment of one year in the middle 1960s, into a religious movement\". Author Geoffrey Himes said that \"Brian's introduction of non-standard harmonies and timbres proved as revolutionary\" as Dylan's introduction of \"irony into rock'n'roll lyrics\". Rock historians also frequently link Pet Sounds to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney later credited Pet Sounds as an influence on his increasingly melodic bass-playing style and cited \"God Only Knows\" as \"the greatest song ever written\". He said that the album was the primary impetus for Sgt. Pepper and influenced his Revolver composition \"Here, There and Everywhere\". Among the distinguishing musical features of Pet Sounds that the Beatles adopted throughout Sgt. Pepper were the upper-register bass lines, a larger emphasis on floor toms, and more eclectic and unorthodox combinations of instruments (including bass harmonica). Lambert writes that \"the overall key relations\" on Pet Sounds resemble the patterns found on Sgt. Pepper, particularly with the invocation of B as a tonic."

Chamber pop itself became a genre that was based on the musical template of Pet Sounds. In the mid-1990s, Robert Schneider of the Apples in Stereo and Jim McIntyre of Von Hemmling founded Pet Sounds Studio, which served as the venue for many Elephant 6 projects such as Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, and the Olivia Tremor Control's Dusk at Cubist Castle and Black Foliage.

Wilson also originated the trope of the \"reclusive genius\" among studio-oriented musical artists. Jason Guriel of The Atlantic, writing about the record in 2016, drew comparisons with the albums of Michael Jackson, Prince, and Radiohead, and said that Wilson \"certainly anticipated the modern pop-centric era, which privileges producer over artist and blurs the line between entertainment and art\". In 1995, a panel of musicians, songwriters and producers, surveyed by Mojo, ranked Pet Sounds as the \"greatest record\" of all time. Referencing the album's newfound popularity in 1998, journalist Paul Lester reported that \"today's most interesting acts \u2013 The High Llamas, Air, Kid Loco, Saint Etienne, Stereolab, Lewis Taylor \u2013 are using the Brian Wilson songbook as a resource for their forays into the realms of electronic pop.\" Cornelius' 1997 release Fantasma was created as an explicit homage to Pet Sounds and contains numerous references to the album. Tribute albums include Do It Again: A Tribute to Pet Sounds (2005), The String Quartet Tribute to the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (2006), MOJO Presents Pet Sounds Revisited (2012), and A Tribute to Pet Sounds (2016). In 2007, producer Bullion  created a J Dilla mashup of the album, Pet Sounds in the Key of Dee. Hip-hop producer Questlove recalled that for \"black teenagers coming of age in the 1980s\", the Beach Boys were out of fashion, and that in the late 1990s, he was ridiculed by \"J Dilla, Common, Proof, and a whole bunch of east-side Detroit cats\" for enjoying Pet Sounds. Later, \"Dilla was like, 'Yeah, you're right man, they had some shit on there.'\" In 1990, the political cartoon strip Doonesbury ran a controversial story arc involving the character Andy Lippincott and his terminal battle with AIDS. It concludes with Lippincott expressing his admiration for Pet Sounds, and in the last panels, depicts the character's death while listening to \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\", as well as his last written words, the line \"Brian Wilson is God\" scrawled on a notebook (a wry reference to the line \"Clapton is God\"). According to cultural theorist Kirk Curnett in 2012, the panel \"remains one of the most iconic in Doonesburys forty-three year history, often credit[ed] with helping humanize AIDS victims when both gay and straight sufferers were severely stigmatized.\" In 2000, the album was presented with gold and platinum awards based on sales that could be documented, although Capitol estimated it may have sold over two million copies. By 2007, there had been at least three books dedicated to Pet Sounds. In Japan, Jim Fusilli's book was translated to Japanese by the novelist Haruki Murakami. Writing in his 2012 book Music Producer: for Producers, Composers, Arrangers, and Students, Michael Zager stated that the album's production techniques remained in use forty-six years later. The album motivated film producer Bill Pohlad to direct the 2014 biopic on Brian Wilson, Love & Mercy, a film which includes a substantial depiction of the album's making, with actor Paul Dano portraying Wilson. In 2016, to honor the album's 50th anniversary, 26 artists contributed to a Pitchfork retrospective on its influence, which included comments from members of Talking Heads, Yo La Tengo, Chairlift, and Deftones. The editor noted that the \"wide swath of artists assembled for this feature represent but a modicum of the album's vast measure of influence. Its scope transcends just about all lines of age, race, and gender. Its impact continues to broaden with each passing generation.\""

In the late 1990s, Carl Wilson vetoed an offer for the Beach Boys to perform Pet Sounds in full for ten shows, reasoning that the studio arrangements were too complex for the stage, and that Brian could not possibly sing his original parts. As a solo artist, Brian performed the entire album live in 2000 with a different orchestra in each venue, and on three occasions without orchestra on his 2002 tour. The concerts received favorable reviews, however, critics focused on Wilson's \"trancelike\" demeanor and odd interview responses. Recordings from Wilson's 2002 concert tour were released as Brian Wilson Presents Pet Sounds Live. Rolling Stones Dorian Lynskey says that the shows helped establish the now-ubiquitous practice of artists playing \"classic albums\" in their entirety. In 2013, Wilson performed the album at two shows, unannounced, also with Jardine as well as original Beach Boys guitarist David Marks. In 2016, Wilson performed the album at several events in Australia, Japan, Europe, Canada and the United States. The tour was planned as his final performances of the album, but occasional shows have been performed or announced through 2020."

        "content": "Pet Sounds has had many different reissues since its release in 1966, including remastered mono and remixed stereo versions. In 1966, Capitol issued a Duophonic (fake stereo) version of the album that was created through equalization and phasing. In 1968, Capitol issued Pet Sounds as part of a three-LP set with Today! and Summer Days. In 1972, Reprise packaged Pet Sounds as a bonus LP with the Beach Boys' latest album Carl and the Passions \u2013 \"So Tough\". In 1974, Reprise issued Pet Sounds as a single disc, which became the album's last reissue until 1990. In 1990, Pet Sounds debuted on CD with the addition of three previously unreleased bonus tracks: \"Unreleased Backgrounds\" (an a cappella demo section of \"Don't Talk\" sung by Wilson), \"Hang On to Your Ego\", and \"Trombone Dixie\".  The edition was prepared from the original 1966 mono master, by Mark Linett, who used Sonic Solutions' No Noise processing to mitigate damage that the physical master had accrued. It became one of the first CDs to sell more than a million copies. In 1995, DCC issued a 20-bit audiophile version that was mastered by engineer Steve Hoffman. It was created from a safety copy of the original master. According to Granata, this version \"garnered numerous accolades, and some feel it comes closest to capturing the spirit and punch of Brian's original 1966 mix.\" In 1997, The Pet Sounds Sessions was released as a four-disc box set. It included the original mono release of Pet Sounds, the album's first stereo mix (created by Linett and Wilson), backing tracks, isolated vocals, and session highlights. It was received with controversy among audiophiles who felt that a stereo mix of Pet Sounds was sacrilege against the original mono recording. In 2001, Pet Sounds was issued with mono and \"improved\" stereo versions, plus \"Hang On to Your Ego\" as a bonus track, all on one disc. On August 29, 2006, Capitol released a 40th Anniversary edition, containing a new 2006 remaster of the original mono mix, DVD mixes (stereo and Surround Sound), and a \"making of\" documentary. The discs were released in a regular jewel box and a deluxe edition was released in a green fuzzy box. A two-disc colored gatefold vinyl set was released with green (stereo) and yellow (mono) discs. In 2016, a 50th anniversary edition box set presented the remastered album in both stereo and mono forms alongside studio sessions outtakes, alternate mixes, and live recordings. Of the 104 tracks, only 14 were previously unreleased."

        "content": "During the summer, Harry Potter and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors. Forced to magically fend them off, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, but his expulsion is postponed pending a hearing at the Ministry of Magic. A group of wizards belonging to the Order of the Phoenix whisk Harry off to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, Sirius Black's childhood home. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny Weasley and Fred and George Weasley learn that Voldemort is seeking something he lacked prior to his defeat. The Ministry, led by Cornelius Fudge, refuses to accept Voldemort's return, and are running a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore. At the hearing, Dumbledore defends Harry, who is cleared of all charges. At Hogwarts, Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry employee, becomes the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She disputes Voldemort's return, and clashes with Harry, punishing him by having him writes lines with a quill that magically carves \"I must not tell lies\" into the back of his hand. When she refuses to teach students how to perform defensive magic, Harry, Ron, and Hermione form their own Defence group with other students. Umbridge, empowered by the Ministry to interfere in Hogwarts as the new High Inquisitor, bans unapproved clubs, forcing the group, now called Dumbledore's Army, to secretly meet in the Room of Requirement to practice under Harry's instruction. One night, Harry has a vision of Voldemort's snake Nagini viciously attacking Arthur Weasley. Harry informs Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore, and Arthur is rescued. Dumbledore arranges for Professor Snape, another Order member, to teach Harry Occlumency to protect his mind against Voldemort's invasions. Umbridge is eventually tipped-off about Dumbledore's Army; to prevent Harry's expulsion, Dumbledore takes responsibility for the group, then goes into hiding. Umbridge becomes headmistress, though she is unable to access Dumbledore's old office. Harry's Occlumency lessons go poorly. During one session, Snape is called away, leaving Harry alone with the Pensieve. In it, Harry views Snape's memory of his father, James Potter, and Sirius Black bullying and humiliating Snape in school. Snape catches Harry and ends the lessons in a fit of rage. Harry makes no further effort to protect his mind, and during exams, Harry has a vision of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. Harry uses the floo network in Umbridge's fireplace to contact Grimmauld Place. Kreacher, Sirius' house elf, claims he is gone. Umbridge catches Harry and wants Snape to question Harry with Veritaserum, which he claims he has run out of. Harry covertly warns Snape of Sirius, which Snape claims to not understand. Umbridge reveals she ordered the Dementor attack on Harry, and decides to interrogate him with the Cruciatus Curse. Hermione intervenes, convincing Umbridge that Dumbledore's secret weapon is in the Forbidden Forest. Harry and Hermione lead her into the centaurs' territory. Umbridge provokes them, and they take her captive. Harry and Hermione escape the centaurs. Luna, Ron, Ginny, and Neville join them, and they fly to the Ministry on Thestrals, to rescue Sirius. Once in the Department of Mysteries, they fail to find him, instead finding a glass sphere bearing Harry's and Voldemort's names. Death Eaters led by Lucius Malfoy attack them, revealing that Harry was lured here with a fake vision to secure the sphere, which is what Voldemort seeks \u2013 a recording of a prophecy concerning Harry and Voldemort. Order of the Phoenix members arrive and battle the Death Eaters. During the fight, Neville accidentally destroys the prophecy, and Bellatrix Lestrange kills Sirius. Harry chases after her, but is no match. Voldemort arrives to kill Harry, but Dumbledore appears, dueling Voldemort to a stalemate. Voldemort possesses Harry, in an attempt to get Dumbledore to kill Harry, but Harry fights off the possession, driving out Voldemort just as Fudge arrives. Having seen Voldemort, Fudge accepts the truth. In his office, Dumbledore explains that Snape had understood Harry's warning, and alerted the Order. Dumbledore also reveals that Kreacher had informed Lucius' wife, Narcissa, of Harry and Sirius's closeness, which Voldemort exploited. Dumbledore also reveals that Harry is safe from Voldemort with the Dursleys, as by taking Harry in, Petunia, Lily's sister, seals the protection Harry's mother gave him. Furthermore, Dumbledore reveals the contents of the prophecy, which foretold the birth of someone with the power to defeat Voldemort. One of Voldemort's followers had overheard part of the prophecy, and informed Voldemort, who then tried to kill the baby Harry. The rest of the prophecy, which Voldemort did not hear, hinted that Voldemort would mark his opponent as an equal, and that eventually, one would kill the other. Overwhelmed by the prophecy and mourning the loss of Sirius, Harry grows sullen, although the wizarding community now affords him great respect. Motivated by his friends, Harry returns to the Dursleys."

Fischer, Richard Levinson and William Link, starring Angela Lansbury, and produced and distributed by Universal Television for the CBS network. The series focuses on the life of Jessica Fletcher, a mystery writer and amateur detective, who finds herself becoming involved in solving a series of murders that take place in the fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine, as well as across the United States and abroad. The program ran for 12 seasons between 1984 to 1996, for a total of 264 episodes, and included amongst its recurring cast Tom Bosley, William Windom and Ron Masak, as well as a vast array of guest cast members including Michael Horton, Keith Michell and Julie Adams. The series proved a ratings hit during its broadcast, becoming a staple of CBS Sunday night tv schedule for around a decade, while achieving distinction as one of the most successful and longest-running television shows in history, averaging more than 30 million viewers per week in its prime. In syndication, the series is still highly successful and popular throughout the world. For her role on the program, Lansbury was nominated for ten Golden Globes, winning four, along with nominations for 12 Emmy Awards, earning her the record for the most Golden Globe nominations and wins for Best Actress in a television drama series and the most Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. The series itself also received three Emmy nominations for Outstanding Drama Series, as well as six Golden Globe nominations in the same category, with two major wins. After the series finished in 1996, four television films were released between 1997 and 2003, with two point-and-click video games released for PC - one in 2009, and a sequel in 2012.

Fischer, Richard Levinson and William Link thought Lansbury would be perfect for the part of Jessica Fletcher but did not think that she would be interested in a television series. Earlier, she had acted in two film adaptations of Agatha Christie's mystery novels: as Salome Otterbourne in Death on the Nile and as Miss Marple in The Mirror Crack'd (1980). When the latter film did poorly\u2014despite an all star cast including Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, Kim Novak, and Tony Curtis\u2014the offer for Lansbury to reprise Miss Marple in three more films never materialized. When she made it known she would be available if the right project came along, the three creators sent her the script and almost immediately, Lansbury felt she could do something with the role of Jessica Fletcher. With Murder, She Wrote debuting on Sunday, September 30, 1984, the producers were able to parlay their \"mystery writer/amateur detective\" premise into a 12-year hit for CBS. It also made Lansbury, known previously for her motion picture and Broadway stage work, a household name for millions of television viewers. The title comes from Murder, She Said, which was the title of a 1961 film adaptation of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple novel 4:50 from Paddington."

        "content": "The show revolves around the day-to-day life of Jessica Fletcher (formerly MacGill), a widowed and retired English teacher, who becomes a successful mystery writer. Despite fame and fortune, Jessica remains a resident of Cabot Cove, a small coastal community in Maine, and maintains her links with all of her old friends, never letting her success go to her head. The show mostly starts with a preview of the episode's events, with Jessica stating: \"Tonight on Murder, She Wrote...\" Jessica invariably proves more perceptive than the official investigators of a case, who are almost always willing to arrest the most likely suspect. By carefully piecing the clues together and asking astute questions, she fools the authorities into arresting her chosen suspect as 'real murderer'. Murder occurred with such regularity in her vicinity that the term \"Cabot Cove syndrome\" was coined to describe the constant appearance of dead bodies in remote locations. Indeed, if Cabot Cove existed in real life, it would top the FBI's national crime statistics in numerous categories, with some analysis suggesting that the homicide rate in Cabot Cove exceeds even that of the real-life murder capital of the world. Jessica's relationship with law enforcement officials varies from place to place. Both sheriffs of Cabot Cove resign themselves to having her meddle in their cases. However, most detectives and police officers do not want her anywhere near their crime scenes, until her accurate deductions convince them to listen to her. Some are happy to have her assistance from the start, often because they are fans of her books. With time, she makes friends in many police departments across the U.S., as well as with a British police officer attached to Scotland Yard. At the start of season eight, more of the stories were set in New York City with Jessica moving into an apartment there part-time in order to teach criminology."

        "title": "Murder, She Wrote_Ending",
        "content": "In August 1988, Lansbury expressed weariness of her commitment to the series as she was not sure, at 63, that she could continue at the pace now required of her; she specifically cited the change from seven to eight days to shoot each episode. Thus, Murder, She Wrote went into its fifth season that autumn with the distinct possibility that it would cease production at the end of it and the series finale would air in May 1989. A solution was worked on, however, which enabled Lansbury to continue but also give her time to rest. This also enabled some secondary characters to get significant stories. For the next two seasons, Lansbury reduced her appearances in several episodes, only appearing at the beginning and the end, to introduce stories starring several friends of Jessica, like PI Harry McGraw, reformed thief Dennis Stanton or MI5 agent Michael Hagarty. The \"experiment\" ended in 1991. In 1992, Lansbury took on a more extensive role in production as she became the show's executive producer. By the end of the 1994\u20131995 season, Murder, She Wrote's 11th season, Lansbury again was considering retirement; this would have made the upcoming twelfth season the final one for the veteran drama. CBS, however, essentially would make the decision for her in what would prove to be a mistake. When the network released its schedule for the 1995\u20131996 season, it decided to go in a different direction for its Sunday night lineup and placed two sitcoms, the top 30 hit Cybill and the new Almost Perfect, into the longtime home of Murder, She Wrote. CBS then put the series in its lead position on Thursday nights, anchoring a lineup that included the new drama New York News and the newsmagazine 48 Hours. The move put Murder, She Wrote in direct competition with the first hour of NBC's Must See TV lineup, which had been drawing the highest ratings of the week for any network for years. Despite protests of many of the show's fans (who believed CBS was intentionally setting the show up to fail in its new timeslot), CBS refused to budge on the new timeslot. Murder, She Wrote plummeted from eighth to fifty-eighth in the yearly ratings as a result; the series lost nearly 6 million viewers and fell below a 10 Nielsen rating as the audience was not willing to follow it to Thursday. It also proved unwilling to watch anything else on CBS on Sunday either; Cybill saw its ratings drop significantly, Almost Perfect was quickly shuffled to Mondays in an attempt to boost its ratings and replaced by The Bonnie Hunt Show, which was quickly cancelled. (In addition, New York News was also cancelled after a few weeks and so was its replacement, the long-running Rescue 911.) CBS eventually decided the drop in ratings was too much and cancelled Murder, She Wrote after twelve seasons. After a three-week hiatus in April 1996, the network returned the show to its longtime Sunday night home to conclude its run; the finale aired on May 19, 1996. The network also agreed to commission four Murder, She Wrote movies over the next few years.  The first was South by Southwest (1997), with three more following as A Story to Die For (2000), The Last Free Man (2001), and The Celtic Riddle (2003). Lansbury stated in May 2011 that she would like to make a comeback appearance as Jessica Fletcher. However, in a 2015 interview, she quashed the idea of reprising the much beloved character, stating, \"I think it would be a downer. In some way, we\u2019d have to show her as a much older woman, and I think it\u2019s better to maintain that picture we have in our mind\u2019s eye of her as a vigorous person.  I\u2019m still pretty vigorous, especially in the garden \u2026 but if I wanted to transform myself back into the woman I looked like then, it would be ridiculous. And I can't do that.\" She then expressed interest in revisiting the character again in 2017."

Keith Michell is the only actor other than Angela Lansbury to receive star billing (before the episode titles), on episodes which focus on Dennis. Len Cariou as Michael Hagarty (7 episodes, 1985\u201386, 1988\u20131992), a British former MI5 agent, who often appeared when Jessica least expected him to drag her into a dangerous case.

As with the band's first two efforts, it is a concept album, and satirizes left- and right-wing politics, particularly the hippie subculture, as well as the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was conceived as part of a project called No Commercial Potential, which produced three other albums: Lumpy Gravy, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets, and Uncle Meat. We're Only in It for the Money encompasses rock, experimental music, and psychedelic rock, with orchestral segments deriving from the recording sessions for Lumpy Gravy, which was previously issued as a solo instrumental album by Capitol Records and was subsequently reedited by frontman Frank Zappa and released by Verve; the reedited Lumpy Gravy was produced simultaneously with We're Only in It for the Money and is the first part of a conceptual continuity, continued with the reedited Lumpy Gravy and concluded with Zappa's final album Civilization Phaze III (1994)."

Zappa stated, \"It's all one album. All the material in the albums is organically related and if I had all the master tapes and I could take a razor blade and cut them apart and put it together again in a different order it still would make one piece of music you can listen to. Then I could take that razor blade and cut it apart and reassemble it a different way, and it still would make sense. I could do this twenty ways. The material is definitely related.\" As the recording sessions continued, the Beatles released their acclaimed album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. In response to the album's release, Zappa decided to change the album's concept to parody the Beatles album, because he felt that the Beatles were insincere and \"only in it for the money\". The Beatles were targeted as a symbol of Zappa's objections to the corporatization of youth culture, and the album served as a criticism of them and psychedelic rock as a whole."

        "content": "Band member Ray Collins had left the Mothers before the New York recording sessions took place, but later rejoined when the band was recording the doo-wop songs that formed the album Cruisin' with Ruben & the Jets. Gary Kellgren was hired as an engineer for the project, and subsequently wound up delivering whispered pieces of dialogue that linked segments of We're Only in It for the Money. During the recording sessions, Verve requested that Zappa remove a verse from the song \"Mother People\". Zappa complied, but reversed the recording and included the backwards verse as part of the dialogue track \"Hot Poop\", concluding the album's first side, but this would be removed by Verve themselves on subsequent represses of their own. Also censored on all copies was the Lenny Bruce reference in \"Harry, You're A Beast\", and a spoken segment of \"Concentration Moon\" in which Kellgren called the Velvet Underground \"as shitty a group as Frank Zappa's group\". While recording We're Only in It for the Money, Zappa discovered that the strings of Apostolic Studios' grand piano would resonate if a person spoke near those strings. The \"piano people\" experiment involved Zappa having various speakers improvise dialogue using topics offered by Zappa. Various people contributed to these sessions, including Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart and Tim Buckley. The \"piano people\" voices primarily consisted of Motorhead Sherwood, Roy Estrada, Spider Barbour, All-Night John (the manager of the studio) and Louis Cuneo, who was noted for his laugh, which sounded like a \"psychotic turkey\". During the production, Zappa experimented with recording and editing techniques which produced unusual textures and musique concr\u00e8te compositions; the album featured abbreviated songs interrupted by segments of dialogue and unrelated music which changed the continuity of the album. Segments of orchestral music included on the album came from a solo orchestral album by Zappa previously released by Capitol Records under the title Lumpy Gravy in 1967. MGM claimed that Zappa was under contractual obligation to record for them, and subsequently Zappa re-edited Lumpy Gravy, releasing a drastically different version on Verve Records, after the release of We're Only in It for the Money. The artwork of Lumpy Gravy identified it as \"phase 2 of We're Only in It for the Money\", while We're Only in It for the Money was identified in its artwork as \"phase one of Lumpy Gravy\", alluding to the conceptual continuity of the two albums. For some pressings of the album, MGM censored several tracks without Zappa's knowledge, involvement or permission. On the song \"Absolutely Free\", the line \"I don't do publicity balling for you anymore\" was edited by MGM to remove the word \"balling\", changing the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, on \"Let's Make the Water Turn Black\", the line \"and I still remember Mama, with her apron and her pad, feeding all the boys at Ed's Cafe\" was removed. Zappa later learned that this line was censored because an MGM executive thought that the word \"pad\" referred to a sanitary napkin, rather than a waitress's order pad. The Kellgren dialogue segment in \"Concentration Moon\" was also re-edited, making it seem that he was calling the Velvet Underground \"Frank Zappa's group.\" Zappa later declined to accept an award for the album upon being made aware of the censorship, stating \"I prefer that the award be presented to the guy who modified this record, because what you're hearing is more reflective of his work than mine.\""

Subsequently, the album satirizes hippie culture and left-wing politics, as well as targeting right-wing politics, describing both political sides as \"prisoners of the same narrow-minded, superficial phoniness.\" Zappa later stated in 1978, \"hippies were pretty stupid. [...] the people involved in [youth] processes [...] are very sensitive to criticism. They always take themselves too seriously. So anybody who impugns the process, whether it's a peace march or love beads or whatever it is \u2013 that person is the enemy and must be dealt with severely. So we came under a lot of criticism, because we dared to suggest that perhaps what was going on was really stupid.\" Another element of the album's lyrical content came from the Los Angeles Police Department's harassment and arrests of young rock fans, which made it difficult for the band to perform on the West Coast, leading the band to move to New York City for better financial opportunities. Additionally, Zappa made reference to comedian Lenny Bruce; the song \"Harry, You're A Beast\" quotes Bruce's routine \"To Is A Preposition, Come Is A Verb\". The song \"Flower Punk\" parodies the garage rock staple \"Hey Joe\", and depicts a youth going to San Francisco to become a flower child and join a psychedelic rock band. Additionally, the track makes a reference to \"Wild Thing\", one of the songs that defined the counterculture of that period. The rhythmic pattern of \"Flower Punk\" is complex, consisting of 4 bars of a fast 5 (2-3), followed by 4 bars of 7 (2-2-3)."

Zappa spent US$4,000 () on the photo shoot, which he stated was \"a direct negative\" of the Sgt. Pepper album cover. \"[Sgt. Pepper] had blue skies\u00a0... we had a thunderstorm.\" Jimi Hendrix, a friend of Zappa, took part in the photo shoot, standing where a wax sculpture of Sonny Liston had appeared on the Beatles album cover. Zappa phoned Paul McCartney, seeking permission for the parody. McCartney told him that it was an issue for business managers, but Zappa responded that the artists themselves were supposed to tell their business managers what to do. Nevertheless, Capitol objected, and the album's release was delayed for five months. Verve decided to package the album with inverted cover artwork, placing the parody cover as interior artwork (and the intended interior artwork as the main sleeve) out of fear of legal action. Zappa was angered over the decision; Schenkel felt that the Sgt. Pepper parody \"was a stronger image\" than the final released cover. In recent years, the album has been reissued with the intended front cover."

In 1984, Zappa prepared a remix of the album for its compact disc reissue and the vinyl box set The Old Masters I. The remix reinstated audio that had been censored by Verve, as well as the original \"Mother People\" verse. It also featured new rhythm tracks recorded by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman. Zappa would later do the same with Cruising with Ruben & the Jets, stating \"The master tapes for Ruben and the Jets were in better shape, but since I liked the results on We're Only in It for the Money, I decided to do it on Ruben too. But those are the only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself.\" Lumpy Gravy was also remixed by Zappa, but not released at the time. After the remixing was announced, a $13 million lawsuit was filed against Zappa by Jimmy Carl Black, Bunk Gardner and Don Preston, who were later joined by Ray Collins, Art Tripp and Motorhead Sherwood, increasing the claim to $16.4 million, stating that they had received no royalties from Zappa since 1969. Zappa would later prepare a CD of the original stereo mix for release by Rykodisc in 1995. Unlike the remix, this retained the censorship applied to \"Concentration Moon,\" \"Harry You're A Beast\" and \"Mother People\" on the original releases. The audio documentary box set The Lumpy Money Project/Object chronicles the production of We're Only in It for the Money, including the orchestral version of Lumpy Gravy, a 1968 mono mix of We're Only in It for the Money and 1984 remixes of We're Only in It for the Money and the reedited Lumpy Gravy album, as well as additional material from the original recording sessions."

He concluded that while the initial listening may be significantly profound, due to the reliance on shock, subsequent listening may be reduced in value; and he returns to a comparison with the Beatles, in which he feels that Zappa has the greater musical genius, but is less comfortable to listen to.

In his discussion of the components of such shock he popularized the term \"information overload.\" This analysis of the phenomenon of information overload is continued in later publications, especially The Third Wave and Powershift. In the introduction to an essay entitled \"Future Shock\" in his book, Conscientious Objections, Neil Postman wrote: \"Sometime about the middle of 1963, my colleague Charles Weingartner and I delivered in tandem an address to the National Council of Teachers of English. In that address we used the phrase \"future shock\" as a way of describing the social paralysis induced by rapid technological change. To my knowledge, Weingartner and I were the first people ever to use it in a public forum.

Each of these waves develops its own \"super-ideology\u201d in order to explain reality. This ideology affects all the spheres which make up a civilization phase: technology, social patterns, information patterns, and power patterns. The first stage began in the period of the Neolithic Era with the advent of agriculture, thereby passing from barbarity to a civilization. A large number of people acted as prosumers (eating their grown food, hunting animals, building their own houses, making clothes,....). People traded by exchanging their own goods for commodities of others. The second stage began in England with the Industrial Revolution with the invention of the machine tool and the steam engine. People worked in factories to make money they could spend on goods they needed (it means they produced for exchange, not for use). Countries also created new social systems. The third stage began in the second half of the 20th century in the West when people invented automatic production, robotics and the computer. The services sector attained great value. Toffler proposed one criterion for distinguishing between industrial society and post-industrial society: the share of the population  occupied in agriculture versus the share of city labor occupied in the services sector.  In a post-industrial society, the share of the people occupied in agriculture does not exceed 15%, and the share of city laborers occupied in the services sector exceeds 50%. Thus, the share of the people occupied with brainwork greatly exceeds the share of the people occupied with physical work in post-industrial society. The third wave led to the Information Era (now). Homes are the dominant institutions. Most people carry on their own production and consumption in their homes or electronic cottages, they produce more of their own products and services and markets become less important for them. People consider each other to be equally free as vendors of prosumer-generated commodities."

        "content": "Alvin Toffler's main thought centers on the idea that modern humans feel shock from rapid changes. For example, Toffler's daughter went to shop in New York City and she couldn't find a shop in its previous location. Thus New York has become a city without a history. The urban population doubles every 11 years. The overall production of goods and services doubles each 50 years in developed countries. Society experiences an increasing number of changes with an increasing rapidity, while people are losing the familiarity that old institutions (religion, family, national identity, profession) once provided. The so-called \"brain drain\" \u2013 the emigration of European scientists to the United States \u2013 is both an indicator of the changes in society and also one of their causes."

        "content": "Many goods have become disposable as the cost of manual repair or cleaning has become greater than the cost of making new goods due to mass production. Examples of disposable goods include ballpoint pens, lighters, plastic bottles, and paper towels. The design of goods becomes outdated quickly. (And so, for example, a second generation of computers appears before the end of the expected period of usability of the first generation). It is possible to rent almost everything (from a ladder to a wedding dress), thus eliminating the need for ownership. Whole branches of industry die off and new branches of industry arise. This affects unskilled workers who are compelled to change their residence to find new jobs. The constant change in the market also poses a problem for advertisers who must deal with moving targets. People of post-industrial society change their profession and their workplace often. People have to change professions because professions quickly become outdated.  People of post-industrial society thus have many careers in a lifetime. The knowledge of an engineer becomes outdated in ten years. People look more and more for temporary jobs. To follow transient jobs, people have become nomads. For example, immigrants from Algeria, Turkey and other countries go to Europe to find work. Transient people are forced to change residence, phone number, school, friends, car license, and contact with family often. As a result, relationships tend to be superficial with a large number of people, instead of being intimate or close relationships that are more stable. Evidence for this is tourist travel and holiday romances. The driver's license, received at age 16, has become the teenager's admission to the world of adults, because it symbolizes the ability to move independently. Death of Permanence. The post industrial society will be marked by a transient culture where everything ranging from goods to human relationships will be temporary."

Curtis Mayfield's song \"Future Shock\" on the album Back to the World took its name from this book, and was in turn covered by Herbie Hancock as the title track for his 1983 album Future Shock. That album was considered groundbreaking for fusing jazz and funk with electronic music. Stanley Clarke performed a song with the same title on his 1984 album Time Exposure. The rock band, BANG released \"Future Shock\" on their self titled Capitol Records release in 1972. October 2019 would see the release of metapop artist Kurt Riley's single FTR SHK. In the 1974 movie The Parallax View the character Joe relates a story to Lee about a wife having an affair with her psychiatrist and then a bulldozer knocking down his house by calling it future shock. Other works taking their title from the book include: the Futurama episode \"Future Stock\"; the Rocko's Modern Life episode \"Future Schlock,\" The Gordons 1981 EP on Flying Nun Records; a segment on The Daily Show starring Samantha Bee; Kevin Goldstein's recurring column on the Baseball Prospectus website; a Magic: The Gathering pre-constructed deck; and the National Wrestling Alliance's 1989 Starrcade event. Since 1977, UK Comic 2000 AD has run a series of short stories called Future Shocks based on this concept, some of which were written by Alan Moore. The abbreviated derogatory term Futsies was applied to citizens in 2000 AD stories (mainly in the Judge Dredd universe) who had been driven insane by Future Shock. Works deriving themes and elements from Future Shock include the science fiction novels The Forever War (1974) by Joe Haldeman, The Shockwave Rider (1975) by John Brunner, the RPG Transhuman Space (2002) by Steve Jackson Games, and the indie RPG Shock: Social Science Fiction (2006) by designer Joshua A.C. Newman. Experimental music group Death Grips use the lyric \"Culture shock, future shock, fuck yourself, choke yourself\" in their song \"Culture Shock\". The line \"You knocked a future shock crowbar upside my head\" occurs in the track \"The Outsiders\" on the alternative rock band R.E.M.'s 2004 album Around the Sun. In 2011, a song titled \"Future Shock\" by Darwin, Obie, and Mr-E appeared on the album Nu Nrg 100, the final installment of the world-renowned label Nu Energy, while Brooklyn-based band TV on the Radio included a song titled \"No Future Shock\" on their album Nine Types of Light. The same year, the Unsound Music Festival in Krakow, Poland took the concept of 'future shock' as its theme. Rapper Mos Def included a reference to the book title in his song entitled Mathematics. William Brittelle, the Brooklyn-based composer of pop-influenced electro-acoustic art music, has an album called Future Shock. The sense of future shock is an integral aspect of cyberpunk. Futureshock were also an electronic music duo recording for Junior Boys Own and Parlophone / EMI. The members were Phil Dockerty and Alex Tepper. A copy of the book can be seen lying on the deceased Wendell Armbruster Sr.'s desk in the 1972 movie Avanti! starring Jack Lemmon. In the episode \"A Friend in Deed\" (1974) of the television series Columbo, a colleague says to Lt. Columbo, \"Haven't you ever heard of future shock?  The world's going to hell with itself.\" The famous Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray's detective movie \"Sonar Kella\" (in Bengali language) shows a bookcase in the protagonist detective Feluda's room where there's a copy of Future Shock alongside books of other genre."

        "content": "Top Gun is a 1986 American action drama film directed by Tony Scott, and produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, in association with Paramount Pictures. The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\" published in California magazine three years earlier. The film stars Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis with Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards and Tom Skerritt in supporting roles. Cruise plays Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young naval aviator aboard the aircraft carrier . He and his Radar Intercept Officer, LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Edwards) are given the chance to train at the US Navy's Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California. Top Gun was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received generally mixed reviews from film critics but many particularly praised the action sequences, the effects, the aerial stunts, and the acting performances with Cruise and McGillis receiving the most praise. Four weeks after release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent. Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit grossing US$356 million against a production budget of only US$15 million. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an IMAX 3D re-release in 2013. Additionally, the soundtrack to the film has since become one of the most popular movie soundtracks to date, reaching 9\u00d7 Platinum certification. The movie won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Take My Breath Away\" performed by Berlin. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A sequel, titled Top Gun: Maverick is scheduled to be released on May 27, 2022, after facing multiple delays starting from a summer 2019 release in order to \"allow the production to work out all the complex flight sequences\", and the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "content": "United States Naval Aviator LT Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell and his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw are stationed aboard the , from which they fly the F-14A Tomcat. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28 aircraft (portrayed by USN F-5), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his wings, citing his newborn child that he has never seen. CAG \"Stinger\" sends him and Goose to attend TOPGUN, the Naval Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar. At a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. Maverick learns the next day that she is Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood, an astrophysicist and civilian TOPGUN instructor. Charlie later becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance. During Maverick's first training hop he defeats instructor LCDR Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks a major rule of engagement and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf. Privately, Jester confides that he admires Maverick's skill, but does not know if he would trust him as a teammate in combat. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's attitude \"foolish\" and his flying \"dangerous\"\u2014as Maverick's tendency to abandon his team and pursue reckless objectives makes him \"unsafe\" to fly with. In class, Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but privately admits to him that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship. During another training hop (Hop 19), Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper. Viper admits he is impressed with his flying abilities but Maverick is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess. Jester publicly tells Maverick that his flying is excellent, but that he should \"never leave [his] wingman\". Maverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the TOPGUN Trophy, chase an A-4 in a later training engagement (Hop 31). Since part of the scoring in every flight in the course is the time taken for every dogfight to conclude, and after noticing that Iceman is pulling time during his chase after the A-4 so that his total score in the course will remain higher than Maverick's, Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement with the A-4 they are both chasing so that he can shoot it down himself, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, going into an unrecoverable flat spin.  Maverick and Goose eject, but Goose hits the jettisoned aircraft canopy head-first and is killed. Although the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on the  and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the TOPGUN Trophy. During the graduation party, Viper and Jester call in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to the Enterprise to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of the SS Layton, a disabled ship that has drifted into hostile waters. Maverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, the two are still badly outnumbered, but Maverick vocally refuses to leave Iceman without a wingman and manages to shoot down three MiGs. Iceman, shifting to offense, also shoots one down, which forces the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to Enterprise, Iceman and Maverick share newfound respect in each other, and Maverick throws Goose's dog tags overboard. Offered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to TOPGUN as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite."

        "content": "The primary inspiration for the film was the article \"Top Guns\" by Ehud Yonay, from the May 1983 issue of California magazine, which featured aerial photography by then-Lieutenant Commander Charles \"Heater\" Heatley. The article detailed the life of fighter pilots at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, self-nicknamed as \"Fightertown USA\". Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project. Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included attendance at several declassified Topgun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways. Tony Scott was hired to direct on the strength of a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker Saab in the early 1980s, where a Saab 900 turbo is shown racing a Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet. Actor Matthew Modine turned down the role of Pete Mitchell (that went to Tom Cruise) because he felt the film's pro-military stance went against his politics. The character of Chipper Piper was created just for Pasdar as Scott loved his performance. The producers wanted the assistance of the US Navy in the production of the film. The Navy was influential in relation to script approval, which resulted in changes being made. The opening dogfight was moved to international waters as opposed to Cuba, the language was toned down, and a scene that involved a crash on the deck of an aircraft carrier was also scrapped. Maverick's love interest was also changed from a female enlisted member of the Navy to a civilian contractor with the Navy, due to the US military's prohibition of fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel. The \"Charlie\" character also replaced an aerobics instructor from an early draft as a love interest for Maverick after producers were introduced to Christine \"Legs\" Fox, a civilian mathematician employed by the Center for Naval Analyses as a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority (MAS), developing tactics for aircraft carrier defense. Julianne Phillips was in consideration for the role of Charlie, and had been scheduled to perform a screen test opposite Tom Cruise. Rear Admiral Pete \"Viper\" Pettigrew, a former Navy aviator, Vietnam War veteran, and Topgun instructor served as a technical advisor on the film, and also made a cameo appearance in the film as a colleague of Charlie's. Former Top Gun instructor pilot and Congressman Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham claimed to have been the inspiration for Pete Mitchell, although the film's producers have denied that the character was based on any specific Naval Aviator."

        "content": "The Navy made several aircraft from F-14 fighter squadron VF-51 \"Screaming Eagles\" (which Tom Skerritt mentions in the scene at his home) available for the film. Paramount paid as much as US$7,800 per hour (equivalent to $ today) for fuel and other operating costs whenever aircraft were flown outside their normal duties. Shots of the aircraft carrier sequences were filmed aboard USS Enterprise, showing aircraft from F-14 squadrons VF-114 \"Aardvarks\" and VF-213 \"Black Lions\". The majority of the carrier flight deck shots were of normal aircraft operations and the film crew had to take what they could get, save for the occasional flyby which the film crew would request. During filming, director Tony Scott wanted to shoot aircraft landing and taking off, back-lit by the sun. During one particular filming sequence, the ship's commanding officer changed the ship's course, thus changing the light. When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost US$25,000 (equivalent to $ today) to turn the ship, and to continue on course. Scott wrote the carrier's captain a US$25,000 check so that the ship could be turned and he could continue shooting for another five minutes. Future NASA astronaut Scott Altman piloted F-14 aircraft for many of the film's stunt sequences, having been recently stationed at NAS Miramar at time of filming. Altman was the pilot seen \"flipping the bird\" in the film's well-known opening sequence, as well as piloting the aircraft shown \"buzzing the tower\" throughout the film. Most of the sequences of the aircraft maneuvering over land were shot at Naval Air Station Fallon, in Nevada, using ground-mounted cameras. Air-to-air shots were filmed using a Learjet, piloted by Astrovision inventor and legendary pilot Clay Lacy. His name is misspelled in the closing credits, as Clay Lacey. Grumman, manufacturer of the F-14, was commissioned by Paramount Pictures to create camera pods to be placed upon the aircraft that could be pointed toward either the front or rear of the aircraft providing outside shots at high altitude. The fictitious MIG-28 enemy aircraft was depicted by the Northrop F-5. In July 1985, Kansas City Barbeque served as a filming location for two scenes. The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing \"Great Balls of Fire\" while seated at the piano. The final scene, where \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" can be heard on the restaurant's jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008. Renowned aerobatic pilot Art Scholl was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a flat spin, which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed \"I have a problem... I have a real problem\". He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his Pitts Special biplane into the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast near Carlsbad on September 16, 1985. Neither Scholl's body nor his aircraft were recovered, leaving the official cause of the accident unknown. Top Gun was dedicated to Scholl's memory. The film was shot in the Super 35 format, as anamorphic lenses were too large to fit inside the cockpits of the fighter jets and also the cameras would fall off their mounts when the fighter jets maneuvered on their sides. Reshoots after Top Guns filming wrapped conflicted with Made in Heaven, in which McGillis starred with brown hair. Top Gun filmmakers were forced to hide her hair color, which for example resulted a scene shot in an elevator that featured McGillis in a baseball cap."

Harold Faltermeyer, who previously worked with both Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson on Beverly Hills Cop, was sent the script of Top Gun by Bruckheimer before filming began. Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock worked on numerous songs including the Oscar-winning \"Take My Breath Away\". Kenny Loggins performed two songs on the soundtrack, \"Playing with the Boys\", and \"Danger Zone\". Berlin recorded the song \"Take My Breath Away\", which would later win numerous awards, sending the band to international acclaim. After the release of Loggins's single \"Danger Zone\", sales of the album exploded, selling 7 million in the United States alone. On the re-release of the soundtrack in 2000, two songs that had been omitted from the original album (and had been released many years before the film was made), \"Great Balls of Fire\" by Jerry Lee Lewis and \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" by The Righteous Brothers, were added. The soundtrack also includes \"Top Gun Anthem\" and \"Memories\" by Faltermeyer, with Steve Stevens also performing on the former. Other artists were considered for the soundtrack project but did not participate. Bryan Adams was considered as a potential candidate but refused to participate because he felt the film glorified war. The band Toto was originally meant to record \"Danger Zone\", and had also written and recorded a song \"Only You\" for the soundtrack. However, there was a dispute between Toto's lawyers and the producers of the film, paving the way for Loggins to record \"Danger Zone\" and \"Only You\" being omitted from the film entirely."

It eventually sold a record 2.9 million units. The film was first released in the U.S. on DVD under Paramount Pictures on October 21, 1998, and included the film in both Widescreen (non-anamorphic Univisium 2.00:1) and Full Screen (open matte) versions.

Special features comprise audio commentary by Bruckheimer, Tony Scott and naval experts, four music videos including the \"Top Gun Anthem\" and \"Take My Breath Away\", a six-part documentary on the making of Top Gun, and vintage gallery with interviews, behind-the-scenes and survival training featurettes. Subsequently, the film was first released on a Special Collector's Edition Blu-ray disc on July 29, 2008, with the same supplemental features as the previous 2004 DVD.

But look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another.\" American film critic Pauline Kael commented, \"When McGillis is offscreen, the movie is a shiny homoerotic commercial: the pilots strut around the locker room, towels hanging precariously from their waists. It's as if masculinity had been redefined as how a young man looks with his clothes half off, and as if narcissism is what being a warrior is all about.\""

The masculine theme of the film has been the subject of humorous examination, with the homoerotic subtext examined in a monologue performed by Quentin Tarantino in the 1994 film Sleep with Me. Top Gun is one of many war and action films, especially those by Jerry Bruckheimer, parodied in the 2004 comedy Team America: World Police. Top Gun along with A Few Good Men are recognized for being an inspiration for the TV series JAG and the subsequent NCIS franchise in turn. JAG and NCIS are also owned by Paramount. The DisneyToon Studios film Planes (2013) pays homage to Top Gun with Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards appearing in the film as part of the voice cast. Two Chinese war films, 2011's Jian Shi Chu Ji (\"Skyfighters\") and 2017's Kong Tian Lie (\"Sky Hunter\"), were based on Top Gun. On January 23, 2011, China's state broadcaster China Central Television published a TV news story about the alleged efficiency of Chinese fighter pilots which incorporated footage from the Top Gun action sequences. Chinese internet users noticed the plagiarism, whereupon the broadcast was immediately withdrawn. The CCTV has declined comments on this incident."

What Tom tells me is that no matter where he goes in the world, people refer to him as Maverick. It's something he is excited about so as long as he keeps his enthusiasm hopefully we'll get it made.\" By September 2014 it was revealed that Justin Marks was in negotiations to write the screenplay, which was confirmed that following June. Marks later said that the film was a dream project for him, calling the original an \"iconic film in my memory\" due in part to it being one of the first films he remembers seeing in a movie theater. In May 2017, during the promotional tour for The Mummy, Cruise confirmed that a sequel to Top Gun would start filming in 2018. By June of the same year, he said that the title would be Top Gun: Maverick with Faltermeyer back as composer for the sequel. Cruise further stated, \"Aviators are back, the need for speed. We're going to have big, fast machines. It's going to be a competition film, like the first one...but a progression for Maverick.\" Later that month it was announced Joseph Kosinski, who directed Cruise in 2013's Oblivion, was set to direct the sequel. A trailer was released at San Diego Comic-Con on July 18, 2019. The release date has been pushed back several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The current release date is May 27, 2022. It will later be streamed on Paramount+, 45 days after its theatrical debut."

Smiling is a signaling system that evolved from a need to communicate information in many different forms. One of these is an advertisement of sexual interest. Female smiles are appealing to heterosexual males, increasing physical attractiveness and enhancing sex appeal. However, recent research indicates a man's smile may or may not be most effective in attracting heterosexual women, and that facial expressions such as pride or even shame might be more effective. The researchers did not explicitly study the role of smiles in other sexual preferences."

Too much smiling can be viewed as a sign of shallowness or dishonesty. In some parts of Asia, people may smile when they are embarrassed or in emotional pain. Some people may smile at others to indicate a friendly greeting. A smile may be reserved for close friends and family members. Many people in the former Soviet Union area consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior, or even a sign of stupidity. Systematic large cross-cultural study on social perception of smiling individuals documented that in some cultures a smiling individual may be perceived as less intelligent than the same non-smiling individual (and that cultural uncertainty avoidance may explain these differences). Furthermore, the same study showed that corruption at the societal level may undermine the prosocial perception of smiling\u2014in societies with high corruption indicators, trust toward smiling individuals is reduced. There can also be gender differences. In the United States and Canada, women report men telling them to smile. For example, Greg Rickford, a member of the Canadian Parliament told a female journalist to smile rather than answer the question she had asked. Biological anthropologist Helen Fisher states that while this could be either caring or controlling behavior, such behavior is unlikely to be welcome."

        "content": "Cheek dimples are visible indentations of the epidermis, caused by underlying flesh, which forms on some people's cheeks, especially when they smile. Dimples are genetically inherited and are a dominant trait. Having bilateral dimples (dimples in both cheeks) is the most common form of cheek dimples. A rarer form is the single dimple, which occurs on one side of the face only. Anatomically, dimples may be caused by variations in the structure of the facial muscle known as zygomaticus major. Specifically, the presence of a double or bifid zygomaticus major muscle may explain the formation of cheek dimples. This bifid variation of the muscle originates as a single structure from the zygomatic bone. As it travels anteriorly, it then divides with a superior bundle that inserts in the typical position above the corner of the mouth. An inferior bundle inserts below the corner of the mouth. Dimples are analogous and how they form in cheeks varies from person to person. The shape of a person's face can affect the look and form as well: leptoprosopic (long and narrow) faces have long and narrow dimples, and eryprosopic (short and broad) faces have short, circular dimples. People with a mesoprosopic face are more likely to have dimples in their cheeks than any other face shape."

        "content": "While conducting research on the physiology of facial expressions in the mid-19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne identified two distinct types of smiles. A Duchenne smile involves contraction of both the zygomatic major muscle (which raises the corners of the mouth) and the orbicularis oculi muscle (which raises the cheeks and forms crow's feet around the eyes). The Duchenne smile has been described as \"smizing\", as in \"smiling with the eyes\". An exaggerated Duchenne smile is sometimes associated with lying. A non-Duchenne smile involves only the zygomatic major muscle. \"Research with adults initially indicated that joy was indexed by generic smiling, any smiling involving the raising of the lip corners by the zygomatic major .... More recent research suggests that smiling in which the muscle around the eye contracts, raising the cheeks high (Duchenne smiling), is uniquely associated with positive emotion.\" The Pan Am smile, also known as the \"Botox smile\", is the name given to a fake smile, in which only the zygomatic major muscle is voluntarily contracted to show politeness. It is named after the now-defunct airline Pan American World Airways, whose flight attendants would always flash every passenger the same perfunctory smile. Botox was introduced for cosmetic use in 2002. Chronic use of Botox injections to deal with eye wrinkle can result in the paralysis of the small muscles around the eyes, preventing the appearance of a Duchenne smile."

        "content": "Exile on Main St. is the 10th British and 12th American studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 12 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records. Recording began in 1969 in England during sessions for Sticky Fingers and continued in mid-1971 at a rented villa in the South of France named Nellc\u00f4te while the band lived abroad as tax exiles. A collage of various images, the album's artwork, according to frontman Mick Jagger, reflects the Rolling Stones as \"runaway outlaws using the blues as its weapon against the world\", showcasing \"feeling of joyful isolation, grinning in the face of a scary and unknown future\". Working with a mobile recording studio, the loose and unorganised Nellc\u00f4te sessions went on for hours into the night, with personnel varying greatly from day to day. The recording was completed with overdub sessions at Los Angeles's Sunset Sound and included additional musicians such as pianist Nicky Hopkins, saxophonist Bobby Keys, drummer Jimmy Miller and horn player Jim Price. The resulting music was rooted in blues, rock and roll, swing, country and gospel, while the lyrics explored themes related to hedonism, sex and time. These newly recorded tracks were combined with some tracks recorded at earlier sessions from 1969\u20131971, resulting in the Stones' first double album. Exile on Main St. contains frequently performed concert staples and was a number one charting album in six countries, including the UK, US, and Canada. It spawned the hit songs \"Happy\", a rare song that featured Keith Richards on lead vocals, country music ballad \"Sweet Virginia\", and worldwide top-ten hit \"Tumbling Dice\". A remastered and expanded version of the album was released in 2010 featuring a bonus disc with 10 new tracks. Unusual for a re-release, it also charted highly at the time of its release, reaching number one in the UK and number two in the US. The album was originally met with mixed reviews before a positive critical reassessment during the 1970s. It has since been viewed by many critics as the Rolling Stones' best work and a culmination of a string of the band's highly critically successful albums, following the releases of Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969) and Sticky Fingers (1971). Rolling Stone magazine has ranked Exile on Main St. number 7 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003 and 2012, and dropping to number 14 in the 2020 edition, the highest Rolling Stones album ranked on the list. In 2012, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the band's fourth album to be inducted."

Mick Jagger said \"After we got out of our contract with Allen Klein, we didn't want to give him [those earlier tracks],\" as they were forced to do with \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\" from Sticky Fingers (1971). Many tracks were recorded between 1969 and 1971 at Olympic Studios and Jagger's Stargroves country house in England during sessions for Sticky Fingers. By the spring of 1971 the Rolling Stones had spent the money they owed in taxes and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Jagger settled in Paris with his new bride Bianca, and guitarist Keith Richards rented a villa, Nellc\u00f4te, in Villefranche-sur-Mer, near Nice. The other members settled in the south of France. As a suitable recording studio could not be found where they could continue work on the album, Richards' basement at Nellc\u00f4te became a makeshift studio using the band's mobile recording truck."

        "content": "Recording began in earnest sometime near the middle of June. Bassist Bill Wyman recalls the band working all night, every night, from eight in the evening until three the following morning for the rest of the month. Wyman said of that period, \"Not everyone turned up every night. This was, for me, one of the major frustrations of this whole period. For our previous two albums we had worked well and listened to producer Jimmy Miller. At Nellc\u00f4te things were very different and it took me a while to understand why.\" By this time Richards had begun a daily habit of using heroin. Thousands of pounds' worth of heroin flowed through the mansion each week, along with visitors such as William S. Burroughs, Terry Southern, Gram Parsons, John Lennon, and Marshall Chess, the son of famous blues impresario Leonard Chess, who had been recently recruited to serve as president of the Rolling Stones' new eponymous record label. Parsons was asked to leave Nellc\u00f4te in early July 1971, the result of his obnoxious behavior and an attempt by Richards to clean the house of drug users as the result of pressure from the French police. Richards' substance abuse frequently prevented him from attending the sessions that continued in his basement, while Jagger and Wyman were often unable to attend sessions for other reasons. This often left the band in the position of having to record in altered forms. A notable instance was the recording of one of Richards' most famous songs, \"Happy\". Recorded in the basement, Richards said in 1982, Happy' was something I did because I was for one time early for a session. There was Bobby Keys and Jimmy Miller. We had nothing to do and had suddenly picked up the guitar and played this riff. So we cut it and it's the record, it's the same. We cut the original track with a baritone sax, a guitar and Jimmy Miller on drums. And the rest of it is built up over that track. It was just an afternoon jam that everybody said, 'Wow, yeah, work on it. The basic band for the Nellc\u00f4te sessions consisted of Richards, Keys, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Nicky Hopkins, Miller (a skilled drummer in his own right who covered for the absent Watts on the aforementioned \"Happy\" and \"Shine a Light\"), and Jagger when he was available. Wyman did not like the ambiance of Richards' villa and sat out many of the French sessions. Although Wyman is credited on only eight songs of the released album, he told Bass Player magazine that the credits are incorrect and that he actually played on more tracks than that. The other bass parts were credited to Taylor, Richards and session bassist Bill Plummer. Wyman noted in his memoir Stone Alone that there was a division between the band members and associates who freely indulged in drugs (Richards, Miller, Keys, Taylor and engineer Andy Johns) and those who abstained to varying degrees (Wyman, Watts and Jagger)."

Although Jagger was frequently missing from Nellc\u00f4te, he took charge during the second stage of recording in Los Angeles, arranging for the keyboardists Billy Preston and Dr. John and the cream of the city's session backup vocalists to record layers of overdubs. The final gospel-inflected arrangements of \"Tumbling Dice\", \"Loving Cup\", \"Let It Loose\" and \"Shine a Light\" were inspired by Jagger, Preston, and Watts' visit to a local evangelical church where Aretha Franklin was recording what would become the live album/movie Amazing Grace. The extended recording sessions and differing methods on the part of Jagger and Richards reflected the growing disparity in their personal lives. During the making of the album, Jagger had married Bianca, followed closely by the birth of their only child, Jade, in October 1971. Richards was firmly attached to his girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, yet both were in the throes of heroin addiction, which Richards would not overcome until the turn of the decade."

        "content": "According to Bill Janovitz, in his account of the album for the 33\u2153 book series, Exile on Main St. features \"a seemingly infinite amount of subtle (and not so subtle) variations on rock & roll \u2013 a form that had seemed to be severely limited to basic, guitar-driven music.\" Music biographer John Perry writes that the Rolling Stones had developed a style of hard rock for the album that is \"entirely modern yet rooted in 1950s rock & roll and 1930s\u20131940s swing\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, described Exile on Main St. as \"a sprawling, weary double album\" featuring \"a series of dark, dense jams\" that encompass rock and roll, blues, country, and gospel styles. Rolling Stone writer Richard Gehr compares the album to outlaw music and observes a strong influence of music from the American South in its \"loose-limbed\" explorations of 1950s rock, African-American soul, and gospel country. Although Exile is often thought to reflect Richards' vision for a raw, rootsy rock sound, Jagger was already expressing his boredom with rock and roll in several interviews at the time of the album's release. Jagger's stance on Exiles rock and roll sound at the time is interpreted by the music academic Barry J. Faulk to seemingly \"signal the end of the Stones' conscious attempt to revive American-style roots rock\". With Richards' effectiveness seriously undermined by his dependence on heroin, the group's subsequent 1970s releases \u2013 directed largely by Jagger \u2013 would experiment to varying degrees with other musical genres, moving away from the rootsy influences of Exile on Main St. According to Robert Christgau, Exile on Main St. expands on the hedonistic themes the band had explored on previous albums such as Sticky Fingers. As he writes, \"It piled all the old themes \u2013 sex as power, sex as love, sex as pleasure, distance, craziness, release \u2013 on top of an obsession with time that was more than appropriate in men pushing 30 who were still committed to what was once considered youth music.\""

        "content": "For Exile on Main St., Mick Jagger wanted an album cover that reflected the band as \"runaway outlaws using the blues as its weapon against the world\", showcasing \"feeling of joyful isolation, grinning in the face of a scary and unknown future\". As the band finished the album in Los Angeles, they approached designer John Van Hamersveld and his photographer partner Norman Seeff, and also invited documentary photographer Robert Frank. The same day Seeff photographed the Stones at their Bel Air mansion, Frank took Jagger for photographs at Los Angeles' Main Street. The location was the 500 block near the Leonide Hotel. At the time there was a pawnshop, a shoeshine business and a pornographic theatre (The Galway Theatre) at the location. Still, Van Hamersveld and Jagger chose the cover image from an already existing Frank photograph, an outtake from his seminal 1958 book The Americans. Named \"Tattoo Parlor\" but possibly taken from Hubert's Dime museum in New York City, the image is a collage of circus performers and freaks, such as \"Three Ball Charlie\", a 1930s sideshow performer from Humboldt, Nebraska, who holds three balls (a tennis ball, a golf ball, and a \"5\" billiard ball) in his mouth; Joe \"The Human Corkscrew\" Allen, pictured in a postcard-style advertisement, a contortionist with the ability to wiggle and twist through a  hoop; and Hezekiah Trambles, \"The Congo Jungle Freak\", a man who dressed as an African savage, in a picture taken by the then recently deceased Diane Arbus. The Seeff pictures were repurposed as 12 perforated postcards inside the sleeve, while Frank's Main Street photographs were used in the gatefold and back cover collage made by Van Hamersveld, which features other pictures Frank took of the band and their crew\u2014including their assistant Chris O'Dell, a former acquaintance of Van Hamersveld who brought him to the Stones\u2014and other The Americans outtakes."

Preceded by the UK (number 5) and US (number 7) Top 10 hit \"Tumbling Dice\", Exile on Main St was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 1 worldwide just as the band embarked on their celebrated 1972 American Tour. Their first American tour in three years, it featured many songs from the new album. The Richards-sung \"Happy\" was released as a second single to capitalize on the tour; it would peak at number 22 in the United States in August. After the release of Exile on Main St., Allen Klein sued the Rolling Stones for breach of settlement because five songs on the album were composed while Jagger and Richards were under contract with his company, ABKCO: \"Sweet Virginia\", \"Loving Cup\", \"All Down the Line\", \"Shine a Light\" and \"Stop Breaking Down\" (written by Robert Johnson but re-interpreted by Jagger and Richards). ABKCO acquired publishing rights to the songs, giving it a share of the royalties from Exile on Main St., and was able to release another album of Rolling Stones songs, More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies). Exile on Main St. was not well received by some contemporary critics, who found the quality of the songs inconsistent. Reviewing in July 1972 for Rolling Stone, Lenny Kaye said the record has \"a tight focus on basic components of the Stones' sound as we've always known it,\" including blues-based rock music with a \"pervading feeling of blackness\". However, he added that the uneven quality of songs means \"the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come\". Richard Williams of Melody Maker was more enthusiastic and deemed it the band's best album, writing that it will \"take its place in history\" as the music \"utterly repulses the sneers and arrows of outraged put down artists. Once and for all, it answers any questions about their ability as rock 'n' rollers.\" Geoffrey Cannon of The Guardian agreed, stating: \"Exile On Main Street will go down as [the Stones'] classic album, made at the height of their musical powers and self-confidence.\" The NMEs Roy Carr gave additional praise to the tracks, praising the styles present, the performances of the band and the lyrical content. In a year-end list for Newsday, Christgau named it the best album of 1972 and said, \"this fagged-out masterpiece\" marks the peak of rock music for the year as it \"explored new depths of record-studio murk, burying Mick's voice under layers of cynicism, angst and ennui\"."

He added that it is \"the single greatest rock & roll record of all time\", distinguished from other contending albums by the Beatles or Pet Sounds, which are more so \"brilliant pop records\". On the response to the album, Richards said, \"When [Exile] came out it didn't sell particularly well at the beginning, and it was also pretty much universally panned. But within a few years the people who had written the reviews saying it was a piece of crap were extolling it as the best frigging album in the world.\" In 2003, Jagger said, \"Exile is not one of my favourite albums, although I think the record does have a particular feeling. I'm not too sure how great the songs are, but put together it's a nice piece. However, when I listen to Exile it has some of the worst mixes I've ever heard. I'd love to remix the record, not just because of the vocals, but because generally I think it sounds lousy. At the time Jimmy Miller was not functioning properly. I had to finish the whole record myself, because otherwise there were just these drunks and junkies. Of course I'm ultimately responsible for it, but it's really not good and there's no concerted effort or intention.\" Jagger also stated he did not understand the praise among Rolling Stones fans because the album did not yield many hits. Richards also said, \"Exile was a double album. And because it's a double album you're going to be hitting different areas, including 'D for Down', and the Stones really felt like exiles. We didn't start off intending to make a double album; we just went down to the south of France to make an album and by the time we'd finished we said, 'We want to put it all out.' The point is that the Stones had reached a point where we no longer had to do what we were told to do. Around the time Andrew Oldham left us, we'd done our time, things were changing and I was no longer interested in hitting Number One in the charts every time. What I want to do is good shit\u2014if it's good they'll get it some time down the road.\""

The garage-trash noise-rock band Pussy Galore released a complete cover of the album, titled Exile on Main St., that reflected their own personal and musical interpretations of the songs, as opposed to paying tribute to the original sound. John Duffy of AllMusic rated the album three and a half out of five stars, and NME ranked it number 253 in \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The British acid house group Alabama 3 titled its debut album Exile on Coldharbour Lane. Perhaps the most notable reference comes from indie singer/songwriter Liz Phair's debut album Exile in Guyville. Phair herself claimed the album to be a direct song-by-song \"response\" of sorts to Exile on Main St. Post-grunge band Matchbox Twenty paid homage to this album by titling their 2007 retrospective Exile on Mainstream. Industrial rock band Chemlab named the leading track from their album East Side Militia, \"Exile on Mainline\", in reference to the Rolling Stones album. The Departed, a 2006 film by Martin Scorsese, features a scene in which Bill Costigan mails Madolyn Madden an Exile on Main St jewel case containing an incriminating recording of Colin Sullivan conspiring with crime boss Frank Costello. The same film also uses the song \"Let It Loose\" from the album. On 31 October 2009, American rock band Phish covered Exile on Main St in its entirety as the \"musical costume\" for their Halloween show in Indio, California. The first episode of the fourth season of the Showtime program Californication is called \"Exile on Main St\". A later episode in the sixth season featured a guest character waking up next to her musician boyfriend who had died from an overdose in the night in room \"1009,\" a reference to the lyrics of \"Shine a Light\". The same song was also played by Tim Minchin's character in the following episode. The first episode of the sixth season of the hit CW show Supernatural is titled \"Exile on Main Street\"."

        "content": "In 1994, Exile on Main St was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, along with the rest of the post-Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out catalogue, after the company acquired the masters to the band's output on its own label. This remaster was initially released in a Collector's Edition CD, which replicated in miniature many elements of the original vinyl album packaging, including the postcards insert. Universal Music, which remastered and re-released the rest of the post-1970 Rolling Stones catalogue in 2009, issued a new remastering of Exile on Main St in Europe on 17 May 2010 and in the United States the next day, featuring a bonus disc with ten new tracks. Of the ten bonus tracks, only two are undoctored outtakes from the original sessions: an early version of \"Tumbling Dice\" entitled \"Good Time Women\", and \"Soul Survivor\", the latter featuring a Richards lead vocal (with dummy/placeholder lyrics). The other tracks received overdubs just prior to release on this package, with new lead vocals by Jagger on all except \"I'm Not Signifying\", backing vocals in places by past and current Stones tour singers Cindy Mizelle and Lisa Fischer, and several new guitar parts by Keith Richards, and Mick Taylor on \"Plundered My Soul.\" On the selection of tracks, Richards said, \"Well, basically it's the record and a few tracks we found when we were plundering the vaults. Listening back to everything we said, 'Well, this would be an interesting addition.. All harmonica heard was added during 2010 sessions by Jagger, and Richards added a new guitar lead on \"So Divine\". \"Title 5\" is not an actual outtake from the sessions for Exile, it is an outtake from early 1967 sessions. It features the MRB effect (mid-range boost) from a Vox Conqueror or Supreme amp, as used by Richards in 1967 and 1968. \"Loving Cup\" is an outtake from early June 1969, but is actually an edit from two outtakes. The first 2 minutes and 12 seconds is the well-known 'drunk' version, as has been available on bootlegs since the early 1990s, but the second part is spliced from a second, previously unknown take. \"Following the River\" features Jagger overdubs on a previously uncirculated track featuring Nicky Hopkins on piano. The re-released album entered at number one in the UK charts, almost 38 years to the week after it first occupied that position. The album also re-entered at number two in the US charts selling 76,000 during the first week. The bonus disc, available separately as Exile on Main St Rarities Edition exclusively in the US at Target also charted, debuting at number 27 with 15,000 copies sold. It was released once again in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version."

Dorothy became pregnant while still in high school, resulting in a marriage to Stanley Zbornak (Herb Edelman) to legitimize the baby. Stan and Dorothy divorced after 38 years when Stan left the marriage for a young flight attendant. The marriage produced two children, Kate and Michael. In the series' final episode, Dorothy marries Blanche's uncle, Lucas Hollingsworth, and relocates to Atlanta. In season one, episode seven, Dorothy is stated to be 55. She is practical, sarcastic, easily angered, a follower of current events, and frequently the brunt of jokes about her supposed lack of attractiveness. Betty White as Rose Nylund (n\u00e9e Lindstr\u00f6m), a Norwegian American, is from the small farming town of St. Olaf, Minnesota. Often naive and known for her humorously peculiar stories of life growing up in her hometown, Rose was happily married to Charlie Nylund, with whom she had five children, daughters Kirsten, Bridget, and Gunilla, and sons Adam and Charlie, Jr. Upon Charlie's death, she moved to Miami. She eventually finds work at a grief-counseling center, but later switches careers and becomes assistant to a consumer reporter, Enrique Mas, at a local TV station. In later seasons, Rose becomes romantically involved with college professor Miles Webber. During season six, Miles is revealed to have been in the Witness Protection Program. Their relationship continues throughout the series and shortly into the sequel series, The Golden Palace. She is sweet, kind, and very competitive. Many of the jokes about Rose focus on her perceived lack of intelligence. Rue McClanahan as Blanche Devereaux (n\u00e9e Hollingsworth), a Southern belle, is employed at an art museum. Born into a wealthy family, Blanche grew up on a plantation outside of Atlanta, Georgia, prior to her relocation to Miami, where she lived with her husband, George, until his death. Their marriage produced six children, daughters Janet and Rebecca, and sons Doug, Biff, Skippy, and Matthew. A widow, Blanche is portrayed as self-absorbed and man-hungry. She has two sisters, Virginia and Charmaine, and a younger brother, Clayton. Another brother of Blanche's, Tad, is seen in the spin-off series. Many of the jokes about Blanche focus on her promiscuity. Estelle Getty as Sophia Petrillo, Dorothy's mother, was born in Sicily; Sophia moved to New York after fleeing an arranged marriage to Guido Spirelli. She married Salvadore \"Sal\" Petrillo, with whom she had three children, Dorothy, Gloria, and Phil, a cross-dresser who later dies of a heart attack (episode \"Ebbtide's Revenge\"). Initially a resident of the Shady Pines retirement home after having a stroke prior to the start of the series, she moved in with Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy following a fire at the institution.

        "content": "Ideas for a comedy series about older women emerged during the filming of a television special at NBC Studios in Burbank, California, in August 1984. Produced to introduce the network's 1984\u201385 season schedule, two actresses appearing on NBC shows, Selma Diamond of Night Court and Doris Roberts of Remington Steele, appeared in a skit promoting the upcoming show Miami Vice as Miami Nice, a parody about old people living in Miami. NBC senior vice president Warren Littlefield was among the executive producers in the audience who were amused by their performance, and he envisioned a series based on the geriatric humor the two were portraying. Shortly afterward, he met with producers Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas, who were pitching a show about a female lawyer. Though Littlefield nixed their idea, he asked if they would be interested in delivering a pilot script for Miami Nice, instead. Their regular writer declined, so Witt asked his wife, Susan Harris, who had been semiretired since the conclusion of their ABC series Soap. She found the concept interesting, as \"it was a demographic that had never been addressed,\" and she soon began work on it. Though her vision of a sitcom about women in their 60s differed from NBC's request for a comedy about women around 40 years old, Littlefield was impressed when he received her pilot script and subsequently approved production of it. The Cosby Show director Jay Sandrich, who had previously worked with Harris, Witt, and Thomas on Soap, agreed to direct the pilot episode. The pilot included a gay houseboy, Coco (Charles Levin), who lived with the girls. Levin had been suggested by then-NBC president Brandon Tartikoff based on  Levin's groundbreaking portrayal of a recurring gay character, Eddie Gregg, on NBC's Emmy-winning drama Hill Street Blues. After the pilot, the character of Coco was eliminated from the series. Walt Disney, NBC Studios and the creators were named in a federal copyright infringement suit filed by Nancy Bretzfield claiming the show was based on a script rejected by NBC in 1980. The suit was later settled."

        "content": "The part of Sophia Petrillo was the first of the four roles to be cast. Estelle Getty auditioned and won the role as the feisty mother of character Dorothy Zbornak, due, in part, to the rave reviews she garnered in her off-Broadway role reprisal for the 1984 Los Angeles run of Torch Song Trilogy. Afterwards, Getty had returned to New York, but gained permission from her manager to return to California in early 1985. Getty figured it would be her last chance to find television or film work. She would return home to New York if she were unsuccessful. Casting director Judith Weiner had seen Torch Song Trilogy, and thought Getty was terrific in it. She was also impressed by Getty's audition for the role of the mother of Steven Keaton (played by actor Michael Gross) for a guest episode of Family Ties. Although Getty was impressive, the show's producers went with another actress. Getty came to Weiner's mind soon after, when it became time to begin casting of The Golden Girls. Getty, who went through a three-hour transformation to become Sophia, wore heavy make-up, thick glasses, and a white wig to look the part. The character of Sophia was thought by the creators to enhance the idea that three retirement-aged women could be young. Disney's Michael Eisner explains, \"Estelle Getty made our three women into girls. And that was, to me, what made it seem like it could be a contemporary, young show.\" Getty continuously battled stage fright during her tenure on the show. In a 1988 interview, Getty commented on her phobia and expressed how working with major stars, such as Arthur and White, made her even more nervous. At times, she even froze on camera while filming. Hired to shoot the pilot, director Jay Sandrich also became instrumental in helping to cast the roles of Blanche Devereaux and Rose Nylund. Both Rue McClanahan and Betty White came into consideration, as the series Mama's Family, in which the two co-starred, had been cancelled by NBC. Producers wanted to cast McClanahan as Rose and White as Blanche based on roles they previously played; White portrayed man-hungry Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, while McClanahan co-starred as sweet but scatterbrained Vivian Harmon in Maude. Eager not to be typecast, they took the suggestion of Sandrich and switched roles at the last minute. In the pilot script, Blanche was described as \"more Southern than Blanche DuBois\", so McClanahan was perplexed when she was asked by director Sandrich during the filming of the pilot not to use the strong Southern accent she had developed, but to use her natural Oklahoma accent instead. Once the show was picked up for a first season, new director Paul Bogart felt exactly the opposite, insisting that McClanahan use a Southern accent. McClanahan deliberately exaggerated her accent, stating, \"I played Blanche the way I felt Blanche. She thought an accentuated Southern accent...would be sexy and strong and attractive to men. She wanted to be a Southern heroine, like Vivien Leigh. In fact, that's who I think she thought she was.\" Though Harris had created the character of Dorothy with a \"Bea Arthur type\" in mind, Littlefield and the producers initially envisioned actress Elaine Stritch for the part. Stritch's audition flopped, however, and under the impression that Arthur did not want to participate, Harris asked McClanahan if she could persuade Arthur, with whom she worked previously on the CBS sitcom Maude, to take the role. Arthur flipped upon reading the script, but felt hesitant about McClanahan's approach, as she did not \"want to play (their Maude characters) Maude and Vivian meet Sue Ann Nivens.\" She reconsidered, however, after hearing that McClanahan and White had switched roles. Bea Arthur and Betty White worked well together in shared mutual respect, but they did not pursue a personal friendship with one another outside of The Golden Girls set. Arthur's son, Matthew Saks, later spoke of tension between the two actresses, stating that his mother, \"unknowingly carried the attitude that it was fun to have somebody to be angry at...It was almost like Betty became her nemesis, someone she could always roll her eyes about at work.\" Both actresses had dramatically different training and acting backgrounds; Saks commented on White's habit of breaking the fourth wall to engage and joke with the studio audience during breaks between filming, which Bea Arthur found unprofessional. In 2011, White stated that she believed it was her \"positive attitude\" and perky demeanor that got on Arthur's nerves. Interestingly, Arthur preferred that  her three castmates and she all break for lunch together on workdays."

        "content": "The show was the second television series to be produced by the Walt Disney Company under the Touchstone Television label, and was subsequently distributed by Buena Vista International, Inc. (which holds as the ownership stake in Disney Channel Southeast Asia, now Disney\u2013ABC Television Group). Creator Susan Harris went on to contribute another four episodes to the first season, but became less involved with the sitcom throughout its run; she continued reading all scripts, though, and remained familiar with most of the storylines. Kathy Speer and Terry Grossman were the first head writers of the series, and wrote for the show's first four seasons. As head writers, Speer and Grossman, along with Mort Nathan and Barry Fanaro, who won an Emmy Award for outstanding writing the first season, gave general ideas to lower staff writers, and personally wrote a handful of scripts each season. In 1989, Marc Sotkin, previously a writer on Laverne & Shirley and a producer on another Witt/Thomas series, It's a Living, assumed head-writing responsibilities, and guided the show (to varying degrees) during what were its final three seasons. Richard Vaczy and Tracy Gamble, previously writers on 227 and My Two Dads, also assumed the roles of producers and head writers. Beginning in 1990, Marc Cherry served as writer and producer, years before creating Desperate Housewives, which ran on ABC from 2004 to 2012. Mitchell Hurwitz also served as writer for the show in its last two seasons. Hurwitz later created Arrested Development for Fox and later for Netflix. Cherry commented on read-throughs of the scripts that \"generally, if the joke was a good one, the women found a way to make it work the very first time they read it. You have a lot of table reads where the actors will mess it up because they don't understand what the characters are doing, or they misinterpret. But the women were so uniformly brilliant at nailing it the first time...we basically knew that if the women didn't get it right the first time, the joke needed to be replaced.\" According to Cherry, the writers' room was \"a competitive atmosphere. There was a lot of competition to get your words into the script.\" Writer Christopher Lloyd explained that the usual situation was for all of the more junior writers to be assigned the same scene to write, with the one judged the best version becoming the one chosen. This \"created a great deal of stress and competitiveness amongst those of us who weren't in that inner sanctum.\" After season three, Arthur had expressed her growing dissatisfaction with the disparaging jokes made about her physical appearance, which were often in the script. She expressed that she would not continue if changes were not made, but changes were made and jokes regarding Dorothy's physique appeared less often. Christopher Lloyd later said, \"I think that was a mistake we made, to be a little bit insensitive to someone who was an extremely sensitive person...I think we pushed that [the jokes about Arthur's appearance] a little bit far and I think she let it be known she didn't love that.\" Estelle Getty's stage fright, which affected her from the beginning of the show, grew worse as the show went on. According to McClanahan, by the end of season three, Getty's anxiety had become a serious problem, and she had increasing trouble memorizing her lines. To aid her retention, Getty tried hypnosis, and the show hired an assistant to run lines with her before taping; neither method worked. She took to writing her lines on props at which she could glance easily, like the wicker purse Sophia always carried with her. The cast often had to stay behind after the audience had departed to redo scenes where Getty had flubbed her lines, and although this was at first met with resistance from the producers, cue cards were eventually introduced to help her. Rue McClanahan, who shared a dressing room with Getty, described the severity of Getty's stage fright: \"She'd panic. She would start getting under a dark cloud the day before tape day...You could see a big difference in her that day. She'd be walking around like Pig-Pen under a black cloud. By tape day, she was unreachable. She was just as uptight as a human being could get. When your brain is frozen like that, you can't remember lines.\" Getty died in 2008, the result of dementia with Lewy bodies. Her co-stars, in an interview, said that her disease had progressed to the point that she was not able to hold conversations with them or recognize them. She had reportedly started to show signs of the dementia during the filming of the television series, when, despite more than three decades of theater work, she began to struggle to remember her lines, and in later seasons of the show, had to rely on cue cards. During season six, some uncertainty arose over whether Bea Arthur would commit to future seasons, or leave the show once her contract expired to pursue other projects. Arthur felt the characters had been in every possible scenario, and wanted to end the series while it was still successful. Debbie Reynolds was brought on as a guest star in the season-six episode \"There Goes the Bride: Part 2\" to test her chemistry with the other actresses as a possible replacement for Arthur, but producers decided that nobody could replicate the chemistry of the four original actresses. In any event, Arthur chose to commit to a seventh and final season."

This fa\u00e7ade, along with the Empty Nest house, sustained hurricane damage leading to Disney's 2003 decision to bulldoze the houses of \"Residential Street\" and construct its Lights, Motors, Action!: Extreme Stunt Show attraction, later replaced by Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. The fa\u00e7ade was based on a real house at 245 North Saltair Avenue in the Westgate Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. Producers used this residence for exterior shots during the first two seasons. In 2020, owners marketed the property for $3 million. The show's designer, Ed Stephenson, took inspiration from his time living in Florida to design a \"Florida look\" for The Golden Girls house set. The wooden accents, columns, and doors were painted to mimic bald cypress wood, popular in South Florida homes, with rattan furniture and tropical-printed upholstery chosen for the furniture. The kitchen set seen on The Golden Girls was originally used on an earlier Witt/Thomas/Harris series, It Takes Two, which aired on ABC from 1982 to 1983. However, the exterior backdrop seen through the kitchen window changed from the view of Chicago high-rises to palm trees and bushes for the Miami setting. Space was limited on the soundstage, so when the kitchen was off camera, it was usually detached from the rest of the set and the space used for something else. The doorway from the living room, with the alcove and baker's shelf just inside, was designed to give the illusion that the actors were walking into and out of the kitchen."

        "content": "Costume designer Judy Evans created distinctive looks for each of the four actresses to suit their character's personalities and to reflect the Florida setting. According to Evans, \"I wanted a sexy, soft, and flowing look for Rue, a tailored, pulled-together look for Bea, a down-home look for Betty, and comfort for Estelle.\" Anna Wyckoff of the Costume Designers Guild wrote, \"Evans took the direction from the producers to create a vibrant look for the four mature leads, and ran with it...redefining what \"dressing your age\" looked like.\" Many of the character's outfits were designed by Evans and made specially, but seven to ten costume changes per episode were made between the four actresses, which entailed a great deal of off-the-rack shopping. Evans generally dressed the actresses in expensive pieces and high-quality fabrics, despite the recurring theme that the four characters were struggling with money, because, \"The main idea was to make them look good. We didn't want the show to be about four dowdy ladies.\" Bea Arthur had a preference for wearing loose-fitting clothing, like slacks and long sweaters, along with sandals, because she hated wearing shoes. She had established this signature look while playing Maude, and Evans honored it in her designs for Dorothy. Much of Arthur's wardrobe was custom-made because at the time, finding off-the-rack clothing that was flattering for a taller woman was difficult. Rue McClanahan had a special clause written into her contract allowing her to keep her costumes, which were mostly custom-made using expensive fabrics. Eventually, McClanahan went on to create a clothing line for QVC called \"A Touch of Rue\", inspired by Blanche, but made with affordable fabrics and practical designs."

For example, one or more of the women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake, ice cream, or some other dessert. One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled the others with a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous, made-up stories). Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. Though the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes. One of the actresses on the show, Bea Arthur, actually hated cheesecake."

The show was the anchor of NBC's Saturday line-up, and almost always won its time slot, as ABC and CBS struggled to find shows to compete against it, the most notable being ABC's Lucille Ball sitcom Life With Lucy in the beginning of the 1986\u201387 season although it aired at 8:00, an hour earlier. The Golden Girls was part of a series of Brandon Tartikoff shows that put an end to NBC's ratings slump, along with The Cosby Show, 227, Night Court, Miami Vice, and L.A. Law. The show dealt with many controversial issues, such as coming out and same-sex marriage, elder care, homelessness, poverty, HIV/AIDS and discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS, US immigration policy, sexual harassment, teenaged pregnancy, artificial insemination, adultery, bad medical care, sexism, miscegenation and interracial marriage, antisemitism, age discrimination, environmentalism, addiction to pain killers, problem gambling, nuclear war, death, and assisted suicide. Writer and producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason created a sitcom with this kind of image as a \"four women\" show, which became Designing Women on CBS. Designing Women began competing against The Golden Girls. At the request of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who was reputedly a big fan, the cast of The Golden Girls performed several skits as their characters in front of other members of the royal family and her at the 1988 Royal Variety Performance in London."

In mammals, including humans, flesh encompasses muscles, fats and other loose connective tissues, but sometimes excluding non-muscular organs (liver, lung, spleen, kidney) and typically discarded parts (hard tendon, brain tissue, intestines, etc.). In a culinary context, consumable animal flesh is called meat. In particular animal groups such as vertebrates, molluscs and arthropods, the flesh is distinguished from tougher body structures such as bone, shell and scute, respectively. In plants, the \"flesh\" is the juicy, edible structures such as the mesocarp of fruits and melons as well as soft tubers, rhizomes and taproots, as opposed to tougher structures like nuts and stems. In fungi, flesh refers to trama, the soft, inner portion of a mushroom, or fruit body. A more restrictive usage may be found in some contexts, such as the visual arts, where flesh may refer only to visibly exposed human skin, as opposed to parts of the body covered by clothing and hair.  Flesh as a descriptor for colour usually refers to the non-melanated pale or pinkish skin colour of white humans, however, it can also be used to refer to the colour of any human skin. In Christian religious circles, the flesh is a metaphor associated with carnality."

Recording resumed on April 18, 1968, at the newly opened Record Plant Studios in New York City, with Chas Chandler as producer and engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren. Hendrix was famous for his studio perfectionism; he and drummer Mitch Mitchell recorded over 50 takes of \"Gypsy Eyes\" over three sessions. Hendrix was insecure about his voice and often recorded his vocals hidden behind studio screens. He sang backing vocals himself on the title track and on \"Long Hot Summer Night\". As recording progressed, Chandler became frustrated with Hendrix's perfectionism and his demands for repeated takes. Hendrix allowed friends and guests to join them in the studio, which contributed to a chaotic and crowded environment in the control room and led Chandler to sever his professional relationship with Hendrix. Bassist Noel Redding recalled: \"There were tons of people in the studio; you couldn't move. It was a party, not a session.\" Redding, who had formed his own band in mid-1968, Fat Mattress, found it increasingly difficult to fulfill his commitments with the Experience, so Hendrix played many of the bass parts. The album's cover states that it was \"produced and directed by Jimi Hendrix\". The double LP was the only Experience album mixed entirely in stereo. Hendrix experimented with other combinations of musicians, including Jefferson Airplane's Jack Casady and Traffic's Steve Winwood, who played bass and organ on the fifteen-minute slow-blues jam \"Voodoo Chile\". Hendrix appeared at an impromptu jam with B.B. King, Al Kooper, and Elvin Bishop."

During its recording, Kramer experimented with innovative studio techniques such as backmasking, chorus effect, echo, and flanging, which AllMusic's Cub Koda said recontextualized Hendrix's psychedelic and funk sounds on the album. Electric Ladyland is a cross-section of Hendrix's wide range of musical talent. It includes examples of several genres and styles of music: the psychedelic \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\", a UK single the previous summer (1967), the extended blues jam \"Voodoo Chile\", the New Orleans-style R&B of Earl King's \"Come On\", the epic studio production of \"1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)\", the social commentary of \"House Burning Down\", and the Sixties-era Britpop of Noel Redding's \"Little Miss Strange\". The album also features an electric reworking of the Bob Dylan classic \"All Along the Watchtower\", which has been well-received by critics as well as by Dylan himself, and also \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\", a staple of both radio and guitar repertoire. Rolling Stone Holly George-Warren praised \"Crosstown Traffic\" for its hard rock guitar riff. \"All Along the Watchtower\" became the band's highest-selling single and their only US top 40 hit, peaking at number 20; it reached number five in the UK. The album also included one of Hendrix's most prominent uses of a wah-wah pedal, on \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\", which reached number 18 in the UK charts."

The company instead used a blurred red and yellow photo of his head while performing at Saville Theatre, taken by Karl Ferris. Track Records used its art department, which produced a cover image by photographer David Montgomery, who also shot the inside cover portrait of Hendrix, depicting nineteen nude women lounging in front of a black background. Hendrix expressed initial displeasure and surprise with this \"naked lady\" cover (but later told Rolling Stone magazine that he \"dug it anyway\"), much as he was displeased with the Axis: Bold as Love cover, which he found disrespectful. The cover was banned by several record dealers as \"pornographic\", while others sold it with the gatefold cover turned inside out, or in a brown wrapper.

Melody Maker called it \"mixed-up and muddled\", with the exception of \"All Along the Watchtower\", which the magazine called a masterpiece. Reviewing for Rolling Stone in 1968, Tony Glover said Hendrix's original songs sometimes sound unstructured and was somewhat disappointed by the \"heavy handed guitar\" on \"1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)\" and the science-fiction conclusion to \"House Burning Down\". Ultimately, Glover appreciated the \"energy flow\" unifying the songs and described Hendrix as \"amazing\", adding that Electric Ladyland serves as \"an extended look into Hendrix\u2019s head, and mostly it seems to have some pretty good things in it (who among us is totally free of mental garbage?)\". Robert Christgau was more enthusiastic in Stereo Review, regarding it as an explosive showcase of rock's \"most important recent innovation\"\u2014the \"heavy\" guitar aesthetic\u2014and \"an integrated work-in-itself in more ways than one\". He found the production exceptional\u2014\"the best job of stereo for its own sake I know\"\u2014and was surprisingly impressed by the quality of the lyrics. While most guitarists in rock believed improvisation to be a straightforward endeavor, Christgau said \"Hendrix achieves unique effects, effects you'll never get from Kenny Burrell\", citing \"Voodoo Chile\" as an example. He later named Electric Ladyland the fifth-best album of 1968 in his ballot for Jazz & Pop magazine's critics poll."

        "content": "Over time, Electric Ladylands critical standing improved significantly, with author and musicologist John Perry describing it as \"one of the greatest double-albums in Rock.\" According to author Michael Heatley, \"most critics agree\" that the album was \"the fullest realization of Jimi's far-reaching ambitions\"; Guitar World editor Noe Goldwasser called it his greatest work. The record was also deemed an essential hard rock album in Tom Larson's 2004 book History of Rock and Roll, and Clash reviewer Robin Murray viewed it as a \"true classic of the psychedelic rock era\". In a retrospective review for Blender, Christgau wrote that it was the definitive work of psychedelic music, describing the record as \"an aural utopia that accommodates both ingrained conflict and sweet, vague spiritual yearnings, held together by a master musician\". In Charlotte Greig's opinion, much like Are You Experienced, Electric Ladyland was \"groundbreaking, introducing audiences to a style of psychedelic rock rooted in the blues\". The Washington Post critic Geoffrey Himes names it an exemplary release of the progressive soul development from 1968 to 1973. Author Amy Wallace called the album a \"classic of acid rock.\" Electric Ladyland has been featured on many greatest album lists, including a number 10 ranking on Classic Rock magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Rock Albums Ever, and number 37 on The Times 100 Best Albums of All Time. Music journalist and author Peter Doggett argued that it is very likely the greatest rock album of all time because of its exceptional concept, artful melodies, experimentation, and skilled musicianship, which he felt remains unparalleled by any other rock artist. The album was included in \"A Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). In 2000, it was voted number 32 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, Q magazine named Electric Ladyland as one of the 100 greatest albums,  while Rolling Stone ranked it 54th in its \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" publication. (Rolling Stones 2020 revision to the list upped the rank to 53.)"

The band's early releases, the 1978 singles \"That's Too Bad\" and \"Bombers\" plus the self-titled debut album, contained elements of punk, hard rock, heavy metal and new wave but were exclusively guitar driven with only occasional use of primitive synthesizer effects. \"Down in the Park\", on the other hand, was Numan's first composition on keyboards and his first release to feature the predominantly electronic sound that became his trademark. Musically, it pared down still further the guitar power chord and bass root note style arrangements he had used previously, reducing the harmony to bare unisons of layered bass guitar, Fender Rhodes electric piano, and Polymoog synthesizer. The semitone key changes (A to B) and chromatic melodic riffs between the song's verses are somewhat unusual in the context of traditional Western music theory, although they are less unusual in rock music."

Many of the filming locations were in the San Fernando Valley (composed of LAPD Devonshire, Foothill, Mission, North Hollywood, Topanga, Van Nuys, West Valley, and Valley Traffic Divisions); and the garage used tow trucks from the North Hollywood Division, close to Universal Studios, which co-produced the show with Mark VII Limited. The Temple Street building was closed in 2008, as a newer and larger station now houses the Rampart Division; the old building is being renovated to serve as headquarters for LAPD's Metro Division, the specialized division that is home to the SWAT, K-9 and Mounted platoons."

Each episode of the series was based on actual cases, with names changed to protect the innocent, and covered a variety of incidents that the officers encountered during a shift, from the tragic to the trivial. The series' first episode was filmed in September 1967, a year before the pilot was picked up. It was directed by Jack Webb. In episode 1, Reed is less than a week out of the prestigious Los Angeles Police Academy and is eager to begin his career. Three weeks earlier, Malloy's patrol partner and friend had been killed in a warehouse. The reason for them being in the warehouse is never mentioned; Malloy is deeply saddened, to the extent that he plans to resign from the force. (The episode \"Elegy for a Pig\" was not about Malloy's partner dying; Tom Porter was a friend who joined the LAPD with Malloy.) Watch Commander Lieutenant Moore (Art Gilmore) was Malloy's first training officer seven years earlier, and he assigns Malloy to take Reed the rookie out for his first patrol on Malloy's final shift. Reed shows tremendous potential on his first night on the job, but Malloy realizes that his new partner has plenty to learn, and the veteran officer decides to stay on the job and guide Reed during his nine-month probationary period. Reed's probationary period is played out during the first and second seasons, after which he transitions to a permanent officer. Reed and Malloy remain partners. In later seasons, Malloy and Reed began patrolling other beats of Los Angeles, including the Los Angeles International Airport, the Los Angeles Harbor, the Foothill District, the West Valley area, Venice, Van Nuys, Hollywood, Rampart, and North Hollywood. Several episodes featured the officers working with other rookie officers, with guest actors playing these one-time characters. Some episodes had Reed serving as the training officer, whereas Malloy had been promoted to the rank of a Senior Lead Officer (P-3+1) who coordinates patrols in many neighborhoods and works as the acting shift supervisor. Malloy displays a \"Distinguished Expert\" shooting medal, Reed displays a \"Sharpshooter\" medal. Malloy and Reed reported to Shift Supervisor (Sergeant 1) William \"Mac\" MacDonald (William Boyett), who occasionally took a black-and-white command cruiser (a Plymouth station wagon, carrying extra police equipment. From Season 5 Mac's vehicle was an AMC Matador station wagon, in keeping with the Matador squad cars used by Malloy and Reed from Season 5.) Mac's call sign was 1-L-20 into the field. Reed once questioned why Malloy had not taken the sergeant's exam, as he would have rated higher than Mac did. Malloy related he preferred working patrol on the street to supervision. Malloy later showed he could supervise when Mac was ill, and Malloy filled in. Several of their fellow officers were recurring characters; the most frequent were Jerry Woods (Fred Stromsoe), Ed Wells (Gary Crosby), Detective Sgt Jerry Miller (Jack Hogan), and Officer Brinkman (Claude Johnson). Shaaron Claridge voiced the dispatcher and was a dispatcher for the LAPD in real life. The personal lives of Malloy and Reed came up on occasion and were always tied in to their duties. Malloy is a bachelor who has at least five girlfriends during the course of the series (the last being Judy (Aneta Corsaut)), while Reed is married to a woman named Jean (played by several actresses, including Mikki Jamison and Kristin Nelson); in Season 2 he becomes a father."

There are several \"crossover\" episodes on each series with characters from other Mark VII shows. Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed appear on the Dragnet episode \"Internal Affairs: DR-20\", The D.A. episode \"The People vs. Saydo\" (the conclusion to a crossover that begins on \"The Radical\") and the Emergency! pilot movie, \"The Wedsworth-Townsend Act\". Sergeant MacDonald appears on the Dragnet episode \"Personnel: The Shooting\". The episode \"Lost And Found\" was set at Rampart General Hospital and featured the Emergency! cast. However, during an Emergency! episode, Adam-12 is shown as a TV show that the paramedics like to watch, causing somewhat of a paradox between the shows. Several years after Adam-12 was cancelled, Kent McCord was signed to appear in a planned third series of Dragnet playing Sgt. Friday's partner, but the project was cancelled due to Jack Webb's sudden death in December, 1982; since none of the scripts Webb wrote for the project were ever produced or released, it is not clear if he intended McCord to play a different character or to revive the Jim Reed character, although in the final episode of Adam-12, the two-part \"Something Worth Dying For,\" Reed talks about applying for an investigator's license."

Of the opening song, Birthday Card at Christmas, Ian Anderson has said: \"My daughter Gael, like millions of other unfortunates, celebrates her birthday within a gnat's whisker of Christmas. Overshadowed by the Great Occasion, such birthdays can be flat, perfunctory and fleetingly token in their uneventful passing. The daunting party and festive celebration of the Christian calendar overshadows too, some might argue, the humble birthday of one Mr. J. Christ. Funny old 25ths, Decembers\u2026\""

        "content": "Double Fantasy is the fifth album by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, released in November 1980 on Geffen Records. Produced by Lennon, Ono and Jack Douglas, it was the seventh and final studio album released by Lennon during his lifetime. The album marked Lennon's return to recording music full-time, following his five-year hiatus to raise his son Sean. Recording sessions took place at the Hit Factory in New York City between August and October 1980. The final album features songs from both Lennon and Ono, largely alternating between the two in its track listing. Other tracks recorded by Lennon from the sessions were compiled by Ono for release on Milk and Honey in 1984. Upon its release, the album stalled on music charts and received largely negative reviews from music critics, with many focusing on the album's idealisation of Lennon and Ono's marriage. However, following Lennon's murder three weeks after its release, it became a worldwide commercial success and went on to win the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards in 1982. In subsequent decades, the album has been viewed favourably, with Lennon's songs in particular garnering praise as some of his finest. In 2010, Ono and Douglas released a remix of the album, titled Double Fantasy Stripped Down, which featured less lavish production than the original."

        "content": "Following the birth of his son Sean in 1975, Lennon put his career on hold to raise him. After five years of little musical activity aside from recording the occasional demo in his apartment in New York, Lennon resumed work. In the middle of 1980, Lennon embarked on a sailing trip from Newport, Rhode Island, to Bermuda. During the journey, his yacht encountered a prolonged severe storm. Most of the crew succumbed to fatigue and seasickness except Lennon, who was eventually forced to take the yacht's wheel alone for many hours. It had the effect of both renewing his confidence and making him contemplate the fragility of life. As a result, he began to write new songs and reworked earlier demos. He commented later, \"I was so centered after the experience at sea that I was tuned in to the cosmos \u2013 and all these songs came!\" Ono also wrote many songs, inspired with new confidence after Lennon had stated that he believed that contemporary popular music, such as \"Rock Lobster\" by the B-52's, bore similarities to Ono's earlier work. The couple decided to release their work on the same album, the first time they had done so since 1972's politically charged Some Time in New York City. In stark contrast to that album, Double Fantasy (subtitled A Heart Play) was a collection of songs wherein husband and wife would conduct a musical dialogue. The album took its title from a species of freesia, seen in the Bermuda Botanical Gardens, whose name Lennon regarded as a perfect description of his marriage to Ono. Lennon was also inspired to return to music by his former songwriting partner within the Beatles. Upon hearing former bandmate Paul McCartney's 1980 single \"Coming Up,\" Lennon deemed the song \"a good piece of work\". According to McCartney, the track prompted Lennon to return to recording later that year."

        "content": "Ono approached producer Jack Douglas, with whom the couple had previously worked, and gave him Lennon's demos to listen to. \"My immediate impressions were that I was going to have a hard time making it better than the demos because there was such intimacy in the demos,\" Douglas told Uncuts Chris Hunt in 2005. Sessions for the album began at the Hit Factory in New York City on 7 August 1980 and continued through 19 October 1980. They produced dozens of songs, enough to fill Double Fantasy and a large part of a projected second album, Milk and Honey. Lennon wanted to work with different musicians than he had previously, and had Douglas assemble and rehearse the band without telling them who they would be recording with.  While the sessions were underway, Douglas brought Rick Nielsen and Bun E. Carlos of the band Cheap Trick (whom he was also producing) to play on Lennon's \"I'm Losing You\" and Ono's \"I'm Moving On\", but these were eventually re-recorded with the studio musicians. (The Cheap Trick version of \"I'm Losing You\" was included on the John Lennon Anthology collection released in 1998.) The sessions remained top secret. Lennon and Ono still were not signed to a record label and paid for the initial sessions themselves. After they were satisfied with the album, their publicist Bruce Replogle leaked the news that the couple were back in the studio again. Immediately, Lennon was inundated with offers from all the major labels. The recording industry was shocked when the couple signed with the newly formed Geffen Records on 22 September 1980 because David Geffen shrewdly insisted on speaking with Ono first and regarded her contributions as equal to Lennon's. He signed them before hearing any of the tracks."

It was released on 20 October 1980 in the United States, and four days later in the United Kingdom. Originally peaking at number 8 in the UK chart, after Lennon's death the single reached number one. In the US, the single was inching upward in the top 10 before reaching number one following Lennon's death. The album was released on 17 November 1980 in both the UK and US. Geffen had planned an elaborate cover for Lennon's comeback, but Ono could not decide on a photo.  Not wanting to miss the Christmas release deadline, Geffen used the single sleeve as the front cover, while choosing an outtake from the same photo session for the back. The tracks were sequenced as a dialogue between Lennon and Ono; one of his songs followed by one of hers. On the initial pressings, the track listing was out of sequence on the album cover. Initial sales were sluggish. In the UK album charts, it had peaked at number 14 then slipped to number 46, while in the US, it had risen to number 11. Upon Lennon's murder, the album jumped to number 1 in the US Billboard chart, where it stayed for eight weeks, and in the UK, it jumped to number 2, where it remained for seven weeks before finally spending two weeks at number 1. \"Woman\", chosen by Lennon, was released as a posthumous single, backed with Ono's \"Beautiful Boys\". It was released on 12 January 1981 in the US and 16 January in the UK, reaching number 1 in the UK and in the US on the Cash Box singles chart, while peaking at number 2 for three weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. Released as the final single from the album, \"Watching the Wheels\", backed with Ono's \"Yes, I'm Your Angel\", peaked at number 10 and 30 in the US and UK charts respectively. The single was released in the US on 13 March 1981, and on 27 March 1981 in the UK. Lennon's Bermuda trip and Double Fantasy inspired the 2013 tribute CD and book Lennon Bermuda."

        "content": "Initial critical reaction to the album was largely negative. However, three weeks after the album's release, Lennon was murdered and several negative reviews by prominent critics were withheld from publication, including those by Stephen Holden of The New York Times, Tom Carson of Rolling Stone, and Geoffrey Stokes of The Village Voice. The negative reviews focused on the album's idealisation of Lennon and Ono's marriage. Stokes found the concept and theme to be \"basically misogynist\" and Kit Rachlis of the Boston Phoenix admitted to being \"annoyed\" by Lennon and Ono's assumption \"that lots of people care deeply\" about them. Charles Shaar Murray, of New Musical Express, wrote that the couple's domestic bliss \"sounds like a great life but unfortunately it makes a lousy record,\" adding that he wished Lennon had \"kept his big happy trap shut until he has something to say that was even vaguely relevant to those of us not married to Yoko Ono\". Double Fantasy finished 37th in The Village Voices 1980 Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of prominent music critics. Robert Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it 7th on his own list of the year's best albums. Although he was put off by its simplistic lyrics and music upon first listen, Christgau said the music works a \"minor miracle\" with \"rich, precise\" song form and a \"command of readymades\" to put \"the anonymous usages of studio rock to striking artistic purpose\". He felt that the use of alternating Ono's improved vocals with Lennon's \"makes the union come alive\" better than his outspoken, straightforward lyrics and concluded that the album is not great but \"memorable and gratifying\" as rare, \"connubial rock and roll\". In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments: \"these are really nice tunes and what's special about them is their niceness \u2013 it's a sweet acceptance of middle age, which, of course, makes [Lennon's] assassination all the sadder.\" In 1982, Douglas, Lennon and Ono won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Double Fantasy at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards. In 1989, the album was ranked number 29 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2020, Rolling Stone included Double Fantasy in their \"80 Greatest albums of 1980\" list, praising Lennon and Ono for their collaboration as \"each song acts as a dialogue between the couple.\""

It was first released on CD on 13 October 1986 in the UK, and nearly a year later on 15 September 1987 in the US. The album was re-released on cassette, CD and vinyl in 1989, after EMI had obtained the rights to the album. On 9 October 2000, EMI/Capitol released a remastered version of the album, containing three bonus tracks. In 2010, Ono and Douglas supervised the release of a remix of the album called Double Fantasy Stripped Down. Released as a two-disc set, it included a newly remastered copy of the original album along with an alternative version of the album featuring simpler arrangements without the original's lavish production, with cover artwork by Sean Lennon. Ono said of the remix: \"This new version really allows us to focus our attention on John's amazing vocals. Technology has advanced so much that, conversely, I wanted to use new techniques to really frame these amazing songs and John\u2019s voice as simply as possible. By stripping down some of the instrumentation, the power of the songs shines through with an enhanced clarity.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the remix a mixed review, writing: \"Apart from '(Just Like) Starting Over', where the removal of the doo-wop backing vocals undercuts the loving oldies homage of the song, the changes [made] are so subtle that they're felt more than heard, cumulatively not affecting the impact of the album all that much.\" He completed his review by stating, \"Ultimately, Stripped Down sounds like a rough mix waiting for all the polish that made Double Fantasy feel like a full, complete album.\""

        "content": "A car pulls up on a New York City street, which Monty Brogan exits with his friend Kostya to look at an injured dog lying in the road. Monty intends to perform a mercy kill and shoot him, but changes his mind after he looks it in the eye; he takes the dog to a nearby clinic instead. A few years later, Monty is about to begin serving a seven-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. He sits in a park with Doyle, the dog he rescued, on his last day of freedom. He plans to meet childhood friends Frank, a Wall Street trader, and Jacob, an introverted high school teacher with a crush on his student Mary, at a club with his girlfriend Naturelle. Monty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic at his bar, to confirm their plans to drive to the prison the following morning. James was able to establish the bar with Monty\u2019s drug money, and remorsefully sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the bathroom. Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against everyone in New York before finally turning on himself, angry for becoming greedy and not giving up drug dealing before he was caught. In a flashback, Monty remembers the night he was arrested: DEA agents raided Monty's apartment and quickly found the drugs he was selling for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who betrayed him, since she knew where he hid his drugs and money. Monty refused to turn state's evidence against Nikolai, but is unsure about Nikolai\u2019s actions. Monty remembers how he met Naturelle hanging around his old school, and how happy they were. He then asks Frank to find out if it was Naturelle who betrayed him. Jacob sees Mary outside the club, and Monty invites her inside with them. Discussing what kind of a future Monty can have after prison, Frank says they can open a bar together, even though he told Jacob that he believes Monty deserves his sentence for dealing drugs. Frank accuses Naturelle of living high on Monty's money despite knowing its origins, but she retorts that Frank also knew but said nothing. The argument culminates with Frank insulting Naturelle's ethnicity, followed by her slapping Frank and leaving. Jacob, meanwhile, finds the courage to kiss Mary, but both are shocked afterwards and go their separate ways. Monty and Kostya go to see Nikolai, who gives Monty advice on surviving in prison. Nikolai then reveals it was Kostya, who betrayed Monty, and offers him a chance to kill Kostya in exchange for protecting his father's bar. Monty refuses, reminding Nikolai that he was the one who told Monty to trust Kostya in the first place. Monty walks out, leaving Kostya to be killed by the Russian mobsters. Monty returns to his apartment and apologizes to Naturelle for mistrusting her. He then hands Doyle over to Jacob in the park. He admits that he is terrified of being raped in prison, whereupon he asks Frank to beat him, believing that he might have a chance at survival if he enters the prison ugly. Frank refuses, and Monty goads Frank into taking out his frustrations, leaving Monty bruised and bloody, with a broken nose. Naturelle tries to comfort him as Monty's father arrives to take him to Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville. On the drive to prison, Monty once again sees a parade of faces from the streets of the city. James suggests they go west, into hiding, giving Monty a vision of a future where he avoids imprisonment, reunites with Naturelle, starts a family, and grows old. As the fantasy ends, Monty and James drive past the bridge to the west and towards prison."

Six months before the book's publication a preliminary trade copy was circulated which Tobey Maguire read, and he was interested in playing the role of Monty Brogan. He acquired the option for a potential film project and asked Benioff to adapt it into a screenplay. However, after the script was written, Maguire became pre-occupied with the Spider-Man film and had to abandon the plan, although he would later act as a producer on the film that was made.  Spike Lee then expressed an interest in directing the film.  Spike Lee was interested in the long monologue that Benioff called the \"fuck monologue\" whereby Monty ranted against the five boroughs of New York; Benioff had considered leaving it out as he thought it might not be dramatic, and Lee persuaded Benioff to keep it in. Disney picked up the film rights and wanted the monologue cut, but Lee filmed the scene nonetheless. The film was in the \"planning stages\" at the time of the September 11 attacks, and so Lee \"decided not to ignore the tragedy but to integrate it into his story\"."

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B- on scale of A to F. Five years after the September 11 attacks, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \"Released 15 months after Sept. 11, 2001, Spike Lee's 25th Hour is the only great film dealing with the Sept. 11 tragedy... 25th Hour is as much an urban historical document as Rossellini's Open City, filmed in the immediate aftermath of the Nazi occupation of Rome\". Film critic Roger Ebert added the film to his \"Great Movies\" list on December 16, 2009. A. O. Scott, Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert all put it on their \"best films of the decade\" lists. It was named the 26th greatest film since 2000 in a 2015 BBC poll of 177 critics. Monty's monologue, or rant, has made many top movie rant lists."

Although intended for an October 31, 2000, release under the title All About U, the album was delayed numerous times, following the leak of several tracks onto the online music store Napster. Usher subsequently recorded new tracks and released the album under the new title, 8701, which is derived from Usher singing for the first time in his local church in 1987 and the album's release date of  August 7, 2001. 8701 takes inspiration from multiple artists, including Donny Hathaway, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Michael Jackson. It follows the theme of Usher's relationship experience, along with the emotions of love and heartache. Usher promoted the album by embarking on the supporting tour, Evolution 8701 Tour in 2002, to which it he performed in forty-four shows across North America. He also made appearances in television shows, including Live! with Regis and Kelly and Total Request Live. 8701 produced two Billboard Hot 100 number one singles, \"U Remind Me\" and \"U Got It Bad\", along with the top five single \"U Don't Have to Call\". The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart, with 210,000 copies sold in its first week. 8701 has since been certified 4x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold eight million copies worldwide as of 2010. 8701 received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Usher's vocals and development as an artist, but were ambivalent towards some of the album's material. The album earned Usher numerous awards, including a BET Award, two Grammy Awards, and three Billboard Music Awards."

Following the event, the album's release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000, to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that he returned to the studios to record new songs, stating \"I didn't want that to be the way my record was remembered or the way I would present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better\" while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site were not going to be included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is \"practically a new album\". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001."

Several months later, Jam and Lewis produced the song \"Separated\", along with multi-platinum producers Ric Atari & Daron Jones (who also wrote the record) to which the producers then turned in to L.A. Reid, who liked the track, and asked them to produce more. Following this, Usher asked both producers to create a song similar to their 1985 \"Tender Love\", performed by R&B vocal group Force MDs. Though he wanted it to be his own unique record, which contains a small similarity, to which Jam and Lewis created \"Can U Help Me\".

About \"U Got It Bad\", Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that it makes use of the acoustic guitar and a \"slow-burning bassline\" throughout.

Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic gave a positive opinion on Usher's development, writing \"He looks good, his material is smooth and seductive, and he has a nice voice, even if he tends to favor melisma\".

Father Robert \"Bobby\" Carillo, their parish priest, tries to teach them right from wrong, but they still often play pranks and also start running small errands for a local gangster named King Benny. In the summer of 1967, the four boys steal a hot dog cart. They accidentally allow the cart to roll down a set of subway stairs, and it injures an elderly man. The boys are sentenced to the Wilkinson Home for Boys in Upstate New York. During their stay, the boys are physically and sexually abused by guards Sean Nokes, Henry Addison, Ralph Ferguson, and Adam Styler. While at the facility, they participate in Wilkinson's annual football game between the guards and inmates. Michael convinces Rizzo, a black inmate, to play as hard as they can to show the guards they can fight back. He agrees, and helps win the game. Humiliated, the guards inflict severe beatings on the boys, put them in solitary confinement for weeks, and beat Rizzo to death, telling his family he died of pneumonia. In the spring of 1968, shortly before Shakes' release from Wilkinson, he suggests they publicly report the abuse. The others refuse, with Michael asserting that no one would believe them, or care. They then decide never to speak of the abuse again. The night before Shakes is released, Nokes and the other guards arrange a \"farewell party\" in which the four boys are brutally abused. In 1981, John and Tommy \u2013 now career criminals \u2013 unexpectedly encounter Nokes in a Hell's Kitchen pub. They confront him, but he dismisses the abuse he put them through. John and Tommy shoot him dead in front of witnesses. Michael, who has become an assistant district attorney, gets himself assigned to the case; he secretly intends to botch the prosecution and expose what the guards at Wilkinson's did. Along with Shakes, now a reporter, they forge a plan to free John and Tommy and get revenge on the remaining abusers. With the help of others (including King Benny and their childhood friend Carol), they carry out their plan using information compiled by Michael on the backgrounds of the former Wilkinson guards. They also hire Danny Snyder, a washed-up, alcoholic lawyer, to defend John and Tommy. With the aid of scripted questions Michael secretly drafts in advance, Snyder casts significant doubt on the testimony of a woman who witnessed the murder in the pub. Two other witnesses are implied to have been intimidated into silence. For Michael's plan to fully succeed, however, he must damage Nokes' reputation and convincingly place John and Tommy at another location at the time of the shooting. Ferguson, when called as a witness for Nokes' character, admits that he, Nokes, and other guards abused boys. To clinch the case, however, they need a key witness who can give John and Tommy an alibi. Shakes has a long talk with Father Bobby, who resists at first, but after hearing of the horrific abuse they suffered, reluctantly agrees to perjure himself. At trial, Father Bobby testifies John and Tommy were with him at a New York Knicks game at the time of the shooting and has three ticket stubs to prove it. As a result, John and Tommy are acquitted. The remaining guards are also punished for their crimes: Addison, now a politician who still molests children, is killed by Little Caesar, a local drug kingpin and Rizzo's older brother; Styler, now a corrupt policeman, is imprisoned for taking bribes and murdering a drug dealer; and Ferguson, a social worker, loses his job and family as a result of his admission in court. Michael, Shakes, John, Tommy, and Carol meet at a local bar to celebrate. It is the last occasion when the four men are together. Shakes remains a reporter, living in Hell's Kitchen. Michael quits the DA's office, moves to the English countryside, becomes a carpenter and never marries. John drinks himself to death, and Tommy is murdered; neither of them live to see age 30. Carol also stays in Hell's Kitchen as a social worker; she has a son and names him John Thomas Michael Martinez, nicknamed Shakes. It is later revealed that John is the boy's biological father."

The explosion tore off most of the aircraft's vertical stabilizer and ruptured all four of the hydraulic systems, causing the loss of all flight control surfaces and rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. The pilots fought to keep the aircraft aloft for nearly 32 minutes, but eventually became trapped in the towering mountain ranges surrounding Mount Fuji and crashed, killing 520 out of the 524 passengers and crew on board. It remains the deadliest single-aircraft disaster in history. Some pressings of the album contain a recording of the last 30 seconds of the flight as an easter egg hidden in the pregap."

        "content": "The album \"revels in the type of paradoxical, multi-faceted existentialism which comes second nature to Germans but is persistently untranslatable to Americans\" and it opens with the track \"Reise, Reise\" which means \"journey, journey\" or \"rise, rise\", and \"we are immediately put on notice that this particular journey will be a grim and harrowing one, leavened by German existentialism in the grand tradition of Mann and Goethe.\" The references to Goethe come in \"Dalai Lama\", a modern version of Goethe's poem \"Der Erlk\u00f6nig\", set in an aeroplane rather than on a horse; the title is claimed to be a reference to the 14th Dalai Lama's fear of flying, while a more sound point of view is a reference to the serfdom in Tibet. The song \"Amerika\" deals with the worldwide political and cultural imperialism of the United States of America. The song's two verses are sung in German with a chorus in English: \"We're all living in Amerika, Amerika ist wunderbar, We're all living in Amerika, Amerika, Amerika.\" The band views it as a satirical commentary on \"Americanization\", and it features mentions of Coca-Cola, Mickey Mouse, and Santa Claus. The song \"Mein Teil\" is about Armin Meiwes, a man who achieved international notoriety for killing and eating a voluntary victim whom he had found via the Internet. After Meiwes and the victim jointly attempted to eat the victim's severed penis, Meiwes killed his victim and proceeded to eat a large amount of his flesh. Because of his acts, Meiwes is also known as the Rotenburg Cannibal or Der Metzgermeister (The Master Butcher). According to Rammstein's bassist Oliver Riedel, the song came about after \"one of our members brought a newspaper to rehearsal and it had a story about the cannibal guy in it. We were fascinated, shocked and amused at the same time.\" Vocalist Till Lindemann stated, \"It's so sick that it becomes fascinating and there just has to be a song about it\". \"Mein Teil\" attracted controversy in Germany; the media dubbed it the \"Kannibalensong\" (cannibal song), which helped to boost it to second place in the German music charts after its release in early August 2004. Remixes of the song were done by Arthur Baker and the Pet Shop Boys. At the beginning of the song in the video, the phrase \"Suche gut gebauten Achtzehn- bis Drei\u00dfigj\u00e4hrigen zum Schlachten \u2013 Der Metzgermeister\" (\"Looking for a well built 18 to 30-year-old to be slaughtered \u2013 The Master Butcher\") is spoken, voiced by Ollie, although the album version of the song does not have this beginning. The quote is taken from an online post by Armin Meiwes. \"Ohne dich\" (\"Without You\") is a power ballad. It is seen as expressing mourning over the loss of a loved person. It follows a slow, even romantic ballad style. The central motif is \"Without you, I cannot be..., With you, I am alone also...\" The song was also remixed by Slovenian avant-garde band Laibach. \"Los\" is a German suffix meaning \"-less\" (as in \"meaningless\"), but it is also an adjective meaning \"off\" or \"loose\", and when used as a command it means \"go!\". The track itself is reminiscent of Depeche Mode's early work, with repetitive acoustic guitar and a stripped-down, insistent beat. The album ends with the track \"Amour\", one of the most intimate love songs written by the band. In the context of a disc filled with the imagery of \"great black gaps in the fabric of human rationality\", Rammstein somehow manage to make \"honest and sincere romance seem just slightly alien, and tinted with enough melancholy to satisfy the heartiest emo-kid.\" There's also a guitar solo towards the end, another uncharacteristic gesture in the album."

On the European version the easter egg is in negative time, to access it, you must rewind the CD past the beginning of \"Reise, Reise\".

On 21 April 2005, Rammstein released a special Japanese version of Reise, Reise, with different cover art, which was later used as the Rosenrot cover art, though the Rammstein logo on the ship was altered into the text \"Rosenrot\". The booklet also features the same art as Rosenrot, but with the songs from Reise, Reise. The easter egg is not present in negative time as it is on the European version. It features two bonus tracks: \"Mein Teil (You Are What You Eat Edit)\" and \"Amerika (Digital Hardcore Mix)\". The Japanese Limited Edition has a bonus DVD featuring footage from Lichtspielhaus. The Japanese Limited Edition was re-issued in 2009 as SHM-CD and DVD edition, featuring the original orange cover art. The album artwork shows a damaged aeroplane cockpit voice recorder depicted on the front and back covers. Its caption (\"Flugrekorder, nicht \u00f6ffnen\") means \"Flight Recorder, Do Not Open\". The inner part of the Digipak edition case shows a picture of the six members in suits wielding suitcases and weapons (like Michael Douglas in Falling Down) leaving from a crashed aeroplane. The cover art is an allusion to the song \"Dalai Lama\", which deals with an aeroplane accident. It is also suggestive of the overarching \"travelling\" theme of the album. While past albums have all featured the six band members in various photographic scenarios, \"Reise Reise\" features a minimal packaging, and there are no photographs featuring the band's members."

David Jeffries from Allmusic gave the album a rating of three out of five stars, and stated that the album's content \"is more of the same: the same grit, the same growl, and the same dramatic, orchestra choruses\" and that \"the lead single, 'Mein Teil' is no 'Du Hast' but the damning 'Amerika' almost equals their breakthrough track.\" He also said that there was a bit more ingenuity in the production and a little more focus in the songs but it wasn't \"enough for the nonfaithful to pick up on.\" Jeffries highlighted the track \"Stein Um Stein\" because it \"creeps more than stomps in parts\". He also mentioned that the track \"Los\" features a bluesy guitar that \"adds some quirk to the band's stern Teutonic pallette.\" He finished his review saying \"few bands can industrially grind as convincingly as Rammstein. Same as it ever was, \"Reise, Reise\" won't do much to increase the band's fan base, but being a tight, free-of-filler album, it'll satisfy the faithful.\" Vaz Malik from the BBC also gave the album a mixed review and said that the band could probably be \"a lot bigger\" in the United States if they opted to sing in English, but \"German sounds a lot more threatening and it's done them no harm in their homeland.\" He stated that the songs \"Morgenstern\" and \"Stein Um Stein\" probably have weak translations but in German they sound mean. He said \"that tracks like 'Amerika' make the admission price worth while. Rammstein say it's their most commercial song to date. Well more like this please because it's funny but rocks at the same time.\" Tim O'Neil from PopMatters gave the album a favorable review and said: \"for those with the patience to look beyond the \"Teutonic bluster\" and punk insouciance, \"Reise Reise\" will be a uniquely rewarding experience.\""

Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said if the record's first side \"makes it seem that reggae has turned into the rasta word for boogie\u2014even to a Trenchtown tragedy recited with all the toughness of an imprecation against litter\u2014the unimpassioned sweetness of most of side two sounds like a function of reflective distance, assured in its hard-won calm.

Marley was involved in a contractual dispute at the time with his former publishing company, Cayman music.

Vincent Ford, a childhood friend from Jamaica, is credited as the songwriter for \"No Woman, No Cry\" on the 1974 album Natty Dread, as well as the songs \"Crazy Baldheads\" (with Marley's wife Rita), \"Positive Vibration\" and \"Roots Rock Reggae\" from Rastaman Vibration, along with \"Inna De Red\" and \"Jah Bless\" with Marley's son, Stephen. Marley's widow and his former manager Danny Sims sued to obtain royalty and ownership rights to the songs, claiming that Marley had actually written the songs but had assigned the credit to Ford to avoid meeting commitments made in prior contracts. A 1987 court decision favored the Marley estate, which assumed full control of the songs."

        "content": "Band on the Run is the third studio album by the British\u2013American rock band Paul McCartney and Wings, released in December 1973. It was McCartney's fifth album after leaving the Beatles in April 1970. Although sales were modest initially, its commercial performance was aided by two hit singles \u2013 \"Jet\" and \"Band on the Run\" \u2013 such that it became the top-selling studio album of 1974 in the United Kingdom and Australia, in addition to revitalising McCartney's critical standing. It remains McCartney's most successful album and the most celebrated of his post-Beatles works. The album was mostly recorded at EMI's studio in Lagos, Nigeria, as McCartney wanted to make an album in an exotic location. Shortly before departing for Lagos, drummer Denny Seiwell and guitarist Henry McCullough left the group. With no time to recruit replacements, McCartney went into the studio with just his wife Linda and Denny Laine. McCartney therefore played bass, drums, percussion and most of the lead guitar parts. The studio was of poor quality and conditions in Nigeria were tense and difficult; the McCartneys were robbed at knifepoint, losing a bag of song lyrics and demo tapes. After the band's return to England, final overdubs and further recording were carried out in London, mostly at AIR Studios. In 2000, Q magazine placed Band on the Run at number 75 in its list of the \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever\". In 2012, it was listed at 418 on Rolling Stones revised list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". A contemporary review by Jon Landau in Rolling Stone described the album as being \"with the possible exception of John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band, the finest record yet released by any of the four musicians who were once called the Beatles\". It was McCartney's last album issued on the Apple record label. In 2013, Band on the Run was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame."

        "content": "By 1973, three years after the break-up of the Beatles, Paul McCartney had yet to regain his artistic credibility or find favour with music critics for his post-Beatles work. After completing a successful UK tour with his band Wings, in July 1973, he planned their third album as a means to re-establish himself after the mixed reception given to Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway. Keen to record outside the United Kingdom, McCartney asked EMI to send him a list of all their international recording studios. He selected Lagos in Nigeria and was attracted to the idea of recording in Africa. In August, the band \u2013 consisting of McCartney and his wife Linda, ex-Moody Blues guitarist and pianist Denny Laine, Henry McCullough on lead guitar, and Denny Seiwell on drums \u2013 started rehearsals for the new album at the McCartneys' Scottish farm. During one rehearsal session, McCullough and McCartney argued, and McCullough quit. Seiwell left a week later, the night before the band flew out to Nigeria. This left just McCartney, Linda and Laine to record in Lagos, assisted by former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick. McCartney had chosen Lagos, as he felt it would be a glamorous location where he and the band could sun on the beach during the day and record at night; the reality, however, was that after the end of a civil war in 1970, Nigeria was run by a military government, with corruption and disease commonplace."

        "content": "The band and their entourage arrived in Lagos on 9 August 1973. EMI's studio, located on Wharf Road in the suburb of Apapa, was ramshackle and under-equipped. The control desk was faulty and there was only one tape machine, a Studer 8-track. The band rented houses near the airport in Ikeja, an hour away from the studio. McCartney, Linda and their three children stayed in one, while Laine, his wife JoJo, Emerick, and Wings' two roadies stayed in another. The group established a routine of recording during the week and playing tourist on the weekends. McCartney temporarily joined a local country club, where he would spend most mornings. The band would be driven to the studio in the early afternoon where recording would last into the late evening and sometimes early morning. To make up for the departed band members, McCartney would play drums and lead guitar parts, in addition to his contributions on bass guitar, with Laine playing rhythm guitar and Linda adding keyboards. The first track they recorded at Apapa was \"Mamunia\", the title for which McCartney appropriated from the name of a hotel in Marrakesh where Wings had stayed in April 1973. Several of the songs on Band on the Run reflect themes of escape and freedom, while the structure of the album recalled the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road. The song \"Band on the Run\" was partly inspired by a remark George Harrison had made during one of the many business meetings the Beatles attended in 1969, in an effort to address the problems afflicting their Apple Corps enterprise. Four years later, the album's creation coincided with what author Peter Doggett terms McCartney's \"moral victory in the debate over Allen Klein\", as Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr now became embroiled in litigation against Klein \u2013 the business manager they had appointed to run Apple in 1969, despite strong opposition from McCartney. Doggett writes that McCartney was perhaps liberated creatively by this recent development, resulting in Band on the Run bearing \"a frothy self-confidence that was reminiscent of the Beatles at their most productive\". Aside from the challenges presented by the substandard studio, various incidents plagued Wings' Lagos stay. While out walking one night against advice, McCartney and Linda were robbed at knifepoint. The assailants made away with all of their valuables and even stole a bag containing a notebook full of handwritten lyrics and songs, and cassettes containing demos for songs to be recorded. On another occasion, McCartney was overdubbing a vocal track when he began gasping for air.  According to Emerick: \"Within seconds, [McCartney] turned as white as a sheet, explaining to us in a croaking voice that he couldn't catch his breath. We decided to take him outside for some fresh air\u00a0... [but] once he was exposed to the blazing heat he felt even worse and began keeling over, finally fainting dead away at our feet.  Linda began screaming hysterically; she was convinced that he was having a heart attack\u00a0... The official diagnosis was that he had suffered a bronchial spasm brought on by too much smoking.\" Another incident was the confrontation with local Afrobeat pioneer and political activist Fela Kuti, who publicly accused the band of being in Africa to exploit and steal African music after their visit to his club. Kuti went to the studio to confront McCartney, who played their songs for him to show that they contained no local influence. Later on, drummer and former Cream member Ginger Baker invited Wings to record their entire album at his ARC Studio in Ikeja. McCartney agreed to go there for one day. The song \"Picasso's Last Words (Drink to Me)\" was recorded at ARC, with Baker contributing a percussive tin of gravel. Recording for the majority of the album's basic tracks, together with initial overdubbing, was completed after six weeks in Nigeria. After hosting a beach barbecue to celebrate the end of recording, Wings flew back to England on 23 September 1973 where they were met by fans and journalists. Upon returning to London, the McCartneys received a letter from EMI dated before the band had left England warning them to not go to Lagos due to an outbreak of cholera. In October, two weeks after the band's return to London, work began at George Martin's AIR Studios on transferring many of the eight-track recordings to sixteen-track. \"Jet\", named after one of the McCartneys' Labrador puppies, was recorded in its entirety at AIR.Madinger and Easter, p. 188. McCartney, Laine and Linda carried out further overdubs on the Lagos recordings during this period; all the orchestral arrangements for the album were taped at AIR in a single day, conducted by Tony Visconti. Visconti was given three days to write the arrangements, including the 60-piece orchestra for the title track. Visconti said that the arrangements were collaborations with McCartney, and was surprised he was not correctly credited for his work until the 25th anniversary reissue. Another contributor was saxophonist Howie Casey, who overdubbed solos on \"Bluebird\", \"Mrs. Vanderbilt\" and \"Jet\", and would go on to become Wings' regular horn player. Final mixing on the album was completed over three days at London's Kingsway Studios in early November. \"Helen Wheels\" was released as a non-album single in late October, and became a top 10 hit in America the following January. For commercial reasons, Capitol Records, the US distributor for Apple Records, asked to include \"Helen Wheels\" on the album. McCartney agreed, although it was never his intention to include the track. While \"Helen Wheels\" is not included on UK versions of the Band on the Run CD (except as a bonus cut on the 1993 \"The Paul McCartney Collection\" edition of the CD), it has always appeared on US editions of the CD starting with the initial Columbia Records release in 1984. Early versions of the Capitol release fail to list \"Helen Wheels\" on the label or the CD insert, making the song a \"hidden track\"."

They are Michael Parkinson, Kenny Lynch, James Coburn, Clement Freud, Christopher Lee and John Conteh. Arrowsmith detailed that the eventual cover was one of the four he found acceptable in the 24 attempts he took. The spotlight's low potency meant everyone had to stand still for two seconds for proper exposure, which was made difficult by the photographer and subjects reportedly being in a \"substance haze\" following a party held by McCartney, making it harder for them to hold the pose. The golden hue of the picture is due to Arrowsmith using a regular daytime film instead of a Tungsten film, which would be better suited for night-time photographs."

Rather than having the band promote the album on radio and television or with a tour, McCartney undertook a series of magazine interviews, most notably with Paul Gambaccini for Rolling Stone. The conversations with Gambaccini took place at various locations from September 1973 onwards and combined to form, in the words of authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, \"a remarkably forthcoming interview in comparison to the 'thumbs-aloft' profiles usually allowed by [McCartney]\"."

        "content": "Upon release, Band on the Run received mostly favourable reviews. Author Robert Rodriguez writes that, after the disappointment of McCartney's previous work since the Beatles, \"It was exactly the record fans and critics had long hoped he would make \u2026\" In a combined review for Starr's concurrently released Ringo album, Charles Shaar Murray of the NME wrote: \"The ex-Beatle least likely to re-establish his credibility and lead the field has pulled it off with a positive master-stroke of an album entitled Band On The Run.\" In addition to praising McCartney for using synthesizer \"like an instrument, and not like an electric whoopee cushion\", Shaar Murray concluded: \"Band On The Run is a great album. If anybody ever puts down McCartney in your presence, bust him in the snoot and play him this. He will thank you for it afterwards.\" Writing in The New York Times, Loraine Alterman considered the album to be \"bursting with a great deal of compelling music even if the lyrics at times make as much sense as that cover photo\" and admired the \"fascinating range of sounds\" offered in the title track, as well as the \"lovely, romantic aura\" of \"Bluebird\". While noting the importance of studio production on the overall effect, Alterman wrote: \"McCartney has managed to make the complexities of multi-track recording sound as natural and fresh as tomorrow.\" Jon Landau of Rolling Stone described the album as \"with the possible exception of John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band, the finest record yet released by any of the four musicians who were once called the Beatles\". Rolling Stone named Band on the Run one of the Best Albums of the Year for 1973. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote in 1981: \"I originally underrated what many consider McCartney's definitive post-Beatles statement, but not as much as its admirers overrate it. Pop masterpiece? This? Sure it's a relief after the vagaries of Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway.\" He praised the title track and the \"Afro-soul\" introduction to \"Mamunia\", calling them \"the high points\". Christgau ultimately awarded the album a C+ rating, indicating \"a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork\". In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine feels that while some songs are excellent and the album overall is enjoyable, it is more showmanship than content. The Rolling Stone reviewer of the 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition said that \"the real action still lies in the original LP's revved-up pleasures\". Writing for Mojo magazine in 2011, John Harris included Band on the Run among \"the trilogy of truly essential post-Beatles solo albums\", along with Harrison's All Things Must Pass and Lennon's Plastic Ono Band. In 2000, Q magazine placed Band on the Run at number 75 in its list of the \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever\". In 2012, it was voted 418th on Rolling Stones revised list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die."

        "content": "The commercial reception was unspectacular initially, with the record-buying public wary after Wings' preceding releases.Spizer, p. 179. On the UK Albums Chart, Band on the Run climbed to number 9 on 22 December, remaining there for a second week before dropping to number 13. On America's Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, it peaked at number 7 on 2 February 1974 and then spent the next six weeks in the lower reaches of the top ten. The album went on to achieve considerable success, however, thanks to the popularity of the two singles culled from it \u2013 \"Jet\" and the title track. Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden described Band on the Run as the first Beatles-related release to be \"planned with a marketing strategy\", as Capitol Records now assumed a fully active role in promoting the album following the removal of Klein's ABKCO Industries as managers of Apple. Although McCartney had been reluctant to issue album tracks as singles, the public's apparent lack of interest in Band on the Run led to him ceding to the recommendations of Capitol's head of marketing, Al Coury, who had similarly pushed for the inclusion of \"Helen Wheels\". McCartney therefore authorised single edits for the two new A-sides. \"Jet\" was issued on 28 January in America, with \"Mamunia\" as the B-side for the single's initial pressings, although this was soon replaced by \"Let Me Roll It\", which was the B-side for the UK release, on 15 February. The single's success provided new impetus for the album,Spizer, p. 180. which hit number 2 in the UK at the end of March and topped Billboards listings on 13 April. Apple issued \"Band on the Run\" on 8 April in America, backed by \"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five\"; the UK release followed on 28 June, with the non-album instrumental \"Zoo Gang\" as the B-side. Due to the popularity of \"Band on the Run\", the album returned to number 1 on Billboard on 8 June, when the single simultaneously topped the Hot 100. In Britain, the album finally hit number 1 on 27 July, for the first of seven consecutive weeks at the top. On the alternative UK listings compiled by Melody Maker, Band on the Run remained in the top ten from 26 January through to 23 November 1974. During that time, its chart performance similarly reflected the popularity of the two singles, with the album spending three weeks at number 2 in April, and six weeks at number 1 throughout August and the first week of September. The album topped the Billboard chart on three separate occasions during 1974, and was the top selling album of that year in Australia and Canada. In Britain, it came second in the year-end standings, behind the compilation The Singles: 1969\u20131973 by the Carpenters. Through this success with Wings, McCartney established himself as the most commercially successful of the four former Beatles. Rodriguez views the album's arrival at number 1 on Billboard, in April 1974, as the moment when McCartney usurped George Harrison as the \"ex-Beatle Most Likely to Succeed\", so beginning a period of public acclaim that reached its zenith with the Wings Over America Tour in 1976. Band on the Run was eventually certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America; it would go on to sell 6 million copies worldwide and become EMI's top selling album of the 1970s in the UK. Its continued success through 1974 was also beneficial in allowing Wings to recruit a new guitarist and drummer, and to integrate them into the band before beginning new recordings."

        "content": "Napoleon Dynamite is a 2004 American comedy film produced by Jeremy Coon, Chris Wyatt and Sean Covel, written by Jared and Jerusha Hess and directed by Jared Hess. The film stars Jon Heder in the role of the titular character, a nerdy high-school student who deals with several dilemmas: befriending an immigrant who wants to be class president, awkwardly pursuing a romance with a fellow student, and living with his quirky family. The film was Hess' first full-length movie and is partially adapted from his earlier short film, Peluca. Napoleon Dynamite was acquired at the Sundance Film Festival by Fox Searchlight Pictures, who partnered up with MTV Films and Paramount Pictures for the release. Filming was done at Preston High School, and in different areas in Franklin County, Idaho, in the summer of 2003. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. Most of the situations in the movie are loosely based on the life of Jared Hess. The film's total worldwide gross revenue was $46,122,713. The film has since developed a cult following and was voted at number 14 on Bravo's 100 funniest movies."

        "content": "Napoleon Dynamite (Heder) is a socially awkward 16-year-old from Preston, Idaho, who lives with his grandmother, Carlinda Dynamite, and his older brother, Kipland Ronald \"Kip\" Dynamite. Napoleon daydreams his way through school, reluctantly dealing with various bullies who torment him. Napoleon's grandmother is injured in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious former athlete who lives in a campervan, treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a get-rich-quick scheme by selling items door-to-door. Kip wants money to pay for his internet girlfriend, LaFawnduh, to travel from Detroit to see him while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and the recent breakup with his girlfriend. Napoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from Juarez, Mexico. Preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who gladly accepts. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks a popular classmate, Trisha, from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws an unintentionally bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is one of Rico's customers. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from Trisha's mother, who buys his wares and forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's invitation. Trisha appears at the dance with Napoleon but soon abandons him, causing Deb to dance with Napoleon. Pedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer. The factions of the two candidates put up flyers and hand out trinkets to students to attract voters. To increase their respect by demonstrating \"skills\", Napoleon and Pedro enter a Future Farmers of America competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits a thrift store and buys an instructional dance VHS called D-Qwon's Dance Grooves, becoming a skillful dancer. Kip's girlfriend, LaFawnduh, arrives from Detroit and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in hip-hop regalia. Seeing that he dances, LaFawnduh gives Napoleon a mixtape. Rico's ongoing sales scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about him to prospective customers. Rico tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends after his sales pitch to the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, goes awry: Rex assaults Rico after unexpectedly arriving during his demonstration of the breast-enhancement product. Summer gives a speech before the student body on election day, and then presents a dance skit to \"Larger than Life\" by the Backstreet Boys with a school club. A despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. To save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's mixtape and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to \"Canned Heat\" by Jamiroquai. Napoleon's routine receives a standing ovation from students, stunning Summer, and her boyfriend, Don. Pedro becomes the class president, Kip, and LaFawnduh leave on a bus for Michigan, Rico reunites with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returns from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb reconcile and play tetherball."

Peluca was shown at the 2003 Slamdance Film Festival and was well received. Jeremy Coon convinced Hess to drop out of school and adapt it into a feature-length film, and he helped him to find investors for the project. Hess sent the short film and the script to a variety of different casting directors, many of whom thought that the idea was \"too weird or they just didn't like the character,\" Hess explained. One casting director suggested Jake Gyllenhaal over unknown actor Jon Heder for the lead role but Hess believed Heder was the only actor to play the part. Jason Lee was offered the role of Uncle Rico while Brad Garrett auditioned for Rex and enjoyed the script, but decided not to commit. Heder was paid $1,000 for starring in the film, but successfully negotiated to receive more after the film became a runaway success."

        "content": "Hess shot the film on location in Preston, in southeastern Idaho, located near the Utah border, in July 2003. Operating on a tight budget of $400,000, Hess cast many of his friends from school, including Heder and Aaron Ruell, and he relied on the generosity of Preston locals, who provided housing and food to crew members. Among the established actors in the cast was comedy veteran Diedrich Bader, who filmed his scenes as virile martial art instructor Rex in one day. He recalled in 2011 that Napoleon Dynamite \"still to this day [is] one of the two top scripts I've ever read\", alongside Office Space (1999), one of his most-recognized roles. \"It was very, very hot,\" Hess recalled in a Rolling Stone interview. \"But it was so much fun being in this rural farm town making a movie. We shot it in 23 days, so we were moving very, very fast; I just didn't have a lot of film to be able to do a lot of takes. It was a bunch of friends getting together to make a movie. It was like, 'Are people going to get this? Is it working?'\" Hess describes the film as being \"so autobiographical\". \"I grew up in a family of six boys in Preston, Idaho, and the character of Napoleon was a hybrid of all the most nerdy and awkward parts of me and my brothers growing up. Jerusha really was like Deb growing up. Her mom made her a dress when she was going to a middle school dance and she said, 'I hadn't really developed yet, so my mom overcompensated and made some very large, fluffy shoulders.' Some guy dancing with her patted the sleeves and actually said, 'I like your sleeves ... they're real big,\"' Hess said in an interview with Rolling Stone. The film is set during the 2004\u20132005 school year, as shown on Napoleon's student ID card in the title sequence. The film contains several anachronisms indicating that it would be more appropriately set in the 1980s or 1990s. For example, Deb wears a side ponytail and Napoleon wears Moon Boots, both popular fashion trends of the 1980s. One scene is set at a school dance that plays only 1980s music such as Alphaville's \"Forever Young,\" whereas an earlier scene features students performing a sign language rendition of \"The Rose\" (1980) sung by Bette Midler. Much of the technology in the film is also archaic; Napoleon uses a VCR and Walkman cassette player, Kip connects to the Internet via a pay-per-minute dial-up connection and Uncle Rico drives a 1975 Dodge Tradesman. The song Napoleon Dynamite dances to at the end of the film\u2014\"Canned Heat\" by Jamiroquai\u2014came out in 1999."

The sequence shows a pair of hands placing and removing several objects on a table.

I've seen you boogie; it's pretty sweet,'\" recalled Heder. \"And I was like, 'Well, I like to dabble.' I liked to mess around sometimes in front of friends and dance. But I did take pride in it. I won't be modest. I wasn't great but I did like to mess around ... Cut to two years later: after we had shot the short, they were like, 'Okay we're going to have you dancing in the movie as the climax. This is going to make or break the film.'\" When it came to shooting the dance scene for the final film, the producers scheduled to film it towards the end of the film. When they finally got to the scene, they were running out of money and film. They only had one roll of film (approximately 10.5 minutes) left to shoot. \"It was a lot of pressure,\" Heder observed. \"I was like, 'Oh, crap!' This isn't just a silly little scene. This is the moment where everything comes, and he's making the sacrifice for his friend. That's the whole theme of the movie. Everything leads up to this. Napoleon's been this loser. This has to be the moment where he lands a victory. He gets up there, and it's quiet: no reaction from the audience.\" The dance was spontaneously improvised by Heder, with some choreography help from Tina Majorino, and additional moves taken from Saturday Night Fever, Michael Jackson, and Soul Train. \"They were like, 'No, Jon, just figure it out.' So I just winged it. I danced three times and they took the best pieces from each of those.\" \"When you're shooting in independent film, you don't know what you're going to get the rights to,\" Heder explained. \"We thought Jamiroquai might be expensive. So we danced to three different songs. To that song and another Jamiroquai song, \"Little L.\" We danced to Michael Jackson, something off of Off the Wall. Just those three. And then we got the rights to Jamiroquai. And I think that was half our budget.\""

Filmmaker Jared Hess states that he was not aware of Costello's use of the name until two days before the end of shooting, when he was informed by a teenage extra. He later said, \"Had I known that name was used by anybody else prior to shooting the whole film, it definitely would have been changed\u00a0... I listen to hip-hop, dude. It's a pretty embarrassing coincidence.\" Hess claims that \"Napoleon Dynamite\" was the name of a man he met around 2000 on the streets of Cicero, Illinois, while doing missionary work for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Costello believes that Hess got the name from him, whether directly or indirectly. Costello said, \"The guy just denies completely that I made the name up\u00a0... but I invented it.

Napoleon Pictures also alleged that Fox had breached the agreement in multiple other respects, including underreporting pay television license fees, failing to report electronic sell-through revenue, charging residuals on home video sales, as well as overcharging residuals on home video sales, deducting a number of costs and charges Fox had no right to deduct and/or for which there is no supporting documentation. In May 2012, Fox went to trial after failing to win a summary judgment on the case. The trial began on June 19, 2012. On November 28, 2012, a 74-page decision sided with Fox on 9 of the 11 issues.

The site's consensus reads, \"A charming, quirky, and often funny comedy.\" On Metacritic it has a score of 64% based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine complimented the film, saying, \"Hess and his terrific cast \u2013 Heder is geek perfection \u2013 make their own kind of deadpan hilarity. You'll laugh till it hurts. Sweet.\" The Christian Science Monitor called the film \"a refreshing new take on the overused teen-comedy genre\" and said that the film \"may not make you laugh out loud \u2013 it's too sly and subtle for that \u2013 but it will have you smiling every minute, and often grinning widely at its weirded-out charm.\" Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice praised the film as \"an epic, magisterially observed pastiche on all-American geekhood, flooring the competition with a petulant shove.\" In a mixed review, The New York Times praised Heder's performance and the \"film's most interesting quality, which is its stubborn, confident, altogether weird individuality\", while criticizing the film's resolution that comes \"too easily.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one-and-a-half stars, writing that he felt that \"the movie makes no attempt to make [Napoleon] likable\" and that it contained \"a kind of studied stupidity that sometimes passes as humor\". At the time, Entertainment Weekly critics gave it a grade C and C- respectively. Entertainment Weekly later ranked Napoleon #88 on its 2010 list of The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years, saying, \"A high school misfit found a sweet spot, tapping into our inner dork.\" The film was on several year-end lists.

Dio, who had read Sir Walter Scott, Arthurian tales, and science fiction growing up, had previously used fantasy lyrics in his early 1970s band Elf.

Holy Diver remains the undisputed highlight of Dio's career...and, indeed, one of the finest pure heavy metal albums of the 1980s.\" Canadian reviewer Martin Popoff describes the album as \"quintessential traditional metal\", with Ronnie James Dio \"almost single-handedly reinventing gothic hard rock for the '80s, incorporating strong melodic hooks and more than the genre's usual share of velvety, classical-based pyrotechnics.\" Kerrang! gave the album a positive review in 1983 and Holy Diver ended up at no. 5 in the British magazine's End of Year list of best releases. Today, Kerrang! still considers it a \"perfect melodic metal album\" and an \"essential purchase\". The rock historian Ian Christe relates that for the post-Sabbath solo career \"Dio simplified his stories substantially for a younger heavy metal audience. The 1983 debut Holy Diver, by his band Dio, reduced lush moral landscapes to simple good-versus-evil conflicts, using the lyrical duality of 'Rainbow in the Dark' and 'Holy Diver' to raise questions about deceit and hypocrisy in romance and religion. In the sharp contrasts of Dio's imagery, there was always a built-in contradiction that fed adolescent revolt: a black side to every white light, and a hidden secret behind every loud proclamation of truth. In a similar way, Dio's music balanced torrents of rage with brief acoustic interludes.\" On IGN's list of \"Top 25 Metal Albums\", Holy Diver is at number 8, and this statement followed, \"In all his bands, in all his roles, in all his musical vagabond choices, Ronnie James Dio has been fortunate enough to be associated with some of heavy metal's best -- Sabbath, Rainbow, and his own band Dio. To best represent his tenure in the genre, one must look no farther than Holy Diver. His first album with his new band was also his best. It is one of metal's best albums, and it spawned two of the greatest metal songs of the '80s: 'Holy Diver' and 'Rainbow in the Dark'. Featuring the underrated Vivian Campbell on guitar, this album showed that Dio could do it on his own.\" In 2017, it was ranked 16th on Rolling Stone list of \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\"."

        "content": "\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\"). It was written by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist. Harrison wrote \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" as an exercise in randomness inspired by the Chinese I Ching. The song conveys his dismay at the world's unrealised potential for universal love, which he refers to as \"the love there that's sleeping\". The song also serves as a comment on the disharmony within the Beatles following their return from studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968. This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band's initial apathy towards the composition, which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator, Eric Clapton, to contribute to the recording. Clapton overdubbed a lead guitar part, although he was not formally credited for his contribution. Harrison first recorded it with a sparse backing of acoustic guitar and harmonium \u2013 a version that appeared on the 1996 Anthology 3 outtakes compilation and, with the addition of a string arrangement by George Martin, on the Love soundtrack album in 2006. The full group recording was made in September 1968, at which point the song's folk-based musical arrangement was replaced by a production in the heavy rock style. The recording was one of several collaborations between Harrison and Clapton during the late 1960s and was followed by the pair co-writing the song \"Badge\" for Clapton's group Cream. On release, the song received praise from several music critics, and it has since been recognised as an example of Harrison's maturing as a songwriter beside his Beatles bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Rolling Stone ranked \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" 136th on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", seventh on the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\", and at number 10 on its list of \"The Beatles 100 Greatest Songs\". Clapton's performance was ranked 42nd in Guitar Worlds 2008 list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\". Harrison and Clapton often performed the song together live, during which they shared the lead guitar role over the closing section. Live versions featuring the pair were included on the Concert for Bangladesh album in 1971 and Live in Japan in 1992. Backed by a band that included McCartney and Ringo Starr, Clapton performed the song at the Concert for George in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death."

        "content": "George Harrison wrote \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" after his return from India, where the Beatles had been studying Transcendental Meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi during the spring of 1968. The visit had allowed Harrison to re-engage with the guitar as his primary instrument, after focusing on the Indian sitar for the previous two years, and also marked the start of a prolific period for him as a songwriter. Inspiration for the song came to him when he was visiting his parents in Warrington, Cheshire, and he began reading the I Ching, or \"The Book of Changes\". As Harrison put it, \"[the book] seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else, as opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental.\" Embracing this idea of relativism, he committed to writing a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a book, which happened to be \"gently weeps\". Harrison continued to work on the lyrics after this initial writing session. The song reflects the disharmonious atmosphere within the Beatles following their return from India. Harrison had led the band in their highly publicised endorsement of Transcendental Meditation and viewed this spiritual pursuit as superior in importance to their career momentum. When discussing another song he wrote at this time, \"Not Guilty\", Harrison said it referred to \"the grief I was catching\" from John Lennon and Paul McCartney for leading them to Rishikesh  and supposedly hindering the group's career and the launch of their Apple record label. Eric Clapton, with whom Harrison collaborated on several recordings throughout 1968 as a distraction from the Beatles, said that \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" conveyed Harrison's spiritual isolation within the group. Author Jonathan Gould writes that, although in the past each of the Beatles had become temporarily subsumed in fads and personal interests, the level of Harrison's commitment to Indian spirituality as an alternative to the band was unprecedented. A demo that Harrison recorded at his home in Esher includes an unused verse: \"I look at the trouble and hate that is raging / While my guitar gently weeps / As I'm sitting here, doing nothing but ageing \u2026\" This version also includes the line \"The problems you sow are the troubles you're reaping\", which he similarly discarded. An early acoustic guitar and harmonium performance of the song features a slightly different third verse: \"I look from the wings at the play you are staging / While my guitar gently weeps / As I'm sitting here, doing nothing but ageing \u2026\" This version was released on the 1996 compilation Anthology 3 and was used as the basis of the 2006 Love remix, with a string arrangement by George Martin."

        "content": "\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was one of the few Beatles compositions from early 1968 that changed markedly from demo form to the official recording. Harrison's demos suggest the influence of folk music, yet the Beatles' version is in the heavy rock style typical of much of the band's late 1960s work. While noting the importance of Harrison's return to the guitar during this period, Gould describes the song as \"virtually a declaration of his recommitment to rock\". The song as originally issued by the Beatles is in the key of A minor, changing to A major over the bridges. Aside from the intro, the composition is structured into two rounds of verse and bridge, with an instrumental passage extending the second of these verse sections, followed by a final verse and a long instrumental passage that fades out on the released recording. All the sections consist of an even sixteen bars or measures, which are divided into four phrases. The chord progression over the verses includes a descending bass of A\u2013G\u2013F\u2013F (8\u20137\u20136\u20136) over an A-minor chord, leading to F-major on the F bass note. According to musicologist Dominic Pedler, the 8\u20137\u20136\u20136 progression represents a hybrid of the Aeolian and Dorian modes. The change to the parallel major key is heralded by a C chord as the verse's penultimate chord (replacing the D used in the second phrase of each verse) before the E that leads into the bridge. Musicologist Alan Pollack views this combination of C and E as representing a sense of \"arrival\", after which the bridge contains \"upward [harmonic] gestures\" that contrast with the bass descents that dominate the verse. Such contrasts are limited by the inclusion of minor triads (III, VI and II) played over the E chord that ends the bridge's second and fourth phrases."

        "content": "In his lyrics to \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", Harrison revisits the theme of universal love and the philosophical concerns that were evident in his overtly Indian-influenced compositions, particularly \"Within You Without You\". The song is a lament for how a universal love for humankind is latent in all individuals yet remains unrealised. In the description of theologian Dale Allison, the song \"conveys spiritual angst and an urgent religious point of view without being explicitly theological\". Harrison sings of surveying \"you all\" and seeing \"the love there that's sleeping\". Musicologist Walter Everett comments that the change from the minor-mode verse to the parallel major might express hope that \"unrealized potential\" described in the lyrics is to be \"fulfilled\", but the continued minor triads \"seem to express a strong dismay that love is not to be unfolded\". During the bridges, Harrison adopts a repetitive rhyming scheme in the style of Bob Dylan to convey how humankind has become distracted from its ability to manifest this love. He sings of people that have been \"inverted\" and \"perverted\" from their natural perspective. \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" follows in a lyrical tradition established by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Bo Diddley, whereby emotions and actions are attributed to a musical instrument. According to an NME reviewer, writing in 1998, the song conveys \"serious concern\" for the Beatles' \"dwindling esprit de corps\". Harrison biographer Joshua Greene says that its message reflects the pessimism encouraged by world events throughout 1968, such as the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy in the United States, and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Allison writes that the lyrics represent the \"antithesis of spiritual triumphalism\", in which Harrison \"mourns because love has not conquered all\"."

        "content": "The Beatles recorded \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" several times during the sessions for their self-titled double album, also known as \"the White Album\". The recording sessions, which began in late May 1968, were characterised by a lack of cooperation among the four band members, and by what Lennon's bandmates regarded as the overly intrusive presence of his new romantic partner, Yoko Ono. In this atmosphere, Harrison had initially been reluctant to present his new compositions to the group. Take 1 on 25 July \u2013 the version later issued on Anthology 3 \u2013 was a solo performance by Harrison, playing his Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar, with an overdubbed harmonium part. Sessions on 16 August and 5 September produced full band recordings of the song. In the case of the 16 August version, an overdubbing session on 3 September marked the first time that the Beatles had used eight-track recording at EMI Studios. According to Ken Scott, the band's recording engineer, Harrison saw the eight-track recorder in a corridor and, defying EMI regulations that new equipment should be thoroughly tested, insisted that they use it immediately. At the same session, Harrison overdubbed a backwards (or \"backmasked\") guitar solo, as he had done two years before on \"I'm Only Sleeping\", on the Revolver album, but he was not satisfied with the results. The Beatles then remade the basic track on 5 September \u2013 a session that marked Ringo Starr's return to the group after he had walked out on 22 August, upset at the unpleasant atmosphere. While Harrison led the band in welcoming back their drummer, by installing a large flower display all over Starr's drum kit, he continued to think that his bandmates were not giving their best to the song."

Clapton, who recognised Harrison's talent as a songwriter, and considered that his abilities had long been held back by Lennon and McCartney, was nevertheless reluctant to participate; he later recalled that his initial response was: \"I can't do that. Nobody ever plays on Beatles records.\" Harrison convinced him, and Clapton's lead guitar part, played on Harrison's Gibson Les Paul electric guitar \"Lucy\" (a recent gift from Clapton), was overdubbed that evening. Recalling the session in his 2007 autobiography, Clapton says that, while Lennon and McCartney were \"fairly non-committal\", he thought the track \"sounded fantastic\", adding: \"I knew George was happy, because he listened to it over and over in the control room.\" Harrison recalled that Clapton's presence also ensured that his bandmates \"tr[ied] a bit harder\" and \"were all on their best behaviour\". The Beatles carried out the remaining overdubs, which included an ascending piano motif, played by McCartney, over the introduction, Hammond organ by Harrison, and further percussion by Starr. McCartney also added a second bass part, played on his Fender Jazz Bass rather than on either of his usual H\u00f6fner or Rickenbacker models."

        "content": "Still wary that his contribution might present too much of a departure from the band's sound, Clapton requested that Harrison give the lead guitar track a more \"Beatley\" sound when mixing the song. During final mixing for the White Album, on 14 October, the guitar part was run through an ADT circuit with \"varispeed\", with engineer Chris Thomas manipulating the oscillator to achieve the desired \"wobbly\" effect. According to Everett, Lennon's tremolo-rich guitar part, recorded on 5 September, was retained only in the song's coda. Everett credits Clapton's guitar contribution with making the Beatles recording a \"monumental\" track. As particularly notable features, he highlights the increasing lengths of thrice-heard first scale degrees (0:17\u20130:19), the restraint shown by rests in many bars then unexpected appearances (as at 0:28\u20130:29), commanding turnaround phrases (0:31\u20130:33), expressive string bends marking modal changes from C to C (0:47\u20130:53), power retransition (1:21\u20131:24), emotive vibrato (2:01\u20132:07), and a solo (1:55\u20132:31) with a \"measured rise in intensity, rhythmic activity, tonal drive and registral climb\". In October 1968, Harrison reciprocated by co-writing \"Badge\" with Clapton and playing on Cream's recording of the track. Released on Cream's final album, Goodbye, \"Badge\" reflected Harrison's pop sensibilities and helped Clapton transition from the heavy blues style and its reliance on extended soloing, and onto the more song-based approach that he and Harrison admired in the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink."

        "content": "Apple Records released The Beatles on 22 November 1968. One of four Harrison compositions on the double album, \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was sequenced as the penultimate track on side one in the LP format, between Lennon's \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\" and \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\". The song was issued as the B-side of \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", a McCartney-written song that had also tested the Beatles' patience during the White Album sessions. This single was an international hit, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Switzerland and West Germany, but was not released in Britain or the United States. Recalling the release in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner said that, in returning to pop/rock songwriting after his excursions into the Indian classical style, Harrison's four White Album songs \"firmly established him as a contender\" beside Lennon and McCartney. In Schaffner's description, \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was the most instantly popular of \"a quartet of more conventionally accessible pop songs [written by Harrison] that many felt were among the finest on the album\". According to Beatles historian Erin Torkelson Weber, the release of the White Album marked the start of a period when many observers began to consider his songs \"equal to some of Lennon and McCartney's best compositions\", a view that was heightened with his two contributions to the Beatles' 1969 album Abbey Road, \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\". New Yorker columnist Mark Hertsgaard, writing in his 1995 book A Day in the Life, said \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was \"the first great composition of George's career and perhaps the single most impressive song on the White Album\". Among contemporary reviews, Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone said that \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was \"one of George Harrison's very best songs\", and likened it to \"Blue Jay Way\" in that it \"recalls California, the simple Baja California beat, the dreamy words of the Los Angeles haze, the organic pace lapping around every room as if in invisible waves\". Wenner found the lyrics \"slightly self-righteous and preaching\", representing \"a general set of incidents, a message, like a sermon, impersonally directed to everyone\", and concluded: \"I am willing to bet something substantial that the lead guitarist on this cut is Eric Clapton, yet another involution of the circular logic on which this song [is] so superbly constructed as a musical piece.\" In his review for the International Times, Barry Miles said the song was a \"great tune\" with \"nice hi-hats\" but a \"lifeless\" guitar part. Alan Smith of the NME credited the \"warm voice\" and \"very strong melody\" to McCartney and said that the track was one of the \"highlights\u00a0... moving into a slightly Hendrix thing\" and was bound to be \"Another hit for somebody\". Three weeks later, Smith acknowledged that the singer and composer was in fact Harrison, and added: \"the words are evocative and the melody line is creeping into my mind to stay.\" Geoffrey Cannon wrote in The Guardian: \"George Harrison has seen the truth, and is anxious that we should see our truth. He's a preacher, man of fire. When his songs speak of 'you', the address is direct. He achieves his character in 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', which, with Phil Ochs's 'Tape from California', is the first track I know that succeeds in making magnanimous love serious and touching.\""

        "content": "\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" became a staple of US rock radio during the early 1970s, on a par with songs such as \"Layla\" by Clapton's short-lived band Derek and the Dominos, Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven\" and the Who's \"Won't Get Fooled Again\". In 1973, it appeared on the Beatles' double album compilation 1967\u20131970, as one of only three tracks representing the White Album. Capitol Records included it on The Best of George Harrison in 1976; a year before this, Harrison released a sequel to the song, titled \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\", which also served as the final single issued by Apple in its original incarnation. The Beatles' recording appeared on the soundtrack to Withnail and I, a 1987 comedy film set in late-1960s London and produced by Harrison's company HandMade Films. Writing for The Observer in 2004, Pete Paphides described \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" as \"George Harrison's startling coming of age as a songwriter\" and one of the few tracks that \"pick themselves\" when listeners attempt to edit the double album down to a single disc. In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald was less impressed with the track, saying that it \"exudes a browbeating self-importance which quickly becomes tiresome\". McCartney identified it as one of his favourite selections on the 1995\u201396 Anthology outtakes series, and he grouped the song with \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\" as candidates for Harrison's \"greatest track\". Starr paired it with \"Something\" as \"Two of the finest love songs ever written\", adding: \"they're really on a par with what John and Paul or anyone else of that time wrote.\" In their written tributes to Harrison following his death in November 2001, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards each expressed their admiration for the song. Jagger said: \"It's lovely, plaintive. Only a guitar player could write that ...\" Rolling Stone ranked \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" 136th on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", seventh on the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\", and at number 10 on its list of \"The Beatles 100 Greatest Songs\". Clapton's performance was ranked 42nd in Guitar Worlds 2008 list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\". Among other critics' lists of the best Beatles songs, Paste magazine and Ultimate Classic Rock each ranked it at number 4, while Mojo placed it at number 17. In his commentary for the Mojo selection, English songwriter Chris Difford said that he had only come to fully appreciate the lyrics following Harrison's death in 2001; describing them as a \"riposte\" to Harrison's bandmates, particularly Lennon and McCartney, Difford added: \"George was the one who came back from India with the spiritual awakening and carried it through to the rest of his life, whereas the others came back with the postcards.\" In 2018, the music staff of Time Out London ranked \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" 20th on their list of the best Beatles songs. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the White Album's release, Jacob Stolworthy of The Independent listed it at number 1 on his ranking of the album's 30 tracks. He said the song was \"hands down one of The Beatles' greatest\" and, having been conceived through \"disharmony \u2013 in the world, as well as in the band he'd grown up with\", \"testament to Harrison's genius\"."

        "content": "Harrison played \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" at every one of his rare concerts as a solo artist. Writing for Mojo in 2003, Ashley Kahn attributed the track's \"classic\" status to its evocation of \"a band falling out of harmony\" and, with regard to the enduring musical bond between Harrison and Clapton, its standing as \"their song\". At Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh, held at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 August 1971, Clapton performed the song on a Gibson Byrdland, a hollow-body guitar more suited to jazz or country music than rock. He later said that this was a poor decision and, as with his substandard playing at the event, one that was indicative of his descent into heroin addiction. In his entry for The Concert for Bangladesh in the book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon nevertheless describes Clapton and Harrison's interplay as \"one of the more thrilling two-man guitar explorations in rock\", adding: \"As they finish each other's thoughts, the two extend and amplify the song's intent: You haven't heard the full gamut of gentle (and not so) guitar weeping until you've heard this.\" The version performed by Harrison during his brief set at the 1987 Prince's Trust Concert reunited him with Starr and Clapton, and features an extended coda with the guitars of Harrison and Clapton interweaving. On their 1991 tour of Japan, Harrison and Clapton performed \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" with additional background vocals. An edit combining parts of the 14 December and 17 December Tokyo Dome performances of the song was included on Harrison's 1992 double album Live in Japan. Harrison also featured the song in the set list for his only other tour as a solo artist, a series of North American concerts over November\u2013December 1974 with Ravi Shankar. Harrison shared the lead guitarist's role with Robben Ford, often extending the piece to eight minutes. While it was a popular inclusion in a set list that barely acknowledged Harrison's past as a former Beatle, his alteration of some of the lyrics \u2013 so that his guitar \"gently smiles\" and \"tries to smile\" \u2013 disappointed many concert-goers and reviewers. Author Simon Leng comments that on Harrison's return to Madison Square Garden towards the end of the tour, his playing on the song nevertheless received a standing ovation."

        "content": "Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey covered \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" on his 1990 album Hell to Pay. Harrison participated in the recording, contributing on acoustic guitar and backing vocals. Also issued as a single, Healey's version peaked at number 27 in Canada, number 85 in the UK and number 25 in New Zealand. During the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II concert at Buckingham Palace Garden on 3 June 2002, McCartney performed the song with Clapton, as a tribute to Harrison. The performance appears on the DVD release Party at the Palace. On 29 November the same year, Clapton, backed by a large band that included McCartney, Starr, Dhani Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Marc Mann, performed \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" at the Concert for George in memory of Harrison. Author Ian Inglis writes that while Clapton was already \"permanently associated\" with \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" due to his presence on the White Album recording and the Concert for Bangladesh and Live in Japan versions, his long, closing solo at the Concert for George contained \"perhaps the most expressive\" playing of all those versions. American musician Todd Rundgren covered \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" for the 2003 album Songs from the Material World: A Tribute to George Harrison. Rundgren said of his contribution to the multi-artist tribute: \"[Before the Beatles], I'd never heard the term 'lead guitarist.' George created the job description for my first paying gig, the vocation that I'm still lucky enough to practice today \u2026\" Johnny Loftus of AllMusic views the recording as one of the collection's highlights, saying that Rundgren \"effortlessly replicates the grandeur\" of the Beatles' track. As his personal tribute to Harrison, Peter Frampton released a version of the song on his 2003 album Now. In 2004, when Harrison was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was played in tribute by a large band that included Tom Petty, Lynne, Steve Winwood, Mann, Dhani Harrison, Prince and Steve Ferrone. The performance concluded with a highly acclaimed extended guitar solo by Prince, who was also being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Among other cover versions, the song has also been recorded by guitarists such as Marc Ribot, Phish and Charlie Byrd, and on ukulele by Jake Shimabukuro. Toto did a cover version for their album Through the Looking Glass and in a live performance in Live in Amsterdam. Santana did a cover for his twentieth album Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time, in 2010, featuring singer India Arie and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Released as a single, it charted on Billboards Adult Contemporary."

        "content": "Yes Please! is the fourth studio album by British rock band Happy Mondays, released 22 September 1992 through Factory Records. Following the non-album single \"Judge Fudge\", Factory allotted the band a budget of \u00a3150,000 for their next album. After settling on producers Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, both members of Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, Happy Mondays decamped to Blue Wave Studio in Saint Philip, Barbados in February 1992. The sessions were plagued by a variety of issues, such as frontman Shaun Ryder developing a crack habit, and dancer Bez breaking his arm three times. With little finished material and a lack of lyrics the band returned to the United Kingdom; Ryder was admitted into a detox centre. Recording continued for two weeks in May 1992 at Comfort's Place Studio in Lingfield, Surrey, where Ryder did his vocals. Yes Please! is a soul funk album, with a bleak sound that earned it a comparison to Unknown Pleasures (1979) by Joy Division. Yes Please! received mixed reviews from music critics, a few of whom found it to be uninspired, while others said it had some high points. It peaked at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart, going on to sell 50,000 copies by the end of the year. Happy Mondays toured the UK in October 1992, which was followed by a one-off Japanese show. Factory Records went into administration the next month; the band broke-up in early 1993. \"Stinkin Thinkin\", released as the lead single from Yes Please! on 31 August 1992, topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in the United States, and peaked at number 31 in the UK. \"Sunshine and Love\", released as the album's second single on 9 November 1992, reached number five on the Dance Club Songs chart, and reached number 62 in the UK."

It peaked at number four in the United Kingdom; all three of its singles reached the top 20 in the UK, with \"Step On\" and \"Kinky Afro\" both peaking at number five. Around the album's release, a newspaper article was published, which detailed frontman Shaun Ryder's past experiences with drugs, making his addiction with heroin (and toying with crack) and stint in a detox centre public in the process. A public relations representative from the band's label Factory Records had to issue a statement on Ryder's behalf, denouncing his drug use. The album was promoted with a UK arena tour, a trek to mainland Europe, and a two-month stint in the United States, ending with a variety of headlining shows and festival appearances in August 1991. Guitarist Mark Day got married as bassist Paul Ryder's marriage was coming to an end, resulting in him and Shaun Ryder doing more heroin. Ryder increased his crack intake while drummer Gary Whelan began suffering from depression and turned to alcohol. Rehearsals bore no new ideas; a recording session with Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne, producers of Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches, resulted in \"Judge Fudge\" and the unfinished \"Baby Big Head\". While the idea of a new album was suggested, both producers felt that timing was not right, saying it would descend into chaos due to the state of the band. \"Judge Fudge\" was released as a non-album single in November 1991, charting within the UK top 30. Despite Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches being a commercial success, Factory Records was struggling financially. To help alleviate some of it, Factory released Happy Mondays' first live album, titled Live. Factory Records had a distribution and licensing deal with major label London Recordings, which helped to push the visibility of Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches in European countries. A potential buyout from London was threatened if Factory was unable to handle its financial security. Misguided artist development, property investments and overspent album budgets for Happy Mondays and New Order meant that Factory had little funds left. In an attempt to recoup costs, Happy Mondays manager Nathan McGough and New Order manager Rob Gretton promised Factory founder Tony Wilson that neither of their respective bands' next albums would exceed a budget of \u00a3150,000."

        "content": "Despite relationships between Happy Mondays members straining, Ryder told McGough they had written enough material for another album. The band and Factory Records wanted to enlist Oakenfold and Osborne for their next album, but the pair was fully booked until June 1992 at the earliest. Concerned that they could not wait that long, McGough and Wilson decided to look for other producers. Paul Ryder was listening to Conscious Party (1988) by Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, learning that it was produced by Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club members Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, and thought they would be ideal producers for Happy Mondays' next album. Around the same time, the band had a new booking agent, Ian Flooks, who also worked with Frantz and Weymouth. When Flooks caught wind that the band were looking for producers, he suggested the pair. Ryder and McGough subsequently flew to Connecticut to visit Frantz and Weymouth. The latter pair had been wanting to produce more albums since Conscious Party; with the demise of the Talking Heads, the pair felt it was the best time to do so. They listened to Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches, which  impressed them, and they were convinced they could aid the band. Unlike Oakenfold and Osborne, Frantz and Weymouth understood how dynamics would work between band members due to their experience in Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club. The rest of Happy Mondays talked with the pair over the phone, telling them that they did not want to be distracted by alcohol and drugs, and wanted to be taken seriously as artists. Ryder, McGough, Frantz and Weymouth all flew to Miami to visit a studio owned by Bee Gees, with Ryder remarking it was a \"huge place but weird, on an industrial estate\". The four of them then went to a studio in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, though it was small and lacked a lot of equipment. If they wanted to record there, it would mean they would have to rent gear and fly it to Jamaica. Ryder then suggested Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas, close to where Frantz and Weymouth had a residence. It was previously a state-of-the-art facility, but when Ryder asked Frantz about it, he told Ryder that it had flooded and was in a state of disrepair. Happy Mondays had a meeting with McGough and Wilson, who gave the band three options on where to record: a studio in Amsterdam, which they all were against; a studio inside a formerly used church in Manchester, which was ran by pop producer Pete Waterman; or a studio in Barbados. Waterman had made a pitch to produce the band's next album, which Ryder and Whelan were against while the rest of the band plus McGough were up for. Whelan stated if they went with Waterman, he would quit. All of them went with Barbados, bar Day  who wanted to make the next album in Manchester. When asked by the band why he wanted to be in Manchester, Day reasoned that they all had families there. During a meeting with their business expenses manager, McGough told the rest of the band that Shaun Ryder (who was absent) had sacked Day, to much surprise. Ryder expected to replace him with Smiths guitarist and Electronic collaborator Johnny Marr. McGough said Day was \"unhappy and Shaun [Ryder] felt culturally he wasn't on board. [... Ryder] made it an issue and for half an hour one afternoon Johnny Marr was in [Happy Mondays]\". Day had been fired over the phone abruptly; Paul Ryder and Whelan visited Day. Day was confused by the idea, thinking the band wanted to kick him out, until they discovered he simply need some time off."

        "content": "On 17 January 1992, the day after Day had re-joined the band, they flew from Manchester to The Bahamas. Factory hoped the remote location would help sedate Shaun Ryder's heroin addiction; he had smuggled methadone (intended as a substitute for heroin) into the island, which he consumed immediately upon arrival. Day, still affected from the sacking and worried about the workload ahead, had a mental breakdown. Whelan and Paul Ryder had been drinking throughout the 13-hour flight to the island, and continued when the band took up residence at Sam Lord's Castle. They were asked to leave the accommodation when they found out keyboardist Paul Davis assaulted the bar band. They then travelled to Blue Wave Studio in Saint Philip, Barbados, which was owned by Eddy Grant. The studio itself was housed in a shack in the middle of a sugar plantation, as well as being near a jungle. It was on the driveway of Grant's estate, who was away during this time. The studio's manager heard unfavourable stories about the band, and had to be reassured by Frantz and Weymouth that the pair would handle everything. Frantz, Weymouth and the rest of the band had set up at the studio; when Shaun Ryder showed up, he was unfit to do any work. When sessions were underway, Mark Roula handled recording with assistance from Bryon Europe. Assembled in a live manner, the other members ran through the six partially-completed tracks they had for Frantz and Weymouth. The pair recorded these rehearsals, with the intention of going back to them after writing more material. Spurred on by the pair's enthusiasm, Day, Davis, Paul Ryder and Whelan started having fun, recalling their early rehearsals in Manchester. Day had been influenced by Eastern music, resulting in off-kilter guitar parts. Ryder and Whelan locked into grooves, with the encouragement of Weymouth. The majority of recording was plagued with a variety of issues with the band members. Happy Mondays discovered that the island was full of cheap crack available from local drug dealers, who knew the band were eager to purchase any drugs from them. Shaun Ryder ended up spending 20 hours each day in the toilet smoking crack, while the others were waiting to record. Dancer Bez broke his arm three times: once when crashing a car, the second time in a boat accident, and the third when his girlfriend sat on it. Paul Ryder began having withdrawal symptoms from the lack of heroin; as both Ryders became ill, McGough had a doctor prescribe them largactil. It resulted in neither of them having an energy left to record anything, especially Shaun Ryder, who was now unable to sing. Day and Whelan relaxed with their families on the island as they had finished their parts for the album, renting houses by the beachside. Frantz and Weymouth attempted to keep recording going, the difficulties with the band members eventually saw the pairs enthusiasm dissipate. The pair felt there was the foundation of ten songs recorded, waiting for Shaun Ryder's input. Amid growing frustration from the others, Ryder had yet to write any lyrics for the new songs. They spent a few days trying to coax lyrical inspiration out of Ryder. The constant crack use saw him inflicted with a throat infection, rending the chance of recording vocals impossible. Whelan let Ryder stay at his place, in an effort to spur lyrics out of him. When Ryder ran out of money to buy more crack, he ended up selling dealers his clothes. Reports of the band's antics \u2013 car crashes and drug consumption \u2013 reached tabloids in the UK. One story involved the band withholding the album's master tapes at ransom from Factory, which Whelan denied. Wilson had received intermittent reports about what was happening on the island. As he was in Los Angeles, California for a few days, he considered visiting the band, but ultimately decided not to. After five weeks of recording, having spent nearly the entire recording budget, the only finished track was \"Cut 'Em Loose Bruce\". At this point, Bez and McGough had returned to the UK. The rest of band then left the island on 10 March 1992 with little material finished."

When he left, McGough decided to have Ryder avoid Manchester, subsequently booking them an apartment in Newquay for two weeks. While Ryder was in a healthier state, he still struggled with writing new lyrics. Ryder returned home for a week before going to Comfort's Place Studio in Lingfield, Surrey to do vocals. The sessions re-started in May 1992, with assistance from Ray Mascarenas, for a period of two weeks. While Shaun Ryder was doing vocals, the other members kept themselves occupied: Paul Ryder and Astrella Donovan followed the latter's father on tour; Whelan spent time at a gym; Day looked after his newly-born child; Davis moved house; and Bez tended to his broken arm. Trying to aid in the writing, Frantz and Weymouth would have Shaun Ryder do things such as dancing on the spot or consult the I Ching for lyrics. They also employed William S. Burroughs' cut-up technique at Weymouth's suggestion. Ryder found himself struggling to enjoy the music the band had done, regretting that he did not take more of an interest when they were recording it. At the time of doing this vocals, Ryder was listening to American rappers, such as Bushwick Bill; he had Kermit of Manchester-based outfit Ruthless Rap Assassins sing additional vocals on \"Cut 'Em Loose Bruce\". Rowetta, who previously did guest vocals on Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches, was brought in, and subsequently had a large role with the new album, adding more melodies. Despite McGough's prior promise to Wilson to not go beyond \u00a3150,000, the album ended up costing \u00a3380,000; by comparison, New Order's respective album Republic (1993) costed \u00a3430,000. Steven Stanley mixed the recordings, with assistance from John Parthum, at Axis Studios in New York City between 1 and 24 June 1992. Scott Hull edited and assembled the songs for Bob Ludwig, who mastered the album at Masterdisk, also in New York City. In hindsight, Wilson regretted having Frantz and Weymouth produce the band: \"[Bez] said to me, 'Tina and Chris are brilliant [...] But their sound is the Tom Tomb Club of the late seventies and early eights. You should have found us the next sound.' And he's totally, totally right\"."

The album's title was the result of the studio manager at Blue Wave Studio answering the phone: \"Happy Mondays... Yes Please!\" Ryder wanted to name it Rubber Lover \"because of the picture of 'Our Lady and baby Jesus' on the sleeve\". In a retrospective piece for The Quietus writer Ben Cardew compared its bleak nature to Unknown Pleasures (1979) by Joy Division. Unlike that album, which relied matching its dark lyrics with similar-sounding music, Yes Please! \"pairs words of weary disgust with music that forces the Caribbean surroundings in which the album was recorded through a Manchester funk filter\". Simon Machan did programming and sampling, while Bruce Martin provided percussion, as well as additional programming and samples. \"Stinkin Thinkin\" details Ryder's time in rehabilitation. Its title phrase came from an American doctor that treated Ryder: \"Listen, don't be thinking negative thoughts, its stinking thinking\". Part of the lyrics also deal with the relationships between band members and the state of Factory Records, as well as being lifted from a Brian Eno interview. \"Monkey in the Family\" is a bass-centric track with an electro song arrangement in the style of EMF and Jesus Jones, and Arabic vocalizations. Ryder said the lyrics stemmed from Frantz writing down various words and told him to included as many of them as he could. \"Sunshine and Love\" is driven by Talking Heads-lite percussion, with a gospel-esque chorus section from Rowetta. \"Dustman\" sees Ryder yelling the lyrics incomprehensively, and out of time with the music, which consisted of bongos, scratch guitar playing and a Hammond organ. \"Angel\" is about visiting a doctor; part of the lyrics were lifted from a newspaper article that quoted Marlene Dietrich. Ryder wrote \"Cut 'Em Loose Bruce\" after hearing a story of a judge letting crack users off scot-free. With the song, Whelan said the band attempt to make darker Caribbean music. \"Theme from Netto\" is an instrumental track \u2013 Ryder claimed \"Netto is Mancunian for Nothing\" \u2013 which is followed by the 1970s disco song \"Love Child\". The final song of the album, \"Cowboy Dave\", was written in reference to Dave Rowbotham, former guitarist of the Durutti Column who was murdered by an unknown assailant; the song speculates that the perpetrator was his girlfriend, who discovered his body."

On the verge of receivership, Factory Records entered into a deal with London Recordings owner PolyGram, who would assume ownership of Factory. Since Factory was occupied, McGough managed to gain funds from the band's music publishing royalties, in the area of \u00a3250,000. It arrived in staggered payments of \u00a345,000. As Ryder enacted a legal clause allowing him \u00a320,000 of that sum, Day, Davis, Paul Ryder and Whelan received \u00a35,000 each. The situation repeated twice later in the year; Day said they were \"all pissed off about the money\". Around this time, Shaun Ryder had restarted his alcohol and heroin habits. \"Stinkin Thinkin\" was picked by both Ryders as the lead single from the album; released on 31 August 1992, it included \"Baby Big Head\" and Stephen Hague and Boy's Own remixes of \"Stinkin Thinkin\" as its B-sides. The music video for \"Stinkin Thinkin\", shot at Shepherd's Bush's shopping centre in London, placed a focus on Bez and Shaun Ryder has the director had a disliking for the rest of the band. They performed the song on Top of the Pops; Ryder sung his vocals live and forgot the words partway through, prompting the need to read off a sheet. Yes Please! was released on 22 September 1992. In preparation for an upcoming tour, McGough had the band set up in a rehearsal space in Ancoats. Shaun Ryder was absent from  the practices, while Paul Ryder was suffering from an heroin addiction, and Day, Davis and Whelan were unsure about the future of the band. They embarked on a stint of the UK in October 1992; several of the shows sold out in advance, with a handful more being added as a result. They then played a one-off show in Japan with Big Audio Dynamite. \"Sunshine and Love\" was released as the second single from the album on 9 November 1992. with a cover of \"Stayin' Alive\" (1977) by Bee Gees and remixes of \"Sunshine and Love\" and \"24 Hour Party People\" as its B-sides. Wilson had corralled about \u00a31,000 to make a music video for \"Sunshine and Love\"; Ryder refused to leave his band for the filming. Factory Records' deal with London Recordings fell through when a document signed by Factory's directors was found stating that the \"musicians own the music and we own nothing\", rendering their assets worthless. Their would-be owner withdrew from receivership as a result. Factory went into administration, a decision that was made public on 23 November 1992. As Factory was folding, the Manchester Evening News reported that Happy Mondays were looking for a new record deal. London Recordings attempt to sign the band for a three-album contract, having newly acquired New Order.

All of the money the band would accrued from the extension would be taken by London to recoup the debt, should they choose to sign with them. A tour of Germany the in December 1992 was cancelled. McGough had secured a contract with EMI; in February 1993, the band were in their rehearsal room with Clive Black, a representative from the label. Ryder announced he was leaving to purchase \"Kentucky\", a term used for heroin. After several hours without Ryder re-appearing, Black left. In an attempt to rescue the deal, Black told McGough to have Ryder meet him in London. After unsuccessful persuasion, Black ended up calling Ryder, telling him he was pulling the deal. Ryder's response was to blame Davis, who had done nothing wrong. Black then told McGough the deal was off; McGough proceeded to call each member to tell them he was quitting. A band meeting was later held with McGough, where Ryder apologized for the situation with EMI. They briefly discussed taking a year-long break; by the meeting's conclusion, Ryder was begging the others to give the band another chance. As they were aware it would be difficult to revive interest from EMI, they broke up."

        "content": "Author John Warburton in his book Hallelujah!: The Extraordinary Story of Shaun Ryder and Happy Mondays said Yes Please! was \"slammed by the critics as anodyne, uninspired and pedestrian\", while author Lisa Verrico in her book High Life 'N' Low Down Dirty: The Thrills and Spills of Shaun Ryder wrote that \"[e]ven the weekly press [...] had to concede that ...Yes Please! had its highlights\". The staff at Q said the band were \"back on the case\" and \"against all odds, they've pulled it off again\". The staff at Melody Maker called it \"actually pretty good. At best, we're talking about the oceanic funk of late, late Can; at worst, a typically tropical soundtrack to the Mondays' expensive vacation\". The NME said that despite the band's attitude over the preceding two years, \"they're back again, unflinching and honest and sick after their own shaggy fashion\". For Trouser Press, Doug Brod and Michael Krugman said that due to the rift between Ryder and his bandmates, the album \"often feels like a document of a band at odds with itself \u2014 the sprightly dance tracks clash with Shaun\u2019s deeply bent mindfuck wordiness\". Doug Iverson of The Blade saw the album as a regression, with the band's energy being compromised by Frantz and Weymouth. Spin Al Weisel, on the other hand, saw it as a \"kinder, gentler\" release, aided by the band and Frantz and Weymouth sharing a \"similar philosophy: 'Who needs to think when your feet just go? Cardew said it was \"steeped in age and regret, haunted by a 30-year-old Shaun Ryder who surveys the wreckage of his life and doesn\u2019t like what he sees\". In a review for Select, journalist Andrew Harrison saw as \"so disappointing\", describing it as an \"unwieldy collision of beach-barbie niceness with the products of Shaun Ryder's depraved extracurricular activities\". Yes Please! peaked at number 14 in the UK, selling 30,000 copies in its first week of release. By the end of the year, sales stood at 50,000. \"Stinkin Thinkin\" charted on the US Billboard charts at number one on Dance Club Songs, number 15on Dance Singles Sales, and number 21 on Alternative Airplay. It also appeared at number 31 in the UK. \"Sunshine and Love\" peaked at number five on the Dance Club Songs chart in the US, and at number 62 in the UK. Yes Please! was included in Pitchforks 2010 list of \"ten career-killing albums\" of the 1990s."

They each want to be in a romantic relationship, but they each have difficulties finding a good man. Successful television producer Savannah \"Vannah\" Jackson believes that one day her married lover will leave his wife for her. She later realizes that he won't, and that she must find her own man who will love her for who she really is. Bernadine \"Bernie\" Harris, who abandoned her career dream of having a catering business, instead raised a family and supported her husband John in building his business. He announces he is leaving her for a white woman with whom he works, sending her into an emotional tailspin that culminates in the two fighting over their assets after she burns his car, clothes and some of his other belongings, and then sells the rest of his things for a dollar each, and he retaliates by draining their bank accounts. Robin Stokes is a high-powered executive and the long-time mistress of married Russell. After dumping him, she has problems finding someone suitable. Beauty salon owner Gloria \"Glo\" Matthews is a single mother. Her ex-husband and the father of her son tells her that he was always bisexual and now realizes he is gay. Gloria eventually falls in love with a new neighbor, Marvin King. The situations all resolve themselves for the better. Savannah ends up permanently dumping her married lover. Bernadine gets a large divorce settlement from her ex-husband and finds love with a widowed civil rights attorney who encourages her to pursue her catering dream. Robin ends up pregnant by her married lover, but dumps him, and chooses to raise the baby on her own. Gloria apologizes to her neighbor for snapping at him when he suggested that she should let her son grow up and experience the world. She learns not to be so protective of her son and lets him go on an \"Up with People\" trip to Spain. She finds love while learning to take care of herself rather than being self-sacrificing in her devotion to her son and her business."

The Los Angeles Times called it a \"social phenomenon\". The film received a 60% approval rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 30 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Waiting to Exhale looks at life's ups and downs from an underseen perspective -- albeit one that's poorly served by uneven acting and a sporadically interesting story.\" In the book Is Marriage for White People? writer and Stanford Law School professor Ralph Richard Banks states that the film is a perfect example of the problems African-American women have in finding serious relationships."

        "content": "The elderly and pious Protestant sisters Martine (Birgitte Federspiel) and Philippa (Bodil Kjer) live in a small village on the remote western coast of Jutland in 19th-century Denmark. Their father was a pastor who founded his own Pietistic conventicle. With their father now dead and the austere sect drawing no new converts, the aging sisters preside over a dwindling congregation of white-haired believers. The story flashes back 49 years, showing the sisters in their youth. The beautiful girls have many suitors, but their father rejects them all, and indeed derides marriage. Each daughter is courted by an impassioned suitor visiting Jutland \u2013 Martine by a charming young Swedish cavalry officer, Lorens L\u00f6wenhielm, and Philippa by a star baritone, Achille Papin, from the Paris opera, on hiatus to the silence of the coast. Both sisters decide to stay with their father and spurn any life away from Jutland. Thirty-five years later, Babette Hersant (St\u00e9phane Audran) appears at their door. She carries only a letter from Papin, explaining that she is a refugee from counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris and recommending her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot afford to take Babette in, but she offers to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next 14 years, producing an improved version of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation and slowly gaining their respect. Her only link to her former life is a lottery ticket that a friend in Paris renews for her every year. One day, she wins the lottery of 10,000 francs. Instead of using the money to return to Paris and her lost lifestyle, she decides to spend it preparing a delicious dinner for the sisters and their small congregation on the occasion of the founding pastor's hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette's appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice. Babette tells no one that she is spending her entire winnings on the meal. The sisters accept both Babette's meal and her offer to pay for the creation of a \"real French dinner\". Babette arranges for her nephew to go to Paris and gather the supplies for the feast. The ingredients are plentiful, sumptuous, and exotic, and their arrival causes much discussion among the villagers. As the various never-before-seen ingredients arrive and preparations commence, the sisters begin to worry that the meal will become a sin of sensual luxury, if not some form of devilry. In a hasty conference, the sisters and the congregation agree to eat the meal, but to forgo speaking of any pleasure in it and to make no mention of the food during the dinner. Martine's former suitor, Lorens, now a famous general married to a member of the Queen's court, comes as the guest of his aunt, the local lady of the manor and a member of the old pastor's congregation. He is unaware of the other guests' austere plans and as a man of the world and former attach\u00e9 in Paris, he is the only person at the table qualified to comment on the meal. He regales the guests with abundant information about the extraordinary food and drink, comparing it to a meal he enjoyed years earlier at the famous Caf\u00e9 Anglais in Paris. Although the other celebrants refuse to comment on the earthly pleasures of their meal, Babette's gifts break down their distrust and superstitions, elevating them physically and spiritually. Old wrongs are forgotten, ancient loves are rekindled and a mystical redemption of the human spirit settles over the table. The sisters assume that Babette will now return to Paris. However, when she tells them that all of her money is gone and that she is not going anywhere, the sisters are aghast. Babette then reveals that she was formerly the head chef of the Caf\u00e9 Anglais and tells them that dinner for 12 there has a price of 10,000 francs. Martine tearfully says, \"Now you will be poor the rest of your life\", to which Babette replies, \"An artist is never poor.\"  Philippa then says: \"But this is not the end, Babette. In paradise you will be the great artist God meant you to be\" and then embraces her with tears in her eyes saying: \"Oh, how you will enchant the angels!\", which is precisely how the short story ends."

        "content": "Blixen's original story takes place in the Norwegian port town of Berlev\u00e5g, a setting of multicolored wood houses on a long fjord. However, when Axel researched locations in Norway, he found the setting was too idyllic and resembled a \"beautiful tourist brochure\". He shifted the location to the flat windswept coast of western Jutland and asked his set designer, Sven Wichmann, to build a small grey village offering very few or no attractions. M\u00e5rup Church, a plain Romanesque church built around 1250 on a remote seaside cliff near the village of L\u00f8nstrup, was used as a backdrop. Somewhat ironically, the actual village of Berlev\u00e5g is not on a fjord, but directly on the Barents sea, and is subject to strong winds\u2014very much similar to Axel's vision. Axel altered the setting from a ship-filled harbor to fisherman's rowboats on a beach. He said the changes would highlight Blixen's vision of Babette's life in near complete exile. The Nordisk Film production company suggested the cast of Babette's Feast should include only Danish actors to reduce production costs. However, Axel wanted Danish, Swedish and French actors to play the roles for the sake of authenticity. Axel was supported by the Danish Film Institute's consultant, Claes Kastholm Hansen, who also agreed the cast should include international stars. The title character of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve was interested in the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual sophisticated woman roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress St\u00e9phane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol's films Violette Nozi\u00e8re (1978) and Poulet au vinaigre (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabrol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her if she might be able to respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast. Two other major parts were the characters of the elderly maiden sisters, Phillipa and Martine. Phillipa, the once-promising singer, was portrayed by Bodil Kjer, considered the first lady of Danish theater and namesake of the Bodil Award. Birgitte Federspiel, best known for Carl Dreyer's 1955 classic film Ordet, was cast as the staid, love forlorn, Martine. The role of the Swedish General Lorens L\u00f6wenhielm, the former suitor of Martine, was accepted by Jarl Kulle and the Swedish Court Lady by Bibi Andersson. Both had achieved international recognition as two of Ingmar Bergman's favorite actors, appearing in many of his films. The group of elderly villagers was composed of Danish actors, many of whom were well known for their roles in the films of Carl Theodor Dreyer. These included Lisbeth Movin as the Old Widow, Preben Lerdorff Rye as the Captain, Axel Str\u00f8bye as the Driver, Bendt Rothe as Old Nielsen and Ebbe Rode as Christopher. The popular Danish actress Ghita N\u00f8rby was cast as the film's narrator. Although production consultants complained to Axel that the use of a narrator was too old-fashioned, Axel was adamant about using one. He said it was not about being old-fashioned but only about the need: \"If there is need for a narrator, then one uses one.\""

        "content": "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is the eleventh studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was released on 22 November 2004 in the United Kingdom by Island Records and a day later in the United States by Interscope Records. Much like their previous album All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), the record exhibits a more mainstream rock sound after the band experimented with alternative rock and dance music in the 1990s. It was produced by Steve Lillywhite, with additional production from Chris Thomas, Jacknife Lee, Nellee Hooper, Flood, Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Carl Glanville. Looking for a more hard-hitting sound than that of their previous album, U2 began recording How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February 2003 with Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results. The group subsequently enlisted Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. U2 lead singer Bono described the album as \"our first rock album. It's taken us twenty years or whatever it is, but this is our first rock album.\" Thematically, the record touches on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received generally positive reviews from critics and reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled the band's previous personal best. The album and its singles won all nine Grammy Awards for which they were nominated (U2 themselves were awarded eight out of the nine). It was also the fourth-highest-selling album of 2004, with almost ten million copies sold, and it yielded several successful singles, such as \"Vertigo\", \"City of Blinding Lights\", and \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\". The album was included on Rolling Stones list of the \"100 Best Albums of the Decade\" at number 68."

        "content": "Lead singer Bono explained that he had to ask himself a few hard questions before carrying on recording: \"I wanted to check where I was to where I am. So I went back and listened to all the music that made me want to be in a band, right from the Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo & The Bunnymen, all that stuff. And what was interesting is, that was what a lot of people in bands now are listening to anyway. So in a funny way, it made us completely contemporary.\" Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of their previous record, All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had completed an album's worth of songs. In October, they met in Dublin to review their work. Bono and guitarist the Edge believed it was good enough to release; Bono said, \"All we needed was the assent of the politburo and the record would have been out for Christmas.\" Bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr., however, disagreed with their bandmates and voted against releasing the record. Mullen said that the songs \"had no magic\", while Clayton said, \"When it comes to signing off on a project, you ask questions like, 'Have we got a first single to open the campaign?' Frankly, we were missing more than just a first single.\" Clayton and Mullen also had a nagging feeling that All That You Can't Leave Behind had been overpraised when it only produced one hit\u2014\"Beautiful Day\". Clayton thought that if U2's goal was to continue to be the world's biggest band, they needed three or four hits from their album that could attract new fans. The group brought in their long-time producer Steve Lillywhite to mediate the disagreement. After they played him the album, Lillywhite assessed that it felt like \"it had the weight of the world on its shoulders. It certainly wasn't any fun.\" After lengthy discussions, Bono and the Edge were convinced that the album needed more work. Bono thought their songs were good but admitted \"good won't bring you to tears or make you want to leave your house and tour for a year\". The group subsequently dismissed Thomas and enlisted Lillywhite to take over as the album's producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \"sonic cohesion\". A demo version of the album (guitarist the Edge's copy) was stolen while the band were having their photo taken for a magazine in France in July 2004. It contained unfinished versions of several songs that made it onto the album. The band publicly announced that if those tracks were leaked online, they would release the album immediately via the iTunes Store. Several months later, the finished album was leaked online, but the band did not release it earlier, despite previous comments. In late 2004, \"Mercy\", an unreleased track taken from the How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb sessions, surfaced on the Internet through a fan who had been given a copy of the album containing the extra track. The track is of less than standard audio quality, but managed to become a favorite on fan websites. It was cut from the final release, but was described by Blender as \"a six-and-a-half-minute outpouring of U2 at its most uninhibitedly U2-ish\". The lyrics to the song can be found in the booklet for the Special Limited Edition. A significantly revised version of the song was performed during the European leg of the U2 360\u00b0 Tour; it made its live debut on 12 September 2010 during the second Zurich concert, and was officially released as the opening track on the band's Wide Awake in Europe vinyl-only live EP that November."

        "content": "As with All That You Can't Leave Behind, this album finds U2 returning to \"more 'stripped down' rock and pop sounds\", according to musicologist Susan Fast. Adam Clayton said of Atomic Bomb, \"It's very much a guitar record. \"Vertigo\", \"Love and Peace\", \"City of Blinding Lights\", \"All Because of You\", all pretty up, rocky tunes. A lot of them are a kick-back to our very early days, so it's like with each year we have gathered a little bit more and this is what we are now.\" In 2003, Bono said one of their new songs called \"Full Metal Jacket\" was \"the mother of all rock songs\" and \"the reason to make a new album\". A similar demo called \"Native Son\" was also recorded. Both of these demos would later become \"Vertigo\". Contemporary Christian artist Michael W. Smith joined the band in the studio during the Atomic Bomb sessions and worked on at least one track with them, entitled \"North Star\". That track, which was a tribute to Johnny Cash, has not yet surfaced officially or unofficially in any form. A song introduced by Bono as \"North Star\" was played in Turin during the U2 360\u00b0 Tour; however, it is unknown whether or not this is the same song that was worked on during the sessions. Other tracks, such as \"Shark Soup\" (another version of \"Vertigo\"), \"Lead Me In The Way I Should Go\", and \"You Can't Give Away Your Heart\", were referenced in the media and by the band themselves, but have not been released. The very earliest versions of \"Love and Peace or Else\" originated during the recording sessions for All That You Can't Leave Behind. It serves as Atomic Bombs \"big plea for peace\" song, following in the footsteps of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", \"Miss Sarajevo\", \"Please\", and \"Peace on Earth\". During performances on the Vertigo Tour, \"Love and Peace Or Else\" featured Mullen moving out to the center of the ellipse-shaped ramp, where he played a floor tom and crash cymbal for the majority of the song. Near the end, Bono took over and played the drum until the song segued into the opening drumbeat of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". Most live performances of the song also saw Mullen singing the \"release, release, release, release\" part during the chorus alongside Bono. \"Crumbs from Your Table\" is about the relationship between Western countries and developing countries. The verses and chorus address the relationship from the perspective of citizens from the developing world, focusing on the disparity between the long-term socioeconomic planning stressed by the West (\"You speak in signs and wonders\") and the developing world's immediate need for sustenance (\"But I'm begging for the crumbs from your table\"). One line (\"You speak in signs and wonders\") was meant as a criticism of the Catholic Church. The bridge (\"Where you live should not decide / Whether you live or whether you die\") is statement from Bono that follows with the theme in his speeches in which he tries to raise awareness about African poverty. Bono stated on a bonus DVD included with special editions of the album that the band has no recollection of writing the song, as they were intoxicated at the time. A studio performance is also included on the aforementioned bonus DVD. It was only played a handful on times during the third leg of the Vertigo Tour. \"One Step Closer\" is a slow tempo song, with Bono's lyrics centered around traffic images, leading to the singer being stranded on a refuge island. The origins of the song go back to the All That You Can't Leave Behind sessions.  It was revived for Atomic Bomb, with Lanois introducing a pedal steel guitar, in addition to guitars from the Edge and Bono, and musical influences varying from country music to The Velvet Underground making themselves felt.  One recording of the song ran for more than 15 minutes, with Bono adding many verses that were subsequently dropped. Jacknife Lee also contributed to the final form of the recording. \"One Step Closer\" is billed in the album with thanks to Noel Gallagher of Oasis. The title of the song comes from a conversation Bono had with Gallagher about Bono's dying father, Bob Hewson. Bono asked, \"Do you think he believes in God?\" to which Gallagher replied, \"Well, he's one step closer to knowing.\" Through the end of the Vertigo Tour, the song had never been performed in any U2 concert. The title of the album derives from a lyric in the song \"Fast Cars\", which was only available on some versions of the album."

The song topped the charts in several countries, including the UK, reached number 31 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and topped the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It also topped the digital downloads chart in both the US and the UK, becoming U2's best-selling digital single ever in the US, with 2x Platinum status (note that for downloads, Platinum status was obtained at 200,000 copies sold). Upon release the song received extensive airplay and was an international hit, being featured in a popular iPod television commercial. The song lent its namesake to the band's Vertigo Tour. The second single in the UK was \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\", released on 7 February 2005. The song is about Bono's relationship with his dying father. The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming U2's first-ever follow-up single to top the charts. On US adult contemporary radio, it reached number 15 on the Adult Top 40 and also appeared on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, the Pop 100, and the Hot 100. \"City of Blinding Lights\" was the third UK release. It peaked at number 2 and spent nine weeks on the chart. It also placed on the US Adult Top 40. The second single in the US was \"All Because of You\". Although it received some airplay on rock radio, reaching number 6 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 20 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, the song had little mainstream exposure. When released in the UK, it peaked at number 4 but only spent four weeks on the chart. \"Original of the Species\" was released as a promotional single in the US. It peaked at number 6 on the Triple A Chart according to mediaguide.com and the video has reached number 12 on VH1's top 20 video countdown.

        "content": "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score out of 100 to ratings from critics, the album received an average score of 79 based on 26 reviews. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone described it as \"grandiose music from grandiose men, sweatlessly confident in the execution of their duties\", believing the album was well served by not tamping down Bono's ego or ambitions. Sheffield praised \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\", calling it \"a reminder that what makes U2 so big isn't really their clever ideas, or even their intelligence \u2014 it's the warmth that all too few rock stars have any idea how to turn into music\". Johnny Davis of Q said that the Edge's guitar playing \"makes this record\" with his \"arsenal of guitar noises that bring to mind a particularly impatient boy with a new box of indoor fireworks\". Responding to Bono's quote about the group wanting to stave off a decline, Davis said, \"They've succeeded in not becoming crap quite admirably.\" Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called the album \"triumphant\", praising U2's \"journey from adolescence to maturity\" over their career as one that few groups could make \"with their creative vision so fully intact\". He said that Bono lyrically \"explores epic themes, from faith to family, with such indelible grace that the CD stands with 'The Joshua Tree' and 'Achtung Baby' as one of the Irish quartet's essential works\". Dan Martin of NME called it \"a classic U2 album, but also a breathtakingly modern heavy fucker\", adding that \"Bono's genius is that his inner monologue is so huge and heroic that it matches the scale of the music\". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called it a \"nakedly honest, uplifting album\" and their most personal one since The Joshua Tree. He called it \"a joy to see the group rekindle its shimmering '80s guitar-pop sound\" and was encouraged that their music \"comes so strongly from the gut once again, without the latest techno-experimental production techniques.\" Ann Powers of Blender called the album a \"tour de force of tune and mood\", adding, \"because U2's sound has come to signify an open heart... it nearly always feels fresh, the way a new flame does\". She thought that Bono lyrically \"wields sentimentality like a switchblade\" but also said that \"U2's music is so broad and welcoming it can express ardor equally well for Christ, wives, supermodels, children or Bishop Desmond Tutu\". Stephen Trouss\u00e9 of Uncut called it \"their most unabashedly strident record since The Unforgettable Fire\" and said that songs such as \"City of Blinding Lights\" and \"All Because of You\" gave \"the sense of a band flexing muscles they haven't used in years\". He remarked about the melancholic undertow of Bono's lyrics, believing that the \"lines that stay with you speak of a creeping malaise\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that the album \"may be unadventurous and melodramatic, but it is packed with disarming moments\". He thought the group had embraced the clich\u00e9d elements of their 1980s music but said, \"Driven by a ferociously powerful rhythm section, U2 sound pleasingly raw, particularly next to the current wave of stadium rock pretenders\". He lamented the abandonment of their 1990s experimentation, but appreciated their retention of self-awareness, concluding, \"it seems highly unlikely anyone will laugh at U2 again\". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly questioned U2's motivations for back-pedaling musically but called them \"one of the few remaining bands who can make pop-chart lust work for them, as Atomic Bomb intermittently demonstrates\". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that the record \"marks a retreat from innovation and daring, and re-immerses the Irish quartet in the comfort zone of its earliest successes\". He believed the band had \"settl[ed] into middle age by recycling its best riffs and ideas\" and that those musical ideas were \"destined to pale in coming years as second-hand versions of those classic albums\". Amanda Petrusich of Pitchfork called the record \"brash, grungy, and loud\" but not \"especially surprising\", judging it to contain a \"tiny handful of outstanding tracks and a whole mess of schmaltzy filler\". She criticised Bono's \"vague, cliched observations, his sentiments always awkwardly bombastic or hopelessly maudlin\" and thought the album's biggest issue was \"that it sounds so much like U2\". Keith Harris of The Village Voice said that the lyrics were marred by \"legions of rampant clich\u00e9s\" and that the album's producers \"simply construct a U2 album in miniature, mixing in the Edge's processed-guitar trademark whenever you fear they're straying into unforgivable un-U2ness. That's just not enough.\""

Young's lead vocal track on the song \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" (on the original album) was actually a temporary scratch vocal he sang through the low-quality talk-back microphone on the mixing board, with no effects such as reverb.

Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere was remastered and released on HDCD-encoded compact disc and digital download on July 14, 2009, as part of the Neil Young Archives Original Release Series.

Bruce Miroff of Rolling Stone wrote a favorable review, describing Young's voice as \"perpetually mournful, without being maudlin or pathetic. It hints at a world in which sorrow underlies everything [...] because that world is recognizable to most of us, Young's singing is often strangely moving.\" Despite stating that \"in several respects [the album] falls short of his previous effort\" and that \"the lyricism of the first album can only be found in faint traces,\" he concluded that the album \"offers ample rewards. Young's music partially makes up for its lack of grace by its energy and its assurance.\" Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice that \"Young is a strange artist and I am not all the way into him yet, but this record is haunting\". The original review was printed with a grade of \"B+\", but Christgau later said he would have changed it to an \"A\u2013\". In a retrospective review in Rolling Stone, Greg Kot called the record \"raw, rushed, energised\", and the band's interplay \"at once primitive and abstract\", a \"gloriously spontaneous sound\" that \"would endure, not only as a blueprint for Young...but as an influence on countless bands.\" William Ruhlmann of music database website AllMusic said of the album, \"released only four months after his first [album], [it] was nearly a total rejection of that polished effort.\" He noted that \"Cinnamon Girl,\" \"Down by the River,\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" were \"useful as frames on which to hang the extended improvisations Young played with Crazy Horse and to reflect the ominous tone of his singing\". He concluded that the album \"set a musical pattern Young and his many musical descendants have followed ever since [...] and a lot of contemporary bands were playing music clearly influenced by it\". Mark Richardson of Pitchfork wrote, \"the opening riff to 'Cinnamon Girl' erases the memory of Neil Young completely in about five seconds\" and that \"Crazy Horse were loose and sloppy, privileging groove and feeling above all\". He also said that \"Young sounds comfortable and confident, singing with the versatile voice that has changed remarkably little in the 40 years since\" and concluded that it \"was a sort of big bang for Young, a dense moment of creative explosion that saw possibilities expanding in every direction\". In 2003, the album was ranked number 208 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and 210 in a 2012 revised list, and number 407 in the 2020 edition. In 2013, the album was ranked 398 on NMEs list of the '500 Greatest Albums of all time'. In 2018, the album won the Polaris Heritage Prize Audience Award in the 1960-1975 category."

The band was founded by Youman, vocalist Chris Mussey, guitarist Matt Rathje, and bassist Craig Winters. A number of players came and went before the lineup coalesced to include Scott Russo on vocals, Steve Morris and Rob Brewer on guitar, and Jeff Brehm on bass. They released their first cassette demo on September 9, 1992, known as Six Song Demo. The lineup changed once again, and they released the 7\" vinyl single Blurr in 1993. The band quickly established themselves in the prolific San Diego music scene of the early 1990s that also included groups such as Blink-182, Agent 51, Buck-O-Nine, Sprung Monkey, One by One, Drive Like Jehu, and Rocket from the Crypt. In 1994 the band recorded their first album, Blue Room, which was released by local label Red Eye Records. It established their early sound of fast-paced punk rock and gave them the opportunity to build their reputation by playing local shows in and around the San Diego area. Songs such as \"CPK,\" \"Shallow,\" and \"Suzanne\" would become favorites with local fans and would remain in their live set for years to come."

The songs \"Denied\" and \"Superman\" received airplay on several southern California rock radio stations and were released as singles. Over the next year the band toured the United States with bands such as Blink-182 and Pennywise. By 1997 Unwritten Law had signed to Interscope Records and bassist John Bell had left the band. Pivit bassist Micah Albao joined them in Seattle for the recording of their self-titled album Unwritten Law which was released in 1998. The singles \"Lonesome,\" \"Cailin,\" and \"Teenage Suicide\" became minor hits on rock radio stations. Pat \"PK\" Kim, formerly of Sprung Monkey, joined as their new permanent bass player and the band embarked on the Vans Warped Tour, which took them across North America, Europe, and Australia. In Australia the band developed an enthusiastic and dedicated following, and they would return there over the next few years and release several singles and live recordings exclusive to the country."

        "content": "The band spent a considerable amount of time recording and preparing their next release, 2002's Elva. The album was a stylistic change of pace, deliberately moving away from their established punk rock formula and towards a more accessible hard rock sound. The lead single \"Up All Night\" became somewhat popular, but it was \"Seein' Red\" and its accompanying music video which brought the band their greatest success, reaching No. 1 on US modern rock charts. They toured extensively in support of the album alongside bands such as Sum 41 and The Used. In 2003 the band was invited by VH1 to film an episode of the live acoustic series Music in High Places. The invitation happened somewhat by accident, as the station was hoping to attract Jimmy Eat World but contacted Unwritten Law's management by mistake. The band recorded a set of acoustic performances in various locales at Yellowstone National Park. They prepared the recordings for release as an album, but Interscope declined to release it. The band ended their contract with Interscope and signed to Lava Records, who released Music in High Places as an album. The performance was also released as a DVD entitled Live in Yellowstone. The song \"Rest of My Life\" from this performance received airplay on modern rock radio stations nationwide. The band's song Celebration Song was featured in the soundtracks of Need For Speed: Underground 2 and MX vs ATV Unleashed. Shortly after the release of Music in High Places founding drummer Wade Youman was ejected from the band due to personal and professional issues. Wade later went on to Join The Rattlesnake Aces. For the recording of their next album Here's to the Mourning drummers Adrian Young of No Doubt and Tony Palermo of Pulley joined the band in the studio. The band got along so well with Palermo that by the time of the album's release in 2005 he had joined as their permanent drummer. Much of the lyrics on the album were co-written by singer Scott Russo's girlfriend Aimee Allen, with whom he formed the side project Scott & Aimee. Allen and Linda Perry contributed to the writing of the album's lead single \"Save Me (Wake Up Call),\" which reached No. 5 on US modern rock charts. This was followed by the single \"She Says.\" In March 2005 guitarist Rob Brewer was fired from Unwritten Law after a physical altercation on stage with Russo. Russo and other band members collectively decided to remove Brewer from the band. The band chose not to replace him and continued on as a 4-piece. They continued to tour in support of Here's to the Mourning across the United States as well as internationally."

On January 3, 2007 the band performed \"Shoulda Known Better\" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. That July the band embarked on a North American tour in support of The Hit List, with Scott & Aimee drummer Dylan Howard filling in for roughly half the tour while Palermo stayed home with his wife, who was due to give birth. Also during 2007, Palermo acted as fill-in touring drummer for Papa Roach. In March 2008 it was announced that Palermo had joined Papa Roach permanently. Meanwhile, Unwritten Law, with new drummer Dylan Howard, filmed a live DVD at the Key Club in Hollywood, California in March 2008. The album, titled Live and Lawless, was released September 30, 2008 through Suburban Noize Records. Unwritten Law's sixth studio album, Swan, was also released through Suburban Noize on March 29, 2011.  On January 24, 2011, Unwritten Law posted on their Myspace page the first single from their new album called \"Starships and Apocalypse.\"  They have also been confirmed to play the 2011 Warped Tour. Guitarist Steve Morris and bassist Pat Kim left Unwritten Law at the end of their Swan Tour in 2011 due to a physical altercation between Scott Russo and Morris.  This was kept silent for a few months until after the band finished touring with Warped Tour, although Morris and Kim did not tour with them.  Derik Envy, formerly of Red Light Sky, and Kevin Besignano, formerly of Bullets and Octane, had become the permanent replacements for Kim and Morris, respectively."

        "title": "Heroes and Villains_Summary",
        "content": "\"Heroes and Villains\" is a song by the American rock band the Beach Boys from their 1967 album Smiley Smile and their unfinished Smile project. Written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, Wilson envisioned the song as an Old West-themed musical comedy that would surpass the recording and artistic achievements of \"Good Vibrations\". The single was Brother Records' first release and failed to meet critical and commercial expectations, although it was a hit record, peaking at number 12 in the U.S. and number 8 in the UK. The song was Wilson and Parks' first collaboration. Parks characterized the song as \"historically reflective\" and a \"visual effort\" that was meant to match the ballads of Marty Robbins. He said the lyrics were based on the early history of California, including references to the involvement of the Spanish and American Indians. Some accounts suggest that the song developed partly from a Wilson reworking of the standard \"You Are My Sunshine\". Early versions included sections with lyrics about farm animals (\"Barnyard\") and physical health (\"I'm in Great Shape\"). \"Heroes and Villains\" has the most complex evolution of any song in the band's history. Recording spanned virtually the entire Smile sessions as Wilson experimented with at least a dozen versions of the track, some of which ranged in length from six to eight minutes.  Wilson discarded almost everything that was recorded, with expenses totaling around $40,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Most of the final composite was produced in three days at his makeshift home studio. The chorus featured a theme that was cannibalized from another Smile track, \"Do You Like Worms?\". Wilson's bandmates and associates later voiced dissatisfaction with the released version, believing that the mix was vastly inferior to his earlier, lengthier edits. Commentators blame the record's failure on the esoteric lyrics, the \"muddy\" sound quality, and the late timing of the release. It remains one of the lesser-known songs in the Beach Boys' catalog. In 2004, Wilson remade the song and its related pieces for Brian Wilson Presents Smile. In 2011, The Smile Sessions was released with an entire disc devoted to the song's original recording sessions."

        "content": "Wilson had been working on \"Heroes and Villains\" for some time before he asked Parks to be his lyricist in mid-July 1966.  Al Jardine surmised that the song derived in part from the group's improvised scat singing exercises from early in the band's existence. In a 2000 interview, he stated, \"We all became instruments for Brian's barbershop concept. He said, 'Let's all do this, let's sing this idea.' Carl would be one instrument, I'd be another. Mike would be another instrument. ... With none of us really being players, we would just scat in the car going to a show or something or going to school, anywhere.\" Musician Al Kooper, writing in his 2008 autobiography, recalled that Wilson played him a rough mix of \"Heroes and Villains\" shortly after the release of Pet Sounds. Kooper remembered that the song had \"evolved, I believe, from a Wilson revamping of 'You Are My Sunshine.'\" \"Heroes and Villains\" was the first song that Wilson and Parks wrote together. As with the others that they wrote for the Smile album, Parks wrote the words while Wilson composed the music. When presented the descending melody at the initial writing session, occurring a few days after their first meeting, Parks was reminded of the Marty Robbins' 1959 song \"El Paso\" and immediately conceived the opening line: \"I've been in this town so long that back in the city I've been taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long, long time.\" Wilson told Parks that he had thought of the Old West when conceiving the melody. Journalist Domenic Priore speculated that Wilson may have based the verses on Phil Spector's productions of \"River Deep - Mountain High\" and \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" \u2013 particularly the former's bass line. Asked in 2004 about the influence of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue on the recurring melodies and themes on Smile, Wilson responded: \"A little bit, not much. It influenced 'Heroes & Villains' and a couple of others.\" He credited Parks with some of the music and arrangement on \"Heroes and Villains\". In Parks' recollection, all but one section of \"Heroes and Villains\" was written entirely \"in one sitting\". The success of the pair's collaboration led to them writing more songs with an Old West theme, including \"Barnyard\" and \"I'm in Great Shape\". It became an integral track for the Smile project and, later, was often called the album's \"centerpiece\". Wilson envisioned \"Heroes and Villains\" as a three-minute musical comedy that would surpass his achievements with \"Good Vibrations\". In a 1977 radio interview, he offered an anecdote in which he told his father, Murry that he was going \"'to make a record that's better than 'Good Vibrations', something that you could never do. I don't know why in the hell I said that.\" In a self-penned 1969 article, former band associate Michael Vosse wrote that, during one night at Wilson's home, Wilson played a past-tense variation on \"You Are My Sunshine\" on piano that deviated into \"this weird little riff\". Vosse said, \"And it hit him, man, right then that he wanted a barn yard\u2014he wanted Old MacDonald's farm\u2014he wanted all that stuff. So he immediately got Van Dyke over and they did a chart for 'You were my sunshine'\". Although Vosse admitted that his memory may be wrong, since Wilson \"changed things so much\", he recalled that the arrangement then \"developed into an instrumental thing with barnyard sounds\u2014people sawing\u2014he had people in the studio sawing on wood\u2014and Van Dyke being a duck\u2014and it was marvelous.\" Asked about Wilson's rendition of \"You Are My Sunshine\" in 2004, Parks could not remember having been involved with it."

        "content": "There are conflicting reports regarding who came up with the title. Wilson credited Parks with naming the song, but Parks denied this, saying that he wrote the lyrics around the title that Wilson had suggested. Wilson's then-wife Marilyn commented: \"There are so many screwed-up people in the music industry. The good guys and the bad guys ... That's one thing Brian had in mind when they did 'Heroes and Villains. Biographer Peter Ames Carlin interpreted the song as Wilson projecting \"all of the feelings sensed inside of himself ... into vibrantly colored, abstract glimpses into another parallel world.\" In Carlin's interpretation, the song describes \"a lawless boomtown somewhere out on the fringes of the Old West\" as told from the perspective of a narrator who \"speaks as a man who has become a part of the scene, but not of it, exactly, because he's still so thrilled and terrified by everything he sees.\" At the song's conclusion, the protagonist \"has aged and seen his children grow to adulthood\" without knowing if his experiences have turned him into a hero or a villain. Alternate versions of the song tell a different narrative, as Stylus Magazines Ed Howard writes,  \"'Heroes & Villains' told a story, though the actual narrative changed depending on what sections were being added or discarded at any given time.\"  In reference to \"I'm in Great Shape\", Parks commented: \"it's interesting how [in the lyrics] there was, all of a sudden, this turning to eggs and grits. It's because it had something to do with the thought of a barnyard, and that related to that place we were trying to come up with in 'Heroes And Villains'. All those lyrics were visual efforts.\" Contrary to a popular rumor, the song was not written about the nascent war in Vietnam. Parks said the lyrics were actually centered around an American Indian \"thing\" in which he and Wilson \"were trying to exculpate our guilt, to atone for what we had done to the aborigines of our own place. There's a lot of things about belief in Smile, and its very question of belief is what was plaguing Brian at that time. What should we keep from the structure that we had, the hard-wiring that we had with religion?\" Historian Keith Badman speculated that the \"you're under arrest\" line from an earlier version of the song may have been inspired by Wilson witnessing an attempted burglary of his Rolls-Royce. Artist Frank Holmes, who designed the Smile cover artwork, created an illustration that was inspired by the song's lyrics: \"The rain of bullets eventually brought her down\". Along with several other drawings, it was planned to be included within a booklet packaged with the Smile LP. Holmes shared a summary of his design choices in Domenic Priore's 2005 book Smile: The Story of Brian Wilson's Lost Masterpiece. Holmes recalled of the illustration, \"the poultry in the right corner is saying, 'Dude'll do,' a reference to a line in the original lyrics: 'She was unafraid of what a dude\u2019ll do in a town full of heroes and villains.' Van Dyke tells me that Brian saw that image and actually got the other Beach Boys to change their singing to \u2018Dude\u2019ll do\u2019, based on this. So there's a case of the drawing definitely influencing the work.\""

        "content": "\"Heroes and Villains\" had the most complex evolution of any song in the band's history, with dozens of sections and themes recorded for the track. Approximately 30 session dates were devoted to the song. Recording spanned virtually the entire Smile sessions, with the total production costs estimated at around $40,000 (equivalent to $ in ), a sum that was possibly three to four times greater than that for \"Good Vibrations\". Wilson also worked on and revised \"Heroes and Villains\" more than any other track for the LP.  He experimented with myriad versions of the song, some of which ranged in length from six to eight minutes. Numerous rough mixes were completed, including at least four substantially different versions. It is the only track on Smile in which Wilson recorded vocals before the different sections of the song was assembled. Wilson said it was also the only song he ever produced in which the bass drum was the backbeat. \"Great boom boom. People across the street were saying, 'Hey\u2014whatever you're doing sounds great!' Thank you very much!\" Some sections that were recorded for \"Heroes and Villains\" were, at one point, slated to be dedicated songs of their own. In the 1970s, Wilson told biographer Byron Preiss that there was intended to be a piece called the \"Barnyard Suite\", which would have been \"four songs in four short pieces, combined together, but we never finished that one. We got into something else.\" The only consistent element among the many versions of \"Heroes and Villains\" was that the song began with the \"I've been in this town ...\" verse. From there, the rest of the track was constantly revised. Journalist Peter Doggett commented, \"The shifts of melody and tempo are so dramatic that virtually anything could have been considered part of that song; in Brian Wilson's mind, virtually anything was.\" Vosse recalled that \"there must have been a dozen versions. The best version I heard, which was never completed, but at least I could see the form of it, was an A side B side version lasting about six minutes. It was a beautifully structured work; and Van Dyke was still very involved.\" Wilson later denied that he had ever planned to issue the song in this form. In 2006, Carlin reported that a rumored 11-minute edit had yet to be found. In 2013, an acetate containing an early mix of the song was discovered. It indicated that Wilson had experimented with incorporating recorded sections of \"I'm in Great Shape\" into the projected \"Heroes and Villains\" single. One of Wilson's \"Heroes and Villains\" recording experiments was, according to journalist Nick Kent, directly inspired by his emerging struggles with auditory hallucinations. Kent wrote that, during a session, Wilson attempted to recreate a \"ghoulish\" voice in his head by \"taking a tape of some acappella Beach Boys vocal horse-play and slowing it down until it was just this vast swamp-like groan of terror. It was the scariest sound of anything he created for Smile ...\" In the September/October 1967 issue of Crawdaddy!, journalist Paul Williams wrote that the song \"originally had a chorus of dogs barking, cropped when Brian heard Sergeant Pepper, and was in many ways - the bicycle rider - a far different song.\""

        "content": "On May 11, Wilson went into Gold Star Studios and recorded an instrumental take of \"Heroes and Villains\" with a 2:45 runtime. The session was conducted as an experiment and was not a full-fledged recording. It is one of the many recordings of the songs that have since been presumed missing or lost. According to journalist Domenic Priore, this early take may have included a section that quoted \"You Are My Sunshine\". Engineer Chuck Britz told Preiss that \"Heroes and Villains\" was \"as big if not bigger than 'Good Vibrations' in its original form. I thought it was a fantastic song, a great, rich full sound. ... We had our basic unit-an organ, drums, basses, and guitars. Mostly everything we did had the same amount of basic instrumentation. I think there was a harpsichord in the back of the room and a harp played by Mike\u2019s sister, Maureen.\" \"Barnyard\" and the backing track verses of \"Heroes and Villains\" were both recorded on October 20, 1966 at Western Studio. \"Barnyard\" featured animal noises roared by Wilson's Smile coterie, including singer Danny Hutton and his girlfriend June Fairchild. A session for \"I'm in Great Shape\" followed on October 27. On the recording, Wilson experimented with a tape delay effect that looped the audio signal back into itself cumulatively at a high gain level to create an \"explosion\" of sound. On November 4, Wilson recorded a piano demonstration of \"Heroes and Villains\" that included \"I'm in Great Shape\" and \"Barnyard\" as sections of the song. Parks and KHJ DJ Humble Harve Miller are also featured on this recording \u2013 the former providing animal sounds. On November 14, Wilson recorded \"My Only Sunshine\", a medley of the standards \"The Old Master Painter\" and \"You Are My Sunshine\". The renditions are relatively short. In 2005, Wilson wrote that the rendition of \"The Old Master Painter\" was brief because he could not remember the full song. During the recording, Wilson remarked that the session players should play as though they're far away, as the lyric suggests. Reflective of the spiritual themes recurring throughout the Smile songs, \"The Old Master Painter\" is a song that evokes God in its lyrics. \"You Are My Sunshine\" ends with a string section descending to a low discordance where Brian used the adjectives \"snappy\" and \"draggy\" to instruct session players. The master take for \"You Are My Sunshine\" was spliced out of the original reel so that Dennis Wilson could add a lead vocal. In 1968, a mono mixdown of the tape was created, but as of 2004, the original master had gone missing from the band's archives."

        "content": "Smile was first projected for a December 1966 release date. On December 15, Wilson informed Capitol A&R director Karl Engemann that the album and its lead single \"Heroes and Villains\" would probably be delivered \"some time prior to January 15\". He attempted to ease Capitol's concerns over the album's delay by delivering a handwritten note that contained an unordered, preliminary track listing. \"I'm in Great Shape\" and \"The Old Master Painter\" were both listed as a separate track from \"Heroes and Villains\". Capitol delayed the release date of Smile and \"Heroes and Villains\" to March 1967. Possibly due to their insistence on a ready single, Wilson returned to work on \"Heroes and Villains\" on December 19, 1966 after which he halted work on most of the album's other tracks until April 1967. According to former band associate David Anderle, in December 1966, Wilson was unable to decide if \"Heroes and Villains\" should be the single. By the start of 1967, the Smile recording sessions were marked by tension, a contrast from the joyous atmosphere that began the project. In one section of \"Heroes and Villains\", Wilson instructed his bandmates to crawl on the floor of the studio and make pig-like snorting sounds. Jardine remembered, \"You hear a bunch of snorting and swining... It was like being trapped in an insane asylum. I was emotionally depressed by a lot of that stuff ...\" On January 3, a module of \"Heroes and Villains\" called \"Do a Lot\" was recorded. A surviving tape of this session includes a remark from Wilson saying, \"If there's not anymore cooperation of this, I'm splitting, I mean it. We better get back into the groove, you know?\" \"Do a Lot\" was later reconfigured as \"Mama Says\" and briefly as a section of \"Vega-Tables\". Similarly, on January 27, a section called \"All Day\" was recorded. Also known as \"Love to Say Dada\", it later evolved into \"Cool, Cool Water\". At some point, Wilson began considering \"Bicycle Rider\", a module from \"Do You Like Worms?\", for inclusion in the structure of \"Heroes and Villains\". On February 10, Wilson completed a mix of \"Heroes and Villains\", later known as the \"Cantina\" version, that ended with a coda extracted from \"My Only Sunshine\". Wilson soon discarded this version and the master tape was later lost, leaving just a safety copy of the mix. On February 16, Richard Goldstein reported in the Village Voice that the forthcoming single had \"five movements, each with a distinct melodic and rhythm line.\" On February 18, journalist Tracy Thomas reported in the NME that \"Heroes and Villains\" would be released once Wilson decides on the contents of the single's B-side. She quoted Wilson as saying that he wanted to \"keep as much of Smile a surprise as possible. I may end up just recording me and a piano. I tried it last night in the studio. It would be an interesting contrast, anyway.\" Work on the song continued throughout February and March. At the end of February, the band launched a lawsuit against Capitol that sought neglected royalty payments and a dissolution of their contract with the label. Following this, Wilson announced that the album's lead single would be \"Vega-Tables\", a song that he had yet to start recording."

On March 18, KMEM in San Bernardino conducted a radio survey that reported that Wilson was busy preparing \"Heroes and Villains\" and Smile, \"and he's informed the Capitol bosses that he doesn't intend to 'hold back' on these projects.\" On March 21, band publicist Derek Taylor reported in his weekly column for Disc & Music Echo, \"Only a scoundrel would dispute the claim that 'Heroes and Villains' is the most famous single not yet recorded. ... it is a fact that the single, at the time of writing, is not completed and many people here are troubled. But Brian Wilson is not one of them.\" In April, Wilson paused work on \"Heroes and Villains\" to focus on \"Vega-Tables\" for two weeks. Parks' last recorded appearance on the album's sessions was for a \"Vega-Tables\" date on April 14, after which Wilson took a four-week break from the studio. On April 29, Taylor announced in Disc & Music Echo that \"All the 12 songs for the new Beach Boys album are completed and ... there are plans to release the album on a rush-schedule any moment.\" That same day, a Taylor-penned press release, published in Record Mirror and NME, revealed that \"Heroes and Villains\" was delayed due to \"technical difficulties\". On May 6, Taylor announced that Smile had been \"scrapped\" by Wilson. On May 11, Wilson returned to work on \"Heroes and Villains\" for a single session. On May 14, Carl Wilson stated at a press conference in Holland that \"Vega-Tables\" would probably be released as a single instead of \"Heroes and Villains\"."

        "content": "By June, Brian had declared to his bandmates that most of the material recorded for Smile was now off-limits and that he wanted to rerecord \"Heroes and Villains\" from scratch. Vocal and instrumental tracking on the song lasted from June 12 to 14 at Wilson's makeshift home studio, representing a dramatic contrast from his previous working methods. According to the group's statements to the press, they abruptly dropped out of headlining the Monterey Pop Festival that weekend because of commitments to deliver the \"Heroes and Villains\" single to Capitol. Biographer Steven Gaines wrote that \"Heroes and Villains\" was the only track prepared for the forthcoming Smiley Smile album that Wilson \"really cared about\". Jim Lockhert, the engineer for the Smiley Smile sessions, recalled: \"We had the complete song, but they just wanted to use part of it. Brian wanted to change what had been done on the rest of it. I think he wanted instrumentally and vocally to make it more complex. I think he wanted to finish the song, it was a challenge to him.\" Like many of the other tracks on Smiley Smile, Wilson used his recently acquired Baldwin theatre organ on the track. On some parts of the recording, the band used Wilson's swimming pool as an echo chamber, The final overdubs were recorded around late June or early July.  On July 22, Mike Love played a version of \"Heroes and Villains\" for NMEs Keith Altham, who reported, \"His particular tape ran for about six minutes. The harmonies and melodies are as intricate as one would expect. The number sounds like a combination of 'Good Vibrations', 'God Only Knows' and 'I Just Wasn't Made for These Times'.\" After a brief period spent re-mixing and editing the song, the record was completed with a runtime of three minutes and 36 seconds. The only remnant of the earlier Smile recordings that made it into the final edit was portions of the backing track that had been recorded in October 1966. The final edit featured a complex vocal arrangement, unusual formal juxtapositions, tempo changes, and other novel elements. It starts at a fast tempo, alternates between a slower chorus, and at the end, shifts to an out-of-tempo a capella section that leads abruptly into the chorus fade-out. The chorus featured a theme that was cannibalized from \"Do You Like Worms?\". According to Jardine, the \"most important part of the song\" was the change from E minor to A major, \"The choruses repeat and you\u2019d hear the theme repeated and repeated in the song.  That\u2019s very similar with what classical composers used to do, and that\u2019s what I liked. I really enjoyed the recurring themes with different arrangements.\""

        "content": "Wilson held onto the final mix of the song for about a month. On the evening of July 11, 1967, he was told by his astrologer (a woman named Genevelyn) that the time was right for the record to be heard by the public. Without informing Capitol, Wilson called his bandmates and, accompanied by producer Terry Melcher, traveled by limo to personally deliver a vinyl cut of the record to KHJ Radio. According to Melcher, as Wilson excitedly offered the record for radio play, the DJ refused, citing program directing protocols. Melcher recalled: \"Brian almost fainted! It was all over. He'd been holding onto the record [and] had astrologers figuring out the correct moment. It really killed him. Finally they played it, but only after a few calls to the program director or someone, who screamed, 'Put it on, you idiot!' But the damage to Brian had already been done.\" \"Heroes and Villains\" was among the most highly publicized singles in the history of rock music. Issued on July 24, it was the first release on the Beach Boys' Brother Records and failed to match the commercial success of \"Good Vibrations\" by a considerable degree. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 81 on August 6, peaked at number 12 around September 4, and dropped off the charts one week later. In Britain, the single was issued on August 18 and reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart. Filmmaker Peter Clifton compiled a music video of \"Heroes and Villains\" set to footage of surfers riding waves for the BBC. The clip aired on the network's Top of the Pops on August 31. On September 2, the BBC hired a film crew to shoot an official music video of the song that featured the group at Brian's home. The film was scheduled to air on Top of the Pops around September 21 but was later scrapped. On September 18, Smiley Smile was released with \"Heroes and Villains\" as the opening track. It was one of the album's two elaborately-produced tracks (the other being \"Good Vibrations\")."

David Anderle later said that whatever new fans the group had brought with Pet Sounds were \"immediately lost with the release of 'Heroes of Villains.'\" In reference to the song, Jimi Hendrix told Disc & Music Echo: \"Don\u2019t particularly like the Beach Boys. Makes me think of a psychedelic barbershop quartet!\"  Billboard reviewed it as \"clever off-beat rock material with an arrangement that encompasses barbershop harmony and jazz!\"  Cash Box called it a \"creatively delivered conglomeration of sounds that run the gamut from amusement park hooplah to barbershop harmony\" and said that the lyrics \"pose some interesting questions.\" Bruce Johnston witnessed the record's debut at The Speakeasy Club in London. He recalled, \"Everyone really got up to dance. But when the tempo changed, I knew we'd blown it with that record.\" Among British reviewers, Disc & Music Echos Penny Valentine lamented that while she appreciated certain aspects of the song on repeated listens, \"the record as a whole ... is disappointing. ... one has, perhaps, just come to expect too much from the Beach Boys. And this isn't it!\" In his review for Melody Maker, Nick Jones praised the song as \"another masterpiece of production from Wilson and another move in his flowery progression.\" New Music Reviews critic described the song as \"weirdly fascinating\". In an editorial published in December, Rolling Stone founding editor Jann Wenner referred to the song as \"pointless\" and a weak follow-up to \"Good Vibrations\". Music journalist Jules Siegel, who was present throughout the Smile sessions, reported in Cheetah that while it seemed like \"the Beatles had outdistanced the Beach Boys\" during the previous summer, \"some people think ['Heroes and Villains'] is better than anything the Beatles ever wrote.\" At the end of the year, French radio listeners selected \"Heroes and Villains\" as the \"Record of the Year\"."

        "title": "Heroes and Villains_Retrospective assessments",
        "content": "Despite its relatively high chart placement, \"Heroes and Villains\" remains one of the lesser-known songs in the Beach Boys' catalog. It was one of the last Beach Boys singles to break the US top 20 until \"Rock and Roll Music\" in 1976. Jardine told an interviewer that Parks felt his contributions destroyed the band's commercial momentum: \"Y\u2019know, he actually apologized to me - for 'ruining my career.' I said, 'Van Dyke, not only did you not ruin it but you enhanced it!  You enhanced our knowledge just by being there.\" Wilson's bandmates did not feel that his final edit was as good as his earlier versions, and according to biographer David Leaf, \"all those who heard the original\" believed that the released version was missing crucial sequences that Wilson originally intended for the song. Jardine expressed dissatisfaction with the mix, describing it as \"a pale facsimile\" of Wilson's original vision, and suggested that Wilson deliberately sabotaged the song at the last minute. He blamed the record's lack of \"sonic energy\" on the limited recording equipment and felt that the mastering was probably engineered improperly, commenting, \"I could hear the difference. I could hear the edge was gone.\"  Parks was not involved with the making of the final edit and later said that he was \"astonished\" by its structure and production quality when he heard it on the radio. Howard opined that the song was \"more fractured\" and \"arguably more inspired\" than \"Good Vibrations\", likening it to a \"pocket opera\" (a reference to the term \"pocket symphony\").  Eric Luecking of NPR said that while \"Heroes and Villains\" was more adventurous than \"Good Vibrations\", listeners could not relate to the song's lyrics, which obscured the single's legacy. Academic Larry Starr explained that the Wild West-themed subject matter \"lacked any context whatsoever in the cultural environment of popular music in 1967, an environment immersed in the emerging counterculture and one that tended to prize lyrics with marked personal or social 'relevance.'\" Doggett felt that while the song was \"beautiful and intriguing\", it was \"nowhere near as commercial as 'Good Vibrations'.\" Some commentators blame the shifts in contemporary pop culture for the record's failure. Starr disputed the suggestion; instead, the song's \"relatively limited appeal may be ascribed to two factors that remained problematic, or sometimes even disappointing, in the Beach Boys\u2019 output for the remaining years of the 1960s: the lyrics, and the production values.\"  Considering the rich orchestrations of Pet Sounds, Starr concluded that \"the source of biggest disappointment for listeners, however, may well have been the overall quality of the sound.\"  Stebbins said that while the arrangement was \"generously filled with fantastic Beach Boys vocal harmonies and genius musical twists and turns\", the record's \"disturbingly muddy sound quality ... undoubtedly hurt its commercial appeal.\""

        "content": "\"Heroes and Villains\" is also cited as a factor in Wilson's professional and psychological decline. Badman stated that the dismal reception was the direct cause of Wilson's withdrawal from the public eye, while Howard offered that the pressure to follow up \"Good Vibrations\" with \"an equally ingenious hit\" likely contributed to the collapse of the Smile project. Doggett called the \"saga\" of the song's recording a \"microcosm of the entire Smile tragi-comedy\". Jack Rieley, who managed the band in the early 1970s, stated that the failure of the single \"shook him to the foundations of his being and self-respect. ... this is when he started disappearing into his bedroom for a long time. This is when he ate himself into a state where he became horrendously fat.\" Marilyn said that Brian did not perform the song for anybody in the years following its release. In the 1998 documentary Endless Harmony, Love referred to \"Heroes and Villains\" as the last dynamic moment in Wilson's music. Journalist David Bennun concurred, \"In a way, Love is right. Brian Wilson would never again generate something as thrilling as Heroes And Villains, or any of the other, numerous, breathtaking tracks he had constructed for the band in their so far brief career.\" Darian Sahanaja, a member of Wilson's supporting band since the 1990s, said that, \"When I first met Brian, you couldn't even mention the words 'Heroes and Villains'; he\u2019d turn around and walk away or he\u2019d say, 'I don\u2019t want to talk about it.'\" Journalist Paul Lester reported in 1998 that Wilson referred to the voices in his head as \"heroes and villains\"."

        "content": "Before the release of Smiley Smile, the Beach Boys attempted to make a live album known as Lei'd in Hawaii. Due to technical difficulties, they decided to record the album at Wally Heider Studios on September 11, a session which included a runthrough of \"Heroes and Villains\". A surviving audio tape of this performance features an overdubbed spoken-word monologue, given by Mike Love, in which he ridicules the song. Carlin writes that the track was likely not intended for release as Love's rant shifts from \"mock-serious to bitterly sarcastic\" and \"becomes even more barbed as he goes on\". He surmised that another laughing voice in the audio belonged to Wilson, and that Wilson may have coordinated the recording himself. The 2017 compilation 1967 \u2013 Sunshine Tomorrow includes this version of \"Heroes and Villains\", albeit with Love's monologue omitted. The band's concerts in Hawaii marked the last time Wilson sang \"Heroes and Villains\" before a public audience until 2001, when he performed the song at a Radio City Music Hall tribute concert held in his honor."

In this version, the discarded \"Cantina\" section was restored in \"Heroes and Villains\". Sahanaja recalled that the group had \"already been performing a version of the song that incorporated the 'Cantina' section, and so Brian wanted to go with that structure for the recording.\" An instrumental arrangement of \"Cantina\", written by Sahanaja, was added as an introduction to \"I'm in Great Shape\", the song which begins the album's third movement. This time, the \"explosion\" tape delay effect was created with a digital plug-in. According to Sahanaja, the placement of \"I'm in Great Shape\" in the running order \"was probably a performance decision. I always felt that this song building into a feedback frenzy and breaking into 'I Wanna Be Around' and 'Workshop\u201d was the disoriented, reality defying portion of the performance.

Asked about this change, Sahanaja responded: \"the tape session research shows that ['I'm in Great Shape'] was definitely part of the 'Heroes and Villains' variations, and so the decision [with The Smile Sessions] was to keep it within that context.\" The box set edition was packaged with two 7-inch vinyl records, one of which was a two-part edit of \"Heroes and Villains\" stretched across both sides. The edit was created by compilers Mark Linett and Alan Boyd. Prior to the release of The Smile Sessions, in 1990, the \"Cantina\" mix was included on a \"two-fer\" reissue of Smiley Smile and Wild Honey. Many unreleased sections of the song were also compiled for the 1993 box set Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of the Beach Boys."

The master tapes were lost shortly after the release of the original album and all subsequent CD releases were mastered from the original poor quality green vinyl pressing. This partly accounts for the somewhat muddy sound of the album. Pop appeared as himself, performing the album's title track, on the \"For Cryin' Out Loud\" episode of the Tales from the Crypt TV series, aired on May 22, 1990.

Richard offered the band a chance to perform for Drive-Thru Records and subsequently invited his sister, and co-label owner, Stefanie Reines to the performance. The pair were impressed by the performance and signed Finch afterwards. Pre-production and demos were done at DML Studios in Escondido, California, in February and April 2001. Finch began recording What It Is to Burn in June of that year at Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, California, with producer Mark Trombino. The band started tracking guitars for the album in July 2001.

The album received comparisons to the music of Glassjaw, New Found Glory, Linkin Park, and Blink-182. Barcalow switches between crooning and screaming on What It Is to Burn; though he has a pop punk-inspired vocal delivery, his screams were compared to the likes of Palumbo and Deftones frontman Chino Moreno. The writing process revolved around Finch jamming. Linares said they could sometimes write a song in two hours, and at other times take a whole day. Collectively, Strohmeyer said it took a year to write all the material on the album. The opening track, \"New Beginnings\", begins with a distorted guitar fading in, before the song shifts to aggressive power chords and octave parts. The song sets the tone for What It Is to Burn with its memorable melodies and tuneful choruses. Barcalow's vocals on \"Letters to You\" border on near-screamo in places. Despite the track having three-part harmonies, it was written when the only members in the band who could sing were Barcalow and Strohmeyer. Palumbo's singing voice on \"Grey Matter\" recalled Bad Brains frontman H.R. \"Awake\" was one of Finch's oldest songs, which Barcalow said is about a couple resolving an argument. \"Project Mayhem\" initially existed as a two-minute track, before Trombino altered it into the final version, and incorporated programming. \"Ender\" begins with a subdued intro that steadily coalesces by the third minute, when it progresses with a constant piano part, and ends with an ambient instrumental section. \"What It Is to Burn\" is written from the perspective of a man in hell sending a letter to his partner."

Brown, who also did the photography with Kris McCaddon. Initial pressings of the album contained a demo version of \"What It Is to Burn\", produced by Chris Fuderich. The demo was replaced on the later pressings with a re-recorded version, produced by Trombino. The United Kingdom edition, released on June 2, 2002, included an acoustic version of \"Letters to You\" and the \"What It Is to Burn\" demo as bonus tracks. Finch filmed a new music video for \"Letters to You\" in mid-April 2002, in a hostel basement in Hollywood. It was directed by Richard Reines and Brad Scott. The video premiered on Refused TV on May 24, 2002. Around the end of 2002, the band signed to MCA Records. MCA had a distribution deal that allowed them to acquire Drive-Thru Records' bands over time. It was aided by the assistance of Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge of Blink-182, who had signed Finch to their management company, as they contacted the label about signing them. In January 2003, \"What It Is to Burn\" was released to radio stations across the United States as the lead single from What Is It to Burn, and a music video was filmed for the track, which was directed by director Alexander Kosta. The video was posted online on February 12, 2003. In March of that year, Punknews.org held a contest where fans could win a copy of the album on vinyl. On April 22, 2003, \"Letters to You\" was released on CD as What Is It to Burns second single. Two versions of the CD single were released: the first with \"Worms of the Earth\" and \"New Kid\" as extra tracks, and the second with live versions of \"Perfection Through Silence\" and \"Letters to You\" as bonus tracks. Following this, \"New Beginnings\" and \"What It Is to Burn\" were released on a double A-sided as the album's third and final single on August 25, 2003."

        "content": "What It Is to Burn was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Jason D. Taylor opened his piece by calling the album \"phenomenal,\" noting that Finch rode the \"thin line\" between hardcore punk and pop punk, preserving a \"trademark sound that stands out from the crowd.\" He also wrote that the album \"exemplifies everything that is right in the punk scene\", citing its emotional vulnerability, the \"agonizing fury of hardcore\" and the positive \"tones of pop-punk.\" Amy Sciarretto of CMJ New Music Report was impressed with the band's ability to not be pigeon-holed into one specific sound, observing that the album showcases their \"delicious blend of infection and perky rock,\" incorporating Glassjaw, Thursday and Jimmy Eat World \"into a potent Molotov cocktail.\" Drowned in Sound writer Peter White referred to What It Is to Burn as an \"absolutely gut smokingly fantastic record.\" FasterLouder Roby Anson described it as an \"album of sadness, gladness, big chunky guitar riffs, smart chord progressions and a rhythm section that chugs along nicely in each song.\" LAS Magazine writer Andy Vaughn noted the Glassjaw influence added \"a great deal of intensity\" to the album, which he felt \"would be missing otherwise.\" He commended Finch for making an \"extremely strong debut.\" Melodic webmaster Johan Wippsson said the album has \"the perfect mix of good melodies with the extra edge,\" and complimented Trominbo's \"great\" production style. He lauded the \"very consistent\" nature of the tracks, \"which are on a very high level all the time.\" The team from Ultimate Guitar hailed the album, saying it \"kicks so much ass\" and lacks any skippable tracks. Sputnikmusic emeritus Ryan Flatley praised \"Grey Matter\" and \"Project Mayhem\" for their energy, but said that the album turned out to be a bit of a disappointment due to the large amount of hype surrounding its release. Exclaim! Amber Authier commented that Finch \"doesn't do a bad job\" of merging punk rock and metal together. However, she felt that the lyrical content on What It Is to Burn came across as a \"little too deep, separating the two styles instead of blending them into something a little different.\" Lina Lecaro of the Los Angeles Times said the band bounced \"between soothing croons and throat-burning wails, metallic riffs and bubbly beats,\" a fusion that \"kept things interesting\u00a0... even if the shifts weren't always seamless.\" While Barcalow \"proved himself to be a versatile vocalist on tunes\u00a0... his range didn't quite make up for his lack of charisma,\" Lecaro added. Kerrang! reviewer Paul Travers criticized the titles of the songs on the album, saying that Finch were \"in need of a good slap\u00a0... you can almost taste the salty tang of tears spilling out of the speakers.\""

It charted at number 177 on the UK Albums Chart, while \"Letters to You\" reached number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. \"What It Is to Burn\" peaked at number 15 on the US Alternative Songs chart and number 35 on the Mainstream Rock chart. By October 2007, What It Is to Burn had sold over 400,000 copies worldwide. Metal Hammer ranked the album at number 17 on their best albums of 2002 list. Loudwire included \"What It Is to Burn\" at number 47 on their list of the best hard rock songs of the 21st century. Shezhaad Jiwani of Chart Attack said What It Is to Burn was one of emo's landmark releases, noting it for leading the genre alongside albums by Glassjaw and the Used. In 2013, Finch celebrated the album's 10th anniversary by performing it in its entirety. The celebration was initially intended for one show, before being expanded to two US tours, a European tour, and performances in Japan and Australia. Independent label Tragic Hero Records released a live video album of the anniversary celebrations in January 2014. What It Is to Burn has been a massive influence on Saosin's Saosin (2006), Young Guns' All Our Kings Are Dead (2010), A Day to Remember's What Separates Me from You (2010), D.R.U.G.S.'s D.R.U.G.S. (2011), and the Amity Affliction's Chasing Ghosts (2012). Alternative Press said the title-track was \"one of the landmark moments\" for the post-hardcore genre. Sleeping with Sirens frontman Kellin Quinn singled out Finch's mix of screaming and singing vocal parts on the song as an influence on him. Equally, Jeremy McKinnon said the album is the reason A Day to Remember formed."

It was released on June 22, 1979, by Reprise Records. Most of the album was recorded live, then overdubbed in the studio, while others originated in the studio. Young used the phrase \"rust never sleeps\" as a concept for his tour with Crazy Horse to avoid artistic complacency and try more progressive, theatrical approaches to performing live."

        "content": "The album was recorded in 1978 during the lengthy \"Rust Never Sleeps\" tour, in which Young played a wealth of new material. The concert tour was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of guitar playing, were influenced by the punk rock zeitgeist of the late 1970s and, provided a stark contrast from Young's previous, folk-inspired album Comes a Time. Two new songs, the acoustic \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\" and electric \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" were the centerpiece of the new material. The solo portions of the album including, \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\", \"Thrasher\" and \"Ride My Llama\" were recorded live in San Francisco at the Boarding House between May 24 and May 28, 1978. Two songs from the album were not recorded live: \"Sail Away\" was recorded without Crazy Horse during or after the Comes a Time recording sessions,  and \"Pocahontas\" had been recorded solo in 1976 (original recording without overdubs was released in 2017 on archival release Hitchhiker). After his final performance at the Boarding House on May 28, Young collaborated with the art punk band Devo on a cacophonous version of \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" at the Different Fur studio in San Francisco and, would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse. During the Different Fur studio session, Devo vocalist Mark Mothersbaugh added the lyrics \"Rust never sleeps\", a slogan he remembered from his graphic arts career promoting the automobile rust proofing product Rust-Oleum. Young adopted the line and used it in his Crazy Horse version of the song, as well as for the title of his album. The lyrics, \"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics. The electric sets were recorded during the Neil Young/Crazy Horse tour in late 1978, with overdubs added later. Audience noise is removed as much as possible, although it is clearly audible at certain points, most noticeably on the opening and closing songs."

        "content": "Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1979, Robert Christgau called Rust Never Sleeps Young's best album yet and said although his melodies are unsurprisingly simple and original, his lyrics are surprisingly and offhandedly complex. \"He's wiser but not wearier\", Christgau wrote, \"victor so far over the slow burnout his title warns of\". Paul Nelson, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, found its first side virtuosic because of how Young transcends the songs' acoustic settings with his commanding performance and was impressed by its themes of personal escape and exhaustion, the role of rock music, and American violence: \"Rust Never Sleeps tells me more about my life, my country and rock & roll than any music I've heard in years.\" Rust Never Sleeps was voted the second best album of 1979 in The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it second on his own list for the poll, as did fellow critic Greil Marcus. The album also won Rolling Stone magazine's 1979 critics poll for Album of the Year. In a decade-end list for The Village Voice, Christgau named it the ninth best album of the 1970s. In 2000, Rust Never Sleeps was voted number 240 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums book. In 2003, it was ranked number 350 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone re-ranked the album at 351 in the list's 2012 edition, and later at number 296 in the 2020 edition. In a retrospective review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that the acoustic and electric sides were both astounding. AllMusic's William Ruhlmann viewed that Young reinvigorated himself artistically by being imaginative and bold, and in the process created an exemplary album that \"encapsulated his many styles on a single disc with great songs \u2014 in particular the remarkable 'Powderfinger' \u2014 unlike any he had written before.\" Rob Sheffield, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), felt that \"Powderfinger\", \"Pocahontas\", \"Thrasher\", and \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" were among Young's greatest songs."

A distressed Emily swears off taking in any more tramps, to the delight of the rest of the family. However, later in the morning, Wade Rawlins (Brian Aherne) appears at the Kilbourne's doorstep. His ramshackle car had broken down; when he got out, it rolled off a cliff. He wants to use the telephone, but is instead immediately adopted by Emily Kilbourne and appointed as the replacement chauffeur, despite the rude efforts of Grosvenor and Emily's daughters Geraldine \"Jerry\" (Constance Bennett) and Marion (Bonita Granville). Further attempts to convince Mrs. Kilbourne to get rid of this latest tramp are blissfully ignored. Rawlins, as the new chauffeur is housed in the servant's quarters. He is overheard talking to himself while cleaning up by Grosvenor and suspected to be crazy. Jerry and Marion see the spruced up tramp looking the perfect gentleman and Jerry approves when Rawlins later brushes off Jerry's arrogant would-be suitor, Herbert Wheeler (Phillip Reed). They now have second thoughts when their father, Henry Kilbourne (Clarence Kolb), who has returned from work, tells Emily that he is putting his foot down and orders that they get rid of her latest tramp the next day. A comedy of errors, nighttime interludes with drunken family behavior, the arrogant Herbert making a move on Jerry, follows with the rescue of the damsel in distress who has also somehow misplaced her keys where some delightful flirting ensues, resulting in Jerry falling in love with Wade. Marion also expresses a crush on Wade. The next day, Emily Kilbourne, despite orders to get rid of Wade, trains him to be a footman at the important dinner party that evening for Senator Harlan (Paul Everton). That evening, through a contrived prank by Marion, Rawlins is accidentally invited to the important dinner party for Senator Harlan, who takes quite a liking to him, as does his daughter Minerva (Ann Dvorak). The next morning, the family finds Rawlins occupying the guest room. It is impossible to throw him out, as it is discovered that he is now a confidant of Senator Harlan and his daughter's target of affection. Jerry is consumed with jealousy, as she sees Minerva flirting with Rawlins at golf later that morning. After a fudge-making spat with Jerry, Rawlins takes the rest of the day off on an errand. The car he wrecked turns out to be a loan. He goes to pay for it, but the car has been found and the police inform the car's owner that Rawlins is assumed to be dead. The man leaves to identify his car. Thus, when Rawlins arrives, the owner's assistant George (Willie Best) thinks he is a ghost. The Kilbournes believe Rawlins has left for good, much to Jerry's dismay after waiting up to reconcile with him. The next morning at breakfast, the newspaper reports the death of E. Wade Rawlins, the \"noted novelist\", from a car crash, much to the shock and dismay of the family, the cook and the maid. When Rawlins reappears, very much alive, Jerry is immensely relieved."

Released on the Gordy (Motown) label, and produced by Norman Whitfield, it features on the group's 1971 album, Sky's the Limit. When released as a single, \"Just My Imagination\" became the third Temptations song to reach number 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The single held the number 1 position on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart for two weeks in 1971, from March 27 to April 10. \"Just My Imagination\" also held the number one spot on the Billboard R&B Singles chart for three weeks, from February 27 to March 20 of that year. Today, \"Just My Imagination\" is considered one of the Temptations' signature songs, and is notable for recalling the sound of the group's 1960s recordings. It is also the final Temptations single to feature founding members Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. During the process of recording and releasing the single, Kendricks left the group to begin a solo career, while the ailing Williams was forced to retire from the act for health reasons. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine listed \"Just My Imagination\" as number 389 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The song was covered by the Rolling Stones on their Some Girls album in 1978."

Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of allmusic notes that the song is narrated by a man who imagines a relationship with the woman he loves, is canny enough to realize that his daydreams are fiction, yet is overwhelmed by them. The lyrics capture his resignation to his fantasies. The song as a whole captures their full emotional effect on him.  The first two verses establish the theme and explore the narrator's daydreams, in which he and the object of his affections are lovers preparing to be married, to \"raise a family\" and build \"a cozy little home / out in the country / with two children, maybe three\". In the bridge, the narrator prays that he will never lose her love to another, or he will \"surely die\". By introducing this doubt, the musical bridge simultaneously connects the movement from dream to reality, completed when the final lines shift from imagery to bald statement: \"But in reality / she doesn't even know me\". For Erlewine, \"the Temptations' performance has a dream-like quality, quietly drifting through the singer's hopes and desires.\""

        "content": "During the late 1960s and early 1970s, producer/composer Norman Whitfield and lyricist Barrett Strong crafted a string of \"psychedelic soul\" tracks for the Temptations. By 1970, the Temptations had released psychedelically influenced hits such as \"Runaway Child, Running Wild\", \"Psychedelic Shack\", \"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)\", and the Grammy Award-winning \"Cloud Nine\". In a 1991 interview, Eddie Kendricks recalled that many of the Temptations' fans were \"screaming bloody murder\" after the group delved into psychedelia, and demanded a return to their original soul sound. \"Just My Imagination\" was the result of one of the few times that Whitfield relented and produced a ballad as a single for the group. Whitfield and Strong wrote the song in 1969, but with the Temptations' psychedelic soul singles consistently keeping them in the US Top 20, Whitfield and Strong decided to shelve the composition and wait for the right time to record it. In late 1970, the Temptations' single \"Ungena Za Ulimwengu (Unite the World)\", a psychedelic soul song about world peace, failed to reach the Top 30, and Whitfield decided to record and release \"Just My Imagination\" as the next single. He approached Barrett Strong, and asked him to pull out \"that song we were messing around with a year ago... because I'm going to record it today.\" Except for their late 1960s duets with Diana Ross & the Supremes, the Temptations had not released a single that was not based in psychedelia since \"Please Return Your Love to Me\" from The Temptations Wish It Would Rain in 1968."

        "content": "Norman Whitfield began the recording of \"Just My Imagination\" by preparing the song's instrumental track. Whitfield arranged and recorded the non-orchestral elements of the instrumental with Motown's studio band, The Funk Brothers, who for this recording included Eddie Willis and Dennis Coffey on guitar, Jack Ashford on marimba, Jack Brokensha on timpani, Andrew Smith on drums, and Bob Babbitt on bass. Jerry Long, an arranger who had previous experience with scoring films in Paris, worked on the orchestral arrangement and conducted several members of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in performing the horns and strings for the recording. The Temptations had heard the Funk Brothers' tracks and loved them, but were \"totally knocked out\", according to Otis Williams, when they heard \"the finished record with all the strings\". The Temptations added their vocals at Motown's Hitsville USA headquarters. While all five Temptations usually sang lead on singles during the psychedelic soul era, \"Just My Imagination\" is primarily a showcase for Eddie Kendricks, who sang lead on such Temptations hits as \"Get Ready,\" \"The Way You Do the Things You Do,\" and \"You're My Everything\"; in fact, this is the only Temptations hit in which Dennis Edwards did not have a lead vocal during his entire tenure with the group. The Temptations remained at Hitsville overnight recording \"Just My Imagination,\" and while the other four members went home at six o'clock in the morning, Kendricks remained in the studio, spending several additional hours recording takes for his lead vocal. The song was recorded in the midst of a bitter feud between Kendricks and the Temptations' de facto leader, Otis Williams. Dissatisfied and frustrated with Williams' leadership, Kendricks began to withdraw from the group, and picked several fights with either Williams or his best friend, bass singer Melvin Franklin. When Kendricks told his friend ex-Temptation David Ruffin about his problems in the group, Ruffin convinced Kendricks that he should begin a solo career. After a final altercation during a November 1970 Copacabana engagement, both Kendricks and Williams agreed that it would be best for Kendricks to leave the group. By the time \"Just My Imagination\" was recorded, Williams and Kendricks were no longer on friendly speaking terms. Nevertheless, Williams was impressed by Kendricks' performance on the recording, and in his 1988 Temptations biography referred to \"Just My Imagination\" as \"Eddie's finest moment\". Paul Williams, the Temptations' original lead singer and Kendricks' lifelong best friend, who sings the first line in the bridge (\"Every night, on my knees, I pray...\"), had suffered for three years from health problems related to alcoholism and sickle-cell disease. By the time \"Just My Imagination\" was cut, Paul Williams' contributions to the Temptations' recordings had been reduced, and the group had Otis Williams' old associate Richard Street lined up as Paul Williams' replacement. As for Kendricks, he was eventually replaced by Damon Harris, who would be featured in the group's 1972 hit \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\"."

Eddie had really changed. Paul was on his last legs. Watch the clip of us doing the song on Ed Sullivan we're not together. Eddie is off by himself. There was no more group. Sure enough, when we played the Copa that week, Eddie left between shows. He didn't come back. Cash Box described the song as The Temptations' \"softest single performance in recent time,\" stating that it is \"exceptional material for markets that generally overlook the team's material.\" On February 7, 1971, \"Just My Imagination\" entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 71 and later number one on both the Hot 100 and the U.S. Billboard R&B Singles charts. It also became the group's first entry on the Adult Contemporary chart, reaching number 33; the group would not return to that chart until 1984. The single was included along with \"Unite the World\" on the Temptations' ninth regular studio album, Sky's the Limit, which included the final Temptations recordings to feature Eddie Kendricks. He began working on his solo album All By Myself shortly before officially leaving the group. The intended follow-up to \"Just My Imagination\" was \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\", on which Kendricks sang lead. When Kendricks left, they released, instead, \"I'm the Exception to the Rule\", a song in the same vein (featuring Kendricks, Otis Williams and Edwards on lead) which follows \"Just My Imagination\" on the album. Unable to promote the song because they did not have anyone to do his parts in concert, the song failed miserably so the company pushed the \"B-side\" \u2013 the group's re-recording of \"It's Summer\", initially the B-side of \"Ball of Confusion\", at the last-minute, and Norman Whitfield had The Undisputed Truth record \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\", for whom it was a major hit. The Temptations and Norman Whitfield returned to psychedelic soul for their next album, Solid Rock, whose second single, \"Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)\", was written by Whitfield and Barrett Strong as an alleged criticism of both Kendricks and David Ruffin."

Issued at the height of the band's popularity, it reached the top spot on the US album chart\u2014the band's fourth consecutive album to do so\u2014and peaked at number 2 on the UK album chart. Both singles from the album also reached the top 5 of the UK and US singles charts, with \"Silly Love Songs\" reaching number 1 in the US. The album was recorded and released in the midst of Wings' highly successful Wings Over the World tour, with songs from the album performed on the tour after its release. Subsequently, performances of \"Let 'Em In\", \"Time to Hide\", 'Silly Love Songs' and \"Beware My Love\" were included on the live album Wings over America, released in December 1976. The album, after the 2010 CD version, was again remastered in 2014 with further improved audio quality. As a reaction to critics who believed Wings was merely a vehicle for Paul McCartney, the album featured every member of the band taking lead vocals on at least one song, and two songs from the album are written or co-written by band members other than the McCartneys."

It was the first time McCartney had fully recorded an album in England since Red Rose Speedway. Because of the tour commitments, Wings were not afforded the opportunity to record in another locale. By the end of February, the album was complete, and Wings went back on the road. Around the time of the studio sessions for Wings at the Speed of Sound, Wings were facing criticism for being merely a vehicle for McCartney. He encouraged each of the band members to contribute a song during the sessions. McCartney had previously attempted to create a democratic album in Red Rose Speedway, though it would be rejected by his record label. Engineer Peter Henderson later commented, \"I remember one of my first engineering jobs, working with Paul McCartney on Wings at the Speed of Sound \u2014 he'd do two vocal takes and ask, 'Which is the better one?' And when he played guitar, he'd really lean into it and give it everything he got.\" Two tracks (\"The Note You Never Wrote\" and \"Warm and Beautiful\") were arranged by Fiachra Trench."

The introduction, \"Let 'Em In\" was perceived as an invitation to join the McCartneys on this fantasy day, with explanation of their philosophy (\"Silly Love Songs\"), a lunch break (\"Cook of the House\"), and a chance to get to know McCartney's friends (Denny Laine in \"The Note You Never Wrote\", Jimmy McCulloch in \"Wino Junko\", etc.). The album reached number 2 in the United Kingdom (and was the 4th best-selling album of 1976). It became McCartney's most successful American chart album since his days in The Beatles, spending seven nonconsecutive weeks at number 1 throughout the summer (and blocking the new Beatles compilation Rock 'n' Roll Music, which reached number 2). Wings at the Speed of Sound sold 3.5 million copies worldwide. Much of the album's success can be attributed to its two smash singles. \"Silly Love Songs\", a response to his critics and one of McCartney's biggest hits, followed the album in April, and became one of 1976's biggest-selling singles. This was followed in July with \"Let 'Em In\", which also scaled the singles charts. Amid all this, Wings finally went to North America for the Wings Over America Tour, playing McCartney's first shows there in ten years (after the Beatles' final tour of America in 1966) to euphoric reaction; four selections from Speed of Sound were included in the tour setlist. Denny Laine covered \"Time to Hide\" and \"The Note You Never Wrote\" in 1996 on his album Wings at the Sound of Denny Laine."

        "content": "Thunderbirds Are Go is a 1966 British science-fiction puppet film based on Thunderbirds, a Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and produced by their company Century 21 Productions. Written by the Andersons and directed by David Lane, Thunderbirds Are Go concerns spacecraft Zero-X and its human mission to Mars. When Zero-X suffers a malfunction during re-entry, it is up to life-saving organisation International Rescue, supported by its technologically-advanced Thunderbird machines, to activate the trapped crew's escape pod before the spacecraft hits the ground. Filmed between March and June 1966 at Century 21's studios on the Slough Trading Estate and on location in Portugal, Thunderbirds Are Go features guest appearances by puppet versions of Cliff Richard and The Shadows, who also contributed to the film's score. It was the first film to be shot using an early form of video assist called \"Add-a-Vision\". The film's special effects sequences, directed by Derek Meddings, took six months to complete. Although early reviews praised the film as a successful cinematic transfer of the TV series, Thunderbirds Are Go drew a lukewarm public response and proved to be a box office failure. Later reviews would criticise the film for its minimal characterisation, lengthy effects shots, and inclusion of a fantasy dream sequence centring on Richard and The Shadows. Surprised by the film's underperformance and confident that Thunderbirds still had big-screen potential, distributors United Artists ordered a sequel, Thunderbird 6. However, this too received a mediocre critical and commercial response and caused the franchise to be abandoned until the early 2000s. Zero-X later appeared in the first episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, the Andersons' follow-up to Thunderbirds, while tie-in publication TV Century 21 ran a Zero-X comic strip until 1969."

        "content": "In 2065, the first human mission to Mars is launched from Glenn Field in the form of the spacecraft Zero-X. Unknown to Captain Travers and his four-man crew, master criminal the Hood has stowed away on board to photograph Zero-Xs wing mechanism. Shortly after lift-off, the Hood inadvertently traps his foot in the craft's hydraulics, jamming them and causing Zero-X to go out of control. As the astronauts eject in the escape pod, the Hood extracts his crushed foot and parachutes to safety from the undercarriage. Zero-X crashes into the ocean and explodes. In 2067, the Inquiry Board of the Space Exploration Center concludes that Zero-X was sabotaged. Meanwhile, a second Zero-X has been built and another mission to Mars planned. International Rescue agrees to provide security at the launch given the possibility of further sabotage. Jeff Tracy dispatches Scott to Glenn Field in Thunderbird 1 to monitor the situation from the ground, while Virgil and Alan are assigned to escort Zero-X through the atmosphere in Thunderbirds 2 and 3. Posing as a reporter at the pre-launch press conference, Lady Penelope arranges for each member of the crew to wear a St Christopher brooch with a concealed homing device. On launch day, Dr Grant's device is no longer registering, even though Grant is on board Zero-X awaiting lift-off. Scott unmasks \"Grant\" as the Hood in disguise. The Hood flees Glenn Field in a car, pursued by Penelope and Parker in FAB 1. Reaching the coast, he transfers to a speedboat and then a helicopter. Parker shoots down the helicopter with FAB 1's machine gun. Meanwhile, the kidnapped Grant is found and returned to Zero-X and the spacecraft is launched without further incident. Mission complete, Penelope invites Scott and Virgil to join her at popular nightclub The Swinging Star. Returning to Tracy Island, Alan feels unappreciated when Jeff insists that he stay at base while the others spend the night partying. Asleep in bed, Alan has a surreal dream in which he and Penelope travel to another Swinging Star located in space. Appearing at the nightclub are Cliff Richard Jr and The Shadows, who perform a song called \"Shooting Star\" and an instrumental called \"Lady Penelope\". The dream ends when Alan falls out of The Swinging Star and back to Earth, waking to discover that he has merely fallen out of bed. After a six-week flight, Zero-X reaches Mars on 22 July and all of the astronauts except Space Navigator Newman touch down on the planet in their lander, the Martian Excursion Vehicle (MEV). Investigating the surface, the men are puzzled to find strange, coil-like rock formations. Space Captain Martin destroys one of the structures with the MEV's gun and Dr Pierce prepares to go outside to collect samples. The other structures come to life, revealing themselves to be one-eyed rock snakes. The aliens bombard the MEV with fireballs from their mouths, forcing the astronauts to take off prematurely. Docking with Newman in orbit, they start back to Earth. As Zero-X re-enters Earth's atmosphere on 2 September, a lifting body fails to connect with the spacecraft and damages various systems, including flight control and the escape pod circuit. With the astronauts unable to eject and Zero-X set to impact Craigsville, Florida, Jeff launches Scott and Brains in Thunderbird 1 and Virgil, Alan and Gordon in Thunderbird 2. Craigsville is evacuated. Lifted into Zero-Xs undercarriage, Alan repairs the escape circuit under Brains' guidance. Seconds before impact, Alan completes his task and jumps out as the astronauts eject. The empty Zero-X crashes into Craigsville. Picked up by Penelope and Parker in FAB1, Alan is driven to the real Swinging Star where Penelope, joined by the Tracy family, Brains and Tin-Tin, toast Alan as a hero."

        "content": "When filming on Series One of Thunderbirds ended in late 1965, Gerry Anderson and his financial backer, Lew Grade, agreed that a feature film would be the next logical step in expanding the Thunderbirds franchise. With United Artists contracted to distribute, a budget of \u00a3250,000 (about \u00a3 million in ) was set and Anderson and his wife, Sylvia, began work on the script at their second home in Portugal. The couple decided to base the film on the American-Soviet \"Space Race\" \u2013 in particular the race to land astronauts on the Moon \u2013 but adapt this premise for the futuristic world of Thunderbirds by switching the location to Mars. During the pre-production of their next puppet series, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, they would write in a second appearance of the Zero-X as a link to Thunderbirds. Like Thunderbirds Are Go, Captain Scarlet depicts hostile life on Mars, though the Mysterons of the TV series pose a greater threat than the \"Rock Snakes\" of the film in that they strike at Earth itself. The rescue of Zero-X is similar to that of Fireflash in the Thunderbirds episode \"Operation Crash-Dive\". Frustrated with the limitations of the puppets and concerned that the TV series would not transfer well to the big screen, Alan Pattillo declined to direct the film. The role was instead given to 24-year-old David Lane, who had directed several of the TV episodes. This made Lane the UK's youngest film director at the time. The dream sequence set at The Swinging Star was spearheaded by Sylvia, who expanded it by scripting a musical interlude performed by puppet versions of Cliff Richard and The Shadows. Richard and Shadows band member Bruce Welch both owned homes in Portugal near the Andersons, and it was there that the two agreed to \"appear\" in the film as Supermarionation puppets. Having also agreed to contribute to the film's score, Richard and The Shadows recorded a song titled \"Shooting Star\" and an instrumental titled \"Lady Penelope\". Sylvia acknowledged that the dream sequence does not advance the plot, noting in her autobiography that it was \"sheer indulgence that would not have been possible on our television budget.\" Stephen La Rivi\u00e8re, author of Supermarionation: A History of the Future, regards the sequence as the strangest ever created for an Anderson production."

Wilkin would continue his association with the Andersons for several years, going on to voice supporting characters in Captain Scarlet, Joe 90 and The Secret Service and appear in the live-action productions Doppelg\u00e4nger, UFO and The Protectors. Paul Maxwell as Captain Paul Travers. Having previously voiced Steve Zodiac in Fireball XL5, Maxwell also provided uncredited guest character voices in Thunderbirds Series Two, and portrayed Captain Grey in Captain Scarlet. Alexander Davion as Space Captain Greg Martin. Davion later appeared in an episode of UFO. Bob Monkhouse as Space Navigator Brad Newman. Monkhouse would host the game show The Golden Shot from 1967 to 1972. The role of Newman was first given to Alfred Marks, who then withdrew due to a fee dispute. Monkhouse originally approached Gerry Anderson to ask his permission to film a comedy sketch parodying Stingray but ended up agreeing to replace Marks. Monkhouse recalled the conversation: \"[Anderson] said, 'How much would you charge for the job?' I said, 'Gerry, I'd do it for nothing.' And that was the first time I ever heard the phrase, 'the price is right'.\" He adopted an American accent for the film. Neil McCallum as Dr Ray Pierce. McCallum's later credits include appearances in Captain Scarlet, UFO and The Protectors. Charles Tingwell as Dr Tony Grant. Known for his role as Alan Dawson in the medical drama Emergency \u2013 Ward 10, Tingwell was approached by the Andersons on the recommendation of Ray Barrett. Like Paul Maxwell, he provided uncredited guest character voices in Thunderbirds Series Two, as well as providing voices in Captain Scarlet and making a guest appearance in UFO. Cliff Richard as Cliff Richard Jr. Cast in Portugal, where he owned a house \"next-door-but-one\" to the Andersons, Richard was \"thrilled\" to be involved in the film. He has fond memories of his Supermarionation puppet: \"It was quite a hoot\u00a0...

        "content": "Pre-production lasted three months and a 16-week shooting schedule was drawn up to coincide with the filming of Thunderbirds Series Two. Principal photography began on 3 March 1966 and ended in late June. The staff at AP Films were divided into \"A\" and \"B\" units: A to shoot the film and B the TV episodes. To accommodate its increased workload, APF bought two additional buildings near its site on the Slough Trading Estate, combining these with the pre-existing puppet workshop, art department building and publicity centre to form a production base of five buildings. Converted by January 1966, one of these former factory units contained puppet stages while the other incorporated a single large sound stage on which all of the film's model and effects work would be completed. Thunderbirds Are Go was filmed in Techniscope with a 2.35:1 widescreen aspect ratio. The possibility of using anamorphic lenses was rejected as depth of field problems made them unsuitable for effects shots. Techniscope, on the other hand, used spherical lenses but still produced a cinematic \"letterbox\" image. All APF productions up to this point had been filmed on Arriflex cameras, but for the film these were replaced with Mitchells. The film was the first to be shot using a video assist technology called the Livingston Electronic Viewfinder Unit. Also known as \"Add-a-Vision\", this system comprised a viewfinder that relayed images from the shooting camera to video monitors elsewhere in the studio. This allowed the crew to examine newly filmed footage live on set and in better quality than before. Add-a-Vision also helped the puppet operators, who were stationed on gantries several feet above the studio floor and could not easily monitor the puppets' movements. In addition, the system incorporated a playback function for viewing rushes. Based on German video assist technology, Add-A-Vision was developed by Thunderbirds director of photography John Read in collaboration with Prowest Electronics. To improve the look of the puppets, director David Lane often kept tops of heads and control wires out of shot and incorporated low-angle shots for dramatic effect. The background shots for Alan's rescue of the Zero-X crew were originally filmed on location in Portugal but were judged unsatisfactory and replaced with a painted backdrop created by associate producer Reg Hill. The location shoot also included filming a point-of-view \"spiral shot\" for the end of Alan's dream in which the character plunges back to Earth. To achieve this, a helicopter carried the crew to a height of about  above an island off the Portuguese coast, then the pilot allowed the aircraft to \"autogyro\" downwards while camera operator Alan Perry filmed the island looming up from below. However, this shot was also deemed inadequate and replaced with footage of a model version built at APF Studios in Slough."

        "content": "Promising Television Mail that Thunderbirds Are Go would be \"bigger and better than anything we have ever done before\", Gerry Anderson realised that any design flaws that showed up on the big screen would not be forgiven as quickly as those on TV. The puppets were therefore expertly revamped, with new paint, wigs and costumes. Models and sets were re-built from scratch with greater attention to detail. Over the course of the production, APF's puppet wardrobe was expanded to include more than 700 costumes, with 150 extra costumes made as spares. Some of the established characters, including Scott Tracy, were re-sculpted from the original puppets, while guest characters, such as the Zero-X crew, were entirely new creations. The guest character puppets of the TV series had had faces made of Plasticine that had been re-modelled for each appearance. This approach was largely abandoned for the film: as some of the puppets would be representing real-life celebrities, a decision was made to build most of the supporting characters in fibreglass to the same standards of workmanship as the main puppets. As with Scott Tracy, the puppet playing Captain Travers was modelled on Sean Connery. The film puppets had the same body proportions as their TV predecessors. As filming progressed, APF developed a new prototype puppet with an animatronic mouth to produce more realistic lip and jaw movement. However, the results proved unsatisfactory and the idea was abandoned. For its next TV series, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, APF would introduce a brand-new puppet design that used natural proportions, made possible by moving the internal lip-sync mechanism from the head to the chest. The puppets of the sequel film Thunderbird 6 were designed as a compromise between the two generations, with increased realism and less overt caricature."

Sets that Bell made for the film included the Glenn Field Control Tower and news conference room, the Swinging Star interiors, and re-designed versions of various locations on Tracy Island. The set design for the Space Exploration Center conference room was heavily influenced by producer Sylvia Anderson, who insisted on a tangerine and black colour scheme in vivid contrast with the blue of the SEC officials' uniforms. Filming of the conference room scene involved the simultaneous operation of 20 puppets, a feat that APF could not have achieved on a TV budget. Lane commented: \"Thunderbirds Are Go was done like an episode but on a bigger scale. Whereas we would think that it might be nice to do a particular shot on the series but couldn't afford to, with Thunderbirds Are Go we just did it because we had the money.\" In the Swinging Star scenes, background characters are represented by enlarged black-and-white photographs. Anderson compared these scenes to a \"Busby Berkeley sequence\" due to their surrealism, aspects of which include a giant guitar and pink \"space clouds\" composed of dry ice.

The main effects pieces were the Zero-X launch sequences, new  Thunderbird launch sequences, the car chase involving FAB 1 and the Hood, the Swinging Star scenes, the sequences set on the Martian surface, and the destruction of Zero-X. Over 300 of the film's effects used scale models. The crew took advantage of the considerable space inside the new effects building to experiment with low-angle shots and other, more inventive camera angles. Building new models of the Thunderbird machines was especially problematic in the case of Thunderbird 2, as Meddings explained: \"Unfortunately, its replacement was not only the wrong colour, it was a completely different shape. Although we had several more built in different scales, I never felt our model makers managed to re-capture the look of the original.\" The Zero-X spacecraft, which was designed by Meddings, was built as a ,  fibreglass model at a cost of \u00a32,500 (approximately \u00a3 in ). Although the model took months to build, all of its scenes, from launch to destruction, were completed in two days. The cockpit was based on that of Concorde, a prototype of which was under construction at Filton Airfield in Bristol. A long shot of the Zero-X lifting body exploding in Earth's atmosphere was the only effects work that was filmed outdoors; the shot was mounted on a gantry at a nearby power station against the actual sky, with Cordtex explosive strips, gunpowder, naphtha, magnesium and petroleum gel used to create a \"fireball\" effect. The film's effects later became so well known in the industry that the crew of James Cameron's film Aliens (1986) used them for reference."

Some of the deleted scenes concerned the SEC's attempts to persuade International Rescue to escort Zero-X. At the same time, the Hood telepathically contacts his half-brother Kyrano (voiced by David Graham), Jeff's retainer on Tracy Island, and forces him to disclose the Tracy family's intentions. With the removal of the latter scene, Kyrano was completely cut from the film. Other scenes saw Lady Penelope and Parker flying to Glenn Field aboard the hypersonic airliner Fireflash and Jeff Tracy making a speech to the world through the Trans American TV Network. The deleted scenes are now considered lost, with only still photographs and brief footage surviving. One of the photographs, showing Brains and Alan standing behind a TV camera as Jeff prepares to make his speech, appeared as the cover of issue 35 of FAB magazine.

He instructed Gerry Anderson to cancel the production of Thunderbirds Series Two after only six episodes and begin preparations for a new series. Around this time, APF was rebranded \"Century 21 Productions\"; this name was first carried by Thunderbirds Are Go to link the film to APF's tie-in comic TV Century 21. The film was the first Anderson project to be promoted, in full, as a \"Gerry Anderson Century 21 Production\". Well received at a test screening for United Artists executives, Thunderbirds Are Go premiered at the London Pavilion cinema on 12 December. The premiere was held in aid of children's charity Barnardo's with the Royal Marines Band Service performing the \"Thunderbirds March\" both before and after the screening."

        "content": "The film's December 1966 release came amid what commentators dubbed the \"Thunderbirds Christmas\" \u2013 a rush among retailers to sell Thunderbirds toys, games, books and other tie-ins. An early review of the film in Kine Weekly described it as a \"colourful extension\" of the TV series, while the News of the World praised it for providing \"breathtaking entertainment\". The Sunday Express was also positive, calling the concept of a Mars mission \"awesome\" and commending the film's visuals: \"Of course, the cast are all puppets, the sets, models, and the story unabashed nonsense. But it's great all the same.\" Elsewhere, the Daily Mail praised the puppets' big-screen transition: \"So who needs people? These handsome, stiff-necked, shiny-faced Thunderbirds puppets have broken spectacularly out of black-and-white TV and on to the cinema screen.\" The Andersons began a tour of the country to promote the film. Around this time, it became apparent that public interest was lukewarm and the box office revenue mediocre. According to Gerry Anderson: \"When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. When we got to the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed \u2013 box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went.\" He believed that Thunderbirds origins as a TV series weakened the film's chances of success: \"The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'\" Sylvia Anderson had a similar explanation: \"Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that \u2013 firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema.\" Supermarionation historian Stephen La Rivi\u00e8re suggests that the film was also facing strong competition from an influx of family films including Batman and Born Free, as well as re-issues of The Wizard Of Oz (1939), Mary Poppins (1964) and  The Sound of Music (1965). Later reviews were less positive: while the Slough Observer described the film as \"basically a Technicolor large-screen extension\" of the TV series, The Times was critical, arguing that the TV-style storytelling and characterisation were too thin to sustain a feature film and that the frequent launch sequences were more for padding than visual appeal. Writer John Peel comments that Thunderbirds Are Go is \"well-made\" and fulfils its promise to deliver visual spectacle. He considers it superior to its sequel, Thunderbird 6, but suggests that the plot is partly recycled from the TV episodes and describes the dream sequence as \"painfully silly\". Both La Rivi\u00e8re and Peel believe that the Thunderbird machines are underused. La Rivi\u00e8re also suggests that the lengthy model shots and reduced role of the Tracy family may have disappointed the film's young target audience. Jeff Stafford of Turner Classic Movies regards the film in its entirety as a \"pop culture novelty as fascinating and endearing as a toy from one's childhood.\" He agrees that the effects sequences are protracted: \"You'll feel yourself growing older as cranes and hydraulic lifts slowly \u2013 very slowly \u2013 prepare for a missile launch.\" William Gallagher of BBC Online gives a positive review, calling Thunderbirds Are Go \"every bit as good\" as the TV series. However, he also suggests that Thunderbirds worked better on the small screen, writing of the film's content: \"Certainly there's no greater profundity or universal theme to the film, it is just an extended episode.\" He rates Thunderbirds Are Go three stars out of five, as does the Film4 website."

        "content": "Thunderbird 6 is a 1968 British science fiction puppet film based on Thunderbirds, a Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company Century 21 Productions. Written by the Andersons and directed by David Lane, it is the sequel to Thunderbirds Are Go (1966). The film is largely set on Skyship One \u2013 a futuristic airship designed by Brains, the inventor of International Rescue's Thunderbird machines. The plot sees Alan Tracy, Tin-Tin Kyrano, Lady Penelope and Parker representing International Rescue as guests of honour on Skyship Ones round-the-world maiden flight, unaware that master criminal The Hood is once again plotting to acquire the organisation's technological secrets. The Hood's agents murder the airship's crew and assume their identities to lure International Rescue into a trap. Meanwhile, Brains' efforts to design a proposed sixth Thunderbird collide with fate when Skyship One is damaged and its occupants' only salvation seems to be Alan's old Tiger Moth biplane. Actors John Carson and Geoffrey Keen provided guest voices, with additions to the regular voice cast in the form of Keith Alexander and Gary Files. The puppet design compromised between the caricatures that Century 21 had used up until Thunderbirds Are Go and the realistically proportioned marionettes that were introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. The film was shot between May and December 1967. Some of the sequences showing the Tiger Moth in flight were shot on location using a full-sized plane, but a legal dispute with the Ministry of Transport over alleged dangerous flying forced the crew to film the remaining shots in-studio with scale models. Thunderbird 6 was released in July 1968 to a mediocre box office response that ruled out the production of further sequels. Critical response has remained mixed: while the special effects have been praised, the story polarised commentators."

        "content": "In 2068, the New World Aircraft Corporation in England gives Brains an open brief to design a revolutionary aircraft. Brains suggests an airship, prompting howls of laughter from the executives. Nevertheless, his proposal is accepted and the corporation builds Skyship One, a fully automated airship powered by an anti-gravity field. Representing International Rescue for the maiden flight \u2013 a private round-the-world trip with pre-programmed stops \u2013 are Alan Tracy, Tin-Tin, Lady Penelope and Parker. Brains, meanwhile, is forced to remain on Tracy Island after Jeff asks him to design a sixth Thunderbird craft. Working without a specification, Brains produces a range of concepts but all are rejected by Jeff. Alan and Tin-Tin fly to England in an old Tiger Moth biplane and join Penelope and Parker before Skyship One departs. However, the group are unaware that Captain Foster and the stewards have been murdered and replaced by agents of The Hood, now operating as \"Black Phantom\" from an abandoned airfield near Casablanca. As the ship is automated, the impostors are not required to demonstrate any detailed knowledge of its systems and are thus able to avoid raising their guests' suspicions as the trip progresses. After Skyship One leaves the Egyptian pyramids, Penelope finds a bugging device in her bedroom. Unknown to her, Foster and his men have been recording and editing her voice to assemble a fake radio message asking Jeff to send Thunderbirds 1 and 2 to the abandoned airfield, where The Hood and his men intend to hi-jack the craft. During a stop in the Swiss Alps, Parker discovers the editing equipment, but before the group can act the message is completed and transmitted to Tracy Island via John on  Thunderbird 5. Jeff immediately dispatches Scott and Virgil in Thunderbirds 1 and 2, but Alan realises that his brothers are flying into a trap and Penelope is able to forward the warning just in time. On landing at the airfield, Scott and Virgil use the Thunderbirds rocket launchers to destroy The Hood's base. They then take off to rendezvous with Skyship One. Aboard the airship, Alan, Penelope and Parker engage in a shootout with the impostors but are forced to surrender when Tin-Tin is taken hostage. The anti-gravity system is damaged in the fighting, causing the ship to lose altitude and crash into a radio mast at a missile base near Dover. With Skyship One balanced precariously on top of the mast and its anti-gravity field weakening, it is up to Scott, Virgil and Brains to rescue all aboard before the ship collapses onto the base below. However, Scott and Virgil are unable close in without their thrusters tipping it over and none of Thunderbird 2s Pod Vehicles is light enough to deploy onto it. At Gordon's suggestion, Brains flies the Tiger Moth up to Skyship Ones top deck to airlift the passengers and crew to safety one by one. However, on landing, he is held at gunpoint by Foster and his two surviving henchmen. With Penelope hostage in the plane's cockpit, Foster tries to take off but is shot dead by Alan. The Tiger Moth launches with the International Rescue agents and impostors clinging on to the wings and landing gear. Shortly after, Skyship One crashes to the ground, starting a chain reaction that obliterates the missile base. The remaining impostors are killed in a shootout aboard the Tiger Moth. Stray bullets puncture the fuel tank, forcing Penelope to make an emergency landing. After near misses with a factory chimney, a bridge on the M104 motorway and a tree, Penelope ditches the plane into a field. Parker is thrown out when the plane clips the tree top and ends up dangling upside down in its branches before falling to the ground. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils the new Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its worth in the field."

Filmed on a budget of \u00a3300,000 (approximately \u00a3 million in ), Thunderbird 6s principal production credits were unchanged from the first film, with Gerry and Sylvia Anderson returning as writers and producers and David Lane reprising his role of director. The Andersons wrote the script in three months, originally intending the film to be about a \"Russo-American space project\". The focus was changed to an ill-fated airship when the Andersons' colleague Desmond Saunders suggested they base the film on the destruction of the R101. In preparation, Gerry read books on the R101 and other airships, including the R100 and the Graf Zeppelin. The plot was intended to be more light-hearted than that of the first film, which focused on the Mars-bound spacecraft Zero-X. Presenting a de Havilland Tiger Moth as the eponymous Thunderbird 6, the script alluded to advertising for Esso: during the Skyship One rescue, a line of dialogue from Virgil Tracy playfully adapts the oil company's slogan \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\" to refer to the \"Tiger\" in Thunderbird 2s pod. However, the model of the plane is never named in full. Principal photography began on 1 May 1967 and was completed in four months."

With the exceptions of John Tracy and Black Phantom/The Hood, all returning characters were voiced by the actors who had voiced them on Thunderbirds Are Go. New voice actors for Thunderbird 6 were: Keith Alexander as John Tracy and the Narrator. Ray Barrett, the original voice of John, had returned to his native Australia after the production of Thunderbirds Are Go. His replacement, Alexander, was also contracted to provide a brief opening narration explaining the secrecy of International Rescue. Alexander later voiced Sam Loover in Joe 90 and Agent Blake in The Secret Service before starring as Lieutenant Keith Ford in UFO. Gary Files as Black Phantom. According to Files, his voice roles in Thunderbird 6 were a trial run for Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, to which he supplied numerous guest character voices. More roles followed, including the regular voice of Matthew Harding in The Secret Service. John Carson as the impostor Captain Foster (codenamed \"White Ghost\"). Carson's guest appearances in the TV series The Troubleshooters brought him to the attention of the Andersons. His delivery of Foster's dialogue led to a mistaken assumption that the character was voiced by James Mason. Geoffrey Keen as James Glenn, the president of the New World Aircraft Corporation. Keen was known to the Andersons for playing the leading role of Brian Stead in The Troubleshooters. Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn suggest that Thunderbird 6 develops the character of Lady Penelope, thanks in part to a more mature reading of her lines by Sylvia Anderson. They also praise David Graham's contributions, especially his performance as Parker, but note that some of the regular characters from the TV series, including John and Gordon, play only minor roles in the film."

        "content": "By the time Thunderbird 6 entered production, Century 21's next puppet series, Captain Scarlet, had already started filming. This series introduced a new puppet design that discontinued the caricatured look of the Thunderbirds marionettes in favour of realistic body proportions. The puppets of Thunderbird 6 were modelled as a compromise between the old and new designs: the heads and hands remained disproportionately large but the overall caricature was toned down. Most of the guest character puppets were recycled from Thunderbirds Are Go, although the Captain Foster puppet was a new creation. Puppeteer Wanda Webb remembered that Thunderbird 6 maintained high standards of puppet workmanship, commenting on a scene that shows Penelope asleep: \"I had placed the sleeping eyelids in Plasticine and made the eye shadow a little too blue. We ended up re-shooting the whole sequence.\" A number of one-off puppets with gaping mouths (showing filled-in teeth) were made for the opening sequence in which Brains' proposal to design a mere airship sends the incredulous NWAC executives into howling fits of laughter. Stephen La Rivi\u00e8re describes this as \"a contender for the most horrific scene ever produced by Century 21\". The decision to place the title sequence after a cold open was one of several measures taken to distinguish Thunderbird 6 from the previous film. The Skyship One filming model was built by effects director Derek Meddings, who also oversaw the construction of scale replicas of the various locations seen in the film, such as the Great Sphinx of Giza and the Grand Canyon. The Swiss Alps scenes called for FAB 1 to skate across the ice with miniatures of Alan and Tin-Tin following on skis. To accommodate the amount of movement that this entailed, the effects team built a set  wide; this was the largest set used for the film and was filled with salt to simulate snow. Bob Bell's art department designed each of the rooms on board Skyship One in a unique style; for example, the Ball Room contained spherical decor while the Games Room had a die and chessboards theme. Penelope's quarters, designed by Keith Wilson, were made pink to match the colour of FAB 1. Archer and Hearn describe them as resembling a \"Barbara Cartland nightmare\". During filming, the heat of the studio lights caused the floor of the Bottle Room set to catch fire, forcing the crew to rebuild it from scratch. The scene set inside the fictional Whistle Stop Inn \u2013 a railway-themed Swiss pub where customers are served meals on model trains \u2013 required careful planning and coordination."

        "content": "Some of the sequences involving the Tiger Moth, such as Alan and Tin-Tin leaving Tracy Island and Brains landing on Skyship One, were filmed with scale models. For other scenes, the production organised a live-action location shoot using a full-size Tiger Moth. Joan Hughes, a ferry pilot who had flown Supermarine Spitfires and Avro Lancasters during the Second World War, was hired to fly the plane and serve as Lady Penelope's human stunt double. The other characters were represented by dummies tied to the wings and undercarriage. Scenes featuring live-action shooting include Brains' take-off, Penelope's struggle to control the plane, the gun battle with Foster's henchmen, the near misses with the motorway bridge and the chimney, and the crash-landing in the field. The location shoot was based at Wycombe Air Park in Booker, Buckinghamshire. By the end of summer, the grass around the park had turned brown, so the effects team corrected the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the production was informed that a local farmer's prize ram had died and that when the animal had been cut open a large amount of green paint had been found inside. Concluding that no one else could have been responsible for the death, the production apologised and compensated the farmer, and production manager Norman Foster gave the farmer's wife a bunch of flowers. The fictional M104 motorway was represented by the then-unfinished M40. The Tiger Moth's near-miss with the bridge was filmed between Junctions 4 and 5 at Lane End on the High Wycombe Bypass. Before this sequence was filmed, the Ministry of Transport and local police had told the crew that for the stunt to be performed legally the plane's wheels had to remain in contact with the ground while it passed under the bridge. During one of the takes, a crosswind sprang up and the drag from the dummies caused Hughes to fear that she would lose control if the plane connected with the motorway. She therefore stayed airborne, clearing the bridge by  as originally intended. During another take, the continuing crosswind necessitated another glide, angering the Ministry of Transport official who was supervising the shoot and leading to the arrests of Hughes and Foster. Hughes was charged with seven counts of dangerous flying and Foster with three of aiding and abetting. However, their trial at Aylesbury Crown Court did not take place until March 1968, by which time production had ended. After a two-day hearing, during which the jury viewed the finished film, the defendants were found not guilty. Commenting on his acquittal, which was reported in the Daily Express with the headline \"Under The Bridge Goes Lady Penelope\", Foster said that the incident had \"opened the way for much greater realism in filmmaking.\" Hughes remarked that the stunt marked the first time in her career that she had been afraid. In the time it took for Hughes and Foster's case to reach court, the Ministry of Transport withdrew its permission for any more stunts to be filmed on the M40. The remaining Tiger Moth sequences were therefore filmed with a series of radio-controlled planes on a -scale replica of a section of the motorway. The planes, which proved unreliable and frequently crashed, included a version that was  wide as well as a smaller -scale model for shots featuring the puppet characters. The M40 model was erected outdoors to reduce lighting discrepancies, with the bridge erected against a backdrop of real trees and fields to simulate the intended setting as accurately as possible. The outdoor filming took six weeks to complete due to poor weather. Built at Hatfield Aerodrome in 1940, the DH82A Tiger Moth that appears in the film (registration G-ANFM, serial number 83604) served in the RAF before being sold to the Association of British Aero Clubs in 1953. After Thunderbird 6, the plane appeared in other films including Agatha (1978). Damaged in a crash in 1992, the repaired Tiger Moth is now a part of the Diamond Nine aerobatics squadron based at White Waltham Airfield in Berkshire."

The aerial shots of Alan and Tin-Tin's flight to England aboard the Tiger Moth are accompanied by a rendition of the 19th-century song \"The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze\". For this sequence, Lane wanted the plane's movements to suggest a \"dance\" in mid-air, and during the location shoot played the song on loudspeakers to inspire the stunt pilot. Composer Barry Gray preferred his score for Thunderbird 6 to that of Thunderbirds Are Go as the second film's premise of a circumnavigation gave him scope to devise a variety of themes.

In a contemporary review for the Daily Mail, critic Barry Norman described Thunderbird 6 as a showcase of \"technical excellence\" but also pointed out its \"class-conscious\" side, noting that the manservant Parker is the butt of several jokes over the course of the film. Stephen La Rivi\u00e8re ascribes the film's failure to a loss of public interest in Thunderbirds: by the time the film was released, the TV series had been cancelled and the final episode (\"Give or Take a Million\") had been broadcast over a year earlier. He praises the film's visuals, writing that the Tiger Moth effects were \"some of the best effects work Century 21 would ever create. It is a testament to their skill and ingenuity that, in the motorway sequence, the model shots are indistinguishable from the original.\" However, he questions the lack of action sequences, suggesting that this was disappointing to younger viewers and makes the film \"[feel] like an extended puppet version of holiday magazine programme Wish You Were Here...?\" He argues that this \"unfamiliar air\" to the film is compounded by its voice acting, which he believes sounds more mature than before (a development he attributes to the casting of new actors like Gary Files and Keith Alexander). La Rivi\u00e8re further argues that the use of a vintage biplane as the star vehicle, and Virgil's pun on Esso's slogan \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\", would have been appreciated only by an adult audience. The film's younger viewers, on the other hand, \"had spent the entire 90 minutes eagerly waiting for the most fantastic piece of hardware to arrive. They got an old plane.\" Commentator John Marriott also criticises the Tiger Moth, remarking that \"the big screen was an unsuitable place for the gentle irony of steam-age technology scoring triumphantly over an array of fantasy machines.\" Responding to claims that the tone is markedly different from that of Thunderbirds Are Go, Gerry Anderson said that as many months had passed since the last TV episode, Century 21 was \"much more aware with ['Thunderbird 6] that it wasn't just a question of making a longer episode, but it was, indeed, to make something special for the cinema.\" John Peel is dismissive of the film, comparing it negatively to the \"well-made fun\" of Thunderbirds Are Go. He calls it \"a feeble last fling for a brilliant series\" with an over-long and illogical plot, weak jokes and little action. BBC Online gives the film three stars out of five, calling it a \"weak and perhaps too padded adventure\" whose plot has the \"extended feel of a special TV episode\" instead of a feature film. Jim Schembri of The Age praises the story and describes the film as having a \"snappier pace, with an action climax leaps ahead of anything in the latest Bond epic.\" Writing for the same newspaper, Philippa Hawker notes an increased level of humour, stating that the film is \"more self-consciously light-hearted but it's also more suspenseful.\" The Film4 website awards three out of five, praising Century 21's decision to introduce more realistically proportioned puppets and comparing Thunderbird 6 favourably to the 2004 live-action adaptation. The review describes the film as \"entertaining if antiquated\" and a \"a slice of kid-friendly cinema made for a far more innocent age.\""

Frank Wiecek (Richard Conte) and another man are quickly arrested, and are later sentenced to serve 99 years imprisonment each for the killing. Eleven years later, Wiecek's mother (Kasia Orzazewski) puts an ad in the newspaper offering a $5,000 reward for information about the true killers of the police officer. This leads the city editor of the Chicago Times, Brian Kelly (Lee J. Cobb), to assign reporter P.J. McNeal (James Stewart) to look more closely into the case. McNeal is skeptical at first, believing Wiecek to be guilty. But he starts to change his mind, and meets increased resistance from the police and the state attorney's office, who are unwilling to be proved wrong. This is quickly followed by political pressure from the state capital, where politicians are anxious to end a story that might prove embarrassing to the administration. Eventually, Wiecek is proved innocent by, among other things, the enlarging of a photograph showing the date on a newspaper that proves that a key witness statement was false. In actuality, innocence was determined not as claimed in the film but when it was found out that the prosecution had suppressed the fact that the main witness had initially declared that she could not identify the two men involved in the police shooting."

        "content": "It was reported on January 24, 1947, that, according to the studio, the picture would be filmed in the documentary manner. Fox had obtained the necessary legal clearances from the persons involved in the story and had dispatched Otto Lang, producer, and Leonard Hoffman, writer, to Chicago to gather material for the film.  Eventually, Quentin Reynolds and Jay Dratler joined Hoffman in writing the script. Casting the film proved complex. According to a March 7 report in The New York Times, Twentieth Century-Fox had named Henry Fonda to play the newspaper reporter in Call Northside 777, which would precede Chicken Every Sunday and Lone Star Preacher on Fonda's schedule. However, after a month, another report pointed out that Fox had named Fonda for a leading role in the screen adaptation of Elizabeth Janeway's novel, Daisy Kenyon, which necessitated Fonda's replacement in Call Northside 777. Two months later, another report said that Twentieth Century-Fox was \"negotiating for the services of James Stewart for the leading role in Call Northside 777.\" Lloyd Nolan was originally named to play the role of Brian Kelly, but Lee J. Cobb replaced him in the end. Leopoldine Konstantin was originally scheduled to play the wrongly convicted man's mother, but in the end the role went to Kasia Orzazewski. This was the first Hollywood feature film to be shot on location in Chicago. Views of the Merchandise Mart as well as Holy Trinity Polish Mission can be seen throughout the film."

        "content": "Saw II is a 2005 horror film directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Leigh Whannell and Bousman. It is the sequel to 2004's Saw and the second installment in the Saw film series. The film stars Donnie Wahlberg, Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Beverley Mitchell, Dina Meyer, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Erik Knudsen, Shawnee Smith, and Tobin Bell. In the film, a group of ex-convicts are trapped by the Jigsaw Killer inside a house and must pass a series of deadly tests to retrieve the antidote for a nerve agent that will kill them in two hours. After the immensely successful opening weekend of 2004's Saw, a sequel was immediately green-lit. Whannell and James Wan were busy preparing for their next film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called The Desperate before Saw was released and was looking for a producer but many studios rejected it. Gregg Hoffman received the script and showed it to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into Saw II. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto. Saw II was released in the United States on October 28, 2005, by Lions Gate Films. It opened with $31.9 million and grossed $88 million in the United States and Canada. It has remained the highest grossing Saw film in those countries. Bell was nominated for \"Best Villain\" at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards for his role as Jigsaw in the film. Saw II was released to DVD on February 14, 2006, and topped charts its first week, selling more than 3 million units. At the time, it was the fastest-selling theatrical DVD in Lions Gate's history. A sequel, titled Saw III, was released in 2006."

        "content": "Police informant Michael Marks awakens in a room with a spike-filled mask locked around his neck. He has one minute to cut into his eye to obtain the key, but can't bring himself to do it and is killed when the mask closes. At the scene of Michael's game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, Detective Eric Matthews, and calls him in. Matthews joins Kerry and Officer Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Michael's trap. There they apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who indicates computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house, including his only known survivor Amanda Young, Matthews' son Daniel, and six other victims: Xavier Chavez, Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, Addison Corday, Obi Tate, and Gus Colyard. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them all within two hours, but John assures Matthews that if he follows the rules of his own game, he will see Daniel again. At Kerry's urging, Matthews agrees to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal. During their conversation, John reveals to Matthews that one of his main motivations to become Jigsaw was a suicide attempt after his cancer diagnosis, which led to a newfound appreciation for life; his games' purpose is to help his victims develop the same appreciation. The group is informed by a microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; one is in the room's safe, and the tape provides a cryptic clue. Gus ignores a warning note and uses the key provided with the cassette on the door, which triggers a gun through the peephole that kills him. Once the door opens, they search the house and find a basement, where Obi, who helped with abducting the other victims, is killed in a furnace trap while trying to retrieve two antidotes. In another room, Xavier's test involves digging through a pit filled with syringes to retrieve a key to a steel door in two minutes, but he instead throws Amanda into the pit. She retrieves the key, but Xavier fails to unlock the door in time. Throughout the game, the group discuss connections between them and determine that each has been incarcerated before except Daniel. During his father's test, John reveals their affiliation to Matthews who was a corrupt police officer framing his suspects in various crimes recently. Xavier returns to the safe room and finds a number on the back of Gus' neck. After realizing the numbers are the combination for the safe, he kills Jonas and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent and dies, after finding the clue revealing Daniel's identity. Incensed by the revelation, Addison leaves on her own and finds a glass box containing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the openings which are lined with hidden blades. Xavier enters the room and leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel from the first room leading to the dilapidated bathroom. Xavier finds them and, agitated by Amanda's taunts, cuts off a piece of skin from the back of his neck to read his own number. Before Xavier can finish them off, Daniel slits his throat with the hacksaw. Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Matthews assaults John and forces him to lead him to the house. The tech team tracks the video's source and while Rigg's team searches the house, Kerry realizes that the game took place days before they captured John until the timer for Matthews' game expires to reveal Daniel inside a safe, bound and breathing in an oxygen mask. Unaware of these events, Matthews enters the house alone and makes his way to the bathroom, where he is subdued by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe and finds a tape recorder left by Amanda, who reveals she had become John's accomplice after surviving her first trap and helped him set up Matthews' test during the game at the house, intending to continue John's work after he dies. Amanda then appears and seals the door, leaving Matthews to die as John hears his screams outside and smiles."

        "content": "Saw II was immediately green-lighted after Saws successful opening weekend a year earlier. Producers needed a script for a sequel  but James Wan and Leigh Whannell, director and writer of Saw, were working on Universal Pictures's Dead Silence. Music video director Darren Lynn Bousman had just completed a script for his first film The Desperate, and was trying to sell it to studios but was getting reactions that the script was very similar to Saw. A German studio eventually approached him with an offer to produce the film for $1 million. Just as they were looking for a cinematographer, the American cinematographer David A. Armstrong, who had worked on Saw, arrived on the scene and suggested showing the script to Saw producer Gregg Hoffman. Hoffman read the script and called Bousman wanting to produce The Desperate. Bousman was initially upset when he heard about his script's similarities to Saw, and feared at first that Lions Gate's call was due to complaints of plagiarism. After Hoffman showed the script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules, the two decided that The Desperate was the starting script they needed for Saw II and two months later, Bousman was flown to Toronto to direct. Whannell polished the script, with input from Wan, in order to bring it into the Saw universe, but kept the characters, traps and deaths from The Desperate script. Bousman said, \"But you could read the script for The Desperate and watch Saw II, and you would not be able to draw a comparison\". Bousman's first draft for The Desperate consisted in an X-rated violent film, but after Bousman's agent found difficult to have the script bought because most studios were turned off due to the level of violence, Bousman modified his script to be an R-rated film, which is when the executives of Lions Gate were turned on his potential. Overall, the framework of The Desperate had a similar bleak, disgusting atmosphere and a twist ending, which is why the Lions Gate executives found parallels in the script's style. Wan and Whannell also served as executive producers. All the previous film's crew members returned: editor Kevin Greutert, cinematographer Armstrong, and composer Charlie Clouser. This was to be Hoffman's last film. He died unexpectedly on December 4, 2005. Only those key cast and crew members who were involved in the film's ending were given the full script; the rest received only the first 88 pages. If a particular page was rewritten, the old page was shredded. Members were also required to sign confidentiality agreements requiring them not to release any plot details. Reportedly, \"four or five\" alternate endings were shot in order to keep the ending a surprise. Bousman gave the actors freedom to change dialogue in the script. He said that 95% of the time, the actors went by the script, with about 5% being adlibs, which he said \"made all of the difference in the world\". Donnie Wahlberg was allowed to modify some pieces of dialogue, especially those of Eric Matthews' interactions with his son Daniel and Jigsaw. For the former, Wahlberg added the line of what was the last thing Eric told Daniel basing it on what he says to his first son before hanging up the phone. For the latter, Wahlberg felt that the relationship between Eric and Jigsaw was \"too dicey\" and should emphasize Eric's need to sit with Jigsaw to rescue his son; Tobin Bell agreed with most of these changes, which Wahlberg added after finishing shooting every day, and the two improsived together on set. Hoffman said in an interview with Fangoria that they listened to fans' suggestions. For instance, instead of only showing the aftermath of a character violently dying in a flashback, they would allow it to unfold as it happened. This was in contrast to Saw, in which most of the violence was implied off-screen."

        "content": "From the first film, Tobin Bell returned to play Jigsaw even though he wasn't obligated to return. Bell found it fascinating to reprise his role, but played the role like any of his, feeling that he needed to put himself on Jigsaw's side to get into character and play him properly. Shawnee Smith similarly returned to play Amanda Young even though she never imagined ever reprising the role as she didn't expect the first film to be such a hit. Bousman served as a stand-in for the hooded figure who places a key behind Michael Marks' eye, who the fans immediately theorized to be the first film's protagonist Dr. Lawrence Gordon, to add \"flavor\" to the performance, though Bousman didn't intend the figure to be Gordon. Saw 3D eventually retroactively confirmed the figure to be Gordon. Donnie Wahlberg was cast as Eric Matthews out of attraction to the character and the script. With sixteen years old, Erik Knudsen was cast as Daniel Matthews in his first major feature film appearance; Knudsen auditioned hard to get the role and was excited upon being notified that he had won the part, as the first Saw was one of his favorite horror films along with the Scream series. Beverley Mitchell was cast as Laura Hunter despite her dislike for horror films and her inability to watch the first film full until trying for the fifth time, but she accepted the role nonetheless because she was looking for a challenging and frightening part to push her limits, which she found in Laura physically due to the requirement to play sick and coughing. Lyriq Bent originally auditioned for the role of Xavier Chavez, but was cast as Daniel Rigg instead out of fear for racial stereotypes of casting an African-American as a drug dealer, leading to Franky G's casting as Xavier, though Bent still found stereotypical of making the character Puerto-Rican."

        "content": "David Hackl, the film's production designer, took three weeks to construct 27 sets on a single sound stage. The puppet Billy, used in the series to give instructions to Jigsaw's victims, was originally created by Wan out of paper towel rolls and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Given the larger budget for the sequel, Billy was upgraded with remote-controlled eyes and a servo-driven mouth. In one trap, \"The Needle Room\", Smith's character Amanda is thrown into a pit of needles to find a key. In order for this to be done safely, four people, over a period of four days, removed the needle tips from syringes and replaced them with fiber optic tips. They modified a total of 120,000 fake needles. However, this number was insufficient and the pit had to be filled with styrofoam and other materials to make it appear to have more needles. The needles that were apparently stuck into Smith were actually blunted syringes stuck into padding under her clothing. For certain shots, a fake arm was used. Bousman came up with an idea whereby a character's hands would get stuck in some sort of vessel, and this resulted in the \"Hand Trap\". It proved to be a challenge, but after much discussion, Hackl, property master Jim Murray and art director Michele Brady came up with a suitable design. They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with the antidote and which had two hand-holes on the underside. As soon as Emmanuelle Vaugier's character Addison Corday puts her hands into the holes, razor blades would close in on her hands, and any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death. In order for the trap to be used safely, the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress's hands, thus allowing her to slide her hands out. Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put her hands into the trap, as there was a lock with a key on the other side of the box that would have opened the contraption. The original idea for the \"Furnace Trap\" came from the house having been a crematorium at some point, but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor, so it was instead decided that the furnace would be part of the house's boiler system. The furnace was visualized in the form of a computer model so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed. Using the computer model as a guide, the furnace was constructed in three days using cement board and tin with removable sides and top so Timothy Burd's character Obi Tate could be filmed crawling inside. The furnace produced real flames and, in place of Burd, a stuntman using a fire retardant gel crawled into the fire."

The site's consensus was, \"Saw II is likely to please the gore-happy fans of the original, though it may be too gruesome for those not familiar with first film's premise.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 40 based on 28 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Robert Koehler of Variety wrote, \"cooking up new Rube Goldberg torture contraptions isn't enough to get Saw II out of the shadow of its unnerving predecessor\". Gregory Kirschling of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B minus, saying \"Saw II is just barely a better B flick than Saw\" and that both films are \"more clever and revolting than they are actually chilling\". He praised Bell's performance as Jigsaw, saying \"As the droopy-lidded maniac in the flesh, Tobin Bell is, for all the film's gewgaws, Saw II sturdiest horror, a Terence Stamp look-alike who calls to mind a seedy General Zod lazily overseeing the universe from his evildoer's lair\". He ended his review: \"Where Saw II lags behind in Saw's novelty, it takes the lead with its smoother landing, which is again primed to blow the movie wide open, but manages a more compelling job of it than the original's cheat finish\". Kevin Crust of the Los Angeles Times called Saw II a \"worthy follow-up to its grisly predecessor\". He said the story was \"much more focused on an endgame than the original film. There are fewer credibility gaps and there are plenty of reversals to satisfy fans\". He criticized the use of numerous flashbacks, saying that it \"rob[s] us of the pleasure of actually remembering for ourselves\". Laura Kern, writing for The New York Times, said that Bousman \"delivers similar hard-core, practically humorless frights and hair-raising tension, but only after getting past a shaky beginning that plays more like a forensics-themed television show than a scary movie\" and called Greutert's editing \"crafty\". She called the sequel \"more trick than treat\" and that it \"doesn't really compare to its fine predecessor - though it still manages to be eye-opening (and sometimes positively nauseating) in itself\". Empires Kim Newman gave the film three out of five stars. He said that the film improves upon Saw \"perverse fascination with Seven-style murders and brutally violent puzzles\" and that Jigsaw's intellectual games make \"Hannibal Lecter look like the compiler of The Suns quick crossword\". He ended his reviews saying, \"Morally dubious it may be, but this gory melange of torture, terror and darkly humorous depravity appeals to the sick puppy within us all\"."

She is released on probation, but warned that if she breaks parole she will be immediately sent back to prison, as well as be forced to pay the remainder of her fortune, some eight million pounds to all the dog shelters in Westminster. Cruella therefore mends her working relationship with her valet Alonzo, and has him lock away all her fur coats. Cruella's probation officer, Chloe Simon, is the owner of Dipstick (one of the original 101, bought from the Dalmatian Plantation of Roger and Anita Dearly) and suspects Cruella will strike again. Dipstick's mate, Dottie, gives birth to three puppies: Domino, Little Dipper and Oddball, who appears to be an albino and begins to feel self-conscious about her lack of spots as she grows up.  Cruella buys the Second Chance Dog shelter, owned by Kevin Shepherd, and saves it from insolvency, to restore her reputation. Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapy's subjects are subjected to loud noises, they revert to their original states, but conceals this discovery. Inevitably, when Big Ben rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality. She enlists the help of French furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt to steal Dalmatian puppies for a new fur coat with a hood, specifically modifying the original design to use Dipstick's children. During a nighttime date together, Kevin tells Chloe that, if Cruella violates her parole, her entire fortune will go to him, since his dog shelter is the only one currently operating in Westminster. Knowing this, Cruella has Kevin framed for the theft of the first ninety-nine puppies Le Pelt takes, also exploiting the fact that Kevin has a prior record of dog-napping. She invites Chloe and Dipstick to her house for a dinner party, to decoy them away while LePelt steals Dottie and her three puppies. Dipstick hurries back to the apartment and hides in LePelt's truck but is later captured at the train station. Chloe rushes home to save her pets, but arrives too late. She is joined by Kevin, who has escaped from prison with help from his dogs and talking scarlet macaw, Waddlesworth (who thinks he is a Rottweiler and later, a retriever). Kevin explains that his earlier conviction was for breaking animals out of a lab, where they were being used for experiments. Upon finding a ticket for the Venice-Simplon Orient Express to Paris dropped by LePelt, Kevin and Chloe attempt and fail to stop Cruella and LePelt before they get on the train. Oddball and Waddlesworth manage to get on board the train, and Kevin and Chloe follow to Paris, where they free the dogs before being discovered and locked in a cellar.  Cruella goes after the puppies alone, while Alonzo, having been scolded beyond his patience, defeats LePelt and frees Kevin and Chloe. They pursue Cruella to a bakery, and find that the puppies, led by Oddball, have tricked Cruella into being baked in an enormous cake. Cruella survives, then she and LePelt are both arrested. Chloe and Kevin, exonerated from the theft accusation, return to London and are personally awarded the remnants of Cruella's fortune by Alonzo himself. Oddball's coat finally develops a few small spots, much to everyone's surprise."

It was directed by Len Wiseman. It is based on a 1997 article \"A Farewell to Arms\" written for Wired magazine by John Carlin. The film's name is adapted from New Hampshire's state motto, \"Live Free or Die\". In the film, NYPD Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) attempts to stop a cyber-terrorist (Timothy Olyphant) who hacks into government and commercial computers across the United States with the goal of starting a \"fire sale\" that would disable key elements of the nation's infrastructure. Justin Long, Cliff Curtis, and Maggie Q also star. Live Free or Die Hard was released in the United States on June 27, 2007. The film grossed $388 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing installment in the Die Hard series. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who called the film a return to form for the series. It is the only Die Hard film to be theatrically released with a PG-13 rating from the MPAA, although an unrated edition would later be made available on home media. A fifth film, A Good Day to Die Hard, was released in 2013."

        "content": "Responding to a brief computer outage at its Cyber-Security Division by tracking down top computer hackers, the FBI, led by Deputy Director Miguel Bowman, asks NYPD detective John McClane to go to New Jersey to bring in hacker Matthew Farrell. McClane arrives just in time to save him from assassins sent by Mai Linh, who is Thomas Gabriel's lover and also working with him to carry out his plans. On the way to D.C., Farrell tells McClane he had written an algorithm for Linh to crack a specific security system for white hat purposes. Meanwhile, Gabriel orders his crew of hackers to take over transportation grids and the stock market, while nationally broadcasting a threatening message to the U.S. government. Farrell realizes this is the start of a \"fire sale\", a cyber attack designed to disable the nation's infrastructure. As McClane and Farrell are driven to DHS headquarters, Linh, posing as a dispatcher, reroutes them into a helicopter ambush. McClane fends off the attackers, destroying the helicopter and all but one of the terrorists. Desperate, McClane asks Farrell what would be Gabriel's next move. He deduces Gabriel's next target is the power grid, so they drive to a utility superstation in West Virginia. They find the superstation under control by a team led by Linh. McClane kills all but Linh. After an intense, violent struggle between the two, Linh, falls to her death in an elevator shaft. While Farrell is working on the hub computer to slow down the damage done, he is able to trace Gabriel & uploads his picture. He then sends it to Bowman at the FBI. McClane is shocked to learn that Bowman and Gabriel once worked together at the U.S. Department of Defense. Gabriel was the chief programmer for infrastructural security. He warned the department of weaknesses that made America's network infrastructure vulnerable to cyberwarfare, but his unorthodox methods got him fired. It's now clear he is out for revenge. Enraged over Linh's death, Gabriel redirects large amounts of natural gas to the superstation to kill McClane and Farrell, but they escape. McClane and Farrell then travel by helicopter to the home of super hacker, Frederick \"Warlock\" Kaludis (Kevin Smith) in Baltimore. Warlock identifies the piece of code Farrell wrote for Linh as a means to access data at a Social Security Administration building at Woodlawn, Maryland. He confirms Gabriel's former ties as a government employee. Doing a traceroute, Warlock locates Gabriel. The Woodlawn building is actually an NSA facility intended to back up the nation's personal and financial records in the event of a cyber attack and designed by Gabriel himself. The attack on the FBI triggered a download of financial data to Woodlawn, data which Gabriel plans to steal. Meanwhile, ordered by Gabriel, one of his top men kills all but one of his computer hackers after they've outlived their usefulness. Gabriel then taps into the connection they made, which reveals the location of McClane's estranged daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), whom he kidnaps. McClane and Gabriel then meet - virtually - McClane telling him he will lose. McClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility. Farrell finds the facility's main server and encrypts the data Gabriel's men downloaded before getting captured. Gabriel then takes Farrell and Lucy with him as he flees. McClane pursues them, hijacking their semi mobile base. Accessing the communication system of an F-35B Lightning II, Gabriel orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving, but the jet is destroyed by falling debris. McClane survives and sees Gabriel's vehicle pull into a nearby hangar. There, Gabriel demands that Farrell decrypt the financial data. When he refuses, Gabriel shoots him in the knee and threatens to kill Lucy. McClane arrives, killing two of Gabriel's men, but he is shot in the shoulder by Gabriel's last man, Emerson. Gabriel positions himself behind McClane, putting the barrel of the gun in his shoulder wound. McClane then pulls the trigger. The bullet travels through McClane's shoulder and hits Gabriel in the chest, killing him instantly. Farrell then grabs a handgun and kills Emerson as the FBI arrives. Afterwards, McClane thanks Farrell for saving Lucy's life, who, takes a romantic interest in him."

Using John Carlin's Wired magazine article entitled \"A Farewell to Arms\", Marconi crafted a screenplay about a cyber-terrorist attack on the United States. The attack procedure is known as a \"fire sale\", depicting a three-stage coordinated attack on a country's transportation, telecommunications, financial, and utilities infrastructure systems. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the project was stalled, only to be resurrected several years later and rewritten into Live Free or Die Hard by Doug Richardson and eventually by Mark Bomback. Willis said in 2005 that the film would be called Die Hard 4.0, as it revolves around computers and cyber-terrorism. IGN later reported the film was to be called Die Hard: Reset instead. 20th Century Fox later announced the title as Live Free or Die Hard and set a release date of June 29, 2007 with filming to begin in September 2006. The title is based on New Hampshire's state motto, \"Live Free or Die\", which is attributed to a quote from General John Stark. International trailers use the Die Hard 4.0 title, as the film was released outside North America with that title. Early into the film's DVD commentary, both Wiseman and Willis note a preference for the title Die Hard 4.0."

        "content": "For the visual effects used throughout the film, actor Bruce Willis and director Len Wiseman stated that they wanted to use a limited amount of computer-generated imagery (CGI). One VFX producer said that \"Len was insisting on the fact that, because we\u2019ve got Transformers and other big CG movies coming out, this one has to feel more real. It has to be embedded in some kind of practical reality in order to give it that edge of being a Die Hard.\" Companies such as Digital Dimension, The Orphanage, R!ot, Pixel Magic, and Amalgamated Pixels assisted in the film's visual effects. Digital Dimension worked on 200 visual effects shots in the film, including the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands on top of the other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view of the shot overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings. The Orphanage developed a multi-level freeway interchange for use in one of the film's final scenes by creating a digital environment and a  long spiral ramp that was built in front of a bluescreen. When a F-35 jet is chasing McClane on the freeway, a miniature model and a full-size prop were both built to assist in digitally adding the jet into the scene. The nine-foot model was constructed from November 2006 through February 2007. When the jet is shown hovering near the freeway, editors used the software 3D graphics program Maya to blur the background and create a heat ripple effect."

        "content": "Filming for Live Free or Die Hard started in downtown Baltimore, Maryland on September 23, 2006. Eight different sets were built on a large soundstage for filming many scenes throughout the film. When recording the sound for the semi trailer used in one of the film's final scenes, 18 microphones were used to record the engine, tires, and damage to the vehicle. Post-production for the film only took 16 weeks, when it was more common for similar films to use 26 weeks. In order to prevent possible injuries and be in peak condition for the film, Willis worked out almost daily for several months prior to filming. Willis was injured on January 24, 2007 during a fight scene, when he was kicked above his right eye by a stunt double for actress Maggie Q who was wearing stiletto heels. Willis described the event as \"no big deal\" but when Len Wiseman inspected his injury, he noticed that the situation was much more serious than previously thought\u2014in the DVD commentary, Wiseman indicates in inspecting the wound that he could see bone. Willis was hospitalized and received seven stitches which ran through his right eyebrow and down into the corner of his eye. Due to the film's non-linear production schedule, these stitches can accidentally be seen in the scene where McClane first delivers Farrell to Bowman. Throughout filming, between 200 and 250 stunt people were used. Bruce Willis' stunt double, Larry Rippenkroeger, was knocked unconscious when he fell  from a fire escape to the pavement. Rippenkroeger suffered broken bones in his face, several broken ribs, a punctured lung, and fractures in both wrists. Due to his injuries, production was temporarily shut down. Willis personally paid the hotel bills for Rippenkroeger's parents and visited him a number of times at the hospital. Kevin Smith recalls rewriting scenes on the set of Live Free or Die Hard in his spoken word film Sold Out: A Threevening with Kevin Smith."

Live Free or Die Hard, however, was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. In some cases, alternate profanity-free dialogue was shot and used or swearing was cut out in post-production to reduce profanity. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying \"It was about three months into it [production], and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13... But in the end, it was just trying to make the best Die Hard movie, not really thinking so much about what the rating would be.\" Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, \"I really wanted this one to live up to the promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one. That's a studio decision that is becoming more and more common, because they\u2019re trying to reach a broader audience. It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. But we still made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film.\" Willis said he thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect so due to the level and intensity of the action as well as the usage of some profanity, although he admitted these elements were less intense than in the previous films. He also said that this film was the best of the four: \"It's unbelievable. I just saw it last week. I personally think, it's better than the first one.\" In the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Classification awarded the film a 15 rating (including the unrated version, released later), the same rating as Die Hard with a Vengeance and Die Hard 2, albeit both were cut for both theatrical and video release, (The first film in the series originally received an 18 certificate). All films have been re-rated 15 uncut. Die Hard 4.0 was released with no cuts made and the cinema version (i.e.,the U.S. PG-13 version) consumer advice read that it \"contains frequent action violence and one use of strong language\". The unrated version was released on DVD as the \"Ultimate Action Edition\" with the consumer advice \"contains strong language and violence\". In Australia, Die Hard 4.0 was released with the PG-13 cut with an M rating, the same as the others in the series (The Australian Classification Board is less strict with regards to language and to a lesser extent, violence). The unrated version was later released on DVD and Blu-ray also with an M rating. The film, notably never released in home media with its theatrical cut, has only been released in Australia as the extended edition."

There is an unrated version, which retains much of the original 'R-rated' dialogue, and a theatrical version of the film. However, the unrated version has a branching error that resulted in one of the unrated changes being omitted. The film briefly switches to the PG-13 version in the airbag scene; McClane's strong language is missing from this sequence (although international DVD releases of the unrated version are unaffected). The Blu-ray release features the PG-13 theatrical cut which runs at 128 minutes, while the Collector's Edition DVD includes both the unrated and theatrical versions. Time magazine's Richard Corliss named it one of the Top 10 DVDs of 2007, ranking it at No. 10.

She played the \"Love Takes Time\" demo to CBS Records former CEO Don Ienner while on an airplane. Ienner and other officials immediately insisted the song be included on her upcoming album, even though the album was already going through final stages of completion and Carey wanted to save \"Love Takes Time\" for her sophomore effort. Eventually the song made it on to the album as the closing track, however, due to its late addition, it was not listed as such on early pressings of the album. Subsequent pressings of the album corrected this error. \"Love Takes Time\" was well received by music critics and went to become another success from the album in North America. It became Carey's second number-one single in the United States on its ninth week, attaining the position for three weeks. However, globally the song did not replicate the success of its predecessor. A music video was provided for the song, filmed in black and white at a beach. \"Love Takes Time\" has been included on Carey's compilation album Greatest Hits (2001), as well as #1 to Infinity (2015), among others. \"Love Takes Time\" was heavily promoted in the US, being performed live on shows such as The Arsenio Hall Show, Mariah's Thanksgiving NBC Special and The Des O'Connor Show. She performed the song live at various locations during late 1990, such as the Music Box Tour, her Number 1's tour in Las Vegas (2015\u201317) and on selected dates of her ongoing residency, The Butterfly Returns (2018). Most recently performed on select dates on her recent tour Caution World Tour (2019)."

        "content": "In 1988, a 19 year old Carey moved out from her mother's house on Long Island and into an apartment in Manhattan. She had composed a four-track demo tape with her writing partner Ben Margulies while she was attending high school. As 1988 progressed, Carey struggled to impress record executives with the tape and had failed in securing a record deal. She worked several jobs, including as a waitress and coat-checker, in order to pay for studio sessions with Margulies to make changes to the demo. After several months, Carey befriended singer Brenda K. Starr, and soon became one of her back-up vocalists. During recording sessions and rehearsals, Starr began to notice \"glimpses\" of Carey's \"gifted\" vocals. She thought that Carey was capable of achieving mainstream success and that she needed some guidance to break into the industry. One evening, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records was interested in Carey, but as she handed him the tape, Tommy Mottola grabbed it, and said that he would tend to \"the project\". Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and brought her over to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, \"When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom.\" After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988."

        "content": "Mariah Carey's debut album for her label Columbia was completed and being mastered when she wrote the song with Ben Margulies. Margulies said, \"It was sort of a gospelish thing I was improvising, then we began working on it. It was on a work tape that we had...and we recorded a very quick demo. It was just a piano vocal demo - I played live piano, and she sang it.\" Carey was on a mini-tour of ten states, playing acoustically with a piano player and three back-up singers. While on a company plane, she played the demo of \"Love Takes Time\" for Columbia Records president Don Ienner. \"All the important guys were on the plane,\" Margulies said. \"Tommy Mottola, Ienner, and Bobby Colomby.\" Carey was told the song was a \"career-maker,\" and that it had to go on the first album. She protested - her album was already being mastered, and she intended this ballad for her next release. The demo was sent to producer Walter Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. \"I guess to see if he made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day,\" remembers Afanasieff. \"He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can to put it on the album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time.\" The demo was very close to what Mottola wanted the finished product to be, according to Afanasieff. \"We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana Jon Chappelle and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: a day and a half for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing.\" Afanasieff heard from Columbia executives as soon as they received the mix. They wanted Carey's vocal a little louder, so a remix was quickly completed. The producer asked if the song would still make the debut album, and was told, \"We're going to do our best.\" When the album was released, \"Love Takes Time\" was not listed on the cassette or compact disc. \"(On) some of the original first copies of the record, they didn't have time to print the name of the song,\" Margulies laughs. \"And so the song's on there, but it doesn't say that it's on there. It was a song that actually was strong enough to stop the pressing...I don't know if they had to throw away a few hundred copies.\""

Carey keeps things simmering at a low heat, slowly unveiling the power and beauty of her voice. Should be firmly lodged in the #1 slot very soon.\" Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"With just the softest synthesizer tinkle, a touch of percussion, and what may well have been a borrowed pair of back-porch wind chimes, she made every last listener feel the utter despair of a breakup: \"Losing my mind/From this hollow in my heart/Suddenly I\u2019m so incomplete.\"\" In 2015, Est 1997 writer Mario stated that it was an \u2033Adult Contemporary ballad\u2033 and that it was \"arguably some of the strongest melodies and bridge in Mariah\u2019s catalog.\" He continued by saying that \u2033Her vocals are so pure and passionate that every emotion filters through the music and just reaches and warms the heart. It\u2019s the realisation of a universal truth by a young woman who\u2019s still learning to deal with feelings. There\u2019s almost a sense of naivety in the lyrics but, at the same time, the song sounds mature and it\u2019s relatable. That\u2019s a constant in Mariah\u2019s catalog, something that has marked her strength and endurance as a writer.\" During a review of her 2001 Greatest Hits album in May 2002, Devon Powers of PopMatters praised the song along with \"I Don't Wanna Cry\", calling it \"stupendous\" and said that \u2033Her lyrics were exactly what you wanted them to be: simple, memorable, and absolutely true.\" Stephen Filippelli from Review Stream called the song decent, but mainly criticized the music video for the song. Amanda Dobbins and Lindsay Weber of Vulture listed \"Love Takes Time\" at number-nineteen on their list of \"Mariah Carey\u2019s 25 Best Singles\". OO Cities called the song a \"beautiful ballad\". The song did not receive as many awards as \"Vision of Love,\" but still managed to win a BMI R&B Award for Song of the Year and Songwriter Award. The song also won Carey the 1991 Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Urban Contemporary New Artist."

The picture was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin, with a screenplay adapted by Tashlin and Herbert Baker from an uncredited 1955 novel, Do Re Mi by Garson Kanin. Filmed in DeLuxe Color, the production was originally intended as a vehicle for the American sex symbol Jayne Mansfield, with a satirical subplot involving teenagers and rock 'n' roll music. The unintended result has been called the \"most potent\" celebration of rock music ever captured on film. The original music score, including the title song performed by Little Richard, was by Bobby Troup, with an additional credit to Ray Anthony for the tune \"Big Band Boogie\". Tom Ewell had portrayed Marilyn Monroe's leading man in The Seven Year Itch the previous year."

He hires alcoholic press agent Tom Miller (Tom Ewell) to promote Jordan, both because of his past success with the career of singer Julie London (a fiction of the script) and because he never makes sexual advances towards his female clients. Miller sets to work by showing Jordan off around numerous night spots; his machinations arouse interest in Jordan and soon offers of contracts follow. However, Miller realizes that Jordan really just wants to be a homemaker and tries to persuade Murdock not to push Jordan into a show-business career. He thinks he's succeeded when he reveals to Murdock that Jordan's singing is so bad it shatters light bulbs, but Murdock suggests that Jordan would be perfect for a song he composed while in prison, \"Rock Around the Rock Pile\" (a parody of \"Rock Around the Clock\"). Miller reluctantly records Jordan performing the part of a prison siren in Murdock's song and heads to Chicago to promote it to Wheeler (John Emery), a former mob rival of Murdock who now has a monopoly over the jukebox industry. Suspicious of Miller's reluctance to promote Jordan and of the obvious attraction between Miller and Jordan, Murdock has his associate Mousie (Henry Jones) wiretap a phone call between the pair. Feeling pity for them, Mousie edits out the romantic portions of their conversations and convinces Murdock that their relationship is strictly business. In Chicago, Wheeler is impressed by the song and Jordan's voice and offers to sign both Jordan and the songwriter. However, when Miller reveals that the songwriter is Murdock, Wheeler throws him out of his office and vows never to play the song. A furious Murdock bullies bar owners into buying jukeboxes from him instead and successfully promotes his and Jordan's song. To prevent Murdock from stealing his business, Wheeler arranges to have Murdock assassinated at the rock show where Jordan will be making her debut. On his way to the show, Murdock confesses to Mousie that he doesn't want to marry Jordan. Mousie confesses that he altered the tape of Jordan and Miller's phone call and encourages Murdock to let Jordan marry Miller. Backstage at the show, Jordan confesses her love to Miller and they kiss. Jordan also admits that she is a talented singer, who lied because she did not want a show business career; she goes on stage and performs a song about her love for Miller. When Murdock arrives, Miller declares to him that he and Jordan are in love; the delighted Murdock surprises Miller by shaking his hand and offering to be the best man. Before Miller and Murdock can tell Jordan the good news, Wheeler's assassins shoot at Murdock. Miller fights them off and shoves Murdock on stage to perform his song, reasoning that the assassins won't shoot Murdock in front of so many witnesses. Wheeler arrives and, impressed by the audience's response to Murdock, calls off the assassination and signs Murdock instead. The film ends with Miller and Jordan kissing on their honeymoon, as Murdock and Mousie perform on a TV show in the background."

        "content": "The film's influence on rock music is significant. The film reached Liverpool, England, in the early summer of 1957. The cameo performances of early rock 'n' roll stars such as Little Richard, Eddie Cochran, and Gene Vincent and His Bluecaps fascinated a 16-year-old John Lennon by showing him, for the first time, his \"worshipped\" American rock 'n' roll stars as living humans and thus further inspiring him to pursue his own rock 'n' roll dream. On July 6, 1957, 15-year-old Paul McCartney was introduced to Lennon after the latter had performed at a village church garden party with his skiffle group The Quarrymen. McCartney demonstrated his musical prowess to Lennon by performing \"Twenty Flight Rock\" in a manner similar to how he had seen it played by Eddie Cochran in The Girl Can't Help It. This led to Lennon inviting McCartney to join the group. McCartney talks about the film in the documentary series The Beatles Anthology. On September 18, 1968, The Beatles interrupted recording \"Birthday\" at Abbey Road Studios so they could go back to Paul McCartney's house to watch the British TV premiere of the film. Also, some film buffs have pointed to Elvis Presley's famous performance of the song \"Jailhouse Rock\" in MGM's film of the same name (often cited as the first music video), released one year after The Girl Can't Help It, as bearing a remarkable resemblance to the theme and performance of a song called \"Rock Around the Rockpile\" from the earlier film. In that performance, Edmond O'Brien plays a character who seeks to escape an assassination attempt by jumping on stage and singing the lyrics, \"rock, rock, rock around the rockpile,\" while backed up by The Ray Anthony Band wearing striped inmate uniforms. O'Brien, then 42 years old, even awkwardly attempts some of the hip-swiveling and leg motions for which Elvis had already become famous, as he had appeared already 10 times, to cumulative audiences in excess of 180\u00a0million viewers, and on national television, before and during the filming of The Girl Can't Help It, the production of which commenced in mid-September 1956. Other film buffs point to the famous acrobatic dancer and Presley contemporary, as well as MGM star, Russ Tamblyn (Seven Brides for Seven Brothers), who visited Presley at his suite at the Knickerboker Hotel on the night before the filming of the \"Jailhouse Rock\" scene. Presley had had trouble that day at the rehearsals in interpreting what the MGM choreographer, Alex Romero, demanded of him, and Tamblyn's advice at the suite that night helped him perform the first part of that dance sequence (which, incidentally, was witnessed by the then-MGM megastar Gene Kelly).  In fact, The Girl Can't Help It'''s producers had sought to enlist Presley, whose manager, Colonel Tom Parker, however, had demanded too much money. Two uncredited composers on The Girl Can't Help It, Hugo Friedhofer and Lionel Newman, had also composed music for the Elvis film Love Me Tender'', in the same year, 1956."

        "content": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" is a song by American singer Madonna for her seventh studio album, Ray of Light (1998). It was written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and was produced by the singer with William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was released as the fifth and final single from the album on March 2, 1999, by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records. An EDM track on which Madonna experiments with different musical genres, \"Nothing Really Matters\" includes ambient music and electronic noise frequencies that were added by De Vries. Lyrically, the recording delves on the singer's first daughter Lourdes Leon, having also themes of selfishness, affection, and motherhood. The song was critically appreciated for its lyrical content and composition, and was declared by reviewers as one of Madonna's most personal efforts; however, some critics felt it was tepid and lacklustre compared to other tracks from Ray of Light. In the United States, the song remains Madonna's lowest entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 93. Its low chart peak was due to lack of airplay and the delay in releasing it in CD single formats, to which the singer's fans protested against Warner Bros. The song became her 23rd number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart, reaching the top spot in Hungary and Spain, and entering the top ten in countries including Canada, Finland, Iceland, Italy, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video was directed by Swedish director Johan Renck, and was released on February 13, 1999. Inspired by Arthur Golden's 1997 novel Memoirs of a Geisha, the video portrays Madonna as a geisha, dancing in a small room. The red kimono worn by her in the video was designed by French fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier. It was worn by the singer during her performance of the song at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. \"Nothing Really Matters\" is cited as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. The costume and music video has been cited by journalist and academics as one of Madonna's most iconic and best re-inventions."

        "content": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" was written by Madonna and American producer and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom she gave birth to in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. \"That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before,\" she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including \"Nothing Really Matters\". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of \"Nothing Really Matters\"'s music. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work for a long time and was pleased with the demo version, which he started to work on. De Vries, who had worked on the demo, asked Orbit to help produce the song, and was enlisted. According to Madonna: Like an Icon writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had originally composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution \"off-putting\", to which the latter confessed, \"On all the collaborations I'd left a lot of space for him, but for this I wanted to put something on the table and say, 'This is what I think'\". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a \"vision on how the song should be finished\". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the \"DAT's broken\". De Vries defended his contribution saying that it was supposed to be \"like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune.\" Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on. In J. Randy Taraborrelli's book Madonna: An Intimate Biography, the singer said that the main inspiration behind \"Nothing Really Matters\" and \"The Power of Good-Bye\" from the same album, was other people judging and dissecting her creative process. Elaborating on the statement, she added, In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I want people to have a visceral and emotional reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I wanted to say that it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't want people to be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance."

        "content": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" was recorded alongside the rest of the album at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California. Only three other people were in the studio with Madonna during the recording of the song and album: Orbit, recording engineer Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. The track featured no live instrumentation, and was part of a machinery issue that delayed initial recording as Orbit preferred working with sample loops and synth-based instrumentation. As a result, it took a while to finish production of the song, until the computers were repaired. The song was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Studios in New York, and included background vocals from Donna De Lory and Nikki Harris. \"Nothing Really Matters\" is a mid-tempo EDM song which contains influences of techno, downtempo pop, and house music. It is set in time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of F major, with a moderate tempo of 117 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from the lower octave of F3 to the higher note of A4. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune labelled the production as a \"worldly, and weary Madonna\". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly noticed that the \"hard-step beats and synth washes make the romantic-physical yearnings (and hooks) of 'Skin' and 'Nothing Really Matters' even tauter [...]\". J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun felt the song was a \"smart, groove-intensive tune\". Chuck Taylor from Billboard compared the composition of \"Nothing Really Matters\" to the \"disco-encrusted\" \"Vogue\" (1990). However, he found that the \"core\" important part of the song was its \"sweetly-spiritual\" and \"simple\" lyrical content. The song begins with a \"strange, electronic, slightly broken noise\" that spans between the start of the song up until 54 seconds. The ambient-influenced beginning gives the impression that \"Nothing Really Matters\" would be a ballad, but in the minute mark, it changes to a mid-tempo dance-pop song. The ambient music becomes restrained, although a cursory bleeping sound can be heard from the right to the left. The background has a number of faint strings in it, which signifies the depth of the stereo field. The chorus starts with a fast-pacing dance sound, over which Madonna sings, \"Nothing really matters / love is all we need / everything I give you / all comes back to me.\" Throughout the entire song, it includes two verses, three choruses, one bridge section, and an outro. The bridge is backed by piano sounds with a descending sequence by a couple of bars. Madonna sings the same lyrics in the outro, but is slowed down and echoed longer until the music fades out. The lyrics are about the birth of Madonna's daughter Lourdes, and the realization of motherhood. In an interview with the Wesleyan University Press, the singer stated: \"There's a song on the album called 'Nothing Really Matters', and it is very much inspired by my daughter. it's just realizing that at the end of the day, the most important thing is loving people and sharing love. The birth of my daughter has been a huge influence. It's different to look at life through the eyes of a child, and suddenly you have a whole new respect for life and you kind of get your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'.\" Based on the lyrical content, Bryan Lark from The Michigan Daily reviewed the parent album, and concluded that as the single \"Ray of Light\" was about confronting the past, \"Nothing Really Matters\" conversely is about \"moving onward.\""

        "content": "Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, Kevin C. Johnson from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Chris Gernard from Metro Weekly highlighted \"Nothing Really Matters\" as one of Ray of Lights best tracks. Erlewine, who also wrote Madonna's biography for the website, cited the song as one of her career standouts. Chuck Taylor from Billboard labeled the song as a \"gem\" and commended the \"irresistible hook\". From the same publication, Jason Lipshutz commented, \"What if the suave dance of 'Nothing Really Matters', the eye-popping 'Ray of Light' music video or the stark beauty of 'Frozen' never existed? Luckily, we never need to find out.\" Paul Moody from NME noted that the song \"floats by almost as if it's asleep, a knowing return to the disco diva-effortlessness of 'Vogue', but with Madonna free from the narcissistic outer-shell of old, free to announce: \"I've realised/No-one wins...\"\" Rolling Stone said, \"Songs like the title track and 'Nothing Really Matters' are filled with warmth and wonder.\" \"A bubbly, infectious piece of shufflebeat\u2026\" Stuart Maconie wrote in a Q review of Ray of Light, \"but aberrant items continually swim into view, like a tumbling, atonal piano solo right out of Schoenberg.\" Sunday Mirror said it is the \"best pop tune\" from the album. Stephen Thompson from The A.V. Club was positive, stating that the \"chugging\" chorus and composition \"should ring across dance floors for years to come[...]\" Nathan Smith from the Houston Press was also positive, stating, \"Few singles illustrated [Madonna's change in musical approach] better than 'Nothing Really Matters'\". He concluded, \"It's a great, bouncy dance track that never received the love it deserved, and its family-friendly themes are a good fit for the event.\" However, Enio Chiola from PopMatters felt the song's commercial appeal and production was inferior to other album tracks, and stated that \"Skin\"\u2014another song from Ray of Light\u2014would have been a better release. Jose F. Promis from AllMusic reviewed the single and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of five. He suggested that the original album version was somewhat \"tepid\", and commented, \"This single is a case of where the production supersedes the song, which in and of itself is among Madonna's simplest and least interesting tunes.\" However, he commended the remixes, including the \"Eastern Asian\", \"chillout\" and \"several club cuts\". Medium's Richard LaBeau opined that it was a \"perfectly fine cut from her best album, but there are several other songs on the album that are better and would have made more interesting singles\". Billboards Nolan Feeney noted, \"She keeps the platitudes from sounding empty by taking her younger self to task [...] Dance music is often a tool for artists and listeners to build their identities; here, Madonna uses pulsing beats to shed her skin\". Ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, The Guardians Jude Rogers placed \"Nothing Really Matters\" at number 39, calling it a \"heavenly ode to motherhood\". At the 2000 ASCAP Rhythm and Soul Awards, \"Nothing Really Matters\" was nominated for the Award-Winning Dance Song award; this was Madonna's first nomination in that category, and was her second nomination at the awards since the previous year, when her song \"Ray of Light\" was nominated, and eventually won the Top Dance Song award. \"Nothing Really Matters\" eventually won the award, becoming her first win in that category; she won it again in 2002 for \"Don't Tell Me\"."

Jose F. Promis from AllMusic believed the single's lack of charting success in North America was due \"to the terrible timing of the single's release, which was much after radio and club airplay had peaked.\" Many fans in North America blamed Warner Bros. Records' marketing strategy for the song's poor charting. \"Nothing Really Matters\" was also the first time since 1994's Bedtime Stories that Madonna charted four singles from her album on the Hot 100. In Canada, the song reached a peak of number seven on the RPM Singles Chart. In the United Kingdom, \"Nothing Really Matters\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number seven on March 13, 1999.

        "content": "An accompanying music video for \"Nothing Really Matters\" was directed by Johan Renck and filmed on January 9, 1999, at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, New York. According to a behind-the-scenes interview with Entertainment Tonight, Madonna stated that the inspiration behind the video was from the 1997 Arthur Golden novel Memoirs of a Geisha. She later stated, \"The whole idea of a geisha is a straight metaphor for being an entertainer because, on one hand you're privileged to be a geisha, but on the other hand you're a prisoner [...]\" Madonna choreographed her own moves in the video, since she \"[did not] like how other people say how I should move, I'm my own best choreographer.\" In an interview with American broadcaster and journalist Larry King, Madonna commented about the geisha depiction, \"[...] there was a character in the book called Hatsumomo and she's been my muse for the past six months. So I don't know.\" She stated that her daughter, at the time, called Madonna the novel's character, Hatsumomo, which the singer found intriguing yet bizarre. The red kimono that Madonna wore in the music video was created by French fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier. Her main look for the video consisted of heavy eye make-up and a pale face with dark, straight hair, as well as a pair red ankle high boots to accompany the kimono. The kimono was tailored by a large red leather belt. Madonna wore the kimono again for her performance at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. The look was then re-designed by Gaultier and the Italian fashion duo Dean and Dan Caten for Madonna's 2001 Drowned World Tour. The visual for \"Nothing Really Matters\" premiered on MTV on February 13, 1999.  The video can be found on Madonna's 1999 compilation, The Video Collection 93:99."

        "content": "The video opens with an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to what looks like a baby, but is actually a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features a group of people of Asian heritage, who walk down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on through the rest of the song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black. The music video received favorable reviews from critics. Soman S. Chainani from The Crimson was positive in his review, stating, \"The video is deliciously subversive. In a sense, Madonna consciously sheds layers of her post-modern act during the 4:25 minute video, daring us to piece together its clues.\" Labelling it a \"surreal\" video with \"angular\" imagery and direction, he concluded, \"Random? Of course not. Realizing it's all the pieces of a puzzle, we grasp the stunning answer. Madonna is, in all truth, a modern-day geisha. She is trapped within her corridor, without the least privacy, but she is free to perform.\" A reviewer from HitFix commented, \"[The video] is a gorgeous futuristic creation and one of Madonna's most underrated videos. Dark and hypnotic, 'Matters' features unconventional choreography that was initially off putting to many (at least for 1999), but in actuality director Johan Renck has created a visual spectacle that demands repeat viewing. It also features one of Madonna's more inspired video performances.\" At the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, Renck, Bjorn Benckert and Tor-Bjorn Olsson were all nominated for Best Special Effects in a Video. This was Madonna's second sub-credited nomination in that category, having been nominated, and eventually won for the same award a year prior with her single \"Frozen\". Madonna was also nominated three times for her single \"Beautiful Stranger\" that same year. However, Renck, Benckert, and Olsson lost to Sean Broughton, Stuart D. Gordon and Paul Simpson of Digital Domain with their work on \"Special\" by American-Scottish band Garbage; this remains Madonna's final video to be nominated in that category."

        "content": "On February 24, 1999, Madonna performed \"Nothing Really Matters\" as the opening number of the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. The performance was held and recorded at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California. The stage had two large Japanese infrastructures on either side, a black screen, and a semi-large bench on which Madonna stood. The performance opened with the lights beaming on Madonna, who wore the red Gaultier kimono, red platform boots, and black bob hairstyle. The chorus started with four back-up dancers holding plastic bag, similar to the Japanese people in the music video, and a background dancer being projected on screen. By the second chorus, Madonna's back-up vocalists started singing atop the benches wearing similar kimonos. During the song's bridge interlude, a man entered the stage and started performing with flamed rope. When Madonna won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the same ceremony, she came onstage with Orbit to accept the award in the red kimono. The live performance received positive reviews from most music critics; Jason Kaufman from NY Rock commented, \"Her constant nationality morphing has got to go. With her geisha-girl-gone-club-hopping outfit last night, [...] the woman proved she's a walking Epcot Center, long on fashion and short on culture. And what were those women dancing behind her in her musical number holding? The objects looked like fetuses from last week's The X-Files\". Bradley Stern from Idolator hosted a poll, asking viewers what was their best Madonna Grammy performance. Alongside the 1999 Grammys, Stern listed Madonna's performances of \"Music\" at the 2001 ceremony, \"Hung Up\" at the 2006 ceremony, and \"Same Love\" and \"Open Your Heart\" at the 2014 ceremony. \"Nothing Really Matters\" came third in the poll with 102 votes. InStyle staff highlighted the performance as one of the best Grammy performances to date."

        "content": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" has been noted as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. Louis Virtel from NewNowNext listed the song at number 94 on their Top 100 Madonna Songs list, stating, \"Copping both new-age maxims and Beatle sentiments ('Everything I give you all comes back to me'), 'Nothing Really Matters' is as queer and curious as a red patent-leather geisha costume.\" The Gaultier kimono has been cited by several publications as one of Madonna's most notable re-inventions and looks, including fashion magazines InStyle, Elle and Harper's Bazaar. Alongside this, the kimono has been recognized as one of the Grammy's best and worst looks. Louis Virtel listed the music video at number 49 on his ranking of 55 Best Music Videos by Madonna. Julien Sauvalle from Out listed the video at number eight on his Top 20 Most Stylist Madonna music videos list. Idolator's Nicole Sta called the clip as one of Madonna's best music videos. Nikki Ogunnaike from Glamour magazine listed the video as one of Madonna's Top 5 Most Fashionable music videos. The geisha look was further reproduced for Madonna's appearance on the May\u2013June 1999 issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine. The singer took partial creative control of the issue, and requested photographer of the shoot Patrick Demarchelier to incorporate elements of the novel Memoirs of a Geisha into it, both visually and typographically. Three covers were selected for different regions around the world. In 2016, the geisha look was adapted on the Logo TV series RuPaul's Drag Race, season eight. The show's host, RuPaul, announced that contestants had to create a gown that was inspired by Madonna's iconic looks. Four drag queen contestants wore the geisha look, including one sporting a similar look from the singer's music video \"Paradise (Not for Me)\". A fifth contestant decided on wearing a kimono from the video of \"Nothing Really Matters\", but changed. This runway show was criticized by Vulture, for the lack of variety of Madonna's iconic looks outside of \"Nothing Really Matters\". Masahiro Ito has cited the song's music video as one of the inspirations for his work on the video game Silent Hill 2 (2001)."

        "content": "\"All Is Full of Love\" is a song by Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk from her third studio album, Homogenic (1997). The lyrics were inspired by love in spring and Ragnar\u00f6k of Norse mythology. Bj\u00f6rk's original version is a trip hop ballad with soul influences, harp, strings, and electronic beats; the version on Homogenic is a minimalist remix by Howie B, emphasising Bj\u00f6rk's vocals. A remix by the German IDM duo Funkst\u00f6rung was released as a single in 1998. In 1999, \"All Is Full of Love\" was released as a single with a music video directed by Chris Cunningham. The video uses Bj\u00f6rk's original mix, and depicts Bj\u00f6rk as a robot being assembled in a factory, who passionately kisses another robot. The video is often cited as one of the best of all time and a milestone in computer animation; it has been displayed in art exhibitions and was on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The single reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and became a dance hit in the United States. \"All Is Full of Love\" is the opening track on Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were voted for by fans. It has been covered by various artists."

        "content": "\"All Is Full of Love\", the closing track of Homogenic, was the album's last song to be written and recorded. Produced by Bj\u00f6rk, the original version of the song was replaced \"at the last minute\" with a remixed version by Howie B. It was inspired by the spring while producing the album in M\u00e1laga, Spain. After living in the mountains among other people for six months, Bj\u00f6rk felt lonely, but a morning walk in April inspired her to write the track. She had a rough winter and then she realised it was spring after she could hear the birds singing. She wrote and recorded the song in half a day. In keeping with Homogenic's theme as a tribute to Bj\u00f6rk's native Iceland, the track was inspired by Icelandic mythology, such as the Ragnar\u00f6k. The previous track, \"Pluto\", stands for death and destruction, whereas \"All Is Full of Love\" stands for a new beginning. Bj\u00f6rk also called it a song about \"believing in love\" and expressed that \"love isn't just about two persons. It's everywhere around you. Even if you're not getting love from Person A, it doesn't mean there's not love there.\" However, she also described it as \"taking the piss\", considering it the most \"sugary song\" ever. As the song opposes the rest of Homogenic'''s \"macho\" aesthetic, Bj\u00f6rk has said it could have been included on Vespertine. The lyrics begin with a promise of protection and caretaking: \"You'll be given love / You'll be taken care of / You'll have to trust it\". The song moves towards a more reproachful tone as Bj\u00f6rk sings, \"You just ain't receiving / Your phone is off the hook / Your doors are shut\", tempered by the recognition that you have to \"twist your head around you\" because \"love is all around you\". This is musically effected by Bj\u00f6rk's vocals as she sings the lyric \"All is full of love\" in counterpoint with herself. The album version of the track does not have drum accompaniment and portrays an ambient song. It does not have Homogenic's characteristic electronic beats, focusing instead on \"[creating] an intimacy between the growing dynamics of the instrumentation and Bjork's impressive vocal abilities.\" It uses a long reverb, which results in a wash of sound that suggests a very large space suggestive of the \"heavenly\" environment Bj\u00f6rk envisaged for the track. According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the song has a soft pulse with intervals that build up to an electronic orchestration of industrial beats. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called it a \"moony lullaby\" and compared it to the music of Enya. In his review for Spin, James Hunter wrote that the track is one of the times Bj\u00f6rk \"dips her toe into the warm lake of tradition\" and noted its \"rockish minor-key verses traipse off into her gospel.\" The video version of the song is a midtempo trip hop ballad with soul influences. In opposition to the sonically minimalist mix included on the album, this version has been described as \"lushly produced\" and includes \"fluttering\" harps and \"shivering\" strings. Reportedly the best known and the preferred version by Bj\u00f6rk's fans and herself, it is further known under the names of \"Mark Stent Mix\" and \"Video Mix\"."

This remix had been previously distributed as a B-side for \"Hunter\" (1998), and another remix of the song had been released as a B-side of \"J\u00f3ga\" in 1998. In January 1999, it was announced that the track would be released later that year as a single and that its music video would be shot soon. It was atypical to release a single for promoting an album released two years before, but Bj\u00f6rk purposely decided to do this so that the music video was more of a short film than a marketing move. The original release date for the single was 2 May 1999, but was later extended out two weeks to 17 May. To coincide with this announcement, Funkst\u00f6rung's remix was made available again and an official logo for the release was unveiled. The music video was released that April, although the premiere of the single was pushed back to 7 June 1999. \"All Is Full of Love\" was released as two 12-inch singles, two CD singles, a DVD single, and a box set, which included the CD singles and the music video in VHS format. Some publications regard the single as the first DVD single release. In the United Kingdom, it was also made available as two different promotional singles in 1999, and as two VHS singles. B-sides include remixes by \u03bc-Ziq, Funkst\u00f6rung, Plaid, Guy Sigsworth, Mark Stent and Howie B. The single's artwork consists of shots from the music video and features the official logo, which can be seen in the video as well.

        "content": "The music video for \"All Is Full of Love\" was directed by Chris Cunningham. Bj\u00f6rk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in Bj\u00f6rk contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought a Chinese Kama Sutra as a guide to what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not figure out how to make the video explicit yet broadcastable. Bj\u00f6rk said: \"I think the only thing I said was that I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean.\" She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be \"white\" and \"frozen\", and then it \"melts because of love\" and \"making love\". When Cunningham first heard the track, he wrote down the words \"milk\", \"sexual\", \"surgery\", and \"white porcelain\"; they outline what would become the music video. Concerning this, Cunningham added that it was like Kama Sutra meeting Industrial Robotics and that because of the surreal nature of the images, they could be \"sexually suggestive\" as they liked.  Initially, it was planned that during the visual's ending, the robots would unfold like a flower as they mated, revealing an abstract life form made from the two artificial forms. However, the team could not manage to materialize this thought. The robots were designed by Cunningham and were built in full-size by Paul Catling \u2014 who had also sculpted the masks for Aphex Twin's \"Windowlicker\" (1999) \u2014 in clay in two hours. He also worked with Julian Caldow in set design, which was created by Chris Oddy. The treatment described the set as an \"elegant\" and \"white environment\" with \"a Japanese feel to it\". However, the music video's director was dissatisfied with the result and relied heavily on post-production. On the shoot there were two main robot arms, but during its post production, a third and fourth robot arm were created in computer-generated imagery. The video was shot at Bray Studios and Greenford Studios, and post-production was handled by Glasswork using the software programs Softimage and Flame. Cunningham said that every shot in the clip had four layers. He reportedly first shot the set and the props doing nothing for about 21 seconds, and then removed the robot and replaced it with Bj\u00f6rk, who had her face painted white and wore a blue suit. Using a mix of the master shot and a live feed of Bj\u00f6rk in frame, the production team tried to match up her face and the robot body as much as possible. Only Bj\u00f6rk's eyes and mouth were used, with the rest of the robot representing 3D animation traced from her real head. Cunningham has described the filming process as an unpleasant experience: Bj\u00f6rk left Cunningham alone to work for the video, refusing to see the product until it was finished, explaining that \"when you come across someone as special as Chris you just go humble\", which Cunningham said made the work much easier."

        "content": "The video begins with a journey through a dark environment wrought with cables and a faint pulsating light. The sequence has been described as \"womb-like, voyeuristic, as if the black box of technology is about to open up\". The camera follows these cables to an ethereal, white room where a robot with Bj\u00f6rk's features lies in a fetal position. As the room lightens up, two mechanical arms begin to assemble the robot, which opens its eyes and begins to sing the song. Pistons pumping white fluids, as well as drilling and penetrative motions are seen, featuring a \"clear\" sexual subtext. Now sitting upright, the robot looks up to see another robotic Bj\u00f6rk as the machines stop the assembly. It smiles and extends its hand to the sitting robot, joining in the song. In the climax of the video, the robots passionately kiss and embrace while the machines assemble their backs and light comes and goes. The images of the kissing robots are interposed with shots of white fluid washing over robotic parts and the mechanical arms assembling them. According to the Institute for the Unstable Media, \"as the music fades and the pulsating beat becomes more dominant, we are once again drawn in the womb-like dark space, making it clear to us that we sampled a glimpse of a black-boxed kingdom\"."

Music journalist Mark Pytlik wrote the visual \"marked an unquestionable creative apex for Bj\u00f6rk's visual work, a perfect synthesis of form and content\". IGN gave the video a score of 9/10, writing it is an \"utterly gorgeous sight to behold\" and \"just about perfect\". Times Craig Duff called it a milestone in computer animation and stated that \"no robot had expressed the sensuality that director Chris Cunningham imbues in a Bj\u00f6rk-bot in the video\". MusicRadar considered the music video to be \"one of the most visually striking promos of Bj\u00f6rk's career.\" NME also praised the \"All Is Full of Love\" clip as one of Bj\u00f6rk's best, and particularly commended the wide angle shot of the cyborgs kissing as the chorus kicks in. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine dubbed it \"the perfect pre-millennial precursor to our current gadget-assisted culture of self-love\" and also wrote, \"When it was released, I thought it looked cool and stressed the importance of loving yourself. Now I think it's a terrifying and sealed-off nightmare wherein you find out that you are the only person who will ever love you.\" Writing for Pitchfork Media, Scott Plagenhoef considered that \"the strongest single images from any video of the 1990s come from [the clip]\", also calling it \"strange and moving\". CMJ New Music Monthlys Douglas Wolk called the video \"magnificent\" and praised it for \"[bringing] out the beauty of the song\"."

Other awards received at festivals include the second place of the Prix PIXEL-INA Best Script in the 2000 Imagina, and the music video award at the London Effects and Animation Festival. At the D&AD Awards, the video was awarded prizes in Video Direction, Cinematography, Animation, and Special Effects. Furthermore, at the MVPA Awards, Cunningham received the award for Best Direction of a Female Artist in a Music Video. Bj\u00f6rk won two awards at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000: Breakthrough Video and Best Special Effects in a Video. The music video also received the Best Special Effects in a Music Video and Best 3D Animation Music Video during the 2000 International Monitor Awards. Particularly, the visual won various nominations: Best Video at the 1999 Ericcson Muzik Awards, Best Short Form Music Video at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, and Best Alternative Video, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing in a Video at the 2000 Music Week Awards. In 2008, MTV2 ranked the music video as number one on their list \"Greatest Music Videos Ever\". In 2011, \"All Is Full of Love\" was placed at number 14 in MusicRadar's list of the 30 best music videos of all time, and was placed in Times list of The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos. The video was also listed as the fifth-greatest of all time by NME, and the ninth top music video of the decade by Pitchfork Media. In addition, \"All Is Full of Love\" has been included in various art exhibitions and museums, including DEAF04 Exhibition in the V2_Institute for the Unstable Media in Rotterdam, Chris Cunningham in MoMA PS1 in New York City, the 49th Venice Biennale, While Interwoven Echoes Drip into a Hybrid Body\u00a0\u2013 an Exhibition about Sound, Performance and Sculpture in the Migros Museum f\u00fcr Gegenwartskunst in Z\u00fcrich, and This Is Not a Love Song in La Virreina Centre de la Imatge in Barcelona. The music video was also on permanent exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Chris Cunningham served as a model for a character in the novel Pattern Recognition (2003) by William Gibson, in which a fictitious music video director who puts \"robot girls in his video\" makes a clip characterized by the following words: \"No sci-fi kitsch for Damien. Dreamlike things in the dawn half-light, their small breasts gleaming, white plastic shining faints as old marble\", as a reference to \"All Is Full of Love\". In 2004, similarities were noted between the design of the robots in the music video and those in the film I, Robot, raising accusations of plagiarism by fans. E! News contacted Cunningham and 20th Century Fox\u2014the studio behind the film\u2014but neither of them returned calls for comment. According to Tymon Smith of The Times, 2015 American film Chappie \"ends with a rip off\" of the music video. It also was an inspiration for the opening title sequence of the television series Westworld."

The song was part of the set list for her Homogenic Tour, on which Bj\u00f6rk embarked with Mark Bell and Icelandic String Octet from late 1997 to early 1999. \"All Is Full of Love\" was also performed during the Vespertine World Tour in 2001, which featured Vespertine collaborators Matmos and Zeena Parkins, an Inuit choir, and an orchestra. During the tour, Bj\u00f6rk performed in concert halls and opera houses in order to \"have the best acoustics possible\" and avoid the \"appalling acoustics\" of stadiums and rock venues. The track was the most performed of the tour, alongside \"Frosti\" and \"Pagan Poetry\". Bj\u00f6rk's concert at the Royal Opera House of 16 December 2001, which included a performance of the song, was broadcast on BBC Four and released as the DVD Live at Royal Opera House in 2002. A live version of the track can also be found on the tour documentary DVD Minuscule of 2003. A Vespertine Tour live version of the song was released through Vespertine Live, a live album of the tour included in the box set Live Box (2003). The headliner of the 2002 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Bj\u00f6rk opened the set with the track, wearing a white Comme des Gar\u00e7ons dress. This performance was included on the 2006 video documentary Coachella. The song was also part of the set list of the Greatest Hits Tour (2003), which once again featured the Icelandic String Octet, but with the addition of Vespertine World Tour collaborators Matmos and Zeena Parkins. It was one of the most played songs of the tour. Bj\u00f6rk's performance of the song in New York City during the tour was included in the 2005 documentary film Screaming Masterpiece. \"All Is Full of Love\" was also performed during the Volta Tour (2007\u201308), a tour she undertook with Mark Bell, J\u00f3nas Sen, Damian Taylor, Chris Corsano, and a 10-piece female brass band. Several of the concerts were part of festivals, including Coachella, Glastonbury, and Rock en Seine, among others. A live performance of the track during the tour was included in the box set Volta\u00efc (2009), specifically the CD Songs from the Volta Tour Performed Live at the Olympic Studios. The track was also performed a few times during Bj\u00f6rk's Biophilia Tour (2011\u201313). The song was performed only once on the 2015 Vulnicura Tour."

Finding a convenience store in the middle of a robbery, he kills the clerk; the thief is subsequently killed in a shootout with police. As Cordell stalks the streets, his enemies Officers Jack Forrest and Theresa Mallory are put back on duty by Deputy Commissioner Edward Doyle, who has the two undergo a psychiatric evaluation under Officer Susan Riley. While Jack is content that Cordell is dead, Theresa is convinced that Cordell is still alive and plotting his revenge. At a newsstand, Jack is fatally stabbed by Cordell. In order to protect the memory of Commissioner Pike, the corrupt official who originally framed Cordell, the police authority refuse to inform the public of the nature of recent events. This, along with her belief that Cordell is alive and killing, prompts Theresa to appear on a talk show to inform the public about Cordell. A traffic cop is murdered by Cordell later while attempting to tow a man's car. The man who was having his car towed is arrested on suspicion on the cop's murder. While en route to a hotel in a taxi, Theresa is joined by Susan, and the two are attacked by Cordell, who kills the cabbie and forces Susan and Theresa off the road. After handcuffing Susan to the steering wheel of a car and sending her into the busy streets, Cordell kills Theresa by snapping her neck. Gaining control of the car, Susan crashes and is found by authorities. Elsewhere, a stripper named Cheryl is attacked in her apartment by Steven Turkell, who has strangled at least six other exotic dancers. Cordell arrives, murders two officers  whom Cheryl called for, and helps Turkell escape. Turkell befriends Cordell and takes him back to his apartment, where Cordell stays for a short while. After Cordell leaves, Turkell visits a strip club, where he is identified by Cheryl to Susan and Detective Lieutenant Sean McKinney. He is arrested and placed in a holding cell. Cordell breaks into the police station, murders nineteen police officers, and frees Turkell and several unnamed convicts. Using Susan as a hostage, Turkell, Cordell, and another criminal named Joseph Blum hijack a prison bus and head to Sing Sing, where Turkell believes Cordell wants to free all the inmates and create an army of criminals. McKinney and Doyle follow, and McKinney convinces Doyle to reopen Cordell's case and rebury his casket with full honors on the assumption that this will appease Cordell. Cordell gains entry into the prison using Blum's paperwork, and kills a guard for his keys. Shortly after entering death row, Cordell is contacted over the prison PA system by Doyle, who admits to Cordell that he was set up and states that his case has been reopened. After hearing Doyle's announcement, Cordell abandons Turkell, Blum, and Susan and heads deeper into the prison, where he is attacked with a Molotov cocktail by the three inmates who originally mutilated and killed him. While on fire, Cordell kills the three convicts who mutilated him, only to be attacked by Turkell. As Cordell and Turkell fight, the two crash through a wall, fall onto the bus below, and seemingly die when the vehicle explodes. Some time later, Cordell is buried with full honors alongside 19 other deceased officers he murdered; Susan and McKinney attend his funeral. As Cordell's casket is lowered, McKinney throws Cordell's badge into the grave, leaves with Susan, and monologues about how justice and pressure are the only differences between a cop and a \"Maniac Cop\". Then the camera slowly and eerily zooms in on Cordell's gravesite. After a few seconds, Cordell's hand unexpectedly bursts through the lid of his casket (in a jump scare) and quickly grabs his badge, as the screen cuts to black, and the credits roll."

Taylor concluded his review by saying that the \"reluctance to remove the album from your stereo is surely proof enough that this is one of the most potentially amazing bands inhabiting the metalcore scene\".

It features a line-up of Trevor Horn, Anne Dudley, Paul Morley and Lol Creme, along with other appearances from John Hurt, soprano Sally Bradshaw, Rakim, and Donna Lewis. As it had been 10 years since their last album, this album carries a completely different sound to that which had defined their four previous albums. The group blended the music of French impressionist composer Claude Debussy with drum and bass, opera, hip hop, jazz, and narration, to create a concept album which they described as \"the soundtrack to a film that wasn't made about the life of Claude Debussy.\" The album was announced in mid-1998 as being due for release by the end of that year, but did not release until mid-1999. The album was only released on CD and MiniDisc formats. The UK edition was released 28 June 1999, while the US edition was released 29 June 1999. The Japan edition was released 1 December 1999."

        "content": "\"Dirrty\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera featuring American rapper Redman, released as the lead single from her fourth studio album Stripped. Despite Aguilera's first three years of commercial success, she was displeased with the lack of control over her image. In response, she desired to create a song that would represent her authentic persona. She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder and suggested using Redman's 2001 song \"Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get in da Club)\" as a guide. The final result, \"Dirrty\", is an R&B and hip hop song that also features rapping verses from Redman and describes sexual activities. RCA Records sent \"Dirrty\" to American radio stations on September 3, 2002, as the lead single from Stripped. RCA and Bertelsmann Music Group later released the song as a CD single. The song peaked at number 48 on the US Billboard 100. Outside of the United States, \"Dirrty\" saw significant success in the British Isles, topping the charts in both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, the song peaked within the top 10 in many countries including Australia, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. David LaChapelle directed the music video for \"Dirrty\", which was intended to publicize Aguilera's new image. Depicting sexual fetishes such as mud wrestling and muscle worshipping, the controversial video eliminated her previous image as a bubblegum pop singer. Various news publications and other recording artists criticized the video, and it was banned on Thai television due to its sexual content, but Aguilera defended the video, calling it inspirational as it put her to the forefront. \"Dirrty\" was included on the setlists of Aguilera's four major concert tours: the Justified and Stripped Tour (2003), the Stripped Tour (2003), Back to Basics Tour (2006\u20132008), and the Liberation Tour (2018)."

        "content": "American singer Christina Aguilera rose to prominence with the success of her 1999 self-titled debut album. It topped the US Billboard 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It produced three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\", and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\". Despite the success, Aguilera was displeased with being marketed as her then-manager Steve Kurtz desired, and felt unable to control her image. She told The Sydney Morning Herald her dissatisfaction with being a part of the late 1990s teen pop trend, \"The label [RCA Records] wanted to push the cookie-cutter, [...] almost virginal kind of imagery that wasn't me,\" Aguilera explained. \"I really wanted to squirm away from that, because I really thought it was really fake and superficial and untrue of what I was about.\" \"Dirrty\" was among the last tracks to be recorded for Aguilera's 2002 album, Stripped. It was recorded at the Enterprise Studios in Burbank and Conway Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles by Oscar Ramirez, Wassim Zreik, and Dylan \"3-D\" Dresdow. Aguilera desired to create a \"down and dirty\" song that would announce her new image. She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder, who had worked with her on \"Lady Marmalade\", and suggested recording a song in the vein of Redman's 2001 hip hop song \"Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get in da Club)\". \"Dirrty\" ultimately became a \"near-remake\" of its predecessor, as Entertainment Weekly said. Rapper Redman, who previously appeared on Eminem's 2001 song \"Off the Wall\", in which Eminem disses Aguilera, is featured on the song. Aguilera intended to use a misspelled title to personalize the song, also considering \"Dirtee\" or \"Dirrdy\". The title reflects the music video, which Aguilera describes as \"gritty, [with] underground, illegal stuff going on.\""

The lines in the refrain and Redman's rapping verses are emphasized by a pair of B\u266d octave dyads. Aguilera's vocal range on the track spans F3 to F#5. Redman's original ape-like sounds from \"Let's Get Dirty\" are also featured on \"Dirrty\". According to Stylus Magazine's Todd Burns, the song features a bassline which \"doesn't quite mesh with the song in a natural way\" and an \"effective\" overdubbing technique. The song's lyrics detail sexual activities such as table dancing. Jon Pareles noted that Aguilera was determined to shed her teen pop image that she achieved with her early works, and decided to show her sexuality and aggression in the \"self-explanatory\" \"Dirrty\". A sequel to the song entitled \"Still Dirrty\" was recorded by Aguilera for her 2006 album, Back to Basics."

Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called it \"the most instantly gratifying\" song from Stripped. Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine labeled it \"one of the most interesting songs of the year\" and compared its styles to Britney Spears' \"image transformation\" on \"I'm a Slave 4 U\". In a separate review, Burns deemed it the best single of 2002, writing, \"That's what pop music is all about, appealing to as many people as possible.\" Writing for The Guardian, Betty Clarke described the song's lyrics as \"majestically filthy.\" Reviewing Aguilera's 2008 compilation album Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits, Nick Levine from Digital Spy called \"Dirrty\" the \"sluttiest, sweatiest club banger in recent memory.\" Jancee Dunn called the release of \"Dirrty\" as the lead single \"a shame\" and opined that it misrepresented the rest of the album. Likewise, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic was disappointed towards the track's being released as the lead single and found Aguilera's vocal range in the song too narrow. Michael Paoletta from Billboard called the song \"horribly derivative\", while NMEs Jim Wirth said that \"Dirrty\" was \"probably the pick of an inconsistent crop.\" Entertainment Weekly critic Seymour Craig gave it a D-, calling Aguilera's voice \"desperate and shrill,\" and found it to be an unsuccessful attempt to gain street cred. \"Dirrty\" won the Best Single award at the 2003 Q Awards. The song also earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 45th Grammy Awards, but lost to Santana's \"The Game of Love\" featuring Michelle Branch."

Aguilera took boxing lessons to prepare for the video, and more than 100 dancers auditioned. Aguilera wanted to make sure that she and LaChapelle had the same vision for the video, never wanted to be \"glossy or pretty.\" A scene where Aguilera is lowered into a boxing ring in a cage and a dance routine in the ring were filmed on the first day. The following day, a foxy boxing scene, a table dancing part, a party scene with Redman's rapping his verse, and a shower scene were filmed. The video premiered on MTV on September 30, 2002, on Making the Video, and was described as \"a post-apocalyptic orgy.\" The video opens with Aguilera gearing up and riding a motorcycle into a nightclub. Wearing a bikini and butt-baring chaps, she is lowered from a cage into a boxing ring and dances, accompanied by several backup dancers. A masked woman is lowered into the ring, and the two engage in foxy boxing. The scene is intercut with sequences of Aguilera dancing in a red belly top, which she later took off to reveal a bra, and a microskirt. Redman then proceeds down a hallway, passing people such as mud wrestlers, a contortionist, and furries. The video proceeds to a scene of Aguilera and backup dancers splashing and dancing while being sprayed with water in a room.

Despite controversy, \"Dirrty\" is considered to be Aguilera's most recognized music video, with the singer herself calling it her \"personal favorite from her catalog\" in 2018, even wearing the infamous chaps from the video on both her Liberation Tour (2018) and her Vegas residency The Xperience (2019\u20132020). \"Dirrty\" was picked as the fifth greatest music video throughout TRL history in the final countdown on November 16, 2008. LA Weekly selected it as the fourth greatest music video on TRL, writing: \"Ass-less chaps: An underutilized pop star accessory.\" The video was nominated for Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, Best Pop Video, and Best Choreography at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. It also earned six nominations at the 2003 Music Video Production Association Awards, and won two: Best Styling and Best Make-Up. The video ranked at number 100 on Slant Magazine's list of \"The 100 Greatest Music Videos of All Time\" in 2003. In late 2008, the video was voted the ninth \"Sexiest Music Video of All Time\" by over a quarter of a million FHM readers in a poll the magazine ran worldwide. It also appeared at number two on VH1 list of \"Scandalously Sexy Music Videos\" in 2013. When Aguilera's collaborator Linda Perry first saw the video, she asked Aguilera: \"Are you high? This is annoying. Why are you doing this?\" Protests also occurred in Thailand over Thai-language posters in the video that translate to \"Thailand's Sex Tourism\" and \"Young Underage Girls\". LaChapelle stated that he was unaware of what the posters stated, and Aguilera's recording company in the country banned Thai television stations from playing the video. The public widely rejected Aguilera's new image so much that it began to overshadow her music. Tim Walker from The Independent wrote: \"[Aguilera] simulated masturbation while wearing little more than a pair of leather chaps.\" Entertainment Weekly described Aguilera's image in the video as \"the world's skeeziest reptile woman,\" and The Village Voice captioned her as a xenomorph from the Alien series. Aguilera's contemporaries Shakira, Kelly Osbourne, and Jessica Simpson expressed disapproval of the video. Time magazine commented that \"she appeared to have arrived on the set... direct from an intergalactic hooker convention.\" Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone dubbed the video Girls Gone Wild: Beyond Thunderdome. Writer Emma Forrest remarked: \"What she's depicting is subcultures within sexuality, and to say that this is normal young woman's sexuality is just not fair. Even Madonna never did that to girls.\" Aguilera responded to the criticism in Blender: In 2017, Amy Roberts of Bustle noticed that Aguilera received a sexist, misogynistic backlash because of \"Dirrty's\" music video, while also remarked that it \"wasn't made to specifically fulfill heterosexual male fantasies\". According to Roberts, the video was \"grimy and subversive, and it had an overbearing aggressive sexuality that wasn't accessible to the masses\". She further praised the video as \"raw\", \"visceral\" and \"ahead of time\", and believed \"it was exactly what the music industry needed to happen in the early '00s\" because of its inappropriateness. Despite the criticism, the video was a number-one video on MTV's countdown series TRL in October 2002. In January 2021, WWE wrestler Liv Morgan have paid tribute to Aguilera's clothing in the video\u2014she wore an identical outfit during the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event."

For the 2003 Justified & Stripped Tour and Stripped Tour, it was the opening song on the setlists. For the performance, Aguilera appeared in torso-baring black outfit and black hair, which, according to the San Francisco Chronicles Neva Cholin and MTV's Christina Fuoco, resembled Cher's styles. The performance at the Wembley Arena in London was recorded for the 2004 video release Stripped Live in the U.K.. \"Dirrty\" was also included on the setlist of Aguilera's 2006\u20132008 Back to Basics Tour, as part of the circus segment. The performance incorporated elements of \"Cell Block Tango\" from the Broadway musical Chicago, and \"Entrance of the Gladiators\" by Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk, and featured a carousel horse. Ben Walsh from The Independent highlighted \"Dirrty\" as the best song of the concert. However, The Observers Kitty Empire called it \"blushery.\" The performance at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in Adelaide was recorded for the 2008 video release Back to Basics: Live and Down Under.

After consulting a storybook, they find that they must go out for a walk to let the instruments cool off. Across the street (in a house with a neon sign saying \"GRANMA'S\"), the Big Bad Wolf is expecting Red Riding Hood's arrival. Instead, he receives a telegram that says Red Riding Hood will be late because she is \"working at Lockheed as a riveter.\" The frustrated wolf looks out the window and sees Goldilocks entering the Three Bears' house. (Unlike the other characters, Goldilocks is drawn as an attractive young woman.) Because there is a \"food shortage\" going on, the wolf decides to pursue Goldilocks. Inside the Three Bears' house, Goldilocks tries all the beds and lies down in the best one, only to find the wolf in bed with her. The wolf chases Goldilocks through the house until the Three Bears return. Finding Goldilocks and the wolf struggling in the living room, they shout \"Jitterbugs!\" and begin playing a dance tune. The wolf and Goldilocks dance the jitterbug until the wolf is exhausted and flees to Grandma's house. Red Riding Hood returns to find the wolf in Grandma's bed, but the wolf is too tired to eat her. So he attempts to make Red leave, claiming she came too late for their segment and his feet are sore from the dance. However The Three Bears rush in, shout \"Dere's dat jitterbug!\" and resume playing. This causes Grandma to burst out of a cupboard and jitterbug with the wolf, who turns to the audience and says, in a Jimmy Durante voice, \"Everybody wants to get into the act!\""

Produced by Dino De Laurentiis, starring Silvana Mangano, Raf Vallone, Doris Dowling and Vittorio Gassman, Bitter Rice was a commercial success in Europe and the United States. It was a product of the Italian neorealism style. The Italian title of the film is based on a pun; since the Italian word riso can mean either \"rice\" or \"laughter\",  can be taken to mean either \"bitter laughter\" or \"bitter rice\". Although Bitter Rice did not win any awards, it was nominated for the 1950 Academy Award for Best Story and entered into the 1949 Cannes Film Festival."

In an effort to escape the law, two small-time thieves, Francesca (Doris Dowling) and Walter (Vittorio Gassman), hide among the crowds of female workers heading to the rice paddies in the Province of Vercelli in the upper reaches of Piedmont in the Po Valley. While attempting to board the train for the fields, the pair runs into Silvana (Silvana Mangano), a peasant rice worker. Francesca boards the train with Silvana, who introduces her to the planters' way of life. Francesca does not have a work permit, and struggles with the other \"illegals\" to find a place on the rice fields. After initial resistance from documented workers and bosses, the illegals are allowed a place in the fields. At work in the fields, Silvana and Francesca meet a soon-to-be-discharged soldier, Marco (Raf Vallone), who unsuccessfully tries to attract Silvana's interest. Toward the end of the working season, Walter arrives at the rice farm and becomes involved in a plot to steal a large quantity of rice. Excited by his criminal lifestyle, Silvana becomes attracted to Walter. She causes a diversion to help him carry out the heist, but Francesca and Marco manage to stop Walter and his accomplices. Francesca and Silvana face each other, armed with hand-guns. Francesca confronts Silvana and explains that she has been heartlessly manipulated by Walter. In response, Silvana turns her gun on Walter and kills him. Soon afterwards, her guilt leads her to commit suicide. As the other rice workers depart, they pay tribute to her by sprinkling rice upon her body."

This sexualization and the melodramatic presence of death and suicide in the film cause it to diverge from typical Italian neorealism."

Mom and Dad is considered the most successful film within its genre of \"sex hygiene\" films. Although it faced numerous legal challenges and was condemned by the National Legion of Decency, it became one of the highest-grossing films of the 1940s. The film is regarded as an exploitation film as it was repackaged controversial content designed to establish an educational value that might circumvent U.S. censorship laws. Babb's marketing of his film incorporated old-style medicine show techniques, and used unique promotions to build an audience. These formed a template for his later works, which were imitated by his contemporary filmmakers. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The Academy Film Archive preserved Mom and Dad in 2010."

After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl requests \"hygiene books\" from her mother Sarah Blake (Lois Austin); however, the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married.  The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake (George Eldredge) that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission. The film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair.  She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn (Hardie Albright), who had previously been fired for teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and accuses her of \"neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth.\"  Only then is the girl able to confront her mother. The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the female anatomy and footage of live births \u2013 one natural and one Caesarian.  In some screenings, a second film was shown along with Mom and Dad, and contained images portraying syphilis and venereal disease.  Mom and Dad is believed to have had a number of endings, although most typically concluded with the birth of the girl's child, sometimes stillborn and other times put up for adoption."

        "content": "Despite the commercially successful run of Babb's debut film, Dust to Dust\u2014a reworked version of the 1938 film Child Bride\u2014his production company Cox and Underwood disbanded, forcing him to form his own unit, Hygienic Productions.  Having attended a meeting in Burkburnett, Texas, that discussed the alleged impregnations of young women by G.I.s from nearby Sheppard Air Force Base, Babb was inspired to shoot a film based on the subject.  His future wife Mildred Horn drafted a screenplay which later evolved into Mom and Dad. Babb located 20 investors willing to fund the movie, and hired William Beaudine as director. Production of the film cost Babb and his investors a total of $67,001.12. The movie was shot in five separate studios over six days in 1944, and was spread across various Monogram Pictures lots; co-producer J. S. Jossey was a Monogram stockholder. On January 3, 1945, Mom and Dad premiered at the Warner Bros. theatre in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The plot is padded with a large amount of filler.  Films of this type were usually produced quickly and at minimal cost, and while filler was sometimes used to increase the production value, the usual motivation was to extend its running time to qualify for feature length status.  Eric Schaefer notes that the \"primary purpose\" of the plot of Mom and Dad  was to \"serve as the vehicle onto which the spectacle of the clinical reels can be grafted\", such as the live birth scene.  The marketing materials suggest the latter reason also, and many posters for the film promised that \"You [will] actually SEE the birth of a baby!\"  The dialogue is carefully worded, and uses period euphemisms rather than explicit terms that may have been controversial at the time.  In particular, at no time does the film specifically mention sexual intercourse or pregnancy."

        "content": "In a Washington Post article covering Babb's career, the film critic Kenneth Turan wrote that Mom and Dad did not \"flourish because of its birth footage or because of its puerile plot, which Babb himself disparages\u00a0... [its] success flowed, rather, from Babb's extraordinary promotional abilities.\"  The film was exhibited across the United States, and over 300 prints were produced. In the weeks preceding the screening, local presenters sought to attract the attention of the town's inhabitants by distributing letters to local newspapers and church leaflets protesting against the film's moral basis. This strategy often utilized fabricated letters supposedly written by the mayor of a nearby city, who wished to register concern about local young women in his area who had seen the film and were awakened enough to discuss problems similar to ones of their own. The campaigns were usually orchestrated by employees of either Hygienic or Hallmark Productions, and they nominally based their campaign from information provided by a standard and detailed pressbook containing cast and crew information, as well as other promotional and marketing materials. Babb's marketing strategy centered on overwhelming small towns with advertisements and letters, in an attempt to create a controversial atmosphere. In keeping with his motto of \"You gotta tell 'em to sell 'em,\" the film became so ubiquitous that Time wrote that its presentation \"left only the livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life.\" The local pitch included a variety of limited screenings, including adults-only showings, viewings segregated by gender, and a live lecture by the \"Fearless Hygiene Commentator Elliot Forbes\" which was often placed during the intermission. At any one time, a number of \"Elliot Forbes\"es would give simultaneous talks in a number of locations showing the film. In some predominantly African-American areas, Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens was hired to make appearances instead of an actor playing Forbes. The \"Elliot Forbes\" actors were usually people local to the production company, sometimes out-of-work performers.  Along with \"Forbes\", presentations were often held with \"nurses\" in attendance, ostensibly in the event that someone fainted due to the content of the film; such \"nurses\" were often hired locally. Modern Film Distributors later distributed the film, and sold over forty-five thousand copies of the books Man and Boy and Woman and Girl following Forbes's lecture. The text was written by Babb's wife, and was filled with both biological and sexual education materials relevant to the film's subject matter; generating extra profit items for their distributors. The sales of these books netted an estimated $31,000 for the distribution company, while Babb estimated the total sales for all distributions at 40 million copies. Babb insisted that the program be followed closely; a contractual agreement with theaters required that each presentation follow a similar approach. Because the Forbes lecture formed part of the viewing, extra newsreels or short films were not permitted, although previews were allowed. A contractual agreement disallowed matin\u00e9e pricing, set specific times for the segregated viewings, and prohibited the screening  of the film on Sundays."

        "content": "Mom and Dad is the third highest-grossing film of the 1940s in dollar value, and returned close to $63 for each dollar invested by its backers. The Los Angeles Times estimates that the film grossed between $40 million and $100 million, and it has been cited as the most successful sex hygiene film ever released. It remains the most profitable pre-1960 exploitation film; ranking among the top ten grossing films of both the 1940s and 1950s, even when scaled against those year's mainstream releases. The film was at the center of many high-profile lawsuits and condemnations. The exploitation genre was pitched against numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s, and fought many local censorship battles, and fought bitterly against the motion picture censorship system. It has been claimed that nearly 428 lawsuits were laid against both Babb and Mom and Dad during the film's run.  Babb often used the supposed educational value of his films as an offer of defense, and recommended such tactic to theater owners in his pressbooks.  One successful challenge was in New York City, where Mom and Dad remained censored until 1956, when the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the censorship board, deciding that human birth did not qualify as \"indecent\". According to Modern Film Distributors, as of the end of 1956, the film has been dubbed into a dozen languages and attended by an estimated worldwide attendance figure of over 175 million people, at over 650,000 performances.  By then Babb claimed it had played in 47 states (excluding Kansas) and 72 other countries grossing $22 million worldwide. Card Mondor purchased the rights to exhibit the film in New Zealand and Australia during the mid-1960s, almost twenty years after the film's debut.  In the late 1970s, a story on Babb by the Press-Enterprise estimated that the film had been dubbed into 18 languages. The film's success spawned a number of imitators, who sought to saturate the market with genre imitations.  In particular, Street Corner recycled Babb's plot, substituting a concerned physician for a concerned teacher.  In 1948, Universal produced a similar film, The Story of Bob and Sally, but was unable to screen it due to the production code, and eventually sold the rights.  The volume of imitations led to the formation of Modern Film Distributors, a group of exploitation filmmakers, in an effort to minimize booking conflicts. In 1969, the film was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America for a film rating, in order to allow the film be shown in traditional movie theaters; it received an R rating. The film was such a success that it is still shown decades later around the world.  In 2005, a version was added to the National Film Registry."

Eventually Mike Frankovich became producer and the Boultings directed. Goldie Hawn signed in January 1969. The movie introduced Christopher Cazenove, who later co-starred on Dynasty, and Nicola Pagett, who played Elizabeth Bellamy on Upstairs, Downstairs. It was one of a series of supporting roles for Diana Dors that revived her career. A novelisation of the film, written by Raymond Hitchcock, was published in 1971. Goldie Hawn was unhappy that she was coerced into doing a nude scene for this film. \"It was my first nude scene in a movie and I didn't want to do it. I was getting out of bed and putting on a coat and the director finessed me into doing it nude. There was absolutely no reason on earth for me to get out of that bed naked.

Peter Sellers, on the other hand, is at his least inventive. And Goldie Hawn, who I think might be fun in another part, mostly indulges in bad habits with her too-expressive eyes. In fairness, both Miss Hawn and Mr. Sellers are handicapped by roles in which any attempt at a characterization must seem an imposition.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and wrote that Sellers had \"his first decent role in several years\" and gave a \"completely sympathetic performance\", but \"no amount of humor is able to wake up the film's tired story premise.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times was positive, writing \"Escapist entertainment it assuredly is, yet Frisby has wisely provided enough quiet moments between his gags to allow his characters to become real enough to care about.\" Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin stated that Sellers was \"hopelessly miscast\" and that the film \"would have been much better served by a straight romantic lead.\" The website Allmovie comments that \"Soup was different in its day, as the heroine of the piece was not a Doris Day-type eternal virgin, but a sexual being who not only gives herself freely to a man but is upfront and unapologetic about her willingness. The movie has little going for it beyond this premise, and it wanders rather aimlessly, if agreeably, before abruptly resolving its insignificant conflicts.\""

It retells the folktale Little Red Riding Hood as a police procedural, using backstories to show multiple characters' points of view. It was produced independently by Blue Yonder Films with Kanbar Entertainment, directed and written by Cory Edwards, Todd Edwards, and Tony Leech, and produced by Katie Hooten, Maurice Kanbar, David K. Lovegren, Sue Bea Montgomery, and Preston Stutzman. The film was released by The Weinstein Company in Los Angeles, California, on December 16, 2005, for a one-week engagement before expanding nationwide on January 13, 2006. The film features the voices of Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, Jim Belushi, Patrick Warburton, Anthony Anderson, David Ogden Stiers, Xzibit, Chazz Palminteri and Andy Dick. Hoodwinked! was among the earliest computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's low budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines, with a less realistic design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until near the end of production, and while the company had several roles recast with higher-profile actors, it otherwise made few changes to the film. Structurally, the film was inspired by non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon and Pulp Fiction. It was released shortly after the first two installments in the successful Shrek series, which accentuated the fairy tale parody genre of which Hoodwinked! is a part. Hoodwinked!, however, intentionally deviated from the Shrek series in its style of humor and in certain plot elements. This was in part based on Cory Edwards' concerns over exposing children to the high level of cynicism often found in the genre. Critical reception to the film was varied; although its script and voice performances were praised by many reviews, its animation quality was heavily criticized. The film was a commercial success, earning over thirteen times its less-than-$8 million budget. Because of this, it is regarded as the most profitable animated film ever made. A sequel, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil, directed by Mike Disa. It was created by an entirely different team, even though the original draft of the screenplay was written by the Edwards brothers and Leech. It was released in 2011 to negative reviews and financial failure."

        "content": "Little Red Riding Hood arrives at her grandmother's house, where the Big Bad Wolf has disguised himself as Red's Granny. The Wolf attacks Red. Granny, who has been tied up, suddenly jumps out of a nearby closet to help Red, just as an ax-wielding woodsman bursts through the window. The police arrive on the scene. Detective Nicky Flippers questions everyone involved about the events leading up to the incident. Little Red, actually named Red Puckett, explains that she was delivering goodies for her grandmother, when she discovered a threat from the mysterious Goody Bandit, who has been stealing recipes. To save her Granny's business, Red embarked upon a journey to take the Puckett family recipes to Granny's home on top of a nearby mountain. En route, she fell out of a cable car operated by the bunny Boingo  and encountered the Wolf, who sprung a series of suspicious questions on her. Evading the Wolf, Red then met an old singing goat named Japeth, who accompanied her through the remaining journey to Granny's house. Upon arriving at her destination, Red found the Wolf already waiting in ambush. What at first seems to be an open-and-shut case becomes confused once the Wolf shares his side of the story. The Wolf, to the surprise of many at the crime scene, is an investigative reporter. He reveals that he was searching for a lead on the identity of the Goody Bandit and had reason to believe that Red and Granny were the culprits. Along with his hyperactive squirrel assistant Twitchy, the Wolf confronted Red in the hopes of solving the Goody Bandit mystery. When they failed to detain Red for long, the Wolf and Twitchy made haste for Granny's house. They managed to arrive ahead of Red (by using a shortcut known by Boingo). At the house, they found Granny already tied up in the closet. The Wolf then went undercover, planning to trick Red into sharing the truth about the Goody Bandit. When the Woodsman, named Kirk, is questioned, he explains that his appearance at Granny's house was pure happenstance. Kirk is in fact an aspiring actor who was only trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial. After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, he was consoled by Boingo and then received a callback for the commercial. He spent the rest of the day chopping trees, getting into character for his upcoming role. At sunset, a large tree collapsed and pushed him through the window of Granny's home. The investigation then turns to Granny. Unbeknownst to her granddaughter, Granny is an extreme sports enthusiast. Earlier that day, she competed in a ski race, where Boingo was in attendance, supposedly as a fan of Granny's. Once the race started, Granny was attacked by the opposing team. Able to withstand the attack and win the race, she learned that the team had been hired by the Goody Bandit to eliminate her. Granny explains to the investigators and her fellow suspects that while parachuting back home, she got tangled up in the parachute strings, which snagged on her ceiling fan and threw her into the closet. Feeling betrayed by Granny's secrecy, Red wanders off alone. Flippers deduces that Boingo, who had been present in all four stories, must be the Goody Bandit. After Boingo sneaks into Granny's home and steals the Puckett family recipes, Red notices Boingo and follows him to his hideout at a cable car station. The police pursue Boingo in the wrong direction. Granny, the Wolf, and Kirk manage to locate Boingo as he is explaining his evil scheme to Red. Boingo plans to add an addictive substance called \"Boingonium\" to the stolen recipes and then bulldoze the forest, so as to clear the way for a new Boingo-themed corporate empire. The Wolf and Kirk go undercover to distract Boingo, as Granny sneaks into Boingo's lair, but they are all soon found out and open conflict ensues. Boingo sends a bound and gagged Red down the mountain in a cable car loaded with explosives. Granny goes after Red, with Boingo and his henchmen in pursuit. Red manages to free herself, and escapes with Granny, while the police, who have been redirected by Twitchy, are waiting at the bottom of the mountain to arrest Boingo and his henchmen. Sometime later, Kirk finds success in a yodeling troupe, while Red, Granny, the Wolf, and Twitchy are enlisted by Flippers to join a crime-solving organization called the Happily Ever After Agency."

        "content": "Hoodwinked! was one of the first independent computer-animated films to be produced without the aid of a distributor. Although the film's budget is listed as $30 million on Box Office Mojo, several sources have rejected this figure, reporting that the film was produced for no more than $15 million. Director Cory Edwards explained in a 2009 interview that the film's actual budget was under $8\u00a0million. Any of these figures would be significantly lower than is typical for a computer-animated film's budget. At the time of Hoodwinked!s production, the costs of computer-animation software had only recently decreased to a price that was accessible to more than just major studios, and leading up to the film's release, producer David Lovegren said, \"Six or seven years ago, the idea of doing Hoodwinked! as an independent [animated] feature would have been impossible\". The filmmakers only made the film independently by necessity, and Cory Edwards has said, \"It's not a model to be followed. It was a once-in-a-lifetime, seat-of-your-pants kind of thing that just barely came off.\" However, he added that the process was worth going through to get the film made, and encouraged aspiring filmmakers to be willing to follow it."

        "content": "After a number of years spent producing  commercials and music videos in Tulsa, brothers Cory and Todd Edwards founded their own production company, Blue Yonder Films. Joined by their friends producers Brad Knull, Robert Yanovitch and Preston Stutzman, who also led marketing for the company. The group released their first feature film, Chillicothe, at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. Emboldened by this success, the company then moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of producing a sophomore film. Blue Yonder evolved as Knull and Yanovitch left to pursue other interests, and new opportunities for the remaining three partners proved elusive at first. An associate producer on Chillicothe, Sue Bea Montgomery, sought out studios that might want to work with the trio; she was met with indifference and determined that Blue Yonder Films would have to further establish itself on the independent scene before anyone would take interest. Montgomery then set up a meeting between the filmmakers and Maurice Kanbar, a successful entrepreneur who had made a minor investment in Chillicothe. The Edwards brothers pitched a number of ideas for live-action films to Kanbar and proposed a development deal that would have entailed Kanbar paying the group and covering their rent in exchange for a significant portion of the rights to any scripts that Blue Yonder Films ever sold. Kanbar, however, was interested in a more direct approach, preferring to focus efforts on getting a single film produced. He had always admired animation, and after seeing a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots, suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with Blue Yonder Films, one that would tell a familiar narrative with a twist. Kanbar gave the group a month to come up with a story idea. Although Kanbar expressed interest in producing a retelling of Cinderella or Pinocchio, the Edwards brothers insisted on avoiding stories that had already been defined by Disney. Several ideas were considered by the brothers. Cory suggested Little Red Riding Hood, describing it as a story \"so simple that you can go a lot of different directions with it\", and within a few days, inspiration came to Todd through non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run and Memento. Todd's proposal to retell Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, exploring the narrative through multiple points of view, was embraced by Kanbar, who agreed to fully finance the film before seeing a finished script. Kanbar's initial plan was to release the film directly to DVD. In 2002, Kanbar and Montgomery joined together in founding Kanbar Entertainment and Kanbar Animation, independent production studios that teamed with Blue Yonder Films for the production of Hoodwinked! Cory served as the film's main director, as he had more experience with animation, comedy, and children's entertainment, while Todd served as co-director. Montgomery and Stutzman were joined by Disney animation veteran David Lovegren as producers on the film, and Cory's and Todd's sister Katie Hooten joined as an associate producer. Tony Leech, who had worked with the Edwards brothers on Chillicothe, was initially hired as an editor, but gained story input as well. He eventually proved to be so valuable to the production that he was given a role as co-director."

        "content": "The filmmakers found independently producing the film to have both benefits and challenges. Although they were given a great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar, their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway. Todd Edwards related that \"Money doesn't just buy you more talent and more machinery, it also buys you flexibility on a story level. At Disney, if they don't like the third act, they just throw the whole thing out and re-animate the whole thing, even if it's finished\u00a0... We had no such luxury, and so in a way, you're watching our first version of the movie.\" Knowing ahead of time their inability to alter the film's script once animating had begun, an effort was made by the filmmakers to finalize the script as much as possible before the start of production, which is not a common practice for studio-produced animated films. Turning away from the well-known archetypes of the Little Red Riding Hood characters, the filmmakers continued to look towards non-linear crime dramas for inspiration instead. Producer Preston Stutzman explained that \"The whole film is about surprises and secret lives\". Not wanting Red to be \"boring\" or \"too innocent\", she was patterned on James Dean and given the desire of leaving home to find her way in the world. Todd Edwards had the idea of basing the Wolf on Chevy Chase's character in Fletch, feeling that it would be fun to apply the character's dry, deadpan style of humor to an animated wolf, while Cory Edwards created the hyperactive character of Twitchy to serve as the Wolf's foil. Going against types, Red's Granny was written as a thrill-seeking action hero, while the strong Woodsman was written as being childishly incompetent. The police officers were written to come across as everyday guys and Cory Edwards has explained that the decision to make three of them pigs was not politically motivated. Nicky Flippers was not a part of the story as it was initially conceived and prior to his creation, the investigation was going to be led by Chief Grizzly. After producer Sue Bea Montgomery and her husband pointed out similarities between their film and the 1950s film/TV series The Thin Man, the Edwards brothers and Leech decided to introduce the character and his dog into the film as an homage to Nick Charles. They considered several different types of animals before settling on making him a frog. Cory Edwards chose to approach the film predominantly as an action/comedy, instead of as a typical animated film, and wrote the script to appeal to audiences of any age like many of the films produced by Pixar or Disney. Bugs Bunny, Road Runner, Rocky and Bullwinkle, The Muppets, The Simpsons and The Incredibles have all been cited as inspirations for the film. An attempt was made to distance the film from Shrek and other similar themed films that had been recently released, by excluding magic, wizards, and fairies from the film. Cory Edwards also strived for a different style of humor than Shrek, choosing to make his film more family friendly and less of a satire. Working out of Todd and Preston\u2019s apartment, Cory and Todd Edwards initially wrote the script while  Cory sketched most of the film's storyboards, and Todd wrote the  songs. Leech simultaneously scanned the boards edited the story reel on his Mac computer. The first (temp) voice cast was the three of them. Producer Sue Bea Montgomery showed test screenings of the story reel to children in her neighborhood, and gained input from their reactions. The filmmakers had been considering removing Japeth the goat, but chose not to when he proved one of the most popular characters at these screenings. The children also particularly liked Twitchy, which led to the expansion of the character's role. In an effort to save costs, the film's cast was originally going to be composed mostly of friends and family members of the filmmakers. Cory and Todd brought in their cousin Tye Edwards to play Dolph and turned to their friend Joshua J. Greene to play Jimmy Lizard. Japeth was written specifically for Benjy Gaither, the son of gospel music singers Bill and Gloria Gaither. He had been a friend of the Edwards brothers since childhood and Cory's short film Wobots had been produced through his animation studio Live Bait Productions. Cory's wife Vicki was given the role of a skunk reporter, and while some consideration was initially given to having an adult play the child woodpecker Quill, the role was instead given to producer David K. Lovegren's daughter Kathryn. The Edwards brothers, Leech, and producer Preston Stutzman all took on roles as well. Wanting to do one of the voices in his movie and having watching a lot of squirrels, Cory took on the role of Twitchy, and Pro Tools was used to speed up the recording of his dialogue by 50 percent. Todd played the local Sandwich Man, Leech played both Det. Bill Stork and Glen, and Stutzman played Timmy. As the producers gained greater confidence in the film, however, larger name actors were brought in. Patrick Warburton was the first celebrity actor to join the film and did so purely out of a love for the script. Though Cory Edwards had originally envisioned the Wolf as sounding like a mixture between a young Chevy Chase and Bill Murray, he praised Warburton's performance, saying that he \"made the Wolf his own character.\" Warburton, who had past experience in voice acting from Buzz Lightyear of Star Command and The Emperor's New Groove, found funny Edwards' idea to voice the Wolf as an investigative reporter who fancied himself like Chevy Chase's Fletch character, so he decided to voice the Wolf dryly and inquisitively. Andy Dick also joined the cast early on, to voice Boingo. He used improvisation and approached the role differently from how it had been written, interpreting the character as victimized and unstable. The filmmakers were enthusiastic over Dick's angle on the character, and Todd Edwards said, \"What we had written was kind of stock, to be honest, but Andy Dick, well, where he was supposed to laugh, he'd be crying. Where he was supposed to yell, he'd be laughing. He just mixed it up!\" Prolific voice performers Tara Strong, David Ogden Stiers and Tom Kenny were cast in multiple roles. Strong was cast as Red and Zorra, Stiers was cast as Kirk, the Woodsman and Nicky Flippers, and Kenny was cast as Tommy and Woolworth the Sheep. Emmy-winning actress Sally Struthers was brought in to play Granny Puckett and Joel McCrary was cast as Chief Grizzly."

        "content": "The film's animation was created on Maya software, and in an effort to save costs, was produced in Manila, Philippines. Producers Sue Bea Montgomery and David K. Lovegren founded the animation studio Digital Eye Candy for the purpose of the film's production and stationed it in a 5,000-square-foot rented house. Cory Edwards traveled to this studio a total of fifteen times over the course of the film's three-year production and has explained that although the house was located in an expensive part of Manila, the rent was no more than that of his two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. When Cory was not able to be on site, Todd took over directing duties. \"Along with Tony, we were kind of a 'three-headed monster,'\" Cory explains. \"We all knew what movie we were making, and I trusted those guys to make creative calls when I couldn't be there.\" Lovegren had attempted to start an independent animation studio in the Philippines before in 2001, but the studio, called ImagineAsia, was closed after it failed to attract business. Digital Eye Candy hired approximately twenty animators that had previously been employed by ImagineAsia, and at one point the studio reached fifty employees. The film's animators had little experience with computer-animation and feature-length films, and had to be trained by the producers over the course of the film's production. Since none of the animators were specialists, they were not divided into specific teams, but instead each worked on all areas of the animating process. The filmmakers found this to be a poor method though, because it kept the individual skills of the animators from being optimized. Due to their independent backgrounds, the animators were accustomed to working at fast paces, and despite their small numbers, each phase of production was able to be completed within a short period of time. Still, schedule and budget restraints led the filmmakers to enlist Prana Studios in Mumbai, India to perform lighting and compositing. The filmmakers found that the most difficult aspect of producing the film independently was their inability to fix all of the mistakes made in the film's animation. Todd Edwards explained that \"it becomes an equation: 'I have 10 things that I would like to change in this shot. I have the time and the budget to do three. Pick those three and then let's move on.' And that was hard to do\". Another obstacle during the film's production, according to Cory Edwards, was putting fur on the animal characters. It took the filmmakers three and a half years to crack the code to do so perfectly, forcing themselves to redesign and reanimate several aspects. Knowing that they could not match the quality of other computer-animated films, the film was instead designed to imitate the look of stop motion. Cory Edwards cited Rankin-Bass as an inspiration and explained, \"If we approach our look like that\u2014photographed miniatures in stop motion\u2014and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as far as that look, then we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot trying to put every freckle and hair on photoreal creatures.\" Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film Howard the Duck with the simple, but beloved puppet character Kermit the Frog to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality. Distancing the film from what producer Preston Stutzman called the \"candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world[s]\" of other CG animated films, an attempt was made to bring an organic look to the film, and \u201cdirt\u201d was rubbed into the colors. The Nightmare Before Christmas was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to make her look more like a doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that \"CG in the past has been pushing the envelope to make things look more realistic, but Hoodwinked takes things back to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon.\""

        "title": "Hoodwinked!_Music",
        "content": "The film's score was composed by John Mark Painter, who along with his wife Fleming McWilliams, constituted the rock duo Fleming and John in the 1990s. The Edwards brothers were fans of the group and first met Painter while Cory was performing in an animated film on which Painter served as the composer. The score was inspired by music from the 1960s and the soundtracks to Planet of the Apes, Dark Shadows, and The Untouchables have been cited as influences, as well as the works of Henry Mancini. It was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee, where Kristin Wilkinson served as the orchestrator and conductor. In an effort to appeal to older audience members, Todd Edwards chose to replace parts of Painter's score with original rock music. From this came the song \"Little Boat\", written and sung by Daniel Rogers, who had composed Edwards' first film Chillicothe. \"Runaway\" was written by Joshua J. Greene, a friend of the Edwards brothers', who also provided the voice of Jimmy Lizard in the film. \"The Real G\", sung by Cory Edwards and \"Bounce\", sung by Todd Collins were both written by Painter and Cory Edwards. \"Blow Your House Down\" was performed by the Filipino band Pupil and written by their lead singer Ely Buendia. Cory Edwards wanted to include the Foo Fighters' song \"All My Life\", and the band themselves were ready to contribute a song... just not that one. The Foo Fighters had a new album coming out and had no enthusiasm about using their old hit, afraid it was getting overused. Sadly, nothing on the new album hit the mark quite the same, so a Foo Fighters song in the movie was not to be. Todd Edwards wrote nine original songs for the film and sung four of them: \"Critters Have Feelings\", \"Tree Critter\", \"Eva Deanna\", and \"Glow\". \"Eva Deanna\" was written about a day that he and his wife spent at the zoo with their niece, the daughter of associate producer Katie Hooten. \"Glow\" was written about the Edwards siblings' grandmother, Vera, who had died a few years earlier. \"Great Big World\" was sung by Anne Hathaway and replaced another song called \"Woods Go-Round\", which Edwards considered too childish and described as being \"in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons.\" This change required the scene to be re-animated and re-cut. \"Be Prepared\" was sung by Benjy Gaither and developed out of a practicality; the filmmakers wanted to introduce Japeth while the character is rocking back and forth on his horns, as though the horns are a rocking chair. However, they realized that this would make the horns too big to fit in a minecart later on in the film. As a solution, they came up with the gag of having the character switch his horns several times, and this led to the song's concept. McWilliams joined Jim Belushi to sing \"The Schnitzel Song\" and Painter asked his longtime friend Ben Folds to sing \"Red is Blue\", a selection strongly advocated for by Edwards. Folds was working on a new album at the time, but a year after the proposal, found the opportunity to record the song and compose a piano arrangement for it as well. \"Top of the Woods\" was sung by Andy Dick and was originally composed to be slow-paced. The recording of Dick's performance was sped up though at the suggestion of Ralf Palmer, a prolific animator and friend of producer Sue Bea Montgomery."

        "title": "Hoodwinked!_Distribution",
        "content": "Hoodwinked! was shown to potential distributors throughout various stages of its production. Though a distribution offer was made by DreamWorks, it was turned down as the filmmakers did not feel that it was a good deal. As the film neared the end of production, it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time, screening Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, The Weinstein Company. They decided to pick Hoodwinked! up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney also happened to work for Blue Yonder Films. Although Cory Edwards did not meet Rodriguez, he acknowledged him as instrumental to get the film made. The Weinsteins had recently left the Walt Disney Company and according to Cory Edwards, they \"loved the idea of picking up an animated film and giving Disney a run for their money\". The involvement of the Weinstein Company encouraged Kanbar enough to enlist Skywalker Sound. The film was nearly complete by the time that the Weinsteins became involved, and Edwards has stated that nothing was done by them to ruin \"the original vision of the movie.\" However, a few edit suggestions were made to quicken the film's pace which Edwards felt were good ideas, as he considered the first twenty minutes to be dragging. The Weinstein Company also heavily recast the film with bigger-name actors in the hopes of attracting a larger audience. Anne Hathaway replaced Tara Strong in the lead role of Red; Jim Belushi replaced David Ogden Stiers in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman; Anthony Anderson replaced Tony Leech in the role of Det. Bill Stork; Glenn Close replaced Sally Struthers in the role of Granny Puckett; Xzibit replaced Joel McCrary in the role of Chief Grizzly and Chazz Palminteri replaced Tom Kenny in the role of Woolworth the Sheep. Opining that the final steps in character design were really fleshed out when the actors were hired, Hooten felt that Hathaway put some edge that was missing on Red, making her more sarcastic, sassy and quick. Anderson accepted the role of Bill Stork given his past experience as voice actor and his previous collaborations with the Weinsteins in Scary Movie 3 and My Baby's Daddy, wanting to do something that his children and godchildren could watch and enjoy. Palminteri was called to be offered the part of Woolworth the Sheep, which he accepted as found the script hilarious. Despite these recastings, Tara Strong retained the much smaller role of Zorra, David Ogden Stiers retained the role of Nicky Flippers, Tom Kenny retained the role of Tommy and Tony Leech retained the role of Glen. Many high-profile country singers were considered to replace Benjy Gaither in the role of Japeth, but none of them were available and Gaither retained the role. The Weinsteins also wanted to replace Joshua J. Greene in the role of Jimmy Lizard with a more famous actor such as Albert Brooks, but the role was ultimately not recast. Edwards appreciated the reason for the recastings and attributed a large part of the film's financial success to them. He expressed disappointment about the amount of recasting, however, saying, \"At a certain point it became Recast-o-Rama, everybody got recast-happy. My feeling is, you get two or three names on that poster, you're fine. Our Hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it. After a certain point, I don't think you need more than two, three celebrities\u2014give it to the voice actors. It sweetens the pot\". Since the film's animation had already been mostly completed by the time the recastings were made, the new actors had to deliver their lines exactly as the old actors had done, giving them no opportunity to improvise. Edwards expressed disappointment with the fact that the original actors would not get any credit for their improvisations in the film, which were copied by the replacement actors."

        "content": "Hoodwinked! received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 46%, based on 125 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \"This fractured fairytale doesn't have the wit or animation quality to compete with the likes of the Shrek franchise.\" On Metacritic, it received a score of 45 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and claimed that many of the film's ideas for altering its familiar storyline \"sound better on paper than they turn out in execution.\" Finding it tedious to view the film's story told multiple times, he wrote that the film \"slips into boredom.\" Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle also gave the film two-and-a-half stars, and although he praised its \"snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations\", he considered the film's plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation. Peter Rainer writing for The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a C+ and called it \"a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children.\" He was not overly critical of the film, but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer-animated films set by Pixar. Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic, and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current. While Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's vocal performances, he wrote, \"Hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania\u00a0... One aches to think what the great Looney Tunes directors could have done with this material.\" Several critics, however, were more enthusiastic about the film. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave Hoodwinked! an A- and praised the zaniness of its humor. Calling the filmmakers heroes, he compared them to Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh due to their potential for bringing independent filmmaking to prominence in animation. Although Nancy Churnin of the Dallas Morning News considered the film inferior to those of Pixar and DreamWorks, she still gave it a B and wrote, \"it's got an upstart charm, a clever premise, appealing characters voiced by a terrific cast and a script that should make you laugh out loud more than once.\" In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington praised the film's voice cast, music, and script, and wrote, \"it packs more verbal wit and surprise than the usual cartoon.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five calling it \"high-energy, imaginative entertainment\". Japeth was praised amongst both positive and negative reviews. Gleiberman and Churnin both felt that the character was one of the best parts of the film, and Westbrook and Wilmington both described him as \"a hoot\". In a mostly positive review for the Orlando Sentinel, Roger Moore called the character hilarious, while in a mostly negative review for Variety, Justin Chang wrote that the character \"steals the show every minute he's onscreen.\" One of the main criticisms of the film was the poor quality of its animation. Berardinelli called it some of the worst CGI animation in memory. He felt that the characters looked plastic, considered the backgrounds dull, and wrote, \"On more than one occasion, I thought I was watching something made for TV. When compared to today's visual standards for animated films, Hoodwinked is far below the curve.\" Burr considered the film's surfaces poorly rendered and compared them to \"Teletubbieland reupholstered with Naugahyde.\" Westbrook felt that the animation worked well for the animal characters, but wrote, \"the humans have a glassy sheen and brittle hardness, much like work done in the early days of CG\u00a0... That art has come too far to embrace a throwback like Hoodwinked as lovably quaint. It's simply dated.\" Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post compared the characters to rubber toys, and wrote, \"their faces are without nuance or vividness\u00a0... In movement, especially, do they lack grace and conviction. It seems like the recent breakthroughs in computerized magic have bypassed the poor Edwards fellows, as it looks stuck somewhere in the 1970s, or maybe even earlier.\" Many reviews negatively compared the film to the Shrek series. Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail considered the film to be \"a sort of discount Shrek\", while Burr called it \"Shrek with added drek.\" Westbrook wrote that \"Echoing such a popular predecessor as Shrek is not a good thing\u2014especially when the echo is so faint.\" Berardinelli felt that the fairy tale references were not as smartly done as in the first Shrek film, while Bernard felt that Hoodwinked! took fairy tale revisionism too far. He felt that the humor in Shrek worked due to the fairy tale characters remaining in character throughout the film, and wrote, \"It's pointless to scold them for behaving the way fairy tales intended, and that's far funnier than turning them into breakdancing anachronisms.\" Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic considered Red's kung fu abilities to be overly similar to Princess Fiona's \"Matrix agility.\" Gleiberman also noted the similarities between the film and Shrek, but he was positive in the comparison, feeling that its independent production gave the filmmakers \"the freedom to follow their flakiest corkscrew whims.\" While Wilmington did not find Hoodwinked! as impressive or beguiling as Shrek, he wrote that \"when it's cooking, it does make you laugh.\" Retrospectively, several critics noted that the film was considerably better than the 2007 computer-animated fairy tale parody film Happily N'Ever After. Although Burr had given Hoodwinked! a negative review, he likened the film to Citizen Kane in comparison to Happily N'Ever After. Wilmington also considered Hoodwinked! the superior of the two films, and Lou Lumenick of the New York Post felt that the film was far wittier than Happily N'Ever After. While Christy Lemire of Associated Press likened Hoodwinked! to a poor man's Shrek, she went on to call Happily N'Ever After a poor man's Hoodwinked! In 2018, Richard Brody of The New Yorker called Hoodwinked! one of the top independent films for families. Acknowledging the crudeness of the animation, he nonetheless praised the writing as \"bold and funny\" and wrote that the direction \"displays admirable comic timing.\" Brody considered the character personalities distinct from those in other animated comedies. He also commended the vocal performances for having a \"zippy, brash energy that doesn't feel condescending\". Hoodwinked! has also been praised by Tony Bancroft, who co-directed Mulan. Hoodwinked! received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Animated Film at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, but lost to Corpse Bride. Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as number ten on \"The Must List\" for its January 27, 2006 issue, calling it a \"genre-busting indie animated gem.\""

        "content": "In February 2006, author Timothy Sexton wrote an article titled \"Hoodwinked: A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism\" for Associated Content, in which he posited that Hoodwinked! was one of the first postmodern animated films and that the film also carried political undertones. He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters' points of view. Calling Hoodwinked! \"the most subversive movie released nationwide since Fahrenheit 9/11\", Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on the free enterprise system. He drew comparisons between the film's villain and the typical American business owner, going so far as to say that the character was \"clearly based on people like Bill Gates and Sam Walton\". In Sexton's view, the film exposed the flaws of capitalism, showing that if left unregulated, business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition. The film's director and co-writer Cory Edwards was surprised by Sexton's interpretation and denied that the film intentionally carried any political messages. He explained that he and the other filmmakers were simply drawing from the evil schemes common of James Bond films, Bugs Bunny cartoons, and The A-Team, and wrote \"If Mr. Sexton sees my movie as a sermon against mega-corporations monopolizing America, that's fine. But our villain is just as easily the face of every dictator in history, or every schoolyard bully who is compensating for low self-esteem, or any Mafia boss who dominates by either absorbing or wiping out his competition. Hey, if you look at an abstract painting and see the devil in a red splotch, that's your prerogative\u00a0... I guess a movie's message is only partially supplied by the filmmaker.\" In May 2007 Time magazine ran an article by James Poniewozik titled \"Is Shrek Bad for Kids?\" which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, \"I thought Hoodwinked! and most of the Shrek series were hilarious\u00a0... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood.\" Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, \"As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We went to great lengths to distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not.\""

        "content": "A sequel, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil, was released on April 29, 2011. It was first announced in January 2006 and in February, Cory Edwards, Todd Edwards, and Tony Leech explained that although they would be writing the screenplay, they would not return to direct. Cory Edwards later elaborated on this decision, explaining that he had a negative experience working with some of the first film's \"key players\" and felt that he had been poorly treated by them. He also cited concerns over being confined to animation, and stated that he felt it would be a lateral move to direct a sequel to his first film as his second film. In March 2007, Edwards announced that Mike Disa had been hired to direct the sequel and expressed enthusiasm over his involvement, saying that he \"has a real passion for the film and a devotion to maintaining the Hoodwinked world. He wants to do the sequel justice and he really gets what we're trying to do.\" Although much of the first film's cast returned for the sequel, Anne Hathaway was replaced by Hayden Panettiere in the role of Red and Jim Belushi was replaced by Martin Short in the role of Kirk the Woodsman. Kanbar Entertainment initially intended to finance production of the sequel independently as it had done with the first film, but entered into a co-financing agreement proposed by The Weinstein Company. The film was initially scheduled to be released on January 15, 2010, but in December 2009, The Weinstein Company postponed the film's release date indefinitely. In April 2010, Kanbar Entertainment brought a lawsuit against The Weinstein Company. In addition to claiming that the postponement of the film's release date breached an agreement between the two companies, the lawsuit accused the Weinstein Company of not contributing to monthly production accounts after February 2009, neglecting to consult Kanbar Entertainment of a release strategy, and not responding to proposed changes to the film, even though Kanbar Entertainment held \"final authority on production decisions\". The film was a financial failure, earning $23.1 million worldwide; less than its budget. Critical reception to the film was almost universally negative, with a Rotten score of 11% across 61 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 20/100 on Metacritic. Cory Edwards expressed disappointment with the finished film, indicating that it was heavily altered from the original script and saying that it was \"deflating to give this thing away and watch others run with it in ways I would not.\""

Just before they are to embark for a trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Karen says she is going on vacation by herself to \"think about everything.\" Matthew and Victor decide to go to Rio with their daughters. Jennifer and Nikki share a room, where she says to Nikki, \"Your father is so sweet... I used to have a crush on him\", to which Nikki replies, \"Me, too\". At the beach, Victor and Matthew pass numerous women walking around topless. The fathers spot their daughters in the distance, and the girls turn around to reveal that they are topless, also. After dropping the girls off at a wedding, the men visit a pub. After Victor pairs off with a local divorc\u00e9e, Matthew winds up at the wedding, where he runs into Jennifer. They eventually share a passionate kiss, which Nikki witnesses. Matthew and Jennifer have sex on the beach. Matthew stresses it can never happen again. Jennifer begins coming onto Matthew in various, inappropriate situations. At one point, she takes a naked Polaroid of herself and gives it to Matthew in public. Jennifer tearfully tells her father that she had an affair with an \"older man\". Victor becomes furious and sets out to hunt down the mystery man, expecting Matthew to help. Matthew tries to talk Jennifer into ending their relationship, but she is determined to never give him up. Matthew ultimately discloses to his friend that  Jennifer had the affair with him. Victor is not as irritated as Matthew expects, because  Victor is revealed to have been having an affair with Karen. Jennifer tries to commit suicide with an overdose of birth control pills, but survives and the incident brings all of the friends closer together, although the men constantly object about each other's sexual misconduct. Karen and Matthew decide to work on their marital problems, Jennifer begins dating a young male nurse she met while recuperating in the hospital, and Matthew thanks daughter Nikki for being the only one who has not misbehaved. As closing credits roll, Matthew, in voice-over narration, says, \"You only live once, but it does help if you get to be young twice\"."

In his current life, he is a representative for the Olivero & Sanchez Marketing Group in Los Angeles and is busy travelling to visit all three of his girlfriends to give them each a gift. Cici (Sof\u00eda Vergara), a cocktail waitress from Miami who enjoys being the center of attention; Patricia Sofia Ordonez Coronado del Pescador (Jaci Velasquez), a debutante of New York's high society who is tired of her mother's (Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso) endless attempts to marry her off; and Lorena Morales (Roselyn S\u00e1nchez), a lawyer from Chicago who loves how Tomas makes her feel sexy; have fallen for him and given him the affectionate nickname \"Papi\". This love triangle of sorts affects Tom\u00e1s's work life, causing him to pass out during a presentation. His doctor (Ian Gomez) learns of the love triangle, tells Tom\u00e1s to choose only one woman, prescribes tranquilizers and advises against driving, alcohol, and women. By coincidence, all three of his girlfriends go to Los Angeles after hearing their horoscopes read by fortune teller Walter Mercado on Univision's Primer Impacto. The three women arrive at his house while he is at the doctor's. Instead of fighting each other, all three agree to leave and quit Tomas cold turkey as revenge for his cheating on them. In their absence, Tom\u00e1s arrives home and takes his tranquilizers with alcohol. The girls each have second thoughts about leaving and return to confront Tom\u00e1s directly. First Lorena, then Patricia and finally Cici, causing Tom\u00e1s to overdose on alcohol and tranquilizers and pass out again. Mary, Tom\u00e1s' secretary, calls hoping that he is doing better. Outside Tomas' house, FBI agent Carmen Rivera (Lisa Vidal), is waiting. She followed Cici to Los Angeles as part of an investigation. Fala, Cici's business partner, had Cici do her boyfriend, Ricky, a favor by taking a car that he sold online to the buyer in Los Angeles. Ricky is involved in the Whittaker counterfeit ring that Agent Rivera is investigating. The girls spot her while panicking about what to do with Tomas and think she is \"the L.A. woman\" who just called, probably from a cell phone. Scared by Agent Rivera's firearm, the girls decide to take Tom\u00e1s out of the house and wait until he wakes up and decide which girl he wants to be with. They load all their bags in Ricky's car and, after a short chase, they decide to stay at a Marriott hotel instead of a Motel 6. Unfortunately, Patricia's credit cards have been canceled by her mother. However, Lorena is their saving grace. The Miss Latina American Beauty Pageant is being held in that very same hotel and Miss Puerto Rico's flight was delayed. Lorena bears a resemblance to the real beauty contestant and takes her place. Cici passes herself and Patricia off as her staff. When moving their bags to Miss Puerto Rico's room, a bag falls off the cart onto the luggage room floor. In the hotel room, all three girls have dinner, empty three bottles of champagne and share their life stories with each other. They each then have a dream in which they end up with Tom\u00e1s but feel bad about leaving the other two behind. The next morning, Lorena has to meet the judges and Cici has to deliver Ricky's car to a man named Rodrigo (D.L. Hughley) who apparently bought it. They leave Tom\u00e1s but, in their absence, he's taken by Agent Rivera who has followed them to the hotel. It turns out Rodrigo was not interested in the car but a bag that was supposed to be in the trunk. Upon returning to the hotel with Rodrigo's associate, Victor (Freddy Rodriguez), the girls discover Tom\u00e1s is missing and a note that reads, \"If you want your Papi back, bring the money to the Don Quixote puppet at L.A. Latin festival at 5 PM. No cops.\" Patricia knocks Victor out with a lamp and Cici calls Fala in Miami for answers about the car but doesn't get any. All that is left is to do what the note says. They are interrupted by Costas Delgado (Paul Rodriguez, uncredited), the director of the pageant, who has been looking for Lorena and needs her to meet with the judges immediately. Patricia finds the extra bag filled with money in the luggage room and Cici gets a map to the festival. Victor comes to, calls Rodrigo and they plan to catch the girls at the festival. While Miss Mexico is being interviewed, Lorena unbuttons her blouse slightly to show off her cleavage and Costas helps her with her sash. During Lorena's interview, Patricia and Cici arrive but so does the real Miss Puerto Rico, who outs Lorena as an impostor. Cici trips her, allowing all three to escape. Outside, Tom\u00e1s wakes up in Agent Rivera's car. Agent Rivera tells him she intends to use him and the girls in order to detain Victor and Rodrigo. They follow the girls to the festival as they leave in Ricky's car. On the way, the girls' car breaks down completely. They steal a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which Patricia knows how to drive, promising the owner to bring it right back and lose both the map and Agent Rivera in another chase. Upon arrival, the girls see the puppet is behind the stage. Running through the crowd to avoid the cops, Patricia loses one of her colored contact lenses. Since she looks \"so much better without all that money\", she simply takes the other one out. Victor and Rodrigo spot them and the girls run on stage where Sheila E. is performing and dance to singer Christina Vidal's song, Dejar\u00e9, regardless of their mixed dance backgrounds. Victor and Rodrigo get closer to the stage, causing the girls to run off mid-performance. They all run to the puppet, where Carmen and other FBI agents surround them and apprehend Victor and Rodrigo. Tom\u00e1s is reunited with all three of his girlfriends. He apologizes to them for his deception and is unable to choose between them. The girls, however, have all found their inner strengths and choose to leave him instead. Tom\u00e1s decides to take Agent Carmen's advice and spend some time alone... after taking her out for dinner. Returning to the festival crowds, the girls are invited to return to the stage where they dance to Christina Vidal's song It's All About Nothing. The movie's timeline advances five months later and the girls have kept in touch. Patricia has moved into her own apartment with her dog Fifi and has gotten a job at an art gallery. Cici is an entertainer on a cruise liner with her business partner Fala. Lorena is still a lawyer working pro-bono but puts her time off to good use and becomes the self-proclaimed \"Queen of Tango\". Fifi hears her horoscope that advises her to \"go outside the door because love is waiting for [her].\" The movie ends with Fifi finding her \"Puppy Chulo.\""

The vessel bursts into flames and explodes; everybody aboard is killed. Jim Hill (McClure) and his wife Carol witness the explosion. Later, Jim and Carol's dog goes missing and the pair finds its dismembered corpse on the nearby beach. The following day, teenagers Jerry Potter (Meegan King) and Peggy Larson (Lynn Schiller) go for a swim at the beach. Jerry is abruptly pulled under the water. Peggy believes it is a prank until she discovers his mutilated corpse. Peggy screams and tries to reach the beach, but a monstrous figure drags her across the sand. The humanoid creature tears off her bikini and rapes her. That night, two more teenagers are camping on the same beach. Billy (David Strassman) is about to have sex with his girlfriend, Becky (Lisa Glaser) when another humanoid monster claws its way inside, kills him, and chases Becky onto the beach. She outruns her assailant, but then runs into the arms of yet another monster, which throws her to the sand and rapes her. More attacks follow; not all of them successful, but few witnesses survive to tell the public about the incidents; only Peggy is found alive, though severely traumatized. Jim's brother is also attacked, prompting Jim to take a personal interest in the matter. A company called Canco has announced plans to build a huge cannery near Noyo. The murderous, sex-hungry mutations are apparently the result of Canco's experiments with a growth hormone they had earlier administered to salmon. The salmon escaped from Canco's laboratory into the ocean during a storm and were eaten by large fish that then mutated into the brutal, depraved humanoids that have begun to terrorize the village. By the time Jim and Canco scientist Dr. Susan Drake (Turkel) have deduced what is occurring, the village's annual festival has begun. At the festival, many humanoids appear, murdering the men and raping every woman they can grab. Jim devises a plan to stop the humanoids by pumping gasoline into the bay and setting it on fire, cutting off the humanoids' way of retreat. Meanwhile, Carol is attacked at home by two of the creatures, but manages to kill them before Jim arrives. The morning after the festival, normality seems to have returned to the village. Jim asks the sheriff about Dr. Drake. The sheriff mumbles that she went back to the lab, where she is coaching a pregnant Peggy, who has survived her sexual assault. Peggy is about to give birth when her monstrous offspring bursts from her womb, with Peggy screaming at the screeching baby."

        "content": "Humanoids from the Deep was originally offered to Joe Dante, who turned it down. Peeters accepted the film, and shooting commenced in October 1979. Executive producer Corman said Peeters' version of the film lacked the required exploitative elements needed to satisfy its intended audience. In an interview included on the 2010 Blu-ray release by Shout! Factory, Corman stated Peeters and he had discussed his expectations of the film regarding B-movie exploitation \u2013 this being to fulfill Corman's maxim that monsters \"kill all the men and rape all the women\". In postproduction, Corman said Peeters had done an outstanding job in filming the death scenes involving male characters, but all of the rape scenes had been left \"shadowy\" or used cutaways before the attacks occurred. Portions of the film were directed by an uncredited Murakami, who directed the Corman-produced sci-fi cult classic Battle Beyond the Stars the same year. The film's budget was $2.5 million. The monster costumes were designed and created by Rob Bottin. Second unit director James Sbardellati, who later directed Deathstalker, was hired to enliven the film; he filmed explicit scenes in which the humanoids rape women. These changes were not communicated to most of the people who had made the film with the working title Beneath the Darkness; several of them expressed shock and anger at the released film, its changed title, and the nudity and sexual exploitation. After Peeters and Turkel saw the additional sequences, they asked for their names to be removed from the film, but were refused. Turkel appeared on television talk shows and castigated Corman for his actions. Primary filming took place in the California towns of Mendocino, Fort Bragg, and Noyo."

The film was a modest financial success for New World Pictures. Critical reviews were mostly negative. Paul Taylor said in Time Out, \"Despite the sex of the director, a more blatant endorsement of exploitation cinema's current anti-women slant would be hard to find; Peeters also lies on the gore pretty thick amid the usual visceral drive-in hooks and rip-offs from genre hits; and with the humor of an offering like Piranha entirely absent, this turns out to be a nasty piece of work all round\". Briefly discussing the film in Fangoria, Alien writer Dan O'Bannon criticized the film, saying, \"Roger Corman's people ripped off the chestburster idea for Humanoids of the Deep.\" Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror stated that additional sex and violence scenes had been edited into the film without director Peeter's knowledge. Hardy continued, \"As weighed down as it is with solemn musings about ecology and dispossessed Indians, it looks as if it had always been a hopeless case\". Nathaniel Thompson said on his Mondo Digital website, \"Director Peeters claimed that Roger Corman added some of the more explicit shots of slimy nudity at the last minute to give the film some extra kick, but frankly, the movie needed it. Though competently handled, the lack of visual style, occasionally slow pacing, and peculiar lack of (intentional) humor hinder this from becoming an all-out trash masterpiece\". In his Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, Michael Weldon said, \"Many were offended by the rape aspect of this fast-paced thriller featuring lots of Creature from the Black Lagoon-inspired monsters. Like it or not, it was a hit and is not dull\". Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 out of a possible 4 stars, calling it \"fast, occasionally hilarious gutter trash from the Roger Corman stable\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently has a 50% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 5.17 out of 10."

Conceived following his songwriting breakthrough with \"Let Me Love You\" for fellow R&B singer Mario in 2004, Ne-Yo worked with musicians Ron \"Neff-U\" Feemster, Brandon Howard, Shea Taylor, and Curtis \"Sauce\" Wilson, as well as Norwegian production duo Stargate on most of the album, some of which would become regular contributors on subsequent projects. The singer co-wrote the lyrics for each song on In My Own Words which features guest appearances by rappers Peedi Peedi and Ghostface Killah. Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from most music critics and earned a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Contemporary R&B Album category. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 301,000 copies sold, and reached the top ten of the Canadian Albums Chart. It was subsequently certified platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with 1,5\u00a0million copies sold in the United States, and became a platinum-seller in Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom as well. Four singles were released from the album, including \"Stay\", \"When You're Mad\", \"Sexy Love\", and the number-one hit \"So Sick\". In further support, Ne-Yo went on tour in August 2006 with singer Chris Brown and Dem Franchize Boyz."

With spare but clean, rounded yet consistent production, the album has an appealing azure quality.\" Billboard found that \"though, at times, the lyrics are a bit too sentimental and production is spotty, In My Own Words should have listeners clinging to Ne-Yo's every word.\" Kelefa Sanneh, writer for The New York Times, complimented Ne-Yo for his \"smooth\" writing and added: \"Not everything on this CD is that brilliant, or that shameless, but Ne-Yo is a deft and appealing player in the game of modern-day R&B.\" Slightly less impressed, Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani found that In My Own Words \"might pale next to [John] Legend\u2019s stellar debut, but, even at its Robert Kelly worst, it\u2019s not hateable. And isn\u2019t that all one can ask for from mainstream R&B these days?\" Blender wrote that \"even at its weepiest, his music, thankfully, stays vivacious.\" Raymond Fiore from Entertainment Weekly called the album a \"confident if slightly underwhelming debut.\""

The screenplay, by Bava, Alberto Bevilacqua, Callisto Cosulich, Antonio Roman and Rafael J. Salvia, was based on an Italian-language science fiction short story, Renato Pestriniero's \"One Night of 21 Hours\". American International Pictures released the film as the supporting film on a double feature with Daniel Haller's Die, Monster, Die! (1965). The story follows the horrific experiences of the crew members of two giant spaceships that have crash landed on a forbidding, unexplored planet. The disembodied inhabitants of the world possess the bodies of the crew who died during the crash, and use the animated corpses to stalk and kill the remaining survivors. The film was co-produced by AIP and Italian International Film, with some financing provided by Spain's Castilla Cooperativa Cinematogr\u00e1fica. Ib Melchior and Louis M. Heyward are credited with the script for the AIP English-language release version. Years after its release, some critics have suggested that Bava's film was a major influence on Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) and Prometheus (2012), in both narrative details and visual design."

        "content": "Two huge interplanetary ships on an expedition into deep uncharted space receive a distress signal emanating from Aura, an unexplored planet. Both ships, the Galliott and the Argos, attempt to land on the surface of the fog-encased world. While entering the planet's atmosphere, the crew of the Argos becomes possessed by an unknown force and try to violently kill each other. Only Captain Markary has the will to resist, and is able to force all of the others aboard his ship out of their hypnotic, murderous state. After the Argos lands on the surface, the crew disembarks and explores the eerie landscape in search of the Galliott. Thick, pulsating mists, lit by ever-shifting eerie colors, saturate the terrain. When they finally arrive at the other ship, they find that the crew members have killed each other. Markary's younger brother, Toby, is among the dead. They proceed to bury as many of the corpses as they can, but several bodies are locked inside the ship's bridge. Markary departs to get tools for opening the sealed room, but the corpses disappear by the time he returns. Some of the Argos''' crew are found dead. Tiona sees their corpses walking in the ship, and becomes paralyzed with fear. Markary advises the survivors that they must escape from Aura. Unfortunately, the Argos incurred serious damage during the landing, and repairs will take time. During the waiting period that ensues, several more killings occur. In a private tape recording, Markary admits that he suspects none of them will survive. While exploring Aura, Wes discovers the ruins of a spaceship a few miles from the Argos. Markary, Sanya and Carter investigate. Inside the ship, they discover large skeletal remains of the long dead crew and thus realize that they are not the first ones to have been drawn to the planet by the distress beacon. Markary and Sanya are temporarily trapped inside the ship, but manage to escape and return to the Argos. Carter inexplicably vanishes. Two crew members of the Galliott, Kier and Sallis, arrive at the Argos to steal the ship's Meteor Rejector device. Kier escapes with the machine, but Markary fights Sallis. Markary tears open Sallis' uniform, exposing his putrescent body. He learns that Sallis' corpse is being manipulated by an Auran, who reveals that the two ships were lured to the planet in order for the Aurans to escape from their dying world. With the crew of the Galliott under their complete control, they plan to use the ship to escape to the humans' home planet. Markary vows to stop them. Markary and his crew rush to the Galliott to retrieve the Meteor Rejector. They are successful, and manage to place explosives in the ship. During a struggle with the Aurans, Dr. Karan and Tiona are killed. Markary and Sanya return to the Argos and manage to escape as the Galliott is destroyed. After takeoff, however, they reveal themselves to be possessed by Aurans. They ask Wes, the last survivor, to join them. Wes refuses and tries to sabotage the Meteor Rejector, but fatally electrocutes himself while doing so. Because the device has been broken beyond repair, Markary and Sanya decide to change course for a nearby planet: Earth."

        "content": "American International Pictures had achieved a great deal of commercial success in the early 1960s with Bava's Black Sunday (1960) and Black Sabbath (1963), as well as dozens of lesser Italian films, including several sword and sandal pictures. Eventually, AIP heads Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson decided to coproduce some of these films, rather than just pay for the rights to distribute them, in order to have more control over their content. Planet of the Vampires was one such coproduction, financed by AIP and Italy's Fulvio Lucisano for Italian International Film, along with some Spanish production money provided by Castilla Cooperativa Cinematogr\u00e1fica. AIP provided the services of writer Ib Melchior, whose previous movies had included such modest hits as The Angry Red Planet (1959) and Reptilicus (1961), as well as the relatively big budget Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964). Melchior wrote the screenplay for the English-language version of the film, with some assistance from AIP producer Louis M. Heyward. American Barry Sullivan and Brazilian Norma Bengell led the cast of international actors. Writer Robert J. Skotak reported that each cast member \"used their own native language on the set, in many cases not understanding what the other actors were saying.\" Sullivan's lines were spoken in English, Bengell's in Portuguese, Evi Marandi's in Italian and \u00c1ngel Aranda's in Spanish. Restricted by a low budget, Bava was unable to utilize opticals, so all of the film's extensive visual effects work were done \"in camera\". Miniatures and forced perspective visuals are used throughout, with much colored fog adding atmosphere but also obscuring the sheer cheapness of the sets. Bava explained: \"Do you know what that unknown planet was made of? A couple of plastic rocks \u2014 yes, two: one and one! \u2014 left over from a mythological movie made at Cinecitt\u00e0! To assist the illusion, I filled the set with smoke.\" According to Tim Lucas, the two plastic rocks were multiplied in several shots by mirrors and multiple exposures. The planet's exterior sequences were filmed on an empty stage obscured by mists, table top miniatures and Sch\u00fcfftan process shots."

In 1966, Castle of Frankenstein described the film as \"Beautifully photographed Italian sfantasy with excellent sfx and superb color\". Variety's Dool opined, \"Plot is punctuated with gore, shock, eerie music and wild optic and special effects...Color camera work and production values are smooth and first class...Flash Gordon type story...should keep the young on the edge of their seats and the older set from falling asleep\". Richard Davis, in Films and Filming, wrote that \"Bava is tied to a grossly synthetic studio set which doesn't for a moment convince of its extraterrestrial reality...the piece on the whole is poor stuff\". Monthly Film Bulletin noted the film was, \"a triumph of mind over matter, or of Bava over a shoestring budget and appalling dubbed dialogue...[Bava] does atmospheric wonders with pastel-shaded fog and cunning camerawork\". In 1974, Joe Dante wrote that the \"fabulous comic strip sci-fi shows director Mario Bava at his most visually inventive...\" Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction noted in 1984 that the film was \"A gorgeous atmospheric confection from Bava...Bava's ever-moving camera creates a chilling sense of menace. The result is a triumph of the pulp imagination\". Glenn Erickson (aka \"DVD Savant\") wrote in 2001 that \"Bava's stunning gothic variation weaves a weird tale of flying saucers, ray guns and zombies that looks like no other space movie ever filmed\".

Derek Hill, in a review of the MGM Midnite Movies DVD release of Vampires written for Images Journal, noted, \"Bava's film (along with It! The Terror from Beyond Space, 1958) was a direct influence on Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien. But where Scott's film tried to mask its humble drive-in origins, Planet of the Vampires revels in its origins. The film literally feels like a pulp magazine cover come to garish life...\" Robert Monell, on the DVD Maniacs website, observed, \"[M]uch of the conceptual design and some specific imagery in the 1979 Ridley Scott screamer undoubtedly owes a great debt to Mario Bava's no budget accomplishments.\" Govindini Murty of The Atlantic, in a review of Prometheus, said, \"The striking images Ridley Scott devises for Prometheus reference everything from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires.\" One of the film's most celebrated sequences involves the astronauts performing an exploration of an alien, derelict ship discovered in a huge ruin on the surface of the planet. The crewmembers climb up into the depths of the eerie ship and discover the gigantic remains of long dead monstrous creatures. In 1979, Cinefantastique noted the remarkable similarities between this atmospheric sequence and a lengthy scene in the then-new Alien. The magazine also pointed out other minor parallels between the two films. However, both Alien's director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon claimed at the time that they had never seen Planet of the Vampires. Decades later, Dan O'Bannon would admit: \"I stole the giant skeleton from the Planet of the Vampires\". Tim Lucas has noted that the basic plot and ideas of the film not only inspired Alien but \"continue to influence filmmakers and inspire the genre today, as witnessed by David Twohy's Pitch Black (2000) and Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars (2000).\" In the late 1970s Atlas/Seaboard Comics published a short-lived comic book entitled Planet of Vampires, which combined plot elements from Bava's film with elements of Planet of the Apes and I Am Legend. It has strongly influenced the 2022 DC film Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom''."

Six days later, the decision was taken to cancel production as no satisfactory replacement could be found for Dafoe and write off the $7 million cost.

The sponsor (Pete, under the name Mr. Macaroni) loves the rehearsal and agrees to have it shown in concert. On the night of the performance, everyone is soon ready, except, of course, for Goofy, who accidentally drops all the instruments under an elevator, severely damaging them and thus rendering them unable to make proper musical sounds. Mickey is left unaware of the unfortunate mishap until the time to go on the air and the musicians start to \"play\" the damaged instruments. Throughout the outrageous concert, Mickey struggles with anxiety while Macaroni throws a tantrum inside his private viewing room. Macaroni is reduced to tears when the concert ends, believing his reputation to be ruined, but lightens up when he hears the thunderous applause from the audience. He immediately runs to the orchestra room and carries Mickey Mouse in extreme approval, with the latter not knowing anything that happened. Besides Goofy, other members of the orchestra include Donald Duck, Clara Cluck, Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. At one point, Donald is so fed up with the chaos caused by the damaged instruments that he packs his things and leaves. However, Mickey, who is determined to carry on come what may, points a gun at Donald's head to prevent him from leaving. The shot of the gun would be cut in some television prints."

        "content": "A neo soul album, The Pendulum Vibe features eclectic music that incorporates R&B, funk, and psychedelic soul styles. It also draws on traditional R&B influences, of which The Source writes, \"The album is a modern variation on the Stax/Muscle Shoals convocations of yore, where the feel of the record set a mood that extended long after the final chords evaporated\". Austin's production on the album is characterized by low-end definition and various aural details. Other elements in the music include slow jams, a cappella tracks, acid jazz, hip hop, layers of drums, and sirens. Songs such as \"Freedom\" and \"Sunshine & the Rain\" exhibit hip hop-influenced production. Martin Johnson of the Chicago Reader comments that the album's \"ingeniously gritty sound\" evokes older R&B songs such as Aretha Franklin's \"Day Dreaming\", Curtis Mayfield's \"Future Shock\", and Sly and the Family Stone's \"Family Affair\". The a capella opening track \"Stand\" has rootsy, spiritual harmonies. It segues into \"Freedom\", a rock-inflected soul song with wailing vocals, electronically distorted sonics, resounding rhythm, and a gospel chorus. \"Sunshine & the Rain\" is a bass-heavy song. \"Memories\" is a jazzy, saccharine soul ballad. \"Fatal Lovesick Journey\" has an intimate, smooth R&B style. \"If We Weren't Who We Were\" has a low humming sound. The album has themes of enlightenment, personal freedom, intimate relationships, and womanism. The lyrics celebrate Joi's strength and individuality, and her whimsical, amorous persona exhibits riot grrrl characteristics. Songs such as \"Sunshine & the Rain\" and \"Find Me\" are sung from a black feminist perspective. Joi sings in high alto on the album, and her vocals are varied and impassioned. They are also characterized by dramatic accents and, at times, flat and sharp pitches. \"I've Found My Niche\" has lyrics promoting self-expression. \"Find Me\" is an ode to self-knowledge, with Joi forcefully singing, \"I'll learn from my mistakes and I'll be strong / So I can find me\". \"Adoramus te Christe\" has Latin lyrics and is adapted from Quirino Gasparini's 18th century motet of the same name. The slow, lustful \"Narcissa Cutie Pie\" has erotic subject matter and was inspired by a sexual experience Joi had with another woman. She recalled the experience and addressed her sexuality in an interview, saying that \"I'm not a lesbian [...] But I met a girl who made me question myself\". The song also features the album's recurring theme of independence, with Joi declaring \"I can do whatever I want to do\". \"I Don't Mind\" features a raga rock style and themes of resignation and acceptance. The a capella \"If We Weren't Who We Were\" has spiritual overtones and a theme of lovelessness. The closing track is a reprise of \"Freedom\"."

It was a minor club hit. \"I Found My Niche\" was released on August 2. The album's singles received some exposure with R&B and hip hop audiences. The album was largely overlooked by consumers upon its release, as its eclectic style was difficult to promote to music outlets such as mainstream urban radio and rock charts. It sold less than 100,000 copies and did not chart. Joi later said of its performance with music listeners, \"The people who got it, got it, and they became my fans and that's cool\".

Musician magazine hailed the album as \"the face of soul to come\" with Austin and Joi's \"new kind of urban dub\" and lyrics: \"Joi revels in her own sexuality, without necessarily being defined by it, and faces down most of the contradictions of contemporary R&B without totally rejecting it\". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called Joi \"as enigmatic and ear-grabbing as her music\" and stated, \"Joi's sweet, elastic voice wraps itself up and around spacey pop that exists in a universe all its own\". Browne remarked on her eccentric personality and concluded in his review, \"Joi leaves you scratching your head, but she fills it with beatific sounds along the way.\" Rolling Stone called the album \"an alluring, shifting cybersexual listening experience\" and complimented Joi's \"dynamic range\". Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, cited \"Freedom\" and \"Narcissa Cutie\" as highlights and wrote in summary of the album, \"freedom as manumission, freedom as swinging both ways\". In a retrospective review, Allmusic editor Stanton Swihart commended Joi's \"versatility\" and commented that the album \"has a whole lot to offer listeners across a wide spectrum of pop music.\" Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! called the album \"ahead of its time\". John Murph of the Washington City Paper wrote that, \"artistically, it placed Joi ahead of the pack of prominent R&B singers of the time (SWV, Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston) by sidestepping sap in favor of more vital juices\"."

Martin Johnson of the Chicago Reader wrote of their collective legacy in a 1994 article, \"[they are] likely to fall through the cracks. Iconoclastic women rockers\u2014such as PJ Harvey, Sinead O'Connor, and Tori Amos\u2014have gained a small foothold, but like-minded women in R & B often have nowhere to go. Too radical for urban radio, they're left to rely on word of mouth\". The Pendulum Vibe garnered the attention of recording artist Madonna, who sought out Joi and developed a friendship with her. She also enlisted Austin to produce songs for her 1994 album Bedtime Stories. Joi attempted to follow up The Pendulum Vibe with Amoeba Cleansing Syndrome in 1997, but the album was shelved after her label folded, and she went on an extended hiatus. She became a long-time collaborator of the Dungeon Family collective and appeared on albums by OutKast, Goodie Mob, and Society of Soul. Since its initial reception, The Pendulum Vibe has attained a cult following among listeners of eclectic R&B music. Allmusic's Stanton Swihart cites the album as \"an integral influence on the neo-soul movement\" and \"a predecessor to and trailblazer for artists like Dionne Farris and Erykah Badu\". Jacinta Howard of Creative Loafing writes that Joi was \"arguably the most pivotal - if not the first - artist to arrive on the alternative soul scene, directly influencing acts ranging from Erykah Badu to OutKast to Janelle Mon\u00e1e.\" James Hannaham of Spin views that Joi \"rewrote the rule book for urban contemporary R&B\" with the album, adding that neo soul artists Maxwell and Erykah Badu \"then memorized it.\" Rolling Stone journalist Jon Caramanica writes in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), \"Joi entered the R&B world as a sort of avant-bohemian, doing so-called neosoul music years before Philadelphians like Jill Scott, James Poyser, and Musiq forged a scene to merit the moniker.\" Miles Marshall Lewis cites The Pendulum Vibe, along with De La Soul's Buhloone Mindstate, the Beastie Boys' Check Your Head, Me'shell Ndeg\u00e9ocello's Plantation Lullabies, D'Angelo's Brown Sugar, as one of the albums that \"proved that the aesthetic sentiments of B-boys and bohos were never as divergent as many believed.\" In 1998, Stereophile included the album on its list of Records to Die For, with editor Chip Stern calling it \"unheralded\" and \"as visionary an R&B record as I've heard in the past 25 years.\""

The film which premiered at the Kortfilmfestivalen Grimstad in June 1991, has been screened at over 300 film festivals throughout the world and won 12 different awards, among which the Norwegian Amandaprisen for best short film in 1991, and the Grand Prix at the Tampere Film Festival in 1992.

It's not what people would have expected after \"ASAP\"; people thought we were going with the flow of what's around, the R&B sound. \"I Need Somebody\" is pretty Kylie.\" \"I Need Somebody\" became Bardot's most successful single in Australia after their first, \"Poison\", debuting at number 8 on the ARIA Charts (their second biggest debut) and eventually peaking at number 5. The single also peaked at number one on the ARIA Dance Chart, appealing to a wider dance audience with its various club mixes, and Bardot performed shows at nightclubs across the country. The success of the single confirmed the group's staying power and helped boost its credibility, earning more respect from critics. \"I Need Somebody\" was the 59th highest selling single in Australia for 2001 and the fourth highest by an Australian artist that year. The music video shows the group in an expensive mansion, each member alone in a different part of the house. In the second half of the song, the group combines, arriving at a pool party with a DJ and guests dancing around the girls."

It released on March 19, 2002, as the second international single from the album, while in North America it was released as the lead single, by Warner Bros.

        "content": "Cher recorded \"Song for the Lonely\" in the summer of 2001 in London and intended to include it on her twenty-fourth studio album Living Proof (2001), and it immediately became her favorite song from the album. However, after the September 11 attacks, she began thinking of it in a different way. In an interview with Larry King Live she said that after the attacks, she was listening to the album and when the track began, all of a sudden it took on a completely different meaning for her, especially because of the \"when heroes fall in love and war, they live forever\" lyric. Cher commented that \"Song for the Lonely\" was one of the best tracks she has ever had the opportunity to sing, because according to her, \"we still lived in a world of innocence\" before the attacks. According to the album liner notes, \"Song for the Lonely\" is \"dedicated to the courageous people of New York especially the fire fighters, the police, Mayor Giuliani, Governor Pataki and my friend Liz\". Since its release, the public's reaction to \"Song for the Lonely\" had been positive. James Lonten, manager of a Borders Books & Music store in New York City, which had been stocking Living Proof since its European release, commented, \"That goes without saying. We play the track in-store, and it literally stops people dead in their tracks. It's an instantly affecting, highly emotional song\". John Boulos, senior vice-president of promotion at Warner Bros. Records, commented that they were not exploiting the September 11 attacks as a selling point to the single, but it had drawn the interest of people. \"We simply feel that we have an incredible song by a truly legendary artist. That's a pretty potent combination to take it to the street\", he said. \"Song for the Lonely\" served as the lead American single from Living Proof, being released on March 19, 2002. In the European and international editions of Living Proof, it is listed as \"(This Is) A Song for the Lonely\"."

The music commentator also noted that the lack of vocoder, which had become a signature on Cher's songs, allowed Cher to \"foster a grin\" with opening notes, until the song reaches the chorus \u2013 which Taylor said it was one of the cathiest since Hanson's \"MMMBop\" (1997) \u2013 and \"explodes into a rhythmic tantrum\". When Cher recorded the track, she thought of it as a love song, but after the September 11 attacks, the singer felt the song was right for the occasion. \"Since the world has changed so dramatically, the lyrics have a different weight. They're heavier, yet they're comforting at the same time. Over the past month or so, I've had a number of people tell me that the song has helped them cope.

He finished his review by writing that \"Boy, is \"Song for the Lonely\" ever an elixir for whatever ails you, a joyous romp with such mass appeal that its destination at the top of the charts seems a given\". Kerry L. Smith from AllMusic praised the song, saying, \"Cher takes a brief break from her inquisitiveness about love to dedicate the bold, heartfelt opening track, in honor of the September 11th tragedy, 'Song for the Lonely'\". Barry Walters of Rolling Stone also agreed by writing that it \"clearly intends to evoke September 11th\", adding that \"coming from a willfully wiggy billion-dollar diva, this noble stuff feels calculated, particularly when it's presented in such a sparkling, showbizzy package\". Metro Weeklys Gordon Ashenhurst called it a \"rousing lead single\", while Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that it \"wisely abandons such (otherwise welcomed) electronic shenanigans for a pure and impassioned performance\".

A first-time director and an architecture enthusiast, Maschwitz sent Warner Bros. Records an idea for the video, featuring a Cher-guided tour through New York City's history, exemplified by a multiple reverse-timelapses of some of the great buildings of the city rising up before the viewer's eyes. After receiving news that he got the job following the singer's personal liking for the project, they would start filming the following weeks. The crew received special permission from Mayor Rudy Giuliani's office for live audio playback in the streets of Manhattan, a practice that had recently been outlawed. Cher had done her own makeup, as her makeup artist Kevin Aucoin was nowhere to be found due to his struggling with a terminal illness. At one point of the shooting, they needed to cover some parts of the streets with big, loud smoke machines. As the attacks were still a fresh and painful memory for the citizens, complaints about the smoke started coming in. The police officer manning the intersection gave word that they would have to shut down their atmospheric effects, but they still had one more shot. The director solved this by taking Cher and the script supervisor's camera, and autographing a polaroid to the cop, to continue the last smoked-up shooting. The video starts in sepia tone, featuring Cher walking around the streets of New York City. While the setting for the start of the video is in the 18th century, the singer is dressed in modern-day clothes. The video progresses to black and white, and then to color, as the times for the setting of the video change to the 19th century through various eras to the 20th century. As the timeline changes, buildings around New York are shown being constructed. The video is intercept with shots of Cher dressed in white, which is overlaid in some shots, as well as shots of New York City from the air. People from each stage of the development of the city join Cher as she walks the streets until at the end, there is a large crowd of people from all eras. In 2002, the video was released on VHS to serve as promotion in the United States. An alternative version for the video for \"Song for the Lonely\" was included on the DVD The Very Best of Cher: The Video Hits Collection (2004)."

        "content": "The material from the film was reworked from a previous Sidaris film, Stacey (1973). The role of Stacey Hanson (Anne Randall) was divided into two new characters: private detective protagonist Cody Abilene (Darby Hinton) and his girlfriend June Khnockers (Lynda Wiesmeier). The openings of both films depict their respective female race car drivers in the finish of a practice race. Both films then have them getting out of uniform.  Stacey is the protagonist, though, while June serves mostly as the source of a recurring joke in her film: \"Knockers with an \"h\"?\". June can still reliably drive a high-performance race car, but Cody performs most of Stacey's functions in the film. The discreet homosexual nephew John (John Alderman) turns into Stuart (Michael A. Anderson), a drag queen, in the second film. In both films, the detective follows the character into a gay bar. The difference is that in the first film, John wears regular clothes, while in the second, Stuart is in full drag. Cody laughs while dictating notes into a recorder, but still admits that Stuart has great legs. Stuart is more of a cartoonish gay stereotype than John. The youthful niece Pamela (Cristina Raines) turns into the bit older niece Liza (Lorraine Michaels) in the second film. Liza has her own sex scene with the houseboy Shane (Brett Clark). The difference in age was probably decided to allow this sex scene and more nudity than would be acceptable from a teenager. The second film adds a character with no counterpart in the original: Contessa Luciana (Sybil Danning). Contessa has a romantic night with Cody, before he moves into his next assignment. The relationship to the family is unspecified, but she turns out to have murdered Shane. She is beyond the reach of the law and suffers no ill consequences for her murder."

The film stars Jonah Hill and Michael Cera as Seth and Evan, two teenagers about to graduate from high school. Before graduating, the boys want to party and lose their virginity, but their plan proves harder than expected. Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the script began development when they were 13 years old, and was loosely based on their experience in Grade 12 at Point Grey Secondary School in Vancouver during the 1990s; the main characters have the same given names as the two writers. Rogen was also initially intended to play Seth, but due to age and physical size this was changed, and Hill went on to portray Seth, while Rogen portrayed the irresponsible Officer Michaels, opposite Saturday Night Live star Bill Hader as Officer Slater. Upon release, the film received positive reviews, with critics praising the dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads. The film also proved financially successful, grossing over $170 million on a $17.5-20 million budget. Since the film's release, it has garnered acclaim as one of the best comedies of the 2000s and as one of the best high school movies of all time."

        "content": "Seth and Evan are two high school seniors who have been best friends since childhood. They are about to go off to different colleges. After Seth is paired with Jules during home economics class, she invites him to a party at her house that night. Their friend Fogell reveals his plans to obtain a fake ID, so Seth promises to buy alcohol for Jules' party with money she gives him. Evan runs into his love interest Becca and he offers to get her a specific bottle of vodka for the party. Despite Fogell's fake ID having only one name, \"McLovin\", Fogell successfully buys the liquor, but is knocked out at the last second by a robber. When police officers Slater and Michaels arrive, Seth and Evan believe that Fogell is being arrested. In reality, the officers have agreed to give Fogell a ride to the party. Outside, Seth is hit by a car. In exchange for Seth and Evan not telling the police, the driver promises to take them to another party where they can get alcohol. Meanwhile, Slater and Michaels take Fogell on a ride-along and then bond with him. Despite being on duty, they start drinking, use their sirens improperly, and shoot their pistols at a stop sign. At the party, Seth fills laundry detergent bottles from the basement with alcohol he finds in the fridge and dances with a drunk woman named Jacinda, who stains his leg with menstrual blood, while some men high on cocaine make Evan sing \"These Eyes\" for them. About to leave, Seth is confronted by the host for dancing with his fianc\u00e9e. A brawl ensues, and Jacinda calls the police while Seth and Evan escape. Evan and Seth argue about the fact that Evan is going to a different college from Seth, before Seth is once again hit by a car \u2013 the police cruiser driven by Slater and Michaels. They plan to arrest Seth and Evan, but when Fogell comes out of the car, Evan makes a run for it, while Seth and Fogell escape with the alcohol. Eventually all three make their way to Jules' party. Arriving at the party, Fogell inadvertently reveals that he and Evan will be rooming together at college, further adding to Seth\u2019s discontent towards Evan. At the party, Seth's stories of the night make him popular. Becca wants to have sex with Evan, but he respects her too much to go through with it while she is drunk. Meanwhile, Fogell impresses Nicola and goes upstairs to have sex with her. Seth drunkenly attempts to kiss Jules, but she turns him down because she neither drinks nor wants Seth while he is drunk. Seth believes he has ruined any chance of a relationship with Jules, and passes out, accidentally headbutting her, giving her a black eye. Slater and Michaels bust the party. Seth wakes up and escapes, carrying an intoxicated Evan. Slater interrupts Fogell and Nicola as they are having sex, causing her to run off. Officer Slater is angry at Fogell for ditching them, but Michaels points out they have just interrupted him, and they apologize, reconcile, and reveal they knew all along that Fogell was not 25 as the ID said; They played along, wanting to show cops can have fun too. To make it up to him, they pretend to arrest Fogell outside to make him look \"badass.\" They resume their bonding, eventually destroying their car with a Molotov cocktail while Fogell shoots it with Slater's pistol. Seth and Evan return to Evan's, where Evan admits he does not want to room with Fogell at college next year but is afraid to live with strangers. They apologize to each other before reconciling. The next day, they go to the mall where they run into Jules and Becca. Becca and Seth both apologize for their drunken behavior the previous night, and the boys pair off with the girls. Seth takes Jules to buy concealer for her black eye, while Evan and Becca leave to buy a new comforter to replace the one she ruined by vomiting on it."

It is loosely based on their own experience as seniors in Vancouver in the late 1990s, hence the character names Seth and Evan. Other characters and references were influenced by Goldberg and Rogen's adolescence, such as Steven Glanzberg, their peer at Point Grey Secondary School, characterized in the film as a loner. According to an interview at an event panel in 2009, Fogell was also a real friend of Rogen and Goldberg. Rogen was initially slated to play Hill's character Seth, but due to his physical size and age, he played one of the police officers. When asked where he wants to be dropped off, Fogell tells the officers to take him to 13th and Granville, a nod to Rogen and Goldberg's favourite all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant in Vancouver. The film took seven years to complete from early scripting in 2000 and filming from 2006 to 2007."

Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle called it 2007's most successful comedy. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times had the headline of his review read \"McLovin It,\" and gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and said \"The movie reminded me a little of National Lampoon's Animal House, except that it's more mature, as all movies are.\" Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times said \"Physically, Hill and Cera recall the classic comic duos\u2014Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Aykroyd and Belushi. But they are contemporary kids, sophisticated and sensitive to nuance\"; she added, \"I hope it's not damning the movie with the wrong kind of praise to say that for a film so deliriously smutty, Superbad is supercute.\" Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly said \"2007: the year Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen saved movie comedy\", a reference to Knocked Up which was released in June. Devin Gordon of Newsweek said \"As a Revenge of the Nerds redux, Superbad isn't perfect. But it's super close.\" In a more critical vein, Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter, compared the film to other films with a single-day structure, such as American Graffiti and Dazed and Confused, but said that Superbad \"doesn't have the smarts or the depths of those ensemble comedies.\" The Hollywood Reporter review was referenced in the film's DVD audio commentary, particularly the review's suggestion that the two main characters have a homoerotic experience similar to the film Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n. Adam Graham of The Detroit News said, \"the cops belong in a bad Police Academy sequel, not this movie\", and also that the film \"falls short of teen-classic status.\" Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel called the film \"super-derivative\", \"super-raunchy\", and \"Freaks and Geeks: Uncensored.\" Moore went on to say the film shamelessly plagiarizes from films such as Can't Hardly Wait and American Graffiti. He also said, \"Like Knocked Up, this is a comedy they don't know how to end. The energy flags as it overstays its welcome.\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe said the film \"has a degree more sophistication than Revenge of the Nerds and American Pie, and less than the underrated House Party.\" Morris also said, \"the few smart observations could have come from an episode of one of Apatow's TV shows\" and \"I wanted to find this as funny as audiences did.\""

It was produced by William Cagney (James Cagney's brother), with Hal B. Wallis as executive producer. The screenplay was written by Arthur T. Horman, Richard Macaulay, and Norman Reilly Raine, based on a story by Horman and Roland Gillett. The cinematography was by Wilfred M. Cline, Sol Polito, and Winton C. Hoch and was notable in that it was the first feature-length Hollywood production filmed entirely in Canada. The film stars James Cagney and Dennis Morgan as Canadian pilots who do their part in the Second World War, and features Brenda Marshall, Alan Hale Sr., George Tobias, Reginald Gardiner, and Reginald Denny in supporting roles. The title of the film came from a phrase used by Billy Bishop, the First World War fighter ace, who played himself in the film. The same words are also echoed in the narration of The Lion Has Wings documentary (1939). A film on the ongoing Canadian involvement made sense for the American war effort. The film ends with an epilogue chronicling the contributions of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) to the making of the film."

Dutton, whose ambition is to start his own airline, flies by the book, but MacLean is a seat-of-the-pants kind of pilot, mirroring the differences in their personalities. Dutton saves MacLean's life after he is struck in the head by a still-moving propeller by transporting a doctor under dangerous flying conditions. MacLean is grateful and joins Dutton in a temporary partnership to help Dutton earn the seed fund for his airline. When Dutton rejects MacLean's warning about his girlfriend Emily Foster, MacLean marries her in order to save Dutton from wrecking his life. Dutton, however, does not know this and abruptly ends their friendship. Dutton impulsively gives his savings to charity and enlists in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Later, after hearing Winston Churchill's \"We shall fight on the beaches\" speech on the radio, MacLean and the other bush pilots enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force, only to discover that they are considered too old for combat. They reluctantly agree to train as flight instructors for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Their commanding officer is none other than Dutton. MacLean, with his brash and fiercely independent nature, clashes with the military way of doing things, and he is court-martialed and dismissed from the service for flying too low, resulting in a cadet being severely injured. For revenge, he and \"Tiny\" buzz the airfield when renowned Canadian First World War ace Air Marshal William \"Billy\" Bishop (playing himself) is speaking during the group's graduation ceremony. \"Tiny\" blacks out while pulling out of a dive, and his plane plummets into the ground, killing him. MacLean loses his pilot's license as a result. Later, when two transport aircraft crash, killing all 44 ferry pilots aboard, there is an urgent need for pilots to ferry a group of unarmed Lockheed Hudson bombers from Gander to Britain. The flight instructors are assigned the task, but their numbers have to be supplemented with civilian pilots. MacLean uses \"Tiny\" Murphy's papers to participate. Dutton recognizes him, but as Emily has told him why MacLean married (and abandoned) her, they reconcile and Dutton permits him to fly. Dutton commands a flight of five. Nearing the coast of the British Isles, they are attacked by a German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter. First, Blimp Lebec is shot down. Then after Scrounger, MacLean's navigator, is killed, MacLean uses his flying skills to crash his unwieldy bomber into the nimble fighter, sacrificing himself to save the others."

        "content": "During pre-production, Joseph W. G. Clark, the public relations director of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan was heavily involved in promoting a film project that was initially identified as \"Bush Pilots\" based on a script submitted by Canadian screenwriters. With RCAF backing, Hal Wallis and Jack Warner were approached in Hollywood to undertake a \"patriotic film.\" Warner was enthusiastic, and began the task of casting a major star to front the project. After considering Raymond Massey, Errol Flynn, and Clark Gable, the decision was made to cast George Brent, but Warner Bros. was unsure whether he could carry the film. Numerous attempts to rewrite the script into a more acceptable form resulted in a final screenplay now titled \"Captains of the Clouds\". The name was borrowed from a Victory Loans speech given by Billy Bishop. The only holdup was casting, which was resolved when Warner persuaded its resident \"cocky guy\" (as producer Jerry Wald had dubbed him), 42-year-old James Cagney, to take on the lead male role. This film was Cagney's first in Technicolor. His participation in the production has been characterized as reluctant, and he accepted only after his brother was taken on as an associate producer. He quipped, \"I didn't like this story the last four times I did it and I don't like it now!\" and feared that he was immersed in one of his trademark Warner Bros. \"potboilers\", playing a role he had reprised numerous times. However, in certain scenes, Cagney improvised. His loose interpretation is evident in a cabin scene when he is playing against his cronies. Cagney veers off the script, reverting to the cocky persona he had cultivated in countless earlier features. Captains of the Clouds was produced with the full cooperation of the Royal Canadian Air Force to promote enlistment in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. (It was also intended as a rousing \"war preparedness\" film for American audiences, but by the time it was released, the U.S. was already at war; nevertheless it did serve as a showcase of the Canadian war effort.) The Warner Bros. principal cast and production crew of over 80 technicians, along with \"half a million dollars of colour cinematography equipment,\" came from Hollywood, crossing into Canada on July 12, 1941. The film was shot from mid-July to mid-October 1941. Scenes filmed in Ottawa include several views of the historic Chateau Laurier hotel, Parliament, and the Cenotaph area. Much of the early footage involved a number of bush planes at the Woodcliff Camp on Trout Lake in North Bay, Ontario, and nearby Camp Caribou on Jumping Cariboo Lake in Marten River, Ontario. The aerial sequences were under the direction of Paul Mantz, a long-time Hollywood stunt pilot, who used a Stinson Model A trimotor camera ship. MacLean's aircraft, CF-HGO on-screen, was a Noorduyn Norseman flown by veteran stunt pilot Frank Clarke (who doubled for James Cagney in flying scenes), Johnny Dutton's silver CF-NBP was an actual Fairchild 71C bush plane,  while Laurentian Air Service's Waco EGC-7 and AGC-8 cabin aircraft provided the other float planes. In addition, there was a Waco CJC, registered as CF-AVW (transformed into CF-JPY in the movie), which belonged to Albert Racicot, a Montreal-based plane dealer and aviation mechanics who, at the time, was also one of the several instructors hired by the Canadian government to train military pilots involved in World War II. Principal photography did not go well; a number of incidents slowed production. One of the huskies that was key to a scene bit Morgan, opening up a gash on his hand. Cagney, in an uncharacteristic move, decided to forgo a stunt double and play the scene himself in which his character is struck by a whirling propeller. At first things proceeded smoothly, but when it came time for him to fall into the lake, he overdid it and suffered a real concussion, putting the 10-day shoot at North Bay, Ontario farther behind schedule. Weather was a constant challenge, and with the need to ensure continuity, small scenes became unnecessarily complex; as a result, a typical shooting day lasted almost into the night. One 30-second scene with all the principals running along the dock took an entire day to complete, with Cagney, Hale, and Tobias barely able to stand at the end of filming. With a Hollywood production in their midst, North Bay residents became such a persistent nuisance that the crew reverted to sending messages out of the location site by homing pigeons. The military background sequences were shot at RCAF Air Stations at Uplands, Trenton, Dartmouth, Jarvis, and Mountain View. The \"Wings Parade\" (officially the \"Presentation of Wings Ceremony\") filmed at the No. 2 Service Training School at RCAF Uplands was an actual graduation service for 110 RCAF cadets. It proved to be the most complex scene of the film. Over 100 Harvard training aircraft flew overhead in a salute to the graduates. The climactic ferry mission was staged out over the Atlantic from RCAF Station Dartmouth using the base's operational Lockheed Hudson bombers, along with a repainted Hawker Hurricane that posed as the German Bf 109. Due to the prominent Luftwaffe markings on the RCAF fighter, special alerts had to be posted in order to prevent \"trigger-happy\" home defence gunners from firing at it."

        "content": "Released in an era of patriotic films with overt propaganda themes, Captains of the Clouds received an enthusiastic public acceptance. Although it was a \"Hollywood\" production, the film premiered simultaneously on February 21, 1942 in New York, London, Ottawa, Cairo, Melbourne, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver, with RCAF pilots transporting film copies to all these cities. The public reaction can be partly attributed to the plot line that revolved around the unique Canadian wilderness and the bush pilot mystique. \"So Full of Spectacle and Glory it Had to be Made in Technicolor!\" was the ad copy that was used. The vivid aerial scenes filmed in Technicolor were another aspect of the expensive production that garnered critical attention. Reviews were mixed; while some critics felt the film suffered from a stagey plot and a forced romantic story line, the aerial scenes were considered the film's redeeming feature. According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $2,116,000 domestically and $1,312,000 in foreign markets."

It includes interviews with The Pirate Bay members Fredrik Neij (tiamo), Gottfrid Svartholm (anakata) and Peter Sunde (brokep) that were later re-used by agreement in the documentary film Good Copy Bad Copy, as well as with Piratbyr\u00e5n members Rasmus Fleischer (rsms), Johan (krignell) and Sara Andersson (fraux). The film is notable for its critical analysis of an alleged regulatory capture attempt performed by the Hollywood film lobby to leverage economic sanctions by the United States government on Sweden through the WTO. Evidence is presented of pressure applied through Swedish courts on Swedish police to conducting a search and seizure against The Pirate Bay to disrupt its BitTorrent tracker service, in contravention of Swedish law. The Guardian's James Flint called Part One \"at heart a traditionally structured 'talking heads' documentary\" with \"amusing stylings\" from film-makers who \"practice what they preach.\" It also screened at the British Film Institute and numerous independent international events, and was a talking point in 2007's British Documentary Film Festival. In January 2008 it was featured on BBC Radio 4's Today, in a discussion piece which explored the implications of P2P for traditional media. Material found in Steal This Film includes the music of Can, tracks \"Thief\" and \"She Brings the Rain\"; clips from other documentary interviews with industry and governmental officials; several industry anti-piracy promotionals; logos from several major Hollywood studios, and sequences from The Day After Tomorrow, The Matrix, Zabriskie Point, and They Live.

It premiered (in a preliminary version) at a conference entitled \"The Oil of the 21st Century \u2013 Perspectives on Intellectual Property\" in Berlin, Germany, November 2007. Thematically, Part 2 \"examines the technological and enforcement end of the copyright wars, and on the way that using the internet makes you a copier, and how copying puts you in legal jeopardy.\" It discusses Mark Getty's assertion that 'intellectual property is the oil of the 21st century'. Part 2 draws parallels between the impact of the printing press and the internet in terms of making information accessible beyond a privileged group or \"controllers\". The argument is made that the decentralised nature of the internet makes the enforcement of conventional copyright impossible. Adding to this the internet turns consumers into producers, by way of user generated content, leading to the sharing, mashup and creation of content not motivated by financial gains. This has fundamental implications for market-based media companies. The documentary asks \"How will society change\" and states \"This is the Future \u2013 And it has nothing to do with your bank balance\". Boing Boing's Cory Doctorow called it 'an amazing, funny, enraging and inspiring documentary series', and Part II \"even better than part I.\""

        "content": "The film is famous partly for being one of the most downloaded documentaries to date. Part One was released through an arrangement with The Pirate Bay; the filesharing site marketed Steal This Film in place of its own pirate ship logo. This produced millions of downloads for the film and catapulted it to wide recognition on the Internet after it hit Digg, Slashdot, Reddit and other online centres of attention.Steal This Film (Part 2) was distributed in a similar manner, but with more trackers and indexes involved, including Isohunt and Mininova. Estimates of the total current downloads of the film hover at around the 6 million mark via bittorrent alone. Since the creators have not attempted to restrict copying, the film is also available on YouTube, Google Video and many other web-based video services. A cam version leaked soon after the premiere of Steal This Film (Part 2) in Berlin. Part 2 had its theatrical (rather than viewed online) premiere at the openly organised Who Makes And Owns Your Work artistic seminar in Stockholm 2007. Despite the principles of the seminar itself (organised via public wiki in a year-long process), the involvement of Piratbyran roused the funders of the seminar, the Swedish Arts Grants Committee, to prohibit Piratbyran's logo on the seminar marketing materials alongside its own. The seminar initiators' solution was to add a black sticker dot over the logo, which was easily peeled off. Another condition given by the committee was that a moderator or an anti-piracy spokesperson be present to balance the debate. The documentary was officially released for peer-to-peer filesharing using peer-to-peer networks on 28 December 2007 and, according to the filmmakers, downloaded 150,000 times in the first three days of distribution. Pirate Bay encouraged the downloading of Steal This Film Two, announcing its release on its blog. Steal This Film Part 2 was also screened by the Pirate Cinema Copenhagen in January 2008. The documentary can also be downloaded on the official Steal This Film website."

Robinson, based on the true story of the German doctor and scientist Dr. Paul Ehrlich. The film was released by Warner Bros., with some controversy considering the subject of syphilis in a major studio release. It was nominated for an Oscar for its original screenplay (by Norman Burnstine, Heinz Herald and John Huston), but lost to The Great McGinty."

        "content": "Paul Ehrlich is a physician working in a German hospital. He is dismissed for his constant disregard for hospital rules, which are bound by bureaucratic red tape. The reason for his conflict is his steadily rising interest in research for selective color staining, the marking of cells and microorganisms, using certain dyes and marking agents, which, as he describes in the film, have a certain 'affinity' to that which is to be stained and nothing else. Emil von Behring, whom Dr. Ehrlich meets and befriends, while experimenting with his staining techniques, is impressed with Dr. Ehrlich's staining methods and refers to it as 'specific staining,' adding that this is one of the greatest achievements in science, especially for diagnostic purposes, based on optical microscopy. After attending a medical presentation of one Dr. Robert Koch showing that tuberculosis is a bacterial disease, Ehrlich is able to obtain a sample of the isolated bacterium. After an intense time of research and experimentation in his own lab, paired with a portion of luck, partly thanks to the empathy shown by his wife, he is able to develop a staining process for this bacterium. This result is honored by Koch and medical circles as a highly valuable contribution to diagnostics. During his work, Dr. Ehrlich is infected with tuberculosis, a disease still known as being deadly. Therefore, Ehrlich travels with his wife Hedwig to Egypt for recovery and relief. There he starts to discover the properties of the human body with regard to immunity. This discovery helps Ehrlich and colleague Dr. von Behring to fight a diphtheria epidemic that is killing off many children in the country. The two doctors are rewarded for their efforts. Ehrlich concentrates on work to create his \"magic bullets\" - chemicals injected into the blood to fight various diseases, thus pioneering antibiotic chemotherapy for infectious diseases (later adopted by others to fight cancer). Ehrlich's laboratory has the help of a number of scientists like Sahachiro Hata. The medical board, headed by Dr. Hans Wolfert, believes much of Ehrlich's work is a waste of money and resources and fight for a reduction, just as Ehrlich begins to work on a cure for syphilis. Ehrlich is financially backed by the widow of Jewish banker Georg Speyer, Franziska Speyer, and after 606 tries he finally discovers the remedy for the disease. This substance, first called \"606\", is now known as Arsphenamine or Salvarsan. The joy of discovery is short-lived, as 38 patients who receive the treatment die. Dr. Wolfert denounces the cure publicly and accuses Ehrlich of murdering those who died from the cure. As faith in the new cure starts to dwindle, Ehrlich is forced to sue Wolfert for libel and in the process exonerate 606. Dr. von Bering (who had earlier told Ehrlich to give up his pipe dreams of cures by chemicals), is called by the defense to denounce 606. Von Bering instead states that he believes that 606 is responsible for a 39th death: the death of syphilis itself. Ehrlich is exonerated, but the strain and stress from the trial are too much for his ill body and he dies shortly thereafter, first telling his assistants and colleagues about taking risks with regard to medicine."

        "content": "Warner Bros. Studios was concerned about Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet because it was about a venereal disease, syphilis, and because Ehrlich was Jewish. This was before the U.S. entry into the Second World War. Warner Bros. did not want the movie to be political or seem to have a Jewish agenda since Germany was a market for American films. However, Warner Bros. had produced a series of medical biographical films during the 1930s including the Dieterle-directed The Story of Louis Pasteur (1935) and The White Angel (1936), and U.S. Surgeon General Thomas Parran Jr. had in late 1936 begun a syphilis control campaign to get the public to consider it to be a medical condition and not a moral failure, suggesting that a film on Ehrlich' life would be acceptable. Ehrlich was one of the greatest Jewish doctors, and in 1908 his work on immunity won a Nobel Prize. However, the Nazi regime in Germany had systematically expunged all memory of Ehrlich from public buildings and street signs and censored books referring to him. The Second World War had already begun but the United States was not yet directly involved. Jack Warner, like other Hollywood moguls, was wary of criticism of pursuing any supposedly \"Jewish\" agenda on the screen. A memorandum circulated by the studio bosses stated with regard to the forthcoming Ehrlich movie: \"It would be a mistake to make a political propaganda picture out of a biography which could stand on its own feet.\" So the words \"Jew\" and \"Jewish\" went entirely unmentioned in the film. Anti-Semitism in Ehrlich's life was no more than hinted at, and then only once or twice. In addition, the original version of the deathbed scene was changed so that Ehrlich no longer would refer to the Pentateuch (books of Moses in the Bible). Nevertheless, the film's story writer Norman Burnside declared \"There isn't a man or woman alive who isn't afraid of syphilis, and let them know that a little kike named Ehrlich tamed the scourge. And maybe they can persuade their hoodlum friends to keep their fists off Ehrlich's coreligionists.\" One prohibited topic of the Motion Picture Production Code adopted in 1930 was \"sex hygiene and venereal diseases,\" and after 1934 studios were required to submit films to the Production Code Administration for preclearance review under the Production Code. Working under the puritanical restraints of the Production Code, Warner executives furthermore seriously considered not mentioning the word \"syphilis\" in the movie. However, Hal B. Wallis, president of the association, while advising caution, wrote to Warner Bros. that \"to make a dramatic picture of the life of Dr. Ehrlich and not include this discovery [the anti-syphilis drug Salvarsan] among his great achievements would be unfair to the record.\" Following negotiations, the film received approval under the Production Code provided no scenes showing treatment of patients with syphilis were shown, and advertising of the film could not mention syphilis. The movie's title role star Edward G. Robinson, himself Jewish, was keenly aware of the increasingly desperate situation of the Jews in Germany and Europe. He met with Paul Ehrlich's daughter who had fled to the US and he corresponded with Ehrlich's widow, who was a refugee in Switzerland. (Robinson furthermore welcomed the opportunity to break out of the police and gangster roles in which he was in danger of being forever stereotyped.) \"During the filming,\" Robinson later recalled with regard to his role as Ehrlich: \"I kept to myself, studied the script, practiced gestures before the mirror, read about his life and times, studied pictures of the man, tried to put myself in his mental state, tried to be him.\""

She was the only member of the group to remain on her label, EMI, after they went on an indefinite break in late 1992. It was released on November 7, 1995, in the U.S. and was a commercial failure, selling only 22,000 copies in the United States according to Billboard.com. Chynna co-wrote 9 of the 11 tracks, featuring productions from Rick Nowels, Glen Ballard (who produced the majority of Wilson Phillips' previous work), and Desmond Child. According to Phillips, she was offered $1 million to record a solo album for EMI, and was dropped shortly after due to the album's disappointing sales. Three singles were commercially released from the album: \"Naked and Sacred\", \"I Live for You\" (which was featured in the 1996 film Striptease starring Demi Moore), and \"Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me\". The album track \"Remember Me\" was released in promo form and sent to U.S. radio in 1996, but was never commercially released and never charted. \"Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me\", which was written by Diane Warren and later recorded as a duet by Faith Hill and Tim McGraw (featured on Hill's 1998 album Faith), was released internationally in 1996."

He reports that the Order of the Phoenix will move Harry Potter, no longer under his mother's protective spell, to a safe location. Voldemort confiscates Lucius Malfoy's wand; his own is powerless against Harry because it and Harry's wand are \"brothers\" by sharing the same phoenix feather core. During the move, Harry survives Voldemort's attack but Mad-Eye Moody and Hedwig are killed. During preparations for Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, the new Minister for Magic arrives. He informs Harry, Ron, and Hermione that Albus Dumbledore left each a bequest: Ron a Deluminator, Hermione a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Harry the Golden Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match. Dumbledore had also bequeathed the Sword of Gryffindor to Harry, but it has gone missing. News arrives during the wedding that the Ministry has fallen and the Minister is dead. Death Eaters attack and Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape to Number 12, Grimmauld Place. While there, Ron realizes that Sirius' brother, Regulus Black, is the R.A.B. who stole Salazar Slytherin's locket from Voldemort. Local thief Mundungus Fletcher later sold it to Dolores Umbridge. The Trio infiltrate the Ministry and recover the locket but they are chased by Death Eaters in a chaotic exit. Hermione, having packed everything they need disapparates them to a forest. Ron is injured while disapparating, and the Trio travels on foot while he heals. Ron learned that saying Voldemort's name aloud reveals the speaker's location. Attempts to destroy the locket fail. Hermione deduces that Gryffindor's sword can destroy Horcruxes because it is impregnated with basilisk venom. Ron, affected by the dark locket, is frustrated with their slow progress and irrationally jealous of Harry and Hermione. He argues with Harry, then disapparates, leaving Hermione distraught. Harry and Hermione continue on. When Harry touches the Snitch to his lips, it reveals a cryptic message: \"I open at the close.\" Hermione notices a strange symbol drawn in Beedle the Bard that is identical to one Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius wears. Harry and Hermione search for the sword in Godric's Hollow and encounter the Deathly Hallows symbol in a cemetery. Elderly historian Bathilda Bagshot approaches and motions them to follow. At her cottage is a photo of the young man in Harry's dream who stole a wand from wandmaker Gregorovitch. Bathilda morphs into Voldemort's snake Nagini and attacks Harry. Hermione disapparates them to safety, but her rebounding spell accidentally destroys Harry's wand. Hermione identifies the man in the photo as dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. That night, a doe patronus leads Harry to a frozen pond where Gryffindor's sword lies on the bottom. Harry dives into the frigid water, but the locket around his neck tightens, strangling him. Ron appears, retrieves the sword, and saves Harry. They destroy the locket Horcrux with the sword. Ron explains that the Deluminator led him to their location. The Trio visits Xenophilius Lovegood and learn the symbol represents the Deathly Hallows. Many years before, three brothers each received a prize that evades Death: the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility, and the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand known. Possessing all three makes one the Master of Death. Xenophilius secretly summons the Death Eaters, hoping to exchange Harry for a kidnapped Luna. The three escape, but Snatchers capture them. During a vision, Harry sees an elderly Grindelwald telling Voldemort that the Elder Wand is buried with Dumbledore. At Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix Lestrange sees a Snatcher has Gryffindor's sword that she believed was in her Gringott's vault. Harry and Ron are locked into the cellar where they encounter Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook. Upstairs, Bellatrix tortures Hermione. Harry begs for help using a mirror shard in which he believes he glimpsed Dumbledore; Dobby appears in response and helps save everyone while Harry grabs their captured wands from Draco Malfoy. As they disapparate, Bellatrix throws a cursed knife, killing Dobby. Harry buries him near Bill and Fleur's seaside cottage, an Order safe house. Voldemort retrieves the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb."

Originally set for a single theatrical release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to what David Heyman called \"creative imperative\". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, \"No, David. How are we going to do it?\". After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division. The production filmed at the Dartford Crossing for the dramatic chase where Harry and Hagrid are being ambushed by Death Eaters."

He said, \"We made a very different kind of film, which was shot a great deal on location. We travelled quite far, we built sets, and they spend a lot of time in a forest,\" he explained. \"We built forest sets and integrated them into the real forests, so there were challenges there, as you might imagine.\" Craig was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Part 1. On the wedding tent for Bill and Fleur's wedding in Part 1, Craig commented on his aim to \"rather than make it an extension of the house, which is rather eccentric, homemade, we decided to make it rather elegant . . . It's lined with silk and beautiful, floating candelabra. So it's a nice contrast with the house.\" For the Ministry of Magic set, he noted, \"This is an underground world; this is a ministry, so we went to the real ministries, the Muggle ministries \u2013 Whitehall, in London \u2013 and decided that our magical ministry was kind of a parallel universe to these real ministries.\" Craig also commented on his design of Malfoy Manor, saying that it is \"a very strong architectural set. The exterior is based on an Elizabethan house here in this country called Hardwick Hall and it has massive windows, and these windows are kind of blinded out. The shutters are drawn so they are like blind windows and they have a real kind of presence, an ominous presence, so that gave us the basis for a good exterior. There's an extraordinary magical roof that's added and surrounded by forest which isn't there in reality, but again is one of the devices to make it more threatening and mysterious.\""

Double Negative also advanced the Death Eaters' smoke effects, with the introduction of the 'flayed man' stage in between their smokey, fluid, flying state and their live-action presence upon landing. Other work included the Patronus charm that interrupts the wedding party to inform the guests that Voldemort has taken over the Ministry of Magic. The visual-effects company Framestore produced most of the creature CGI, as in previous films, as well as the animated Tale of the Three Brothers sequence, which was directed and designed by Ben Hibon."

Others expressed that the film faithfully adapted the novel, which led to an inheritance of the \"book's own problems\". Warner Bros.

Pictures has made the decision to release Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 in 2D, in both conventional and IMAX cinemas [because] we will not have a completed 3D version of the film within our release date window.

Even before the leak, the film was already the fifth-biggest generator of advance ticket sales in history, after selling out 1,000 cinemas across the United States. Despite widely circulating rumours that the leaked footage was a marketing ploy to generate hype for the movie release date, no screener discs had been created by Warner Bros., and executives called it \"a serious breach of copyright violation and theft of Warner Bros. property\". In Australia, the film had its premiere on 13 November at Warner Bros. Movie World, located on the Gold Coast, Queensland. Three hundred people attended the viewing, which was the second official showing in the world, behind the UK premiere. The film premiered in Kuwait on 16 November. In Israel, Estonia, and New Zealand, the film was released on 18 November."

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. The UK's Daily Telegraph also gave the film a positive review, remarking, \"For the most part the action romps along, spurred by some impressive special effects,\" adding, \"It's just slightly disappointing that, with the momentum having been established so effectively, we now have to wait until next year to enjoy the rest of the ride.\" Roger Ebert awarded the first part three out of four stars, praising the cast and calling it \"a handsome and sometimes harrowing film . . . completely unintelligible for anyone coming to the series for the first time\". Scott Bowles of USA Today called it, \"Menacing and meditative, Hallows is arguably the best instalment of the planned eight-film franchise, though audiences who haven't kept up with previous chapters will be hopelessly lost\", while Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly likewise praised the film as \"the most cinematically rewarding chapter yet.\" In a review for the Orlando Sentinel, Roger Moore proclaimed Part I as \"Alternately funny and touching, it's the best film in the series, an Empire Strikes Back for these wizards and their wizarding world. And those effects? They're so special you don't notice them.\" Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek gave a negative review, writing, \"They've taken one of the most enchanting series in contemporary fiction and sucked out all the magic . . . while Rowling's stories are endlessly inventive, Potter onscreen just gives you a headache.\" Lou Lumenick of The New York Post found the film to be \"Beautifully shot but a soulless cash machine... [that] delivers no dramatic payoff, no resolution and not much fun.\" Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York named Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 the seventh-best film of 2010, calling it an \"elatingly downbeat blockbuster\"."

God knows why because it's a classic, 10 songs of love and life in a hostile sub-tropical landscape. David McComb wrote the lot and it's a substantial achievement.

This version of the song was recorded live by Mitch Jones on 23 November 1985 at the Graphic Arts Club in Sydney and mixed by Rob Muir in Perth. \"Born Sandy Devotional\" - 5:07 : This version has been reworked, as it only ever appeared as a truncated version on the album, In The Pines. \"Wish to See No More\" - 1:59 : This is another song that was listed for inclusion on Born Sandy Devotional and also for In the Pines but was not included on either. \"Tender Is the Night (The Long Fidelity) Alt. vers.\" - 3:40 : Was recorded on the same cassette as the first two songs, \"The 107\" and \"When a Man Turns Bad\", with McComb and Birt singing this as a duet."

        "content": "Peter Wilson (Jack Lemmon) is a sarcastic near-sighted cartoonist, author, and swinging bachelor living in Manhattan. He detests women, dogs, and children. He is flustered by women's priorities and avoids commitment, much preferring transient physical relationships. At the office of his eye surgeon, Peter meets a leggy, eye-catching strong-willed woman named Terri Kozlenko (Barbara Harris). He likes her very much, but discovers later that she is a single mother to three children, Caroline, Linda, and David. The first thing she learns about him, from his ophthalmologist, is that he's in danger of losing his sight, which would make it impossible for him to continue his work. Nevertheless, they develop a close friendship that grows into romance, when Peter realizes that Terri is the only woman who can tolerate his strong anti-feminist opinions. When she rejects his plan of a sexual relationship conducted exclusively at his bachelor pad (so that he doesn't have to bond with her demanding family), he reluctantly proposes to her. They get married and he moves into her apartment, but her rogue ex-husband Stephen (Jason Robards) appears to spend more time with their children. Stephen and Peter clash at first, but they soon become good drinking friends, much to Terri's disapproval. Peter also begins to bond with David, who has had no stable male role model with his father perpetually off photographing war zones. Peter's eyesight gradually worsens and his boss, Howard Mann (Herb Edelman), begins to criticize his work. On the advice of his ophthalmologist, Peter schedules an operation that could cure his problem, and tries to keep it a secret from Terri to avoid worrying her.  Howard gets hysterical and inadvertently ruins Peter's alibi of working away from home on a book. Terri tells him that she had known that Peter was going blind before they ever got involved. This revelation enrages Peter, and he accuses her of only going to bed with him out of pity.  She says she never once felt sorry for him, but his pride is too wounded to accept this. The operation is partly successful in restoring Peter's vision, and he moves out of the house to his old studio to begin work on a new book, The Last Flower Stephen is killed on assignment, which traumatizes everyone, but Linda in particular.  Her stammer is getting progressively worse. Terri insists she go talk to Peter, who takes her on an imaginary visual tour of his new book--which is about war and human stupidity, but also love and hope and restoration. She begins to conquer her stammer, and he realizes he was wrong to leave his new family, who need him.  He meets Terri at a party related to the release of his new book, and they renew their bond.  Much against his misanthropic nature, he is forced to rejoin humanity."

The writers, Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, had worked on it for 13 months. Film rights were sold almost immediately, to Universal, for a reported $100,000 against a sliding percentage of the gross to reach a maximum of 15% at $2.5 million. A clause was added that if a film was not released by June 30, 1950, the rights would revert to the authors and they would keep the $100,000. Diana Wynyard appeared in the London production and her husband Carol Reed was going to direct the film version. However, he disagreed with Universal about how best to adapt it. Another director, Michael Gordon, encountered similar difficulties. In 1948, Goff approached Universal to buy the project back but balked at the studio's demand for $316,000. When the June 30, 1950 deadline passed, the project reverted to the authors. They tried finance the film with Michael Gordon and Joan Crawford."

Then, his partner disappeared, along with a large stash of police-impounded money. Due to the fact that Matt was an avid gambler, he was the prime suspect for the crime, but his colleague Steve lied that he and Matt were playing poker, thus giving him an alibi. Since the police still suspected Matt of the crimes, he was thrown off the police force. Matt's wife files for divorce and marries Steve. Matt's daughter Becky stays with Steve while Matt spends his time gambling and heavily drinking. Some time later, Matt's markers from extended gambling are mysteriously picked up. Eventually the collector, called the \"Old Man\", sends him a messenger named Blue. Matt is told that he must work off his debt as a hitman for the Old Man's vigilante organization. He begins to receive contracts to kill criminals who avoid arrest with their money and influence. Matt deals with his first assignments without much difficulty. Matt also surprisingly learns that his new girlfriend Drea is also an operative for the Old Man, like Blue. Later, Matt is ordered to kill Steve. He refuses and confronts Blue, the Old Man, and Drea with the assignment. Matt is told that Steve is actually a dirty cop who deals with criminals; Matt refuses to believe this. Elsewhere, Steve kills an innocent chaplain because in a prior confession to the priest Matt had talked about his history with Steve. Steve uses this to frame Blue for the crime. When Matt returns to the church, he swears that he'll avenge the clergyman's death, despite Steve's urgent requests to stay out of the situation. Unwilling to heed Steve's request, Matt is then arrested by Steve for being a \"material witness\" and released after two hours because Steve hopes to find the Old Man and kill Matt and Blue through following Matt. Still, Matt and Blue manage to escape. At the priest's funeral, which Matt later attends, Steve and his associates plan to kill Matt. After the funeral ends, a standoff ensues between Matt and Steve. It is revealed that Steve stole the confiscated money and murdered Matt's partner out of fear that he would blow the whistle on Steve's operations. Blue and Drea show up to support Matt, much to the surprise of Steve, and a gunfight ensues. As a trump card, Steve reveals that he is holding Becky hostage, and threatens to kill her if Matt doesn't back down. Drea is able to free Becky while Matt and Blue fight Steve's associates. Blue is mortally wounded and says his goodbyes to Matt before passing. Matt and Steve confront each other once more and Matt successfully kills Steve. Much later, Becky and her father are shown to be reunited and spending more time together than before. The camera cuts to Matt praying in the church as Drea walks in to give Matt his next assignment from the Old Man."

Seagalogy author Vern praised the film, calling it \"a classic of the DTV era,\" commending the film's better-than-usual cast (particularly Lance Henriksen and Paul Calder\u00f3n), nuanced storyline, and Seagal's willingness to play an older, more flawed character than he typically does. He compares it to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 2007 film Until Death and Abel Ferrara's 1992 film Bad Lieutenant in its subversion of action icons through the use of an unusually flawed protagonist, and claims that, \"[Pistol Whipped] has Seagal stretching his persona and exploring new territory without abandoning his classic themes\". David Johnson of DVD Verdict gave the film a negative review, saying \"this entry into the Seagal canon is dull,\" and going on to criticize Seagal's physique and calling the plot, \"slow-moving, emotionally contrived and utterly predictable.\""

        "content": "In the summer of 1994 in New York City, Luke Shapiro (Peck) is trading marijuana in exchange for therapy from his psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffery Squires (Kingsley). Luke graduates from high school but while dealing at a party, he finds out that Justin (Aaron Yoo) and most of his class have left for the summer, except for him and his classmate and Squires' stepdaughter, Stephanie \"Steph\" Squires (Thirlby). When Luke returns home, he finds his parents arguing over money and their probable eviction from their Manhattan apartment. Luke starts dealing more marijuana to make money for his family. After a session with Squires, he bumps into Steph and invites her to come with him dealing around the city. Steph has a great time and gives Luke her number so she will not be lonely in the city for the summer. Luke calls Steph but ends up talking to Squires and they go out to a bar. While getting drunk and high, they get kicked out for underage drinking. Walking back from the bar, Luke and Squires start tagging a wall but are apprehended by the police. Steph bails them out of jail and, against Squires' wishes, takes Luke out for the day. Luke and Steph end up kissing. When Luke gets home, he finds he has strong feelings for her. After Luke learns that his family is getting evicted, Steph invites him to her family's house on Fire Island while Squires and his wife go on a second honeymoon to repair their marriage. At the island, Steph finds out Luke is a virgin and gives him sex lessons. After taking a shower and having sex together, Luke tells Steph that he loves her. She reacts with astonishment, though Luke fails to realize that she is not interested in a committed relationship. Justin later contacts Steph asking if she wants to hang out. Luke asks Squires for help selling pot in order to make enough money for college. Luke introduces Squires to his client, Eleanor, and they hit it off. As Luke's family is evicted and moves in with his grandparents in New Jersey, Luke visits Steph for companionship, only to find her on a date with Justin. A heartbroken Luke goes to Fire Island to seek counselling with Squires, who is on a bender because his wife left him. While high, Squires tries to commit suicide by drowning in the sea, but Luke stops him. Luke later talks with Squires inside the Squires' home and Squires wishes him good luck. As Luke is leaving, Steph follows him to the elevator to talk to him. However, Luke refuses to talk to her and leaves, leaving a regretful Steph behind. As Luke walks out of the complex, he puts in the mixtape Squires made for him and \"All the Young Dudes\" by Mott the Hoople begins playing. In New Jersey, Luke tells his family he plans to become a psychiatrist, wanting to help other people with their problems. Back in the city, Eleanor beeps Squires and the two make plans to hook up that night. The film cuts to Luke, who is smoking a joint while waiting at a train stop."

Luke and Stephanie bond in Central Park over beer and the sounds of Total Featuring the Notorious B.I.G.'s single \"Can't You See\". \"The What,\" a song from that album featuring Wu-Tang Clan member Method Man, who also appears in the film as Luke's supplier, leads off the soundtrack. Levine says he considered expanding the film's soundtrack to include Weezer and Smashing Pumpkins, two of the year's biggest non-hip-hop acts, and that the original ending featured Nirvana's Lithium.\" Levine wrote, \"Ultimately, tough choices refined the film's reach, which isn't such a bad thing. But that doesn't mean it was easy passing that other music up.\" The soundtrack from the Sundance submission edit of the movie differs from the final edit, with several tracks either being shifted, replaced, or cut out of some scenes possibly due to issues of licensing."

        "content": "Pinocchio (, ) is an Italian fictional character and the protagonist of the children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio (1883) by Italian writer Carlo Collodi of Florence, Tuscany. Pinocchio was carved by a woodcarver named Geppetto in a Tuscan village. He was created as a wooden puppet but he dreams of becoming a real boy. He is notably characterized for his frequent tendency to lie, which causes his nose to grow. Pinocchio is a cultural icon. He is one of the most reimagined characters in children's literature.  His story has been adapted into many other media, notably the 1940 Disney film Pinocchio. Collodi often used the Italian Tuscan dialect in his book. The name Pinocchio is a combination of the Italian words pino (pine),  and occhio (eye); Pino is also an abbreviation of Giuseppino, the diminutive for Giuseppe (the Italian form of Joseph); one of the men who greatly influenced Collodi in his youth was Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist who supervised Collodi at the Libreria Piatti bookshop in Florence. Geppetto, the name of Pinocchio's creator and \u201cfather,\u201d is the diminutive for Geppo, the Tuscan pronunciation of ceppo, meaning a log, stump, block, stock or stub."

        "title": "Pinocchio_Fictional character description",
        "content": "Pinocchio's characterization varies across interpretations, but several aspects are consistent across all adaptations: Pinocchio is a puppet, Pinocchio's maker is Geppetto and Pinocchio's nose grows when he lies. Pinocchio is known for having a short nose that becomes longer when he is under stress (chapter 3), especially while lying. In the original tale, Collodi describes him as a \"rascal,\" \"imp,\" \"scapegrace\" (mischievous or wayward person), \"disgrace,\" \"ragamuffin,\" and \"confirmed rogue,\" with even his father, carpenter Geppetto, referring to him as a \"wretched boy.\" Upon being born, Pinocchio immediately laughs derisively in his creator's face, whereupon he steals the old man's wig. Pinocchio's bad behavior, rather than being charming or endearing, is meant to serve as a warning. Collodi originally intended the story, which was first published in 1881, to be a tragedy. It concluded with the puppet's execution. Pinocchio's enemies, the Fox and the Cat, bind his arms, pass a noose around his throat, and hang him from the branch of an oak tree. A tempestuous northerly wind began to blow and roar angrily, and it beat the poor puppet from side to side, making him swing violently, like the clatter of a bell ringing for a wedding. And the swinging gave him atrocious spasms...His breath failed him and he could say no more. He shut his eyes, opened his mouth, stretched his legs, gave a long shudder, and hung stiff and insensible."

        "content": "Pinocchio is a wooden marionette (a puppet that is manipulated with wires) and not a hand puppet (directly controlled from inside by the puppeteer's hand). However, the piece of wood from which he is derived is animated, and so Pinocchio moves independently. Basically good, he often gets carried away by bad company and is prone to lying. His nose will become longer and longer once he starts lying to others. Because of these characteristics, he often finds himself in trouble. Pinocchio undergoes transformations during the novel: he promises The Fairy with Turquoise Hair to become a real boy, flees with Candlewick to the Land of Toys, becomes a donkey, joins a circus, and becomes a puppet again. In the last chapter, out of the mouth of The Terrible Dogfish with Geppetto, Pinocchio finally stops being a puppet and becomes a real boy (thanks to the intervention of the Fairy in a dream). In the novel, Pinocchio is often depicted with a pointy hat, a jacket and a pair of colored, knee-length pants. In the Disney version, the appearance is different; the character is dressed in Tyrolean style, with Lederhosen and a hat with a feather."

Collodi himself, in Note gaie claims how \"to hide the truth of a speculum animae (mirror of the soul) face [ ... ] is added to the true nose another papier-mache nose.\" There is an inconsistency, however, because his nose grows when it is first carved by Geppetto, without Pinocchio ever lying. The nose appears only a couple of times in the story, but it reveals the Blue Fairy's power over Pinocchio when he acts disobediently. After the boy's struggling and weeping over his deformed nose, the Blue Fairy summons woodpeckers to peck it back to normal."

        "content": "Some literary analysts have described Pinocchio as an epic hero. Like many Western literary heroes, such as Odysseus, Pinocchio descends into hell; he also experiences rebirth through metamorphosis, a common motif in fantasy literature. Before writing Pinocchio, Collodi wrote a number of didactic children's stories for the then-recently unified Italy, including a series about an unruly boy who undergoes humiliating experiences while traveling the country, titled Viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino ('Little Johnny's voyage through Italy'). Throughout Pinocchio, Collodi chastises Pinocchio for his lack of moral fiber and his persistent rejection of responsibility and desire for fun. The structure of the story of Pinocchio follows that of the folktales of peasants who venture out into the world but are na\u00efvely unprepared for what they find, and get into ridiculous situations. At the time of the writing of the book, this was a serious problem, arising partly from the industrialization of Italy, which led to a growing need for reliable labour in the cities; the problem was exacerbated by similar, more or less simultaneous, demands for labour in the industrialization of other countries. One major effect was the emigration of much of the Italian peasantry to cities and to foreign countries such as the United States. The main imperatives demanded of Pinocchio are to work, be good, and study. And in the end Pinocchio's willingness to provide for his father and devote himself to these things transforms him into a real boy with modern comforts."

Pinocchio was voiced by Dickie Jones. Today, the film is considered one of the finest Disney features ever made, and one of the greatest animated films of all time, with a rare 100% rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes. In the video game adaptation of the film, Pinocchio lives out (mostly) the same role as the film, traveling through the world filled with temptations and battling various forces. This Disney incarnation was later used in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, voiced by Peter Westy; and Disney's House of Mouse, voiced by Michael Welch; as well as making cameo appearances in Aladdin, Teacher's Pet, Tangled, the Mickey Mouse television series, and Ralph Breaks the Internet. Pinocchio is a supporting character, voiced by Seth Adkins, in the Kingdom Hearts video game series. He plays a major role in the eponymous first game, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, and Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, while in Kingdom Hearts II he appears during a flashback at the early stages. In Kinect Disneyland Adventures, he appears as a meet-and-greet character in Fantasyland and has several quests for the player.

In the series of paintings titled La morte di Pinocchio, Italian painter and engraver Walther Jervolino (1944\u20132012) shows Pinocchio being executed with arrows or decapitated, thus presenting an alternative story ending. Pinocchio was the official mascot of the UEFA Euro 1980 held in Italy, the first UEFA European Championship to feature a mascot. 12927 Pinocchio, a main-belt asteroid discovered on 30 September 1999, by M. Tombelli and L. Tesi at San Marcello Pistoiese, was named after Pinocchio. In A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), the story of Pinocchio is woven throughout the story as a robot, an artificial boy, struggles to become real through a search for the Blue Fairy. In the modern Battlestar Galactica series, the producers have stated that main antagonist John Cavil basically suffers from an inverted version of Pinocchio Syndrome; where Pinocchio was a puppet who wanted to be a real boy, Cavil was a machine who was given a human body and now wants to be a true machine, resenting his creators for making him in the image of humanity. In Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), the story of Pinocchio is referenced to symbolize the cybernetic villain Ultron becoming free of his master (Tony Stark's) orders. A dark version of the Disney Pinocchio song \"I've Got No Strings\" is also quoted by him, and used in promotional material for the film. In 2015 and 2016, the Dutch themepark Efteling used its own version of Pinocchio's story for a musical in her theater. It is a mix of the original Carlo Collodi's story, the Disney version and some adjustments. Fay de Fee (translated: Fay the Fairy) here takes on the role of the good fairy, but is also Pinocchio's 'conscience'. In the Efteling version there is also a  Monster Fish that eats Pinocchio and Geppetto. Various other versions speak of a Whale. Halfway through 2016, the fairytale of Pinocchio was added in the Fairytale Forest of the Efteling. A walk-through attraction in a wooded area, in which various scenes from fairytales are depicted. Especially for the Italian visitors, an Italian translation was added for this fairytale.

James said in an interview with the digital newspaper Scotsman.com: \"I'm sure a lot of fans will be excited by the following: It's closer in spirit to the first album \u2013 it's got real soul to it. We've gone more for the emotional, tugging at the heartstrings approach. We went off on a bit of a rock tangent on the last album. It was good fun but it's time to get back to our roots.\" On 21 March 2008, James Walsh wrote: There has been an emphasis on strong melodies and simple arrangements for this album and the guitar playing of Richard Warren has definitely enhanced the sound. I'm not one for slagging off the last album and saying this one is 100 times better because the last album definitely had its merits. However we have spent a lot longer writing and recording this one and the result is the perfect companion to Love Is Here. According to Manchester Evening News, there isn't a particular theme to All the Plans but \"married life and international politics are some of the key ingredients.\" Walsh said, \"We've tried to write classic songs.\" In an interview with James Oldham, Walsh commented that he thought the band had perhaps become a bit too defensive to media impressions: We wanted to prove people wrong. Working with Phil Spector on the second record [he actually only produced two tracks before he was fired] and then making a more American sounding rock record [2005's On the Outside] was just our way of trying to prove ourselves to our detractors. The new album is us realising that that was unnecessary and returning to the sound that we love and established us in the first place.\" The album was postponed one week in order not to clash with U2's then-forthcoming album, No Line on the Horizon. According to Walsh, when the band was recording a live session on Radio 2 on 13 January 2009, radio hosts Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie highlighted the fact that Starsailor would release All the Plans on the same day as U2 and else suggest calling Bono and \"toss a coin for who moves their release date.\" Bono called \"heads\" ,winning the toss, and so All the Plans was postponed for a week."

According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 62, based on 9 reviews. On 5 February 2009, the newspaper Washington Square News posted the world's first review of All the Plans, giving a generally positive assessment. Kadeen Griffiths from Washington Square News wrote that: \"The band's fourth studio album is both its first with Virgin Records and with Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood. The result is a cohesive blend of solid beats and fantastic harmonies. The addition of subtle, simple sounds like the tambourine on \"Boy in Waiting\" and the piano intro to \"Change My Mind\" gives the album a homey, personal feel. Tambourine and piano may not be the most innovative, but they provide a glimpse into the heart and soul of the band through their simple sounds.\" On 13 February 2009, Nigel Goulds from Belfast Telegraph stated, \"The band have served up another collection of heart-tugging tracks which again benefit from James Walsh's \u2013 who's based in Belfast much of the time \u2013 unique set of vocal cords. There's really nothing new to add to the Starsailor repertoire but when they produce songs of uncluttered grandeur they really are in a league of their own.\" On 26 February 2009, The Guardian gave the album its first rave review, praising the quality of the songs, the emotional core, and Ron Wood's guitar work, summarising \"With no one expecting it but themselves Starsailor have delivered.\" PopMatters called the lyrics \"a rather pedestrian litany of breakup woes\" but concurred that the melodies were well written and asserted that they, and most especially Walsh's vocals, more than made up for such flaws. They concluded \"Starsailor are the most consistently good of the English pop troupes, with each of their efforts succeeding gracefully at what they attempt to accomplish.\" On 8 March 2009, Dan Cairns from The Times claimed that, \"What has changed is that the self-consciousness and anxiety that marred 2005's On the Outside has gone. On All the Plans, Starsailor sound like a band in love again with being a band,\" and added that \"there is a real sense here of a band finally settling into their own skin, and rather liking the feeling.\" On 9 March 2009, Andrew Hirst from the Huddersfield Daily Examiner said that, \"Now nine years into their topsy turvy career, Starsailor have reached a new peak with an album of stunning elegance and presence.\" On 12 March 2009, The Glaswegian named All the Plans as \"album of the week,\" stating that, \"After their last misfiring album, All the Plans can be seen as something of a comeback. It's also a return to form, as, while the Chorley lads may have lost a little ground, they've not lost their way with emotional, melodic music. The title track, which boasts an appearance from Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, could be Oasis at their most anthemic, while James Walsh's voice has rarely sounded better than it does on \"Hurts Too Much.\" The real stars of the show are the rootsy \"Stars and Stripes\" and the album's penultimate track \"Listen Up,\" which might be the best song the band ever wrote.\" However, Mojo wrote a negative review, stating that, \"You try to remember a single melody or hook from the record and you're found wanting\", while James Skinner of Drowned in Sound went as far as to single out the lyrics to 'Change My Mind', stating that \"Starsailor are so wantonly unoriginal, so brazenly mediocre on every level, it's almost like they don\u2019t even realise that they are and totally mean all this stuff.\" Entertainment.ie's review echoed these sentiments, remarking \"If you're looking for any more reasons to dislike Starsailor, you'll find them in abundance on album number four, which is a continuation of the dull pub-rock sound that they've rarely deviated from during their nine-year career.\" Gillian Watson of The Skinny was yet another voice in this chorus, asserting that \"The culprit here is frontman James Walsh, whose banal lyrics and achingly sincere vocals are a wearying and occasionally embarrassing listen.\""

The film was selected as the Egyptian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 43rd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. It is the 3rd on the list of Top 100 Egyptian films. It remains one of the best examples of neo-realism in Egyptian cinema. Other notable examples include Youssef Chahine's Al Ard (The Earth, 1968) and Al Usfur(The Sparrow, 1972) as well as  Tewfik Saleh\u2019s The Dupes(Al Makhdu'un, 1973). Produced by Roberto Rossellini, who was instrumental in encouraging Abdel Salam to make the film, The Night of the Changing Years tells a story set among the grave robbers of Kurna in Upper Egypt. \"Shadi Abdel Salam's The Mummy was the forerunner of what was to become the hallmark of the new realism, namely, the preoccupation with the search for identity and the relationship between heritage and character.\" The relationship between contemporary and Ancient Egypt is dealt with allegorically in the film. The static images of landscape and the rigid expressions of the main characters reflect those of the statues and reliefs found in Ancient Egypt. The use of classical Arabic, not Egyptian dialect which is normally used in Egyptian cinema, reinforces the impression of monumentalism. The unrestrained sacking of the tombs is represented as a danger, threatening moral decline by inviting greed and sex to undermine the dignity of the tribe and its traditions, replacing the order of the world with chaos. Shadi Abdel Salam has said that his task was to remind Egyptians of their own history: \"I think that the people of my country are ignorant of our history and I feel that it is my mission to make them know some of it. I regard cinema not as a consumerist art, but as a historical document for the next generations.\" Although he went on to direct short fiction and documentaries, The Night of the Changing Years remains Abdel Salam's only full length feature film."

        "content": "This film is set in 1881, when Egypt was under the failing rule of the Ottoman Khedives, themselves overseen by the Anglo-French Caisse de la Dette, and a year before the start of British colonial rule. It is based on the true story of the Abd el-Rassuls, an Upper-Egyptian clan that is stealing piecemeal a cache of mummies they have discovered at a tomb (known to modern Egyptologists as DB320) near the village of Kurna, and selling the artefacts on the black market. The film begins with Wanis (Ahmed Marei) and his older brother (Ahmed Hegazy) watching the funeral of their father Selim. The brothers have become the heads of the Horabat tribe, and their uncle shows them its dark secret \u2013 the tribe has been living off the treasures of the ancient pharaohs buried in tombs within the mountain on which they live. The brothers are shocked on seeing their uncle beheading a mummy to obtain a gold necklace. They feel their life is built on a lie. The older brother complains to the family, who kill him and throw his body into the Nile. The secret thus falls solely onto the shoulders of Wanis, who struggles to reconcile his conscience with his loyalty to his people. The city people (effendis), wealthy Egyptian archeologists, have come - unusually in the hot summer - to try to identify the source of unexplained artefacts which have been found on the black market, following a meeting with French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero. The trading has been led by Ayoub (Shafiq Noureddin), via Murad (Mohamed Babih), who also runs a brothel. Wanis tells Ayoub that the tribe will not trade with him again. Murad then tells Wanis that his uncle arranged for his brother to be killed; Murad says that Ayoub has sent him to repair the relationship with Wanis and acquire the remaining treasure. Wanis refuses, and walks to the steamboat carrying the effendi leadership. A team of archaeologists and soldiers are sent to the tomb, and the tomb is emptied of all the sarcophagi, which are loaded onto the boat."

        "content": "At the start of 2008, Ciara began working on her third album. She became executive producer of the album, with LaFace Records A&R coordinator Mark Pitts. The first recording sessions saw her working with producers Tricky Stewart, Danja, Jasper Cameron, and The-Dream. In an interview from a concert, Ciara stated that she worked on two tracks with Justin Timberlake and his production team The Y's which will appear on the album. Spike Stent was involved in mixing tracks for the album which Ciara recorded at Chalice Studios. Ciara stated in 2008 that she wanted her third album \"to take fans on a musical journey\". Billboard magazine initially reported that the album would be released across three discs, each representing a different theme and featuring stylistically similar songs. Danja executively produced the Crunktown and Kingdom of Dance cuts while the Groove City offerings were overseen by Tricky Stewart and Jasper Cameron. The Groove City recordings were intended to remind fans of the Evolution era. The first single \"Never Ever\" (featuring Young Jeezy) falls under this theme and is similar to previous single \"Promise\". Crunktown tracks are remincent of single \"Goodies\" and the trademark genre that Ciara is associated with. \"High Price\" (featuring Ludacris) was the original lead single and an example of what Ciara had created under the crunk theme. The final recordings where up-tempo pop-tinged, house, and freestyle cuts under the theme Kingdom of Dance which can be heard on the album's second single \"Love Sex Magic\" (featuring Justin Timberlake). However, during an interview the editor of Vibe in April, magazine Ciara confirmed that along with changing management she had dropped the three disc idea. The editor previewed six of the songs recorded for the album."

DC Comics artist Bernard Chang helped Ciara create the character for the album artwork.  Ciara said she worked on the artwork about nine months to a year. On April 5, her official website posted the new album covers (purple Super C for the standard edition, red Super C for the deluxe edition). Speaking on the images, Ciara stated, \"Super C is my super hero name. It's who I am. It's the inner strength and drive that enables me to overcome any obstacles and who I have to be in order to accomplish my dreams and survive in this tough world.\" Her official website confirmed that in North America the album will feature the super hero covers whereas international markets will receive the human cover featuring Ciara on a faded white background."

BBC Music states: \"When listing great pop stars of the 2000s, it's more than likely that Ciara will be unfairly forgotten. It's just as exciting to hear the slow jams as the club tracks, thanks to the detailed and often strange sounding backing tracks. She uses her silky vocals on softer tracks such as the Ne-Yo produced \"I Don't Remember\" or the delicate \"Never Ever\" to great effect. Only \"Like a Surgeon\" with its somewhat bizarre sex/hospital metaphors may leave you at a loss for words. Overall it is a record that manages to make you dance as much as retreat to the bedroom, Fantasy Ride is an album which could take Ciara to the much deserved next level. Slant Magazine also gave the album a positive review ending the review by calling the album \"Ciara's smoothest ride ever\". The Guardian said \"despite the usual collaborators, it is Ciara's presence that is stamped firmly on the album. Evidence that she is an under-rated balladeer comes in the form of \"Keep Dancin' on Me\", a shimmering slow jam, and the morning-after existential haze of \"I Don't Remember\", but a terpsichorean swagger remains at the heart of Ciara's world. Few artists go as hard as she does on her club jams, whether inviting the world to 'kiss my swag' over kinetic freestyle beats on \"Pucker Up\", combining outraged soprano braggadocio with thunderous crunk baselines on the broiling \"High Price\" or gliding smoothly through the delectable, sun-kissed \"Echo\". At her best, her pace is furious, and keeping up is exhilarating.\" Digital Spy gave it three out of five stars and commented that \"Fantasy Ride features much the same cast of producers as countless other R&B albums from the last couple of years, but these A-list knob-twiddlers rarely try anything risky or inventive here. However, this isn't to say that Fantasy Ride is a bad album. It actually offers a consistently sexy listen with enough minor triumphs \u2013 \"Love Sex Magic\", \"Turntables\" and the electro-scuzzy \"Pucker Up\" \u2013 to hold your attention. Ciara, meanwhile, is on a seductive form throughout. Ciara's Fantasy Ride deserves the benefit of the doubt.\" However, Billboard gave it an average review, stating, \"On 'High Price,' where she takes her vocals to an opera-like pitch, and her collaboration with the-Dream, 'Lover's Things,' whose faint tenor would seem like an ideal match, Ciara seems to go almost unnoticed. Thankfully, 'Work,' featuring Missy Elliott, has Ciara showing fly-girl antics over a house-like, clap-laden production, and the breakup song 'Never Ever,' featuring Young Jeezy, which samples 'If You Don't Know Me by Now,' pick up the slack.\"  In his Consumer Guide, however, Robert Christgau gave the album a \"dud\" score ()."

The album also made it to number two on the UK R&B Albums Chart. \"Turntables\" (featuring Chris Brown) charted in the UK at number 80 on the UK singles chart for just one week, it then dropped out. The song has received much airplay on UK radio station BBC Radio 1Xtra. On the issue dated May 23, 2009, Fantasy Ride debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart. This made it Ciara's third consecutive album to debut within the top three on that chart, making her only the fourth female artist to do so during this decade. Although the song \"Go Girl\" was initially planned to be released as the first worldwide single, after a disappointing chart performance, it eventually received just a promotional release. The song charted in the US at number 78 on the US Billboard Hot 100, 26 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and 88 on the Billboard Pop 100. \"Ciara to the Stage\" charted at number four on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 during the week the album was released. As of June 2013, the album has sold 206,000 copies in the US, failing to match the success of previous albums Goodies (2.7 million copies) and Ciara: The Evolution (1.3 million copies). In Canada, the album debuted at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart, becoming Ciara's first album peak in the top ten. This happened due to the song \"I'm On\", a deluxe edition track, to chart on the Canadian Hot 100 at number 79. Additionally, the album reached top 10 in Argentina, and Ireland, where it debuted at number 9 and 10 respectively. Ciara also obtained her highest peak in Belgium, France, and Switzerland.

Jaggubhai returns to India as a dejected officer, failing in both his official duty and personal life. However, fate had something in store for him. 20 years later, or as he says it 21 years later, he gets a call from Australia stating that Ilavarasi is dead and has left him a will. He reaches Australia and is shocked to know that the brief encounter with Ilavarasi had resulted in a daughter named Monisha, who is now a teenager. Jaggubhai realizes that he has left behind his daughter and her wish that he should protect her. Monisha thinks he is her mother's friend and tries to act cranky. The threat comes in the form of some antisocial elements who want to eliminate Monisha. These thugs were the same ones who had tricked Jaggubhai 21 years earlier and who had killed Ilavarasi. Now, it is Jaggubhai's duty to save his only daughter and settle old scores with the thugs. He now meets his former colleague Kaaliyappan or MIB. With his help, he kills the thugs and their leader Hamid Ansari (Richard Raj). Monisha then accepts Jaggubhai as her father."

Page's history with guitar traces back to his childhood when he played in a skiffle band. After desiring to do more than play pop music, Page \"retires\" from guitar playing to attend art school. He later revives his music career as a session guitarist, only to be discouraged by the realization that he is playing others' music and stifling his own creativity. At that point, Page begins to write and perform in the bands The Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin. Page discusses the skiffle and blues music that influenced him at the time. For many of Page's scenes, he is seen visiting Headley Grange, where several songs from Led Zeppelin IV were recorded, and in one scene, explains how the distinctive drum sound from \"When the Levee Breaks\" was achieved from the acoustics of the house in which it was recorded. The Edge's history with guitar traces back to building a guitar with his brother Dik and learning to play. In the film, he visits Mount Temple Comprehensive School and recalls forming U2 in his childhood. He also demonstrates his playing technique, in how he eliminates certain strings from chords, as well as his use of echo and delay effects to \"fill in notes that aren't there\". He also discusses his purchase of his signature guitar, the Gibson Explorer, in New York City and the punk music that influenced him. In other scenes, he plays early demo tapes of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", discusses his inspiration for \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and spends time experimenting with guitar effects for the riffs to \"Get on Your Boots\". Jack White traces his musical background to his childhood in a rundown neighborhood of Detroit. Living with two drum sets and a guitar occupying his room and sleeping on a piece of foam due to taking out his bed for more room for his music, White struggled to find a musical identity, as it was \"uncool\" to play an instrument and his nine siblings all shared a musical propensity. His strong interest in blues and roots music opposed the hip hop and house music popular in the predominantly Latino south Detroit neighbourhood at the time. White eventually finds a niche in a garage rock band called The Upholsterers while working as an upholsterer, which paves the way for his future bands The White Stripes and The Raconteurs. White's philosophy is to limit and challenge himself in various ways to force creative approaches to recording and playing. The touchstone of the film is a meeting of the three guitarists dubbed \"The Summit\". In these scenes, the three guitarists not only converse about their influences and techniques, but they also play each other's songs together, showing each other how to play \"I Will Follow\", \"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\", and \"In My Time of Dying\". The film concludes with the men playing an impromptu cover version of The Band's \"The Weight\" on acoustic guitars."

        "content": "Karan (Fardeen Khan) and Bhavesh (Tusshar Kapoor) are close friends living in Cape Town, South Africa. Karan has a good life, with a well-paying job. He is in a comfortable relationship with his beautiful yet childish and pampered girlfriend Sanjana (Genelia D'Souza), who changes her profession every six months rather disastrously. Her father (Anupam Kher), who dislikes Karan, always tries to keep her happy and supports her. Bhavesh wishes for an arranged marriage and keeps a diary of all the beautiful things he will do to his wife after marriage. His father Darshan Manibhai Patel (Darshan Jariwala) is a strict autocrat, patriarch. Jeet (Govinda) does not believe in marriage or love and is a womaniser. He encourages married women into divorcing their spouses so that his living as a divorce lawyer is uncompromised. Bhavesh's father treats him as young and incapable of marriage, but on his wife's (Shoma Anand) insistence, he travels with his family, along with Karan and Sanjana to Gujarat to find Bhavesh a bride. In Gujarat, they stay at the palatial home of Bhavesh's father's friend, Vijay Singh Jadeja (Vikram Gokhale). Bhavesh meets some girls but ends up falling for Prachi (Prachi Desai), Vijay Singh's daughter, and they get married. During their wedding, Sanjana says \"yes\" to Karan's proposal as well and they get married the same night. The movie then switches to the present, where both couples are at court. The judge declares the divorce between Karan and Sanjana and Bhavesh and Prachi valid. The story goes back 6 months earlier, showing what led to the divorces when they came back to Cape Town from India. After marriage, Karan and Sanjana's family life deteriorates, with Karan wanting domestic stability and Sanjana being a horrible homemaker. Karan finally loses patience with Sanjana after she accidentally burns down their apartment, and yells at her, venting his frustration at her stupidity and his dislike for her father. Shocked and heartbroken, Sanjana leaves and sends a notice of divorce to him the very next morning. Bhavesh is happy with Prachi but Prachi is stifled at the old-fashioned ideals and strict rules of Bhavesh's father. She, without her father-in-law's knowledge, applies for a job \u2013 the very idea of which angers him. Bhavesh, taking sides with his father, slaps her at the same time Prachi's father arrives. Bhavesh, bound by his father's old-fashioned ideas, is unable to stand by his wife. This ends with Prachi divorcing Bhavesh. Jeet later changes his lifestyle when he meets Anjali (Amrita Rao in a special appearance), who turns out to be different from all the other girls he has met since she does not give up on him and expresses a genuine desire to marry him. He decides to marry her and Karan and Bhavesh shout themselves hoarse at him, stating that since Jeet had facilitated their divorces, he has no right to get married. Jeet explains that he was wrong in taking a negative view of love and marriage and also says that wives or \"life partners\" always stood by their husbands, thus it is never worth it to break up such a relationship. At Jeet's wedding, Sanjana enters the party, wearing a \"bomb\", shouting that Jeet was happily getting married when he had caused her divorce. With five minutes left for the bomb to explode, Karan and Sanjana have an argument as to why their divorce took place. Sanjana's father intervenes by saying that he had been against the relationship from the start, and he had sent the divorce papers to them without their knowledge. With only seconds left, Bhavesh's father also apologises to Prachi and the family for imposing his traditional values on them. However, the \"bomb\" turns out to be fake. When this is revealed to be a plan concocted by Jeet and Sanjana to bring everyone to admit their mistakes, everyone reconciles with each other. At the end, Bhavesh's father lets go of his strict ideals and is shown interacting happily and in a modern manner with his family. Jeet becomes a marriage counsellor, now uniting the very people he separated, and Karan unsuccessfully tries to teach Sanjana how to cook."

Their song \"Take It Home\", replete with guitar riff, is their homage to \"Day Tripper\". The first track, \"I Just Want to Touch You\", was written by Todd Rundgren for the Roadie soundtrack. It was rejected by the movie's producers for fear of legal action because it sounded so much like the Beatles. The original pressing was made to look like an early 1960s Beatles release, with custom inner sleeve advertising their previous three albums even down to the way the vinyl was mastered with wide bands of silence between each song."

Their initial stop, for punting on the River Thames in an inflatable raft, ends disastrously when they collide with a rowing team and sink beneath the waters.  Tony then takes Lucy to the heart of London's shopping district, where she models the latest mod fashions in a musical number based on the Phil Spector tune \"Lucy in London\". Lucy is then escorted to Madame Tussaud\u2019s wax museum, where she is frightened by a curator (Wilfred Hyde-White) whom she mistakes for a haunted wax statue that comes to life.  She then visits a British manor, where she plays Kate opposite actor Peter Wyngarde in a scene from the William Shakespeare comedy The Taming of the Shrew.  Lucy and Tony return to the Thames, where they sing Pop Goes the Weasel as a duet.  The Dave Clark Five turns up to sing London Bridge is Falling Down. Lucy and Tony then arrive at an empty theater, where Tony dons a tuxedo and sings a medley of songs from the Leslie Bricusse-Anthony Newley show Stop the World \u2013 I Want to Get Off.

        "content": "Lucy in London came about as part of Lucille Ball's 1966\u201367 contract renewal with CBS. At the time, she was producing and starring in The Lucy Show for the network. The agreement gave her the option to star in three specials that would be produced independent of her weekly program.  Ball originally planned a production where she would co-star with Mitzi Gaynor as two nuns touring Europe, followed by a French-based production called Lucy in Paris and a Middle Eastern comedy called Lucy in Arabia.  None of those projects gained footing, and instead Ball, through her company Desilu Productions, opted to shoot Lucy in London. Impressed by his work, Ball hired Steve Binder to direct the special. The concept for Lucy in London was set up in an episode of The Lucy Show called \"Lucy Flies to London\". Much of that episode, which involved Lucy\u2019s unfamiliarity with air travel, was based on an unsold pilot written and shot in 1960. However Lucy In London itself was not explicit in its connection to The Lucy Show. Subtle references were made to The Lucy Show including her winning the jingle contest but explicit references like Lucy's surname Carmichael and that her boss is Mr Mooney were avoided. It seemed that Lucy In London was written this way to accommodate viewers who may not have been watching The Lucy Show at all. In fact Lucy In London was promoted as a special in its own right but not as part of The Lucy Show. Laurence Olivier was signed to appear in Lucy in London, but withdrew from the production prior to shooting. Ball went through 15 different wigs during the production.  Cleo Smith, Ball's cousin and the executive in charge of this production, later recalled that problems arose in photographing the star on the London locations, where the use of heavy stage make-up and filtered lighting that was employed for her studio-based program could not be repeated.  Ball's biographer Geoffrey Mark Fidelman would later remark that the actress \"looked old\" throughout the show due to difficulties in establishing flattering lighting for the outdoor sequences. Lucy in London was broadcast on October 24, 1966, replacing both The Lucy Show and The Andy Griffith Show for that evening. Viewership was high for the special (finishing as the most-watched telecast of the week) but critical responses were very poor, with Variety complaining: \"What had promised to be one of the season's major specials turned out to be a major disappointment.\"  Ball opted not to pursue the creation of the remaining two specials in her contract and severed ties with director Steve Binder.  (Ball did co-star in one other special earlier in 1966, Carol + 2, which starred Carol Burnett, had a much better reception and would be re-aired in 1967 to fill one of the spots of the two unproduced specials.) Additionally, Ball had starred in a special in 1965, The Lucille Ball Comedy Hour with Bob Hope (that is not to be confused with her similarly-titled series of television specials with the cast of her prior show), although that special was not part of the contract that gave way to this production. Lucy in London is included on the DVD release of The Lucy Show - The Official 5th Season."

It was written, directed, produced and shot by rock phenomenologist feminist Lisa Rose Apramian, edited, shot and co-produced by drummer Kyle C. Kyle and co-produced by Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain.  A DVD, with a booklet, was available for purchase at the official website (until 2019 when the website was shut down) and a release date for the sequel book is still in the works as of 2019. The bands featured in the film were Hole, L7, Lunachicks, Babes in Toyland, Joan Jett, Calamity Jane, Bulimia Banquet, The Mudwimin, Silverfish, 7 Year Bitch, Bratmobile, Bikini Kill.

It also features female rock communities including riot grrrl and the first annual Riot Grrl Convention, Rock 'n' Roll High School of Melbourne Australia, and the Feminist Majority Foundation sponsored \"Rock for Choice\" benefits with L7/Joan Jett.  According to press releases, the film explores themes such as the musicians' relationship to creativity and music, the negotiation of gender identity and gender performance (feminist term coined by Judith Butler) through rock, subversion of stereotypes and gendered expectations through stage play performances and stylization of the body, and the processes of healing and reclaiming through musical expressions. The sequel Not Bad for a Girl book contains images, anecdotes, reviews, interviews from many more bands unable to fit into the original including Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Strangefruit, 7 Year Bitch, Tribe 8, Dickless, Girl in a Coma and rock musicians in France, Japan, Brazil, Italy and the Middle East.

Gaurav Malani of IndiaTimes rated the movie 3/5 and said, \"If you hate love stories this one's certainly not for you.

The fresh pairing and the on-screen electrifying chemistry, the lilting musical score and the magical moments in the film should attract its target audience.\" Parimal M. Rohit of Buzzine Bollywood added, \"I Hate Luv Storys features no shortage of cheesy dialogue, simplistically thematic humor, and unrealistic depictions of lifestyles\" but still has \"some redeeming values (such as) the chemistry between Sonam Kapoor and Imran Khan ... strong individual performances, genuine corniness, and memorable avatars....\" Subhash K. Jha was not impressed, calling it \"a disappointment.\" The Hindu in its review said \" After trying to be versatile, Imran has returned to familiar romantic terrain. His Jay is only a couple of streets away from the Jai he played in Jaane Tu\u2026 Ya Jaane Na. He has mastered four-five expressions which establish his uber-cool credentials quite well...Sonam's face lights up the proceedings every time the mind says, \u201cEnough!\u201d If there is something called intelligent innocence, she has it, but it is waiting to be explored.\""

The film devotes attention to the role of The Goldbergs in helping to present a congenial image of a striving Jewish family to the broader American public, and the tremendous popularity that the radio and television shows experienced. Stamberg deems Berg, \"the Oprah of her day.\" Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg addresses developments contemporaneous with the years of The Goldbergs, Kristallnacht, the American Nazi German-American Bund and right-wing radio lecturer Father Coughlin. It also deals with Berg's struggle against the McCarthy Era blacklisters and the influence of Red Channels.

        "content": "Beavis and Butt-Head open the film by explaining 3D technology; in a matter typical for the characters, they start arguing and quickly get into a slap-fight, with several of the moves especially animated to come out of the screen in a 3D setting. The opening sequence features the members lining up, standing in each color of the rainbow while an opera version of the Jackass theme song \"Corona\" plays. Then each member does small stunts by various objects in slow-motion. The opening sequence, as well as many of the stunts, were filmed with Phantom high speed cameras which shoot at 1,000 frames per second. The most notable stunts and pranks include; Johnny Knoxville being camouflage-painted as a bull charges at him, Bam Margera falling into a pit filled with snakes, Ryan Dunn playing the tuba while a male sheep rams him, Steve-O getting launched into the air in a shit-filled porta-potty, Wee Man fighting other midgets in a bar, Preston Lacy getting an gridiron football kicked against his face, Chris Pontius flying an RC helicopter as it's tied to his penis, Ehren McGhehey getting his crooked tooth pulled by Bam's Lamborghini, and Dave England playing tetherball with a beehive against Steve-O. The closing skit is done in a similar fashion as the introduction, as Knoxville announces he's about to \"end the movie\", then triggers an old-fashioned dynamite plunger; after the rest of the crew is disappointed by the initial explosion being a mere puff of air out of a nearby pi\u00f1ata, everything in the room is destroyed in a series of large explosions as the blown-up objects are thrown at the cast (like the opening, all shown in slow-motion) to the tune of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. After the explosions are finished, the cast members are flushed away by a wave pool. As in the past two Jackass films, comedian Rip Taylor makes an appearance before the credits roll, celebrating the end of the film in overly dramatic fashion. As the ending credits play, a retrospective is shown with clips from the original show along with old photographs of cast and crew set to Weezer's \"Memories\", the film's single. Knoxville's daughter, Madison, is also seen in the ending credits, joining in on the prank fun."

        "content": "In December 2009, director Jeff Tremaine began doing camera tests with the 3D equipment. In that same month, Johnny Knoxville announced the return of the entire cast of the previous two movies. According to Deadline Hollywood, a stunt called \"The Heli-cockter\" was filmed and shown to Paramount executives in its 3D format to greenlight the project. Chris Pontius tethered a remote control-operated helicopter to his penis, and grinned while he swung it around. Filming of the stunts began on January 25, 2010, Tremaine filmed the crew on private property unlike the traditional Jackass fashion of filming in the streets (although in the film, several skits/pranks were shot in public), and it includes \"occasional forays to foreign countries.\" Bam Margera told the Artisan News Service that the movie was 70% done and half the crew had been to the hospital with Margera having \"three broken ribs and a broken shoulder and a twisted ankle as we speak.\" During filming, recurring guest cast member Loomis Fall suffered a compound fracture of his clavicle after an improper landing during a stunt involving an umbrella and a jet engine. On the subject of the stunts, director Jeff Tremaine said he was aiming to revamp most of the old stunts from the original show into the movie (example: the \"Poo Cocktail Supreme\" is based on a stunt originally done by Knoxville on the television show). The stunt, \"The Lamborghini Tooth Pull\" was originally shot for Jackass Number Two with Margera's uncle, Vincent Margera (also known as Don Vito) but after Margera's arrest back in 2006, the stunt was pulled from the final cut of the movie and was not shown in Jackass 2.5, so it was re-shot with Ehren McGhehey for this film, and the elder Margera was declared persona non grata among the cast and crew for a time. In April 2010, JackassWorld.com was closed, leaving a posting that said \"gone filmin',\" and \"Thanks for the support the past two years. To keep abreast and adick of all things related to the world of jackass and Dickhouse (including the currently in production flick jackass 3D), follow us on Facebook and Twitter.\" In an interview with Rick Kosick, he revealed that JackassWorld.com will no longer be a web site after the movie releases. Despite this, it was relaunched as the main website for Dickhouse Productions. Cameraman Lance Bangs explains the transition from television to cinema screen: \"It's utterly crazy. Everything in 3-D looks as brightly colored as candy. I'm a cameraman on it, and it's amazing to watch the footage being turned 3-D, like watching everything through a viewfinder.\" He later went on to say, \"I thought I was above peer pressure, but there's such camaraderie. I took part in a few stunts and ended up humiliated and hurt \u2014 me, the poetic film-maker friend of Spike Jonze.\" In late May 2010, Knoxville stated that Steve-O's sobriety was at its best and, \"[t]here is no beer on set this time around even if some of us wish there was.\" He also said, \"And to be honest it's going great. Everyone has had different injuries throughout which is a good sign and Steve-O is probably getting the best footage out of everybody. He is really going for it. He wants to prove to everyone he can do these stunts sober. It's been two years since he had a drink now. Everyone has been real supportive of him.\" At the 2010 MTV Movie Awards, Tremaine said filming was nearly finished but they had not shot internationally yet but intended to shoot \"a couple of bits\". An injury to cast member Bam Margera forced a rewrite for the beginning of the movie. On June 12, 2010, Margera was beaten on the head with a bat by a 59-year-old African-American woman outside of his bar, The Note. The woman alleged Bam called her a \"nigger\" and that she was offended, but did not hit him. When Margera was approached by TMZ two days after the incident, he told them he \"never used the n-word\" and that \"[the lady] attacked me times before\". He explained: I was internally bleeding in the brain for two days and they wouldn't let me leave the hospital. I was like, 'I need to go to Los Angeles in six hours to go finish Jackass.' We start tomorrow and I'm supposed to get hit in the head and now I can't because of her. Margera added in the same interview that the opening sequence is being shot with Phantom high speed cameras, which record at 1,000 frames per second to produce hyper-slow motion, similar to the opening sequence of Zombieland. Appropriately, make-up effects designer Tony Gardner, creator of the zombie hordes for Zombieland, was a designer for all of the Jackass films."

In the United States, the film had a record opening day for a fall release movie ($22 million), and posted a record October midnight opening ($2.5 million).

Based on early outperforming predictions it would earn $30 million. It marked the highest-grossing opening weekend of the franchise, ahead of Jackass: The Movie ($22.8 million) and Jackass Number Two ($29 million). 3D accounted for a whopping 90% of its opening weekend gross; however, it still improved on the attendance of its predecessors. It then earned $65.6 million in its first week, which marked the largest Fall opening week of all time. It closed in theaters on January 20, 2011, with $117.2 million.

The website's critical consensus reads: \"The Jackass gang might be running out of gross-out stunts, but this installment contains plenty of brilliantly brain-dead comedy \u2013 and the 3-D adds a pungent new dimension.\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B grade. He notes that the audience wants to see Knoxville and the boys top themselves, and ultimately they achieve that. Gleiberman described the 3D as \"the usual big nothing\" and fails entirely to make the film any more disgusting. Washington Post critic Dan Kois described the film as \"a touching ode to male friendship at its most primal\" and describes the atmosphere as one of \"infectious bonhomie\". He sarcastically asks viewers if they are \"highbrow\" enough for Jackass 3D. He notes the apprehension of the performers before the stunts is nearly as exciting as the stunts themselves. Kois shows his appreciation not just for the stunts but also the way in which they are repeated in slow motion. He gives the film 3/4 stars. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune criticizes the film describing it as \"reductive, insanely violent slapstick\" but he accepts that is the idea. Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel complains that the performers \"aren't getting better, they're getting older\" and the stunts that were cute ten years ago now seem forced and a little desperate."

The album was produced by Greg Kurstin, and features The Strokes' guitarist Nick Valensi. At the J Awards of 2010, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year. The album's first single, \"You've Changed\" was released in December 2009 and the lead single, \"Clap Your Hands\", in April 2010.  We Are Born debuted at number 2 on the Australian Albums Chart and was Sia's first top 10 release in her home country.

When the ship comes to port, Tom (Emory Johnson), a young man, joins the crew as a lookout. He is distraught as well, having been jilted by his fianc\u00e9e. Back on the seas, the ship's inexperienced crew mistakes the water supply as a leak and pumps it overboard. The captain rations the remaining water, and stores it in his quarters. The crew mutinies. From the crow's nest, Tom spots a nearby island and comes down to tell the captain while the crew is asleep. The captain makes Tom the first mate, and they steer the ship to the nearby island. The island is inhabited by two survivors of an earlier shipwreck, one of whom is a beautiful young Blossom (Bessie Love). The survivors are brought back to the ship, where the captain resists letting them, board. The survivors promise to work on the ship, and he reluctantly agrees to let them travel. Blossom learns that the captain's family name is Nelson, and says that her mother had the same name. The captain realizes that Blossom is the daughter of his wife, but assumes Blossom's father is another man. Blossom tells him that she never knew her father. During a storm at sea, the captain finds Blossom's Bible, which contains a note from her mother saying that she loved him all along. The captain realizes that Blossom is his daughter, and they are reconciled. Blossom and Tom fall in love."

        "content": "Bridge over Troubled Water is the fifth and final studio album by American folk rock duo Simon & Garfunkel, released in January 1970 on Columbia Records. Following the duo's soundtrack for The Graduate, Art Garfunkel took an acting role in the film Catch-22, while Paul Simon worked on the songs, writing all tracks except Felice and Boudleaux Bryant's \"Bye Bye Love\" (previously a hit for the Everly Brothers). With the help of producer Roy Halee, the album followed a similar musical pattern as their Bookends LP, partly abandoning their traditional style to incorporate elements of rock, R&B, gospel, jazz, world music, pop and other genres. It was described as their \"most effortless record and their most ambitious\". Bridge over Troubled Water was released on January 26, 1970, and several re-releases followed. The album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. Columbia Records released a 40th Anniversary Edition on March 8, 2011, which includes two DVDs, including the politically themed TV special Songs of America (1969), the documentary The Harmony Game, additional liner notes and a booklet. Other reissues contain bonus tracks, such as the 2001 version, which covers the demo tapes of \"Feuilles-O\" and \"Bridge over Troubled Water\". Contemporary critical reception to Bridge was initially mixed, but retrospective reviews of the album have been laudatory, and it is considered by many to be the duo's best album. Despite numerous accolades, the duo decided to split up, and parted company later in 1970; Garfunkel continued his film career, while Simon worked intensely with music. Both artists released solo albums in the following years. Bridge includes two of the duo's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful songs, \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" and \"The Boxer\", which were listed on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Critically and commercially successful, the album topped the charts in over ten countries and received two Grammy Awards, plus four more for the title song. The album sold around 25 million records; making it at the time of release the best-selling album of all time. It has been ranked on several lists, including at number 172 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time."

Their Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme, the soundtrack album for Mike Nichols' film The Graduate and Bookends peaked at number three, two and one in the US Billboard 200, respectively, with the first and latter selling 3 million copies and 2 million copies in the United States alone. Art Garfunkel took the role of Captain Nately in another Nichols film, Catch-22, based on the novel of the same name. Initially Paul Simon was to play the character of Dunbar, but screenwriter Buck Henry felt the film was already crowded with characters and subsequently wrote Simon's part out. The unexpectedly long film production endangered the relationship between the duo; Garfunkel later stated in a 1990 interview with Paul Zollo in SongTalk magazine: \"Our way of working was for Paul to write while we recorded. So we'd be in the studio for the better part of two months working on the three or four songs that Paul had written, recording them, and when they were done, we'd knock off for a couple of months while Paul was working on the next group of three or four songs. Then we'd book time and be in the studio again for three or four months, recording those\u00a0. . . . Rather than wait for Paul to write the next bunch of songs, I went off and did this movie.\""

Simon had not completed any new songs at this point, and the duo planned to collaborate when the filming was finished. Roy Halee would produce the album, and as was the case with their most recent studio album, Bookends, they created an experimental sound, moving away from typical folk rock and instead exploring new genres. Bridge over Troubled Water was also the duo's first album to credit the backing musicians in the liner notes. The credited musicians were Simon and Fred Carter, Jr. on guitars, and Hal Blaine on drums, Joe Osborn on bass and Larry Knechtel on keyboards, all of whom were famous Wrecking Crew members."

        "content": "As Simon and Garfunkel were working busily on recording, they had to decline invitations to perform, including at the Woodstock Festival. Simon wrote \"Bridge over Troubled Water\". He wanted a gospel piano sound, so he hired session musician Larry Knechtel. The song was initially two verses long, but Garfunkel felt the song was too short and asked Knechtel to play a third verse, to which Simon would write more lyrics. Osborn played two bass guitar parts, one high and the other low. Blaine recorded the drums in an echo chamber, to achieve a hall effect. A horn section rounded off the track. Due to a series of factors, the duo had to work on a new tape; an arranger falsely labeled the song as \"Like a Pitcher of Water\" and wrote Garfunkel's name incorrectly (GarFunkel), and the string part was unsatisfactory. The duo then returned to New York to record the vocals. The vocal style in \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" was inspired by Phil Spector's technique in \"Old Man River\" by the Righteous Brothers. After two months the song was finalized. Simon himself admitted that it sounded like the Beatles' \"Let It Be\", stating in a Rolling Stone interview: \"They are very similar songs, certainly in instrumentation\u00a0...\" The song has been covered by over 50 artists since then, including Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" was influenced by the gospel music to which Simon was listening at that time, especially the Swan Silvertones and their song \"Mary Don't You Weep\". The name of the title track was inspired by the latter's line \"I'll be your bridge over deep water, if you trust in my name\". According to gospel producer and historian Anthony Heilbut, Simon later acknowledged his musical debt to Claude Jeter in person, and additionally handed Jeter a check as compensation. \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" was addressed to Simon's wife Peggy, whom he had met that year. The \"silver girl\" in the song refers to her, and her first gray hairs, and not to a drugged hypodermic needle, as was believed by some in the United States. Simon asked Garfunkel to sing lead on the song, and although Garfunkel initially refused this proposal and suggested that Simon should sing falsetto, later agreed to sing. Simon initially composed the song in G major, but arranger and composer Jimmie Haskell transposed the song to E-flat major to suit Garfunkel's voice. \"El C\u00f3ndor Pasa (If I Could)\" is a Peruvian song based on traditional Andean music.  Simon relied on erroneous information from Jorge Milchberg of Los Incas about the collection of royalties for his arrangement of song.  Simon wrongfully thought it to be a traditional song and thus not restricted by copyright law, but in reality it was written by Peruvian Daniel Alom\u00eda Robles.  His son Armando Robles Godoy filed a successful lawsuit later that year in 1970, citing that he held the song's copyright in the United States since his father's 1933 filing. Simon wrote English lyrics to the instrumental recording by Los Incas, and the song later became a forerunner of Simon's world music era as a solo artist. In the summer of 1969, Simon, his wife Peggy and Garfunkel rented a house on Blue Jay Way in Los Angeles, as Garfunkel did not want to withdraw from Catch-22, which was being filmed on the West Coast. In this session, the duo experimented on a new song with numerous objects to create unusual sounds, such as a falling bundle of drum sticks. Garfunkel had a Sony reel-to-reel tape deck with a reverberation effect, so that each sound received an echo. When finished, Simon gave the tape to Halee, who then worked on the song, condensing sounds and copying them. The song features Simon as percussionist on the xylophone, an instrument he had never played before, and as acoustic guitarist. He began with a random line, \"You're breaking my heart. I'm down on my knees,\" and when finished it was what later became \"Cecilia\". The drummer was again Blaine, and Simon's brother Eddie played on guitar. The song is about an unfaithful girl who invites another lover to her bed, while the singer (the first) is in the bathroom. David Browne suggested that the name may be derived from the patron of music, Saint Cecilia. It has an unusually fast tempo compared to their prior songs. Featuring the rockabilly style of the Everly Brothers, \"Keep the Customer Satisfied\" recounts the exhausting tours that Simon grew tired of, a similar theme to that of their earlier song \"Homeward Bound\". \"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\" is a tribute to the architect Frank Lloyd Wright but also to Garfunkel, who wanted to train as an architect. It chronicles the early career of the duo and predicts their future split up. At the end Halee shouts \"So long already, Artie\", a portentous message. Simon plays here a guitar style that has been described as Latin jazz and bossa nova. Congas additionally contribute to the South American sound."

The session lasted over 100\u00a0hours and took place at several locations. The second, main part was recorded in Nashville, at Columbia Studios, December 6\u20138, 1968. The third, final part and the horns were recorded inside St. Paul's Chapel at Columbia University (Garfunkel's alma mater), and the strings at Columbia Studios. The song features Simon and Fred Carter, Jr. playing Martin guitars. The echoing drums were played by Blaine in a corridor. Other instruments include Bob Moore playing contra bass, tuba, Charlie McCoy playing harmonica, Pete Drake playing pedal steel guitar, Dobro and a piccolo flute. Simon & Garfunkel became the first musicians to use 16-track recording, but as only two 8-track recorders were available, both had to be carefully manually synchronized to produce a clear sound. \"Baby Driver\", an uptempo and happy rock and roll song, already released as a B-side of \"The Boxer\", tells about a boy who lives a comfortable life in a protected home, but who searches for adventures and one day decides to have his first sexual experience. The recording features car noises, Beach Boys\u2013like singing parts and absurd syllables. Edgar Wright's 2017 action comedy film Baby Driver is named after the song, which is played at the end credits. Simon wrote \"The Only Living Boy in New York\" while Garfunkel was filming in Mexico; it is about the resulting isolation he felt in New York. In an interview with SongTalk, Simon guessed that 12 to 15 voices were used to record the \"aaah\"s, while Garfunkel said that he proposed those lines, stating \"It's us around eight times screaming, and we mixed it down very softly\u00a0... I started getting into open-mouth harmony, in a very loud, strident way. We were screaming at the top of our lungs and inside an echo chamber. I remember that day that Dylan dropped by to visit. We came out of the booth after all this screaming, and there he was.\" \"Why Don't You Write Me\", deals with separation from Simon's wife in a jungle. In this song Simon experimented with the nascent genre of reggae for the first time, a style he later explored in his solo career, most notably in \"Mother and Child Reunion\". Following the end of filming of Catch-22 in October, the first performance of their tour took place in Ames, Iowa. The concert included the Everly Brothers' \"Bye Bye Love\", backed by the audience's hand clapping. Simon & Garfunkel were fascinated with its sound, so they repeated it a second time for a recording; while the first try failed, they liked the second attempt and included the latter on Bridge over Troubled Water. The US leg of the tour ended in the sold-out Carnegie Hall on November 27. Three days later, their show Songs of America was broadcast on CBS just one time on November 30, 1969, after which it was banned. After numerous fan letters suggesting that they not intervene in politics but simply continue doing music, the duo did not release any similar TV specials. \"Bye Bye Love\" became a farewell song and a sign of a new career. The album's final song, \"Song for the Asking,\" represents an \"olive branch\" extended by the duo to each other and holding open the possibility of reconciliation and further collaboration. The song starts with the applauses of the previous song cross-fading into it."

Bridge over Troubled Water charted in over 11 countries, topping the charts in 10 countries, including the US Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart. It was the best-selling album in 1970, 1971 and 1972 and was at that time the best-selling album of all time. It remained CBS Records' best-selling album until the release of Michael Jackson's Thriller in 1982. The album topped the Billboard 200 charts for 10 weeks and stayed on the charts for 85 weeks. According to Columbia Records, 1.7 million copies were sold in the first three weeks in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the album topped the charts for 35 weeks, and spent 285 weeks in the top 100, from 1970 to 1975. Furthermore, it received 8\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and 4\u00d7 Platinum in Canada. Bridge over Troubled Water has since sold 3,163,789 copies in the UK, and over 25 million copies worldwide. The songs \"Cuba Si, Nixon No\", \"Groundhog\", and the demo \"Feuilles-O\" were recorded during sessions but not released on the album. \"Cuba Si, Nixon No\" was later released on a bootleg recording of a concert of November 11, 1969 by Simon and Garfunkel at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, while the demo recording of \"Feuilles-O\" was later released on the Old Friends and The Columbia Studio Recordings (1964\u20131970) box sets. A remastered and expanded version of the album was released on compact disc in 2001, containing the demo versions of \"Feuilles-O\" and \"Bridge over Troubled Water.\" It was remastered by Vic Anesini. Garfunkel later recorded \"Feuilles-Oh/Do Space Men Pass Dead Souls on Their Way to the Moon?\" on his debut solo album Angel Clare, and as the flip-side to his single, \"I Shall Sing\", from the same album. Columbia Records released a 40th Anniversary Edition on March 8, 2011, comprising three discs. The first disc features the original album and the second disc contains the entirety of Live 1969, which had been released three years earlier as an exclusive at Starbucks. The third disc, a DVD, consisted of the television special Songs of America, which originally aired in 1969 on CBS and unavailable since its original broadcast, and a new documentary The Harmony Game about the making of the album. Songs of America comprised footage of the 1969 tour, intimate backstage conversations, and historic news clips; it had elicited controversy owing to the duo's political comments regarding the Vietnam War and the direction of American society at the time. The Harmony Game featured new 2010 interviews with Simon, Garfunkel, producer Roy Halee, and more principals involved with the making of the album. The 1969 special runs for approximately 52 minutes 37 seconds, while the 2010 documentary runs for approximately 70 minutes 54 seconds. A booklet of liner notes, photos, and essays by critics Michael Hill and Anthony DeCurtis was also included. The album is also included in its entirety as part of the Simon & Garfunkel box sets Collected Works, The Columbia Studio Recordings (1964\u20131970) and \u2018\u2019Simon & Garfunkel: The Complete Albums Collection\u2019\u2019."

        "title": "Bridge over Troubled Water_Reception and legacy",
        "content": "Bridge over Troubled Water was originally released to a mixed critical response. Writing in Melody Maker in February 1970, Richard Williams identified \"a few dull moments\" on the album, while adding that \"they're worth enduring for the jewels they surround\". Williams concluded: \"Not, perhaps, another classic like Bookends, but still worth hearing for Simon's constantly surprising timing, and for the way he can make his guitar sound like a small orchestra and the orchestra sound like a big guitar\u00a0...\" Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was lukewarm about the album in 1970, giving it a \"B\" grade in his \"Consumer Guide\" column and notoriously reviewing it with one word: \"Melodic\". He later expounded on the problematic nature of the record's \"smooth, well made\" music, writing in Newsday that the album is \"often funny and honest. It breathes life. Yet I suspect that its flawless, rather languid loveliness is ultimately soporific\". According to Steve Horowitz of PopMatters, contemporary critics compared the album to the Beatles' White Album \"in that one can hear the incipient break up of the band in the way they separately perform the material\". Among retrospective reviews, Bruce Eder of AllMusic said that Bridge over Troubled Water was \"perhaps the most delicately textured album to close out the 1960s from any major rock act\", especially in a time of troubles in the United States. Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone assessed the album as \"a casually ambitious look back\" at both the decade and the duo's musical partnership, which concluded the latter \"on an exhilarating note\". Author and critic David Browne noted the album's \"sonic warmth and richness\". Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork praised its unique sound, writing that \"Bridge sounds like a unified statement enlivened by styles and rhythms not often heard on pop radio at the juncture of [the 1960s and 1970s].\" In a 2001 review for Uncut, Ian MacDonald found the album \"overproduced and underwritten\", adding: \"Where Bookends is succinct, dry, and disciplined, Bridge\u00a0... is self-satisfied, sentimental, mediocre, and overblown. Even its best song, 'The Boxer', is needlessly inflated and protracted.\" Writing for MusicHound, Leland Rucker acknowledged that Bridge over Troubled Water \"is considered their masterpiece\", while noting that he found that \"it sounds top-heavy, overproduced, and too precious for its own good.\" Conversely, Q magazine deemed the album to be Simon & Garfunkel's best and most consistent work, \"notable for the strength of its melodies, the force of its lyrics and the Abbey Road-style sophistication of its production\". In his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin admires the album as a \"celebrated\" work that includes a \"classic single\" (\"The Boxer\") and a title song that \"became a standard with Garfunkel's angelic vocal set perfectly matched to the lush, orchestral arrangement and contrasting tempo\". Joe Nolan of American Songwriter notes that \"the pair were never more popular or commercially successful than they were with the release of Bridge over Troubled Water\". Bridge over Troubled Water won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, as well as for Best Engineered Recording, while its title track won the Grammys for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Contemporary Song of the Year and Instrumental Arrangement of the Year in 1971. Bridge over Troubled Water was nominated at the first Brit Awards for Best International Album and its title track for Best International Single in 1977. In 2000 it was voted number 66 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, it was ranked at  on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list; in a 2020 revision, the album was ranked at No. 172. In December 1993, The Times ranked the album at number 20 on its \"The Vultures 100 Best Albums of all Time\".  The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Chris Charlesworth, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Paul Simon and Simon & Garfunkel, gave a mixed reception, noting that seven songs (\"Bridge over Troubled Water\", \"El Condor Pasa\", \"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\", \"The Boxer\", \"The Only Living Boy in New York\", \"Bye Bye Love\" and \"Song for the Asking\") were outstanding or good, while the rest, mainly uptempo ones, were for him \"throwaway\" recordings. He was surprised at its success."

Garfunkel took a role in another Mike Nichols film, Carnal Knowledge, in the role of Sandy, for which he later earned a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor nomination. Filming started in May 1970. Meanwhile, Simon taught a one-week songwriting course at New York University, studied music theory and listened to numerous types of music. The duo's last performance at that time was in the Forest Hills Stadium on July 18, 1970. Simon worked on his second studio (and first post-Simon & Garfunkel) solo album between January and March 1971, which was later released as Paul Simon, while Garfunkel revived his music career with Angel Clare, released in September 1973."

In a mixed review, Han Dong-yun from webzine IZM said that the album triggers feelings of excitement, fun, and adrenaline; however he noted the rather excessive autotune and felt that it created a distraction. Han additionally commented that while the album is \"full of energy\", it is \"difficult to find elements that stimulate the emotions\". In February 2011, To Anyone was selected as the Best Dance & Electronic Album at the 8th Korean Music Awards for excellence in the genre; selection committee member Kim Yun-ha said that 2NE1 stands out with their \"unique charms\", despite the \"music created by several young composers under Teddy's direction not being perfect\", and called the album proof of the group's \"overflowing vitality\". Since its initial release, the album has been regarded as the work that introduced the group to a larger audience outside the K-pop realm."

Johnson and executive produced by Spike Lee via his production company 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks. The plot depicts a team of African Americans who kidnap fellow black people who they feel have betrayed their community and seek to \"deprogram\" them so that they will change their ways. The acronym DROP stands for \"Deprogramming and Restoration of Pride\". The film has been described as \"[p]art thriller, part social satire\". The film was based in part on The Session, a 45-minute film Johnson produced in 1988 on a $20,000 budget, and ultimately derived from a short story by David C. Taylor titled \"The Deprogrammer\". Johnson described the differences between the two films as follows: \"The short film was basically satire, an absurdist piece .... D.R.O.P. Squad, on the other hand, is realism. The characters have more at stake.\""

Bruford's sister Lenora (Nicole Powell) calls in the Drop Squad to deprogram him. Bruford winds up being subjected to three weeks of psychological and physical brutality. Among the other persons who are shown being subjected to the deprogramming are a corrupt politician and a drug dealer.

The song's production and Derulo's vocal performance garnered positive reviews from music critics, however, some criticized its lack of originality. \"Fight for You\" attained moderate chart success, peaking at number five in Australia, and reaching the top twenty in the United Kingdom.

According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing \"that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready to let go of just yet\". The song contains a sample of the song \"Africa\" (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that \"Fight for You\" features \"airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats\". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of \"Fight for You\", saying: \"It's very relationship-based and the line [\"fight for you\"] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I put myself in that place again where you would do anything to keep the relationship together so I went back to that place.\""

        "content": "\"Fight for You\" garnered positive reviews from music critics for its catchy production and Derulo's vocal performance. David Griffiths of 4Music called it a \"catchy little ditty\" that \"is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for the rest of the day\". Shawn Kitchener of Entertainment Wise described the song as \"the kind of sweet-as-candy R&B fodder\" that could have been featured on the High School Musical soundtrack. Meena Rupani of DesiHits noted that the song's lyrical theme is similar to \"It Girl\", and that Derulo's \"vocals are enough to put any girl into a trance\". However, \"Fight for You\" also received unfavorable reviews from critics because of its lack of originality. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song a three out of five star rating, calling Derulo \"extremely lazy\" for sampling \"Africa\". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described the song as \"languid\", while writing that the sample gives it \"a bit of bounce\". Although Jess Holton of The Music Network described \"Fight for You\" as a \"touching ballad\", she added that sampling \"Africa\" does not do the latter \"any form of justice\". In an album review of Future History, Michael Cragg of BBC Music noted that the songs \"revolve around the joys of being in a relationship or the pain of not being in one\", however disapproved of the lyrical content and sample in \"Fight for You\", calling it \"perhaps the worst offender\" on the album."

His business includes marijuana and hooch. His sons Koshy, who is the second-in-commands in his business and illegal activities, is equally ruthless and violent. His second son Sunny is an alcoholic, but a normal guy struggling to get out of his father's stranglehold; he rebels once a while, but incompetent and lazy to go his own way. Mathukutty's only daughter, Annie, is a nymphomaniac, who has no feelings for her husband Andrews or daughter. Her husband is fed up of her wayward lifestyle. Annie comes to live with her maternal family every month, in the pretence of some fight with her husband, so that she can sleep with Mathukutty's henchman and rubber employee, Unnunni. Mathukutty and Koshy are not aware of Annie's wayward lifestyle, and think their son-in-law is unduly suspicious by nature. They mince no words while chastising Annie's husband for being the guilty party in the marriage; Koshy even roughs him up, when Andrews refuses to come for a reconciliation meeting. Mathukkutty's youngest son, Baby, is an engineering student. At college, he fantasises about murder and gushing blood. He shows early signs of antisocial behaviors which manifests itself when ragging a junior (freshman). He strangles a junior student with an electric wire. Baby is suspended from the college and returns home. The junior student is admitted to hospital in a serious condition. His family gets to know of the incident through a newspaper article and dismiss it as a ragging incident gone bad. Baby always keeps the electric wire in his bag as a memento of the incident. Baby is a marijuana addict and he shows no alarming outward symptoms of his mental illness. His uncle Bishop senses something wrong with his nephew and cannot get through him. Baby observes Annie's affair with Unnunni and decides to murder him. He manages to strangle Ununni to death at the tools shed where Unnunni and Annie meets up. Baby hangs the body to stage a suicide. On discovering the body, the family dispose the body to avoid any Police investigation on the unnatural death. Baby has violent dreams, constantly plays with his father's rifle, and imagines murdering Annie, multiple times, using his electric wire and the gun. He likes Nirmala, a village girl from a poor family. Nirmala, a young teenager, keeps him interested, and even makes love to him under the shade of coffee shrubs in broad daylight. She loves Baby but is well aware of the caste and class divide between them. Nirmala gets engaged to a local shop-owner, Balan. She ends the relationship with Baby. Baby murders Balan by strangling him with his preferred weapon, the electric wire. The murder goes unsolved as Baby removes money from the shop making it look like a robbery gone bad. Nirmala believes that Baby is behind Balan's death, and confronts him when they meet at the river. Baby tries to kill her as well, but Nirmala escapes without knowing his intention. Nirmala's mother fixes her wedding to Raghavan, a rubber tapper and Baby's friend. Baby tries to strangle Raghavan too, but fails in his attempt. Raghavan sees Baby's face when the mask he was wearing comes out and reports it to the police. The cops start searching for Baby, who goes into hiding. While his family tries to find him, he suddenly appears with a revolver. He shoots at Koshy who confronts him and shoots at his father too when he shouts at him to stop. Mathukutty escapes the shot, but Koshy is hit though not fatally. While the scuffle is going on, Baby is shot dead by Mathukkutty, using his rifle. His family in pursuit of making money did not realise the animal and danger he is becoming through avoidance to the society and to them."

        "content": "After burying Dobby, Harry Potter asks the goblin Griphook to help him, along with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, break into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts bank, suspecting a Horcrux is there. Griphook agrees, in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy; he senses Draco's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry, who captured it from Draco. A horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff's cup, is found in Bellatrix's vault, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons them. Trapped by security, they release the dragon guardian and flee Gringotts on its back. Harry has a vision of Lord Voldemort at Gringotts, furious at the theft. Harry also realises a Horcrux connected to Rowena Ravenclaw is hidden at Hogwarts. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade and are helped by Aberforth Dumbledore, who reveals a secret passageway into Hogwarts, which Neville Longbottom guides them through. Severus Snape knows Harry has returned and threatens to punish any staff or students who aid Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees during a duel with Professor McGonagall. McGonagall rouses the Hogwarts community for battle. Luna Lovegood urges Harry to speak to Helena Ravenclaw's ghost. She reveals Voldemort performed \"dark magic\" on her mother's diadem that is somewhere in the Room of Requirement. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron and Hermione destroy the Horcrux cup with a Basilisk fang. Draco, Blaise Zabini and Gregory Goyle attack Harry in the Room of Requirement, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts an uncontrollable Fiendfyre curse that kills him while Harry, Ron, and Hermione save Malfoy and Zabini and escape on brooms. Outside of the room, Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake Nagini is the final Horcrux. In the boathouse, the trio overhear Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; Nagini then viciously attacks Snape. As Snape dies, he gives Harry one of his memories. Meanwhile, Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks are killed in the chaos at Hogwarts. Harry views Snape's memory in the Pensieve: Snape despised Harry's late father James, who bullied him, but he loved his mother Lily. Following her death, Snape worked with Albus Dumbledore as a double agent amongst the Death Eaters, to protect Harry from Voldemort. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and planned for Snape to kill him. It was Snape who conjured the Patronus doe that led Harry to Gryffindor's sword. Harry also learns that he became an accidental Horcrux when Voldemort's curse originally failed to kill him; Voldemort must now kill Harry to destroy the soul shard within him. Using the Resurrection Stone that had been stored in the Golden Snitch bequeathed to him, Harry summons the spirits of his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus. They comfort him before he surrenders to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who awakens in limbo. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that Harry is now free of Voldemort, and can choose to return to his body or move on. Harry returns to his body. Voldemort displays Harry's apparent corpse and demands that Hogwarts surrender. As Neville draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat in defiance, Harry reveals he is alive and the Malfoys and many other Death Eaters abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, destroying the last of the horcruxes. Harry finally defeats Voldemort after the Expelliarmus charm deflects the Killing Curse, rebounding it onto the Dark Lord. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that Voldemort never commanded the Elder Wand. It recognised him as its true master after he had disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore, atop the Astronomy Tower. Instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry destroys it. Nineteen years later, Harry married to Ginny, and Ron married to Hermione, proudly watch their children leave for Hogwarts at King's Cross station."

For example, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds assumed the role of Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore's brother and bartender of the Hog's Head inn. In the book, a significant number of characters who have not appeared since some of the earlier novels, reappear to defend Hogwarts in the large, final battle. Director David Yates said, \"I want to get them all back\", referring to his desire to bring back as many actors who have appeared in the franchise as possible for the climactic battle sequence in the film. Sean Biggerstaff, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Miriam Margolyes, and Emma Thompson reprise their roles from earlier films briefly during the battle scene. For the final scene in the film which is set nineteen years after the film's main story, the actors playing the main characters were made to look older through the use of makeup and special effects. After the initial look of the actors' aged appearances leaked onto the Internet, some fans reacted by opining that Radcliffe and Grint looked too old, while Watson did not appear significantly different at all. After primary filming concluded in June 2010, Yates examined the footage, and concluded that the problem could not be resolved through editing or CGI, and had the sequence re-shot that December, with redesigned makeup."

Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, \"No, David. How are we going to do it?\".

Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, \"our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was part of the fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble.\" About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, \"We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. John Richardson, the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it.\" Craig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to Art Insights Magazine, saying that \"the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, the entrance of the Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really\u00a0\u2013 maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely.\" When asked about the King's Cross scene near the end of the film, Craig said, \"We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white\u00a0\u2013 so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research.\""

We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative.\" He went on to say: \"It's taken two years\u00a0\u2013 getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas.\" On the quality of 3D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, \"I think it's good, actually. I think people are going to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really impressed with it, actually.\" Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3D conversion, saying that \"The way David Yates is approaching 3D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way.\" In 2012, the visual effects in the film were nominated for an Oscar. The film also won the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects at the 65th BAFTA Awards in 2012."

Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 40 million tickets. It set new records in advance ticket sales with $32\u00a0million, in its midnight opening with $43.5\u00a0million and in its IMAX midnight opening with $2\u00a0million. It grossed $91.1\u00a0million on its opening Friday, setting a Friday-gross record as well as single- and opening-day records. It also set an opening-weekend record with $169.2\u00a0million, an IMAX opening-weekend record of $15.2\u00a0million and opening-weekend record for a 3-D film. Although 3-D enhanced the film's earning potential, only 43% of the opening gross came from 3-D venues. This means only $72.8\u00a0million of the opening-weekend grosses originated from 3-D showings, the second-largest number at the time. It also scored the largest three-day and four-day gross, the sixth-highest-grossing opening week (Friday to Thursday) with $226.2\u00a0million, and even the seventh-largest seven-day gross. It fell precipitously by 84% on its second Friday and by 72% during its second weekend overall, grossing $47.4\u00a0million, which is the largest second-weekend drop for any film that opened to more than $90\u00a0million. Still, it managed to become the fastest-grossing film in the franchise and also achieved the second-largest ten-day gross ever at the time (now eighth). In its third weekend, the movie surpassed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to become the highest-grossing film of the franchise in the US & Canada."

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling, Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a satisfying\u00a0\u2013 and suitably magical\u00a0\u2013 conclusion.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating to reviews, the film has a score of 85 out of 100 based on 41 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". The film received a score of 93 from professional critics at the Broadcast Film Critics Association; it is the organisation's highest-rated Harry Potter film. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Philip Womack in The Daily Telegraph commented, \"This is monumental cinema, awash with gorgeous tones, and carrying an ultimate message that will resonate with every viewer, young or old: there is darkness in all of us, but we can overcome it.\" He further expressed that David Yates \"transmutes [the book] into a genuinely terrifying spectacle.\" Another review was released on the same day from Evening Standard, who rated the film four out of five and stated \"Millions of children, parents, and those who should know better won't need reminding what a Horcrux is\u00a0\u2013 and director David Yates does not let them down. In fact, in some ways, he helps make up for the shortcomings of the final book.\" The Daily Express remarked that the film showcases \"a terrifying showdown that easily equals Lord of the Rings or Star Wars in terms of a dramatic and memorable battle between good and evil\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four and said, \"The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone all those magical years ago.\" Mark Kermode from the BBC said that the film is a \"pretty solid and ambitious adaptation of a very complex book\", but he criticised the post-converted 3D. Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film three and a half out of four and said \"While Deathly Hallows: Part 2 offers long-promised answers, it also dares to pose some eternal questions, and it'll stay with you after the final chapter has closed.\" Richard Roeper, also from the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film an A+ rating and said: \"This is a masterful and worthy final chapter in one of the best franchises ever put to film.\" In one of the few negative reviews, Brian Gibson of Vue Weekly described the film as \"deadly dull\" and a \"visual overstatement\". Other reviews criticised the decision to split the novel into two cinematic parts, with Ben Mortimer of The Daily Telegraph writing \"Deathly Hallows\u00a0\u2013 Part 2 isn't a film. It's HALF a film\u00a0... it's going to feel somewhat emotionless.\" Other critics wrote of the film's runtime; Alonso Duralde from The Wrap said, \"If there's one substantial flaw to the film, it's that this cavalcade of people and places and objects can barely fit in the 130-minute running time.\" Rebecca Gillie from The Oxford Student gave the film two out of five and wrote: \"At the end of [the film] there is nothing that stays with you once you've left the cinema.\""

Highly praised by the critics and the audience, the film succeeds in portraying the tenderness, the genuine integrity and the deep humanity between the controversial writer and his wife. It gathers sequences from Madrid to Helsinki to Rio de Janeiro. It includes sequences life in Lanzarote, and during trips around the world (presenting Jos\u00e9's books, signing autographs, making speeches) as well as their simple, transient and quotidian moments during the period Jos\u00e9 writes his \"The Elephant's Journey\".

The film shows us their daily life in Lanzarote and their trips around the globe, and is a surprising portrayal of an author throughout the creative process of a couple who decide to change the world, or at least to make it a better place. The film shows us an unknown Saramago, unravels any preconceived ideas we may have about the man and demonstrates that genius and simplicity can indeed be compatible. Jos\u00e9 and Pilar is a glimpse into one of the greatest creators of the Twentieth Century and shows us that, as Saramago said, \"everything can be told in a different way.\""

The West Memphis Three were subsequently convicted of murder and remained in prison for more than 18 years. West of Memphis focuses on Terry Hobbs, stepfather of Stevie Branch, one of the victims of the 1993 crime, as a potential suspect due to physical evidence linking him to the crime, a history of violent behavior and his lack of an alibi for the time the murders were committed, as well as damaging statements made by his ex-wife, former neighbors, and most recently his own nephew, who claims Hobbs confessed to him. The film reveals that inexplicably Terry Hobbs was not interviewed by police at the time of the murders. Since the 1996 release of the HBO Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky documentary, Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills, supporters protested the innocence of the West Memphis Three. Much like the Paradise Lost films, West of Memphis chronicles the history of the imprisoned men all the way up to the eventual release through interviews conducted with lawyers, judges, journalists, family members, witnesses, and the West Memphis Three themselves. With the January 2012 HBO premiere of the third Paradise Lost film, Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory, there were two documentary films on the subject within a year. West of Memphis premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2012, at the Deauville American Film Festival on September 2, 2012, and at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2012."

Director Amy Berg, wrote Morgenstern, \"has a dramatist's eye for what was irretrievably lost \u2014 the innocent lives of the children, plus 18 years of three other innocent lives. And she saw, equally well, what was there to be gained: dramatic new insights into an inexorable progression from random arrests through groundless supposition, fevered conjecture and flagrant perjury to official disgrace in a supposedly airtight case.\" Film critic Philip French of The Observer called West of Memphis \"riveting\", and a \"shocking indictment of the American criminal justice system and a tribute to the dedication of selfless civil rights lawyers and their supporters from all over the world\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \"A-\" and wrote that it \"casts a hypnotic spell all its own. It artfully sketches out the events for anyone who's coming in cold, but basically, its strategy is to take what we already know and go deeper. ... West of Memphis goes after another possible suspect, Terry Hobbs, who was stepfather to one of the victims and who has denied any involvement. In doing so, the film reframes the story's terrible darkness, even if it can't give us the closure we hunger for.\" Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a perfect four star rating, writing: \"Do we need a fourth film? Yes, I think we do. If you only see one of them, this is the one to choose, because it has the benefit of hindsight.\""

Schulberg and his company Preferred Pictures.  The film stars Alyce Mills, and represents an early role for actress Clara Bow.  It is the tenth ever film for William Powell (better known for his later work in talking pictures), and the first of only two films where Powell and Bow worked together. The film was for years believed to be a lost film, but a full 16mm nitrate print survives and is preserved at UCLA Film and Television Archive.  Considered a \"Silent Classic\", the film was remastered by the National Film Preservation Foundation.  The film screened in Italy in 2003 at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival."

Unlike his self-titled debut solo album, which featured a variety of singers including Chris Cornell, Ozzy Osbourne, M. Shadows, and Kid Rock, he said his second album would feature Alter Bridge vocalist Myles Kennedy as the sole singer. Kennedy had previously appeared on two songs from Slash's first album, and was later the vocalist of Slash's band on tour. Slash later said that his second album would be more of a collaboration album with Kennedy, and said he was unsure whether it would be released under his own name or a new name entirely. Slash began working on his second solo album in June 2011, and that December, three songs\u2014\"Halo\", \"Standing in the Sun\" and \"Bad Rain\"\u2014had been recorded. Slash described the new material as \"very heavy\". The album was finished in February 2012 and was given a May 22, 2012, release date. The first single, \"You're a Lie\", was released to rock radio on February 27, 2012; a 30-second preview of the song was released online with this announcement. Slash released the track listing for the album on March 5, 2012. Kennedy, who wrote the lyrics, has said that some of the lyrics on the album are about his past negative experiences with drugs. On March 26, 30 second samples from \"Apocalyptic Love\" were made available on Amazon.com. It is an \"internet rumor\" according to Slash that the lead intro riff for \"Anastasia\" takes inspiration from Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, which Slash interpolates live in his version of \"Speak Softly Love\"."

The album received mixed reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 13 reviews. Writing for Artistdirect, Rick Florino gave an enthusiastic review, awarding the album 5 out of 5 stars and stating that it \"embodies every side of Slash\", featuring \"some of the man's most incendiary and infectious playing yet\". He also praises Myles Kennedy's vocals and cites \"Anastastia\" and \"Far and Away\" as standout tracks, praising their orchestral and cinematic elements. Brandon Geist of Revolver also gave a positive review of the album, giving it a 4 out of 5 rating. Geist compares the album to Slash's solo d\u00e9but, which he criticised for sometimes seeming \"strained under the weight of its creator\u2019s own grand ambition\", whereas on Apocalyptic Love, Slash's band \"let the riffs and hooks fly freely\". He concludes that the album is \"a collection of lean, high-octane rock-and-roll tunes\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a more mixed opinion of the album in his review for AllMusic, awarding it 3 out of 5 stars. He observes that performing with Kennedy \"clearly is easier on Slash's soul\" compared to the vocalists in Slash's previous bands, and that the music on the album \"reflects this ease\". He criticises the album for containing \"absolutely no surprises\" but adds that it \"never tries too hard, so it winds up satisfying on its own limited scale.\" Another 3/5 rating came from Johan Wippsson, writing for Melodic.net, who wrote that the album \"is far better\" than Slash's debut, praising the decision to have Kennedy perform on all tracks, though admitting that he \"had expected better songs\"."

In the district, the children imitate the adults' behaviour and kiss in the streets, men work as pickpockets in the city proper, and corrupt businessmen, politicians, and police officers hire the prostitutes. Lily and Ijan plan to marry, but they do not have enough money to do so. When they are discussing it, Lily is interrupted by a customer who takes her to a room to have sex. Meanwhile, Yayuk and her husband are having marital difficulties as he continues to gamble and sleep with other women. The pickpockets steal a purse in town, but one is chased down and beaten to death by the crowd. Mangapul takes Yayak to a nearby warehouse for sex. They decide to marry, and after their tryst take leave of the brothel leader, then drive away for Surabaya. Mbah Genggong leads his men, including Ijan, to rob a jewellery store owned by a Chinese-Indonesian man. The store-owner's wife tells them to take the jewellery, so long as she and her family are not harmed. The bandits agree, then take the goods and escape to their hideout in an old farmhouse. Ijan takes a pair of wedding rings, and sneaks away to give the rings to Lily before coming back. Meanwhile, the police arrest Mangapul; he promises to marry Yayak from inside prison. After arresting Mangapul, the police go to Mbah Genggong's hideout. As the bandits flee, Mbah Genggong\u00a0\u2014 who thinks he has been betrayed\u00a0\u2014 kills Ijan with a blade and then attempts to attack the police, but is killed. As the district's residents come out and watch the police actions, Lily puts on her wedding ring."

Andreas Weiland, reviewing for the Taiwanese film magazine Influence, wrote that the film was comparable to Glauber Rocha's 1969 film O Drag\u00e3o da Maldade Contra o Santo Guerreiro (The Dragon of Evil Against the Warrior Saint) in that they were in a similar style, including the inclusion of bandits and use of music and colour. Umboh, as usual for him, used mainly medium and close-up shots; Noer considered the effect overdone, and wrote that the film could have been improved with longer-range shots. The film is interspersed with songs, both traditional and modern. Mangunharso, in a review in Suara Merdeka, suggested that the character of Mbah Genggong was included to show that people considered useful to their country can fall, and that those who are prostitutes now could have been something else had their lives taken a different turn. He also noted that a strong sense of mystery pervaded the film. Weiland noted a strong sense of social commentary about poverty."

Subsequently, Gaga revealed on Twitter that the song was written in Australia and finished on her tour bus in Europe. Describing the recording's lyrical themes as delving on \"needing to feel safe to find love\", it was theorized by a writer from Take 40 Australia to be inspired by the singer's 2009 live performance on Australia's The Chapel arena. Like the opening track of Born This Way\u2014\"Marry the Night\"\u2014the song made its debut on a special edition of social network game FarmVille, called GagaVille and released on May 18, 2011. \"Electric Chapel\" has been compared to the work of Madonna, with NMEs Dan Martin saying that \"if you'd ever wondered what that Madonna doing the soundtrack to Blade Runner might have sounded like... then wonder no more.\" Genre-wise, Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone referred \"Electric Chapel\" to as an electro rock recording, while Robbie Daw of Idolator dubbed the song as being of the pop metal genre, attesting that unlike fellow song from Born This Way, \"Heavy Metal Lover\", \"Electric Chapel\" possesses an actual metal-edge. Gaga recorded the chorus a number of times, channeling the vocals of bands like Duran Duran, and singers Cher and Billy Idol. Inspired by 1980s music, the track incorporates a spoken word section, which Gaga wanted to sound like The B-52's song \"Rock Lobster\" (1978). She explained to Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone that when she \"say[s] 'electric chapel,' something needs to occur... It needs to be more fantasy. You should see the empress of the Vatican unicorn planet appear and soar across the nightclub.\" Writing for music website Beats Per Minute, Brent Koepp described the song as \"Iron Maiden meets 80s pop\". According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, \"Electric Chapel\" has a time signature of common time, and a pop-rock tempo of 128 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of A minor with Gaga's vocals ranging from E3 to C5. It also has a basic sequence of Am\u2013Dm\u2013Am\u2013Dm\u2013F serving as its chord progression. \"Electric Chapel\" was later remixed by Irish indie rock band Two Door Cinema Club; this version was included on the singer's second remix album titled Born This Way: The Remix (2011). Gaga unveiled the remix during a cover shoot for Elle magazine. A reviewer from BBC Music complimented the remix, saying that \"Two Door Cinema Club almost make 'Electric Chapel' sound like a collaboration between Gaga and Hot Chip\"."

Caryn Ganz of Spin wrote that \"Electric Chapel\" \"pairs divine diva thump with a Van Halen guitar solo.\" NME writer Dan Martin published a review on the song, confessing that \"perhaps ['Electric Chapel'] nails the record's blood-and-chrome aesthetics most effectively of all.\" In another review, Martin compared its opening riffs to Opus III's 1983 song \"It's a Fine Day\", with him further likening the recording to science fiction music. Kerri Mason from Billboard described the track as a \"technicolor wedding\" with a \"fat guitar riff\". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse praised the cut, feeling that \"Gaga takes Born This Way to new levels of pop-dom on cuts like the jagged 'Electric Chapel' and 'Heavy Metal Lover'\". Ann Powers from NPR noticed the influence of Duran Duran in the track, while believing Gaga to imagine \"Electric Chapel\" as an output from \"an electric guitar-wielding girl group\". Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone did reviewed Born This Way track-wise, observing that in \"Electric Chapel\" Gaga wrote about hoping for a monogamous relationship, with heavy guitar riffs and metal solo being characteristics of the record. Awra Haider from Metro called it an \"OTT elegy with electric guitars and lots of sci-fi attitude\". In an article in GQ about 10 detrimental things on Born This Way, a writer from the magazine listed the track's lyrics as \"reek[ing] of a lack of ideas, not a distortion of form. Sing words.

Raphael also has an illegitimate son, Bernard, with his former maid Maria Laurel (Beauty Gonzalez). When Maria and Bernard have nowhere else to go, Raphael takes both of them in. Unaware that they are siblings, Bernard, who is gay, and Detty become close friends, as both share their love for fashion. When Kara discovers Raphael and Maria sleeping with each other, as well as realizing that Raphael is Bernard's father, she confronts them in front of Bernard and Detty, kicks them out and accidentally pushes Maria down the stairs, severely injuring her. With no assistance from the family or the other maids, Bernard swears vengeance against the Sabroso family. Many years later, the adult Detty (Ai-Ai delas Alas) and Bernard (Vice Ganda) have different lives. Following the bankruptcy of her tailor shop, Detty struggles to make ends meet for her children Kathy (Kathryn Bernardo) and Cindy (Xyriel Manabat), whom she is fighting for custody from her ex-husband. Bernard, going by the name \"Bernice\", owns the successful fashion brand Ponytale, which he rules with an iron fist, and lives in a large mansion with the disabled Maria (Gloria Diaz) and Angelo (Daniel Padilla), the son of Bernice's deceased former maid. Detty applies for a job as executive assistant at Ponytale, unaware that Bernice is her estranged sibling. With encouragement from his mother, Bernice sees this as his long-awaited opportunity for revenge by hiring her and giving her absurd and embarrassing tasks. He also advises Angelo to pursue and date Kathy, who is his schoolmate, and then dump her to break her heart. Despite her duties becoming increasingly odd, Detty accepts and accomplishes her tasks with no complaints. Bernice begins to second-guess his intentions, but his mother advises him to continue with his plans. At the Run Away Fashion Show, Bernice confront his rival Roselle Hermosa (Kris Aquino), who owns the equally successful La Yondelle and competes with him for a European partnership deal. When La Yondelle's collection turns out to be stolen from Ponytale's, Detty devises a last-minute plan to revise the fashion line. The revamped line is a success, but Bernice, angry from the stolen designs, does not thank Detty for rescuing the brand. A frustrated Detty attempts to resign, but Bernice convinces her to stay by raising her salary and increasing her work benefits. Roselle decides to hire the Filipino-Brazilian model Marlon (Daniel Matsunaga) as her brand's endorser, and requests Bernice's design partner James (DJ Durano), revealed to be the mole in Ponytale, to convince Detty to join La Yondelle instead. Detty finds Marlon, who has encountered a flat tire; she repairs the tire and escorts him to the hotel where Bernice and Roselle argue over Marlon. Due to Detty's assistance, Marlon decides to sign with Ponytale. Marlon and Detty begin to show interest in each other. Marlon and Detty visit Bernice's house, where Detty twists her ankle. Marlon decides to massage it, but Bernice walks in and believes that they are having oral sex, which results in him firing Marlon. Bernice and Maria confront Detty about their pasts, but Detty fails to recall the incident where Maria is paralyzed. Maria decides to do a reenactment by falling down the stairs again, which helps Detty remember who Bernice is. Detty begs for forgiveness, claiming that she was too young and didn't know what to do at the time, while Bernice counters by saying that she didn't do anything to help even in their adulthood, and fires her. Arriving home, Detty reveals to Kathy that she was fired from her job and her boss was her brother. The siblings confront each other in a shopping district, where Bernice reveals to Kathy that he used Angelo, who developed feelings for her, as part of his revenge. Angelo approaches Kathy at their school to explain that he went through with Bernice's plan because he owes him for taking him in, and that he really loves her. Roselle and James convince Detty to join La Yondelle. Bernice confronts them, where he realizes that James was the mole, and despite negotiations from him, Detty decides to remain at La Yondelle. Bernice devices an elaborate plan to scare Roselle, who falls down a flight of stairs and fractures her foot, and the latter vows revenge against Ponytale, which is facing dwindling sales. Bernice's close friend Jessie (Wilma Doesn't) advises him to get back Detty and forget about his revenge scheme if he wants Ponytale to emerge successful. After a failed attempt at reconciliation with his sister, Bernice tells his mother that he wants to stop his revenge scheme, and that nothing good will come out of it. Roselle's father Simon (Tirso Cruz III) wants Detty to replace Roselle; James convinces Roselle to eliminate Detty. Detty, Kathy and Cindy are brought to an abandoned warehouse, with Bernice and Angelo in pursuit. Detty's family is ambushed by Roselle, James and several thugs, but after pleading from Kathy and Cindy, Roselle has a change of heart and begs James to call it quits. James decides to also kill Roselle to take over La Yondelle, but Bernice, who arrived with Angelo and the police, intervenes and takes a bullet for Detty. At the hospital, the siblings reconcile after blaming each other, and Bernice eventually recovers after Roselle donates blood and makes amends with Detty and Bernice. Angelo decides to pursue Kathy again. Detty rejoins Ponytale and becomes co-president, and Bernice and Detty partner with Roselle to form a new fashion line named \"Sisterakas.\""

On May 27, 2012, Smith said in response to a tweet that, at some point in the next six months, the band would be releasing 10 unreleased songs on 7-inch and as digital downloads. Flea followed up Smith's announcement a few days later on May 29, 2012, by stating that 18 unreleased songs from the I'm with You sessions would be released over the next six months. He also confirmed that the band has been writing new music while touring. Josh Klinghoffer commented on the unreleased songs by saying \"Finding songs that seem to want to join hands with others is a special task that require the right people...and the right songs! Some songs seem to have a lot more of an agenda than others. Some songs play well with others and some songs need more attention and a little extra care. Here are some songs that seemed to want to pair up and take a later train. Keep your eye on them, they're up to something...\" Smith said in July 2012 of the unreleased songs that \"We just wanted them to come out because we just really like them. We didn't want them to get lost, so we're gonna put them out, mainly for our fans. They would've waited for the Warner Bros. box set in, like, 2020, if there's even a record company around then. I'm glad they're going to see the light of day because it's an important part of the band and what we were doing at the time.\" On the sound of the songs, Smith says he finds it \"hard to explain\" what the first two songs to be released sound like but describes \"Long Progression\" as \"kind of a flowing, kind of midtempo funk\". He also stated the band is currently working on new music. \"Those are just waiting,\" Smith said. \"We'll go back to those when we start writing again, I'm sure \u2013 or not. We're just always trying to come up with new stuff; usually the latest and greatest is what we use, but you never know.\""

I\u2019m sure everyone in the band can tell you the same.\u201d In an interview, Klinghoffer said the band spent time in 2012 and 2013 doing post-session work for some of the B-sides. Klinghoffer also said they recorded 48 songs during the album's sessions and some could eventually see the light of day. \u201cIt's possible,\u201d Klinghoffer said. \u201cWe just had so much material back then that certain things just straight-up didn\u2019t get enough attention.

Hallucinations about his dead little sister Misha threaten his sanity. He is drawn to his old vacant family apartment, where he one day opens the lid of a treasure chest, only to see a vision of Misha dead inside. He finally seeks psychiatric help in the form of the odd Dr. Palit, who puts him under regression hypnosis to go back to the past, when Bobo was 11 and Misha 6. A terrifying childhood story surfaces: Bobo and Misha live with their single father in the apartment. Bobo reads a book about witchcraft, from which he discovers the number 666 and uses it to travel on the elevator to an unlisted floor at the bottom of the building, which he tells Misha to be the entrance to hell. According to Bobo, each building has its own hell, where the \"bad people\" of the building are consigned for eternity once they are dead. A woman named Diana moves in and Bobo is convinced that she is a witch (daayan) and surfaced following his and Misha's trip on the elevator. Diana charms Bobo's father and marries him. Bobo learns that the source of the power of a witch is her plait. On Diana's birthday, during the night of the red moon, she sacrifices Misha in order to restore her dark powers. Bobo and his father discover Misha dead inside the trunk and a now-undisguised Diana hovering over her body. Diana kills Bobo's father with her ear-piercing screams. As she performs the rest of her ritual, the distraught Bobo finds his father's dagger and cuts off Diana's plait, destroying her source of power. Diana begins to crumble into dust, but says that she will return for Bobo. Dr. Palit dismisses Bobo's visions as fantasy. Bobo and Tamara marry and adopt ten-year-old Zubin. Everything goes well till the irresistible Lisa Dutt enters their lives during a magic show. Everyone loves her, but Bobo suspects that the witch is back in the form of Lisa. Lisa buys Bobo's old apartment, adding to his suspicion. During Lisa's housewarming party, Tamara falls off the balcony and is hospitalized. Lisa visits her, but Bobo walks in and angrily tells her to get out when he finds her tinkering with the IV bag. Afraid for his family, he calls Dr. Palit for help. Dr. Palit finds out something disturbing and calls Bobo, but the witch appears as Diana and kills him. Bobo finds Dr. Palit dead and sees a paper in his hand, on which Zubin's name is written. He looks for Zubin everywhere, but finds him missing. He then rushes back to the old apartment and takes the elevator to hell. There, he finds Zubin lying on an altar and the witch ready to sacrifice his son's life to sustain her powers. Bobo tries to save Zubin, but encounters Tamara. In a twist, it is revealed that Tamara is the witch, not Lisa. Diana appears and tells him that he himself is a Pishacha, as not just anyone merely pushes buttons in an elevator and finds hell. Tamara tells him that it took her twenty years to be reborn and she will not let him kill her again, and knocks him unconscious. Bobo wakes up and remembers the book, where he read that a Pishacha can regain his strength as it is the night of the red moon. With his acquired powers, he kills Tamara and returns his powers to Satan. The witch, now appearing as Diana, reveals that only the innocent can kill a witch, and since Bobo killed her once before, he is no longer innocent. The two fight again until Bobo kicks the sacrificial dagger to Zubin. Zubin is able to cut off Diana's plait, but the crumbling witch promises that she will return again. In the end, Bobo meets Lisa and she asks him why he was so aggressive toward her in the beginning. Bobo tells her that he thought she was a witch."

The tribal groove echoes a 10-year-old Jennifer Lopez hit, though because of how outdated such a formula is in today\u2019s EDM-filled universe, the whole thing never crosses into the accessibly endearing Top 40 orbit for which it longs.\" Alexandra Capotorto of Pop Crush called it \"perhaps the catchiest single to come off the album, and with an easily memorable chorus.\""

Alex Henderson of AllMusic noted that Martin wanted a different production style for her second album. While her first album had a very slick, high-tech, synthesizer-driven sound, this album favored a more organic production style. Still, in terms of the songs themselves, this release was not all that radical a departure from her first album. Martin was still aiming to be a commercial, radio-friendly pop/rock vocalist. Her appreciation for R&B showed up on tracks like \"Try Me,\" the title song, and the single \"Possessive Love\". \"This Is Serious had the makings of a hit,\" Henderson wrote, \"Even though 'Marilyn Martin' is the more essential of her two albums, 'This Is Serious' is also quite enjoyable.In the Philadelphia Inquirer'' of May 29, 1988, a review of the album stated \"Martin has built a career as a backup singer for many artists, including Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Nicks. The usual problem when a good backup singer performs as a lead singer is that she's so used to subsuming her vocal personality to another that the result is technically perfect but bland music. Martin neatly avoids this trap by permitting the rough edges in her voice to surface and by singing in an intimate, conversational tone. It helps, too, that with the exception of a few bombastic ballads, her material is strong pop-rock.\""

Matt Bjorke of Roughstock wrote that Farr's \"strong, likable voice [that] is put to ample use on the eleven tracks held within and it also suggests there's even more to the man that we've only scratched the surface of.\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was critical of the album containing country music clich\u00e9s and production that's indebt to hip-hop but gave note of Farr's performance sounding \"freshly showered and eminently respectable,\" concluding that \"[T]his inherent politeness does mean his rowdy redneck ways feel a bit like schtick, but it's a good act performed with enough cheer that Farr's slickness sells Redneck Crazy whenever the tunes drift toward the generic.\" Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time criticized the overall content for utilizing \"the three most standard clich\u00e9s in country music\" found in \"Chicks, Trucks and Beer\" and Farr's vocal delivery for being too hip-hop influenced and \"raspy\", concluding that \"In reality, there's not a whole lot of excitement. Not when you're considering that Farr is trailing the pack, not trying to lead it.\" In 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin placed four tracks from the album on his top 10 list of Farr's best songs: \"Hello Goodbye\" at number one, the title track at number two, \"Living with the Blues\" at number six and \"Hot Mess\" at number seven. Redneck Crazy debuted on the Billboard 200 at number five, and the Top Country Albums chart at number two, selling 29,000 copies in its first week and being the highest-charting debut by a new male country artist in two years.

To pursue her passion of spying, Bobby solves petty neighbourhood cases such as helping Tasawwur (Ali Fazal), a TV show host, to get rid of marriage proposals brought home by his parents. Bobby finally gets her big break when a rich NRI Anees Khan (Kiran Kumar) hands her a case of finding two missing girls named 'Niloufer' and 'Aamna' with a birth mark on their hand and shoulder respectively. To solve the case, Bobby takes up many get-ups such as 'beggar', 'peon', 'hawker', 'nerd student', 'astrologer' and even a fake 'TV producer'. After locating the targets, Khan pays her a tremendous fee and also offers huge amount of money to both girls' fathers for reasons unknown to Bobby. Khan also hands over his third and final case of finding a boy with a missing toe named 'Ali'. Meanwhile, Bobby and Tasawwur's family fix their marriage leaving both into the dilemma of how to get rid of this situation. A local goon Lala (Arjan Bajwa) also offers a case to Bobby to break Lala's girlfriend Aafreen (Anupriya Goenka)'s marriage, which is forcefully fixed by her mother Saida (Zarina Wahab). On Bobby's denial, Lala makes her realize that she has been helping the NRI for a wrong cause. Doubting on that Bobby tries to know the whereabouts of the two girls, but gets to know that both girls have gone missing. Scared and shocked, Bobby takes help from Tasawwur and sneaks into Khan's 5 star hotel room to check his background, only to be caught and thrown out by Khan and the hotel staff. But Bobby manages to get a hold of Khan's diary and his old photograph, which later gets into the hands of Lala, who since then starts following Bobby. Khan now suddenly goes into hiding and Bobby starts searching for him with the belief that Khan will not leave the town without his third target Ali. With the help of clues in Khan's diary such as a London based library's stamp and a Biryani order from a local restaurant, Bobby gets to know about Khan's background and later Khan is shown following Ali. It turns out to be a trap to capture Khan. With the twist in the climax, it is revealed that the three people Khan was looking for were his long lost children during communal riots. Khan has offered money to both girl's foster parents for helping them and sent the girls to London to pursue higher education. Tasawwur also enters the scene along with Lala who is actually Khan's long lost son 'Ali'. The film ends with Bobby becoming a famous detective, while she and Tasawwur are now in love with each other but are still confused about their marriage."

        "content": "At a bar, Deb Clarington, a camera operator for the local  news, sees an attractive man, Ryan Waverly.  Although she is initially too insecure to approach him, her friend Ruby talks her into it.  While awkwardly hitting on him, Deb is interrupted by Ryan's fianc\u00e9, who breaks up with him when he refuses to accept a high-paying job at his father's company.  The next thing Deb knows, she wakes in Ryan's bed with a hangover.  Ryan asks her to leave, and after several attempts to seduce him, she reluctantly agrees, but sees people attack and cannibalize each other.  Deb saves Ryan from a zombie attack, and they return to his apartment. Deb once again attempts to seduce Ryan, who is more concerned with checking on his family and ex-fianc\u00e9e.  Since he has no car, Deb agrees to help him.  They first visit his elderly neighbor for supplies.  Finding her apparently dead, they bicker over arrangements, only to be surprised when she rises as a zombie.  After they kill her, Deb drops the supplies, alerting many zombies.  The two flee to her car, agreeing that they will not stop until they reach Ryan's family.  Along the way, Deb eagerly rams several zombies; Ryan objects, saying they may be treatable.  Although skeptical of his idealistic optimism, Deb agrees not to unnecessarily kill them. Despite their earlier agreement, Deb takes a detour to visit Ruby, who is now a zombie.  Convinced the zombies may be treatable, Deb traps Ruby in the car's trunk.  At Ryan's father's mansion, the two meet Chaz, Ryan's brother, who quizzes them on whether they are zombies before allowing them in.  Ryan is reunited with Stacy, and Ryan's father, Frank, reveals that his water treatment plant spread the zombie virus to the town.  When Deb pushes for more information, he blames the governor for pushing an environmentally dangerous project, to Ryan's disgust. Frank privately tells Ryan the governor has arranged a helicopter for them, and Ryan insists they take Deb.  Frank initially refuses but relents when Ryan threatens to stay behind.  Frank attempts to drug Deb so they can leave her behind, but she hands the drugged food to their security guard.  When Ryan tells Stacy he no longer wants to marry her, she loudly simulates having sex, driving Deb to leave the house and Chaz to become intensely jealous.  After their guard dies, zombies attack Stacy.  Chaz ignores her pleas for help, and dazed by seeing her eaten alive, allows himself to be bitten.  The Waverlys leave the house for the helicopter, taking Chaz with them. Deb discovers a security checkpoint at the town limits.  Satisfying the paramilitary group, they allow her to leave but say she must turn back to the town.  After she invokes Frank's name to the governor, Frank himself appears, demanding his helicopter transportation.  The governor explains there never was a helicopter, and he wants only to clean up loose ends.  Ryan tells the Governor that Deb is a reporter who has evidence on him hidden in her car's trunk; the governor opens the trunk and is killed by Ruby. When Frank is also bitten, he tells Ryan and Deb to flee while he holds off the soldiers. Deb realizes they can use her television station to send out a broadcast that can not be jammed.  After she proclaims her love for Ryan on-air, she is bitten.  Believing herself to be turning into a zombie, she asks Ryan to leave her behind and wait for help, but he refuses to abandon her, instead offering himself to her as zombie food.  Before she can bite him, paramedics break into the station and reveal the virus is not contagious.  Frank and Chaz, revealed to have also survived although under arrest, encourage Ryan to proclaim his love to Deb.  As fighter jets bomb the city, Deb and Ryan kiss."

There is a massive, continent-wide power outage that appears to be part of a region-wide technological collapse. The car battery is drained, so they are left stranded for days. Eventually their father gets the car working and they make it to the nearest town where they buy supplies including gas from a man called Stan. Later Eva attends dance class while her sister meets up with Eli, a boy she has a crush on. Returning home, they see a stranded car and the girls' father offers to help the passengers, but after they brandish guns the family move on. The father says they will not return to town until the power is restored. Later, while cutting down a tree, he cuts his leg badly with a chainsaw. Knowing he is bleeding to death, he tells the girls to take care of each other and love one another. They bury him where he died in the forest. Two months pass and the girls are low on food. Eli arrives one night, having walked there looking for Nell. He says the surrounding houses are all abandoned. After Nell and Eli sleep together, he says there may still be power and order in Boston. He convinces Nell to go with him. They leave, but Nell turns back after a night away from home, unwilling to leave Eva. Nell researches plants for food and medicine, and forages. After a night of celebration when Nell confirms she is not pregnant, while Nell is in the forest foraging, Eva is surprised by Stan while she is chopping wood. He assaults her and rapes her before stealing most of the remaining gas and the car. The girls board up the house and Eva stays within doors. Eva throws up, and soon realizes she is pregnant. To Nell's surprise, Eva has decided to keep the baby, saying that she doesn't want to lose any more. During a bad storm, several beams of the roof break and Eva goes into labour. The sisters flee for a hollowed out tree stump that once served as their play house, where Eva gives birth to a baby boy. Returning to their ruined home, Eva decides to burn down the house so that anyone passing will think that they died in a fire. Before setting the house ablaze, they collect a few precious items and keepsakes, and begin to walk into the darkened forest."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on 24 reviews. Billboard described Drake and Future's chemistry as expected and said \"Future deals with personal demons that he tries, and fails, to drown in drugs; Drake is mostly about insecurities and lesser gravity\". Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, attributing the \"fresh and spontaneous\" feel to the quick production of the album, where \"both artists [are] playing off their louder-than-life personalities without overthinking the details.\" However, Sheldon Pearce in a Pitchfork review suggests that this limited time-frame for making the album is the sonic downfall of the mixtape arguing that the album \"wasn't created with the care or the dutiful curation we've come to expect from both artists when solo.\" In a mixed review, Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork criticizes the \"decided lack of chemistry between these two,\" because \"they have difficulty sharing the same space\" when on the same song. Pearce goes on to highlight how Future's presence, both in content and persona, is much more prevalent than Drake's, where the latter appears to be a \"bystander\" and \"out of his element.\" Yet, he highlights moments where the collaboration works most effectively. In \"Scholarships\", Drake \"throws Future the perfect alley-oop,\" \"Jumpman\" is a banger, and \"Diamonds Dancing\" is the first track between the two artists that \"clicks on all cylinders.\" Additionally, Pearce lauds the production by Metro Boomin as \"glimmering\" and hails both rappers when they are able to work on their own and make music in their respective comfort zones in songs like Future's \"Jersey\" and Drake's \"30 for 30 Freestyle\". Complex said about Drake verses; \"despite a corny bar here or there, Drake sounds way more energized with much better flows.\" Entertainment Weekly was disappointed with Drake on the album, quoting \"despite a beat by Drake whisperer Noah \"40\" Shebib, the album-closing \"30 For 30 Freestyle\" doesn't come near clearing the admittedly high bar Drake has set for himself in 2015.\""

The terrorists have the ingredients for a \"dirty bomb\", which they plan to use to kill delegates at the first Asean Counter-Terrorism Council meeting, in Manila. At Camp Navarro, a U.S. Marine military base in Mindanao, a rapid deployment force led by Captain Max Randall receives orders from General Hank Wallace to go after the terrorists. The general's daughter (and Randall's girlfriend), Jenna Wallace, works for the security contractor providing security at the Manila conference.  Her security and technical skills place her on the Marine operation. Nassif is collaborating with a local revolutionary, Abdul Malik, son of the 2004 U.S. Embassy bomber Omar Malik. The Marines attack a warehouse where the terrorist and revolutionary groups are meeting. While Sergeant McCray is able to blow up a truck with some of the leaders inside, some civilians are killed by friendly fire, with the act caught on a civilian's camera. Subsequently, Randall is ordered to stand down his unit. Intent on seeking revenge for their dead in the warehouse attack, the terrorists attempt to abduct Randall, instead capturing Jenna, who is held for a $5 million ransom. General Wallace wants to pay the ransom, but Randall is given a new set of orders to go into the Philippines jungle to track down the terrorists and bring back Jenna. Jenna is freed, but Randall is captured.  The Marines also learn that the terrorists are trying to establish a satellite feed to set off their dirty bomb.  With the assistance of a U.S. Marine task force flying F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters, Jenna and the Marines storm the terrorist headquarters. Finally cornered, the terrorists are killed."

        "content": "Raman Raghav 2.0 (released internationally as Psycho Raman) is a 2016 Indian neo-noir psychological thriller film directed by Anurag Kashyap. Produced by Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Vikas Bahl, and Madhu Mantena, the film stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vicky Kaushal, and debutante Sobhita Dhulipala. It depicts in eight chapters the cat and mouse chase of serial killer Ramanna (Siddiqui) by corrupt cop Raghavan (Kaushal). Real-life killer Raman Raghav, who operated in Mumbai during the 1960s, inspired the film. Kashyap initially wanted to make a period film about Raman Raghav, but after the commercial failure of Bombay Velvet (2015), his previous film was also set in the 1960s, he realized that he would be unable to find financing. Abandoning the period-piece concept, he co-wrote the film with Vasan Bala, setting it in the contemporary time. The film's music was composed by Ram Sampath, and Varun Grover wrote the lyrics. Jay Oza served as the film's cinematographer and Aarti Bajaj as its editor. Raman Raghav 2.0 premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. It also screened at the 2016 Sydney Film Festival, the Singapore International Film Festival, the Fantasia International Film Festival, Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival, and the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. The film was released in India on 24 June 2016, received high critical acclaim, and proved to be a moderate commercial success, grossing over \u20b970\u00a0million (US$1.1\u00a0million)."

However, his plan to purchase drugs is foiled\u2014the dealer and another man have been murdered. Investigating the murders the next day, he receives a hammer followed by an anonymous phone call. In 2015, a man named Ramanna surrenders to the police and confesses to killing nine people. He is detained and beaten by the police but manages to escape with the help of a group of boys nearby. Seeking food at the home of his sister Lakshmi, Ramanna argues with his brother-in-law. After leaving the house he quickly returns and kills the couple and their son. Raghavan is among the police who later investigated the family's murder, where he finds a picture of Ramanna with Lakshmi, confirming Ramanna's involvement in the crime. Raghavan is in a relationship with Smrutika \"Simi\" Naidu, but he is an abusive partner: he beats her and has forced her to have three abortions. Ramanna surveils Raghavan and Simi, suggesting a link exists between the cop and the killer. This surveillance escalates into more murders when Ramanna stalks and kills Simi's maid and her husband. After these killings, Ramanna is caught by the police with assistance from an onlooker. However, Ramanna escapes from custody again and kills the man who aided his capture. Raghavan proves to be a killer himself when, after a trip to visit his father, he murders an African drug dealer. That evening Raghavan picks up a woman named Ankita at a nightclub and brings her to Simi's house. Incapacitated by drug use, Raghavan is unable to perform sexually, prompting mockery from Ankita. In response he assaults her. Still enraged, he searches for the stash of drugs he keeps at the house but is unable to find it. In this state he confronts Simi and they argue. When Simi demands he leave with Ankita, he strikes Simi; her head hits a glass table killing her instantly. Ankita locks herself in the bathroom and tries to call for help, but desists when Raghavan threatens and coerces her. He then clears away incriminating evidence and arranges the scene to implicate Ramanna for the murder. He retrieves a tyre iron similar to Ramanna's favored murder weapon and smashes Simi's head with it. During these preparations, Ankita escapes. The next day Ramanna surrenders to Raghavan and claims a deep connection with him: each man is the missing half of the other. Ramanna also reveals his role in the two 2013 murders that opened the film and initiated this connection. He confesses to one of the killings but witnessed Raghavan kill the other man, and thus began his surveillance of the policeman. Ramanna offers to accept the charge for Simi's murder, but only if Raghavan will kill the eyewitness, Ankita. In the final scene Raghavan's descent into evil matches Ramanna's when he murders Ankita in her home."

        "content": "Raman Raghav 2.0 was inspired by the notorious serial killer Raman Raghav, who had killed several homeless people in Mumbai during the late 1960s. Bludgeoning his victims, he produced widespread panic until he was captured by the Mumbai police and confessed to 41 murders. Raghav was sentenced to death by the Bombay High Court, but his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia allowed his defence to claim mental incapability and gain a change of sentence to life imprisonment. He was sent to Yerawada Central Jail, where he died of kidney failure in 1988 after 19 years of incarceration. Director Anurag Kashyap first became interested in the story of Raman Raghav in 1991, when Sriram Raghavan was making a 68-minute film about the killer titled Raman Raghav, A City, A Killer. Kashyap was drawn to the idea of a criminal who was not motivated by familiar human vices. According to him, the killer had \"no moral compass or planning\" to kill someone. He initially wanted to make a trilogy of period films based in Mumbai, the first of which was Bombay Velvet (2015), then a film on the Nanavati murder case after Raman Raghav 2.0. But after the commercial failure of Bombay Velvet, Kashyap realised that he would not get producers for another period film. He then set the film in contemporary time. The film on the Nanavati case did not materialise. Vasan Bala, the film's co-writer, had written a biopic about Raman Raghav. Kashyap re-wrote that script, taking inspiration from the actual murders. He created a police officer who would be the \"mirror image\" of the killer, as he felt it was difficult to create an honest cop in a contemporary time."

Vicky Kaushal was called by Kashyap and was given two scenes to prepare in five days for the audition. Kaushal locked himself in the room and isolated himself from phone, internet and newspaper and kept repeating his lines from the scenes. He then gave the audition and was selected for the role of Raghav. Miss Earth India 2013, Sobhita Dhulipala made her acting debut with this film.

He mentioned that it helped in making the film look vast as the locations kept changing. The title was decided before the script was ready. The crew employed guerrilla filmmaking technique to shoot in real locations of Mumbai. Siddiqui had to deliver a ten-minute monologue in the film. To maintain continuity, he had to be still at the same place while the camera setup was changed from different angles. As a result, he ended up speaking for 300 minutes in the same position. After the shoot, the actor experienced a blackout and could not talk for sometime. Kaushal's character is shown snorting cocaine throughout the film. To make a quasi-cocaine powder, the crew used Glucon-D and Corn Starch. Kaushal practised inhaling the powder for his scenes in the film. While shooting in some unhygienic surroundings, Siddiqui fell ill and was hospitalised for five days. His wife later said that Siddiqui was repeating his dialogues from the film, while being semi-conscious on bed. Although the diagnosis showed dengue initially, he recovered quickly. He resumed shooting for the film when he was discharged. Siddiqui called the shoot a \"mentally draining\" experience. For a scene, the crew had to shoot it in the restricted area of the Mumbai airport which is guarded by snipers with strict instructions to shoot any infiltrator. Siddiqui was told not to move from his position and the scene was shot. The visual effects and title sequence for the film were executed by Mumbai-based VFX and animation studio, Plexus. Aarti Bajaj and Jay Oza served as the editor and director of photography respectively. Raman Raghav 2.0 was distributed by Reliance Entertainment."

She said the song \"Paani Ka Raasta\" has a poetic touch with dark undertones. Manish Gaekwad thought that \"Raghav's Theme\" has a \"hybrid sound in which techno music meets the sarangi to create a hypnotic instrumental track that explores the psyche of its protagonist.\""

Saibal Chattejee of NDTV praised the \"gripping, visceral genre film\",  and described the villain as \"a cross between No Country for Old Men's Anton Chigurh and Se7en's John Doe\". Writing for The Hindu, Namrata Joshi called Raman Raghav 2.0 a \"taut thriller\" that \"takes you on an entertainment high.\" Anna M. M. Vetticad praised Siddiqui for his \"eerie, scary, [and] disgusting\" portrayal of the serial killer, and was particularly impressed by his ability to elicit laughs \"for the matter-of-fact manner in which he goes about his bloody business\". Mohar Basu of The Times of India wrote, \"It is crude, callous and keeps you in suspense all through\". He felt that it was a difficult film to watch as it made the viewer \"queasy\". Aseem Chhabra shared the view of the film being a \"difficult watch\". Although he was critical of the film's misogyny that made it a \"difficult film to admire\", he praised Siddiqui's performance at his \"creepiest best\". Sweta Kaushal of Hindustan Times described the film as \"spine-chilling\" and \"pure sadism\". Contrary to the positive critical reviews, Rajeev Masand felt the film \"doesn't bring anything blazingly new or original to the serial killer genre.\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote that the film was \"atmospheric yet hollow\" and the viewers are \"turned into cringing voyeurs, into reluctant participants, without redemption\". Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today praised the film but felt that Dhulipala's character was the \"weak link\" as she \"doesn't have much to do\". Among the overseas reviewers, Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter noted Kaushal's performance and lack of character-depth of female characters, \"Variety and depth of character are badly lacking on the female front, weakening the whole film.\" Maitland McDonagh commented that the film performs a \"surprisingly deep dive into lust, murder and violent obsession\" and \"delivers a couple of truly suspenseful sequences.\" Guy Lodge from Variety mentioned it as a \"luridly absorbing serial killer thriller\" and felt Siddiqui's performance has an \"unblinking intensity\". Wendy Ide from Screen International reviewed the film and called it a \"propulsive and bloodthirsty thriller\" and an \"adrenalised energy which rarely flags.\" But he felt that the film lacks the sense of a \"Manhunter-style battle of wits.\" Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting wrote about the film, \"If you only think of Bollywood when you think of Indian film, Psycho Raman will knock some sense into you, as it stands up with the grittiest American serial killer thrillers.\" Suprateek Chatterjee of HuffPost mentioned the film as an \"exercise in empty shock value\"."

In February 2015, Michielin started posting messages on her Twitter account, suggesting a new release. After sharing a photo of a red background, she sent a series of pictures with incremental details, including a prism and Michielin's name. The picture was later revealed as the single's artwork. During the same days, she also sent a message including the sentence \"L'amore esiste\" (English: Love exists), leading to speculations on it being the title of her new single or album. On 2 March, it was officially announced that \"L'amore esiste\" would be released on 6 March 2015 as the lead single from Michielin's second studio album, which was later titled di20."

The song is an electropop ballad, in which Michielin lists a series of faint hints suggesting that love exists, concluding that the only thorough definition of love is \"you\", the man to which it is dedicated. However, Michielin revealed in an interview that the song also has a general meaning, claiming that \"it is a hymn to love, which expresses itself both in its singularity and plurality\". In the same interview, she stated the song represents \"a sign of hope, an invitation to think about love as the only way to escape from the dark days we're living in\"."

On 24 July 2015, Michielin received the \"Lunezia Pop Award\" for \"L'amore esiste\". The prize awards Italian songs in different genres for their \"musical-literary value\". Reviewing the track, Radio Italia's Paola Gallo considered \"L'amore esiste\" a very emotional song, praising Michielin's voice and the song's international sound. Writing for Italian music portal Rockol.it, Mattia Marzi also noted an \"interesting work on arrangements and production\", citing the use of vocoder as an element distinguishing the song from most Italian productions and comparing the track to Lorde's work. Il Fatto Quotidiano'''s Michele Monina strongly criticized the song, considering it a clone of Marco Mengoni's 2014 single \"Guerriero\", also co-written and produced by Zampaglione and Canova, and released by the same recording label."

Her cover was published online and released as a single on 10 February 2017. On the digital single, two different remixes of her song were featured as well as an instrumental version. Lee decided to rework the song while in Italy, working on the music video of her song \"Speak to Me\" recorded for the film Voice from the Stone (2017). The singer revealed that she had heard \"L'amore esiste\" on the radio, and afterwards \"it seemed to follow me everywhere, got under my skin and just wouldn't leave\". She elaborated, \"I couldn\u2019t stop listening to it, over and over the whole way home. I started piecing together what the lyrics meant and wrote my own twist on them in English.\" The singer afterwards presented her work to producer Guy Sigsworth whom she convinced to join her in New York and help her recreate \"L'amore esiste\". Dave Eggar was the one responsible for the string arrangement and the group recorded the song in a week at Flux Studios. Lee further elaborate on the work behind the song, saying, \"What an incredibly fulfilling experience it was to make this beautiful thing. And with such a talented, down-to-earth, and inspired team- with no rules or limitations beyond the ones we created. Guy pushed me in new ways and I learned a few things. It was a unique honor to work beside someone I admire so much on something that at the time had no plan, no album to go on, and made no sense other than how good it felt. It's easy to get bogged down by the 'point' sometimes, when what matters most in my opinion, in music-making, is following your heart. Finding a way to satisfy that deep need to express something that can't be said with words alone.\" The ballad begins with a gentle synthesizer and a delicate melody which progressively adds more layers, including string arrangements. Lee's vocal performance in the song was described as \"tranquil, subdued\" during the verses and with \"uplifting power and a soulful wail\" during the chorus. Joe DiVita from the website Loudwire'' felt that overall, the song \"resides on the more soothing side of things\". Idolator writer Mike Wass praised \"Love Exists\", calling it \"the best power ballad Celine Dion never sang \u2014 albeit with a pleasing twist of darkness\". The song managed to appear at number four on the Belgian Ultratip chart in Wallonia on 18 March 2017."

During this downtime, Benji and Joel Madden did production work; after working with All Time Low and 5 Seconds of Summer, the brothers, and subsequently the rest of the band, wanted to make a new album. The writing and recording process consisted of the brothers creating a song, showing it to the other members, practice and record it. Working with collaborator John Feldmann, who produced the album, sessions concluded mid-2015. After announcing the end of their hiatus in early November 2015, \"Makeshift Love\" was released as a single. In early 2016, the band supported All Time Low on the UK arena tour, leading into the single release of \"40 oz. Dream\" in May. Preceded by the single release of \"Life Can't Get Much Better\" in June, Youth Authority was released in July through the Madden brothers' own label MDDN. It was promoted with performances on Warped Tour for the remainder of the month, and a handful of UK shows surrounding the band's appearance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. A music video for \"Life Changes\" followed in September, as did a headlining US tour in October and November. A second headlining US tour followed in May 2017; alongside two festival appearances, a music video was released for \"Keep Swingin'\" in June. A few months later, a music video was released for \"War\"; the band closed the year with a headlining UK tour in November and December. Youth Authority received a generally favorable reception, with the album's pop punk sound dividing critics. It charted at number 23 on the US Billboard 200, and peaked within the top 20 on five additional Billboard charts. \"Makeshift Love\" and \"Life Can't Get Much Better\" charted within the top 20 on various Billboard sales charts, with \"Life Changes\" charting just outside this frame. The album reached number one in Australia, where \"Makeshift Love\" and \"Life Can't Get Much Better\" peaked outside of the top 100 and top 50, respectively. Outside of these territories, the record charted within the top 20 in Switzerland, the UK, Austria, New Zealand, Germany and Canada."

At the time, the members felt burned out from the previous 12 years and decided to focus on their families. In addition, they also felt the music industry was controlling their image and ideas. Vocalist Joel Madden said they took their website offline, sold off all of their merchandise because they wanted to \"go out with a clean slate.\" Benji and Joel Madden hosted The Voice in Australia, before forming The Madden Brothers project. They used this project to move away from Good Charlotte's pop punk sound to explore pop music. After releasing a mixtape, they began working on an album in 2012, which was eventually released as Greetings from California in 2014. The brothers did production and song writing work for 5 Seconds of Summer, All Time Low, Three 6 Mafia, among others. Additionally, they formed MDDN, an entity that served as a record label, management and music publishing company. Guitarist Billy Martin worked as an artist/illustrator for Nickelodeon and Disney. Bassist Paul Thomas got a degree at University of California, Berkeley. Drummer Dean Butterworth served as a session musician and wrote music for TV shows. The brothers got the idea to reform Good Charlotte while working on All Time Low's Future Hearts and 5 Seconds of Summer's Sounds Good Feels Good albums in 2015. They had an interest in making pop punk music again and decided to contact the other members, who were interested in writing a new album."

For three months, the brothers would write a song, show the rest of the band, practice it and then record it. By the end of each day, the group at least had a rough outline of a new song. They eventually went back finished up the tracks. Long-time collaborator John Feldmann acted as producer. They group had worked with Feldmann previously for a few songs, but had not recorded an album with him, which was something they had wanted to do for a while.

Discussing the album title, Madden said Youth Authority was the concept that \"there\u2019s a kid out there right now who has a guitar, or a microphone, or a laptop, with a dream that is going to beat the odds.\" He said the album felt like the \"GC of the past\" with \"a new energy to it.\" He mentioned \"Life Changes\" as encapsulating \"the GC spirit\", while having an arena rock chorus in the vein of Bon Jovi. \"Makeshift Love\" incorporates the sound of an iPhone, and is about being misunderstood by your significant other. \"40 oz. Dream\" bares resemblance to Bowling for Soup's version of \"1985\", and is a satirical view of the music industry. \"Keep Swingin'\" was written while the Madden brothers were working with Quinn, starting off as a riff and quickly evolved into a complete song within a day. Joel Madden listened back to it the following week and was highly impressed by it, subsequently asking Quinn if they could include it on Youth Authority. The Madden brothers were in Los Angeles and hung out with Neil, who was there to write songs. Neil suggested the three of them write together, resulting in \"Reason to Stay\", in which he sings the first verse. The pop rock ballad features vocal effects akin to those used by Imogen Heap. Benji Madden was hesitant to include \"The Outfield\" on the album as it featured lyrics about his and brother's upbringing. \"War\", the heaviest track the group has written, recalls the mood of The Chronicles of Life and Death (2004). An earlier version of the track appeared on the iTunes deluxe edition of Greatest Remixes (2008). \"Moving On\" channels the electro-dance vibe of Good Morning Revival (2007)"

The album garnered a longlist nomination for the 2017 Polaris Music Prize, and won the Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2017."

The couple want Piaa to be admitted to a prestigious English-medium school in Delhi as they feel that this will enable her to become a part of the elite of society. They decide on Delhi Grammar School, ranked the best in the city, but it requires that students must stay within a 3-km radius of the school. They move to a posh villa in Delhi's upscale Vasant Vihar neighbourhood and try to become more refined in their manner. A consultant, Saumya, despite her misgivings about them, tutors them in the answers to be given in the admission interview, but their limited knowledge of English means Piaa's application is rejected. Raaj and Meeta learn from an employee that his daughter has been admitted through the RTE quota, a scheme that helps children from poor families to be admitted to prestigious schools. After a scam reveals that rich parents are gaming the quota to admit their children, they move to Bharat Nagar, a slum area, for a month and pretend to be poor. They strike a friendship with Shyam Prakash and Tulsi Prakash, who are hopeful that their son Mohan Prakash gets to study in Delhi Grammar School through the RTE quota. Shyam and Tulsi teach them to live like truly poor people, and Raaj joins Shyam at work. However, while Piaa eventually gets admission, Mohan's application is rejected. Raaj, Meeta & Piaa return to Vasant Vihar. Raaj and Meeta make a donation to the Bharat Nagar Government School, where Mohan studies, to renovate it and get new books. After watching their son become fluent in English, Shyam and Tulsi search for the identity of the anonymous donor to thank them. However, when he visits the donor's address in Vasant Vihar, Shyam finds out the truth about Raaj pretending to be poor to enable Piaa's admission and leaves to tell Delhi Grammar School's principal Lodha Singhania of Raaj's deceit. Raaj and Meeta rush to Delhi Grammar School to get there before Shyam, but fail. Shyam, reaching there first, tries to find the principal's office, but meets Piaa instead, where Shyam endures an emotional moment with her, and decides not tell the principal, but Raaj reacts with guilt for what he has done. Finally, Raaj goes to the principal and asks for Piaa's admission to be revoked, while telling the truth, but the principal rejects him. Raaj gatecrashes the Annual Day function, gives a speech about English in India and education rights, and leaves, with no one clapping for him, except Meeta. On their way out, Raaj & Meeta tell the principal of the Bharat Nagar Government School that they plan to admit Piaa to his school to study with Mohan."

The film was directed by Chaudhary, his third after romantic comedy films Pyaar Ke Side Effects (2006) and Shaadi Ke Side Effects (2014). He came up with the idea of making a film about India's education system with his co-writer Zeenat Lakhani during the development of the latter film. They found the idea too extensive to include in Shaadi Ke Side Effects, so after its release, they decided to incorporate the idea into a separate film. Stating the reason to make Hindi Medium, Chaudhary said, \"The subject is so relevant. We realised that today irrespective of the background of the parent, they still want to have the best education for the children.\" Pre-production work began after the release of Shaadi Ke Side Effects. Chaudhary began working on the story at that time, and he chose Delhi as the film's key location. The production crew consisted primarily of people Chaudhary had worked with on Pyaar Ke Side Effects and Shaadi Ke Side Effects, with the exception of production designer Mustafa Stationwala\u2014they are editor A. Sreekar Prasad; dialogue writer Amitosh Nagpal; and cinematographer Laxman Utekar. The score was composed by Amar Mohile. On 29 May 2016, News18 reported the casting of Saba Qamar in the film, which marked her Bollywood debut. Khan had recommended the casting of Qamar to the makers of the film. He said, \"When I saw her YouTube videos, I recommended her to the director and producer and they really liked her\". Speaking about her role, Qamar said, \"I play a person who didn't get an opportunity to fulfil her dreams so she comes up with a scheme about giving the daughter a life that she didn't have\". Khan commented that he had accepted the role as it tackled the realistic subject of the challenges of obtaining a good education in India. Qamar arrived in Mumbai from Pakistan in July 2016, and the film's principal photography began in the same month. The film was shot in Chandni Chowk, Anand Lok, Karol Bagh, and Sangam Vihar. The shooting was completed in October 2016. A song sequence was also filmed in Georgia. Qamar commented that she enjoyed working with Khan, and felt safe while shooting in Delhi. In the same interview with Pakistani newspaper Dawn, she commented that her experience wasn't affected by the nationalist far-right political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's hostility towards Pakistan at the time."

A reviewer for Time Out gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: \"With all its merits, though, the film stumbles near the end with its overly sentimental conclusion.\" The reviewer concluded that \"the film is one of the best Bollywood films\". James Marsh of South China Morning Post rated it 3.5 stars out of 5 stars, calling it \"a classical comedy of manners full of humour and playful performances\". Sadaf Siddique of Dawn observed: \"Chaudhary gets full marks for novelty, he fails to adequately flesh his ideas out\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 2.5 stars out of 5, commenting \"Despite its shortcomings, the film is never unwatchable and benefits enormously from a winning performance by Irrfan Khan who makes his every moment on screen count. From his hilarious wooing of a mother-daughter pair of potential customers at his shop in the film's first half to his earnest amends on discovering his conscience late into the final act, he has you eating out of his palm. For Irrfan alone, Hindi Medium may be worth a watch.\""

Normani shares the chorus, as she sings on top of the rock cliff, shown earlier in the video. Camila Cabello seductively lays down and grabs her hair, in similarity to Ally. Several men approach the girls as they arrive in a convertible Jeep Wrangler. They greet and socialize with each other.

She refuses to talk to the police, who believe the janitor was blackmailing her with something until she grew tired and decided to kill him. The detective informs her fiance that she has canceled her marriage with two other men previously, which appears to be what she did not want to get revealed. The fiance gets angry and his father encourages him to forget her. Shirin's parents hire a famously skilled lawyer, who visits Shirin in detention and manages to make her state her first words after arrest. The lawyer considers this a start and learns from Shirin's mother that in contrast to Shirin's two previous marriage attempts, she chose the last one herself; and that they are true lovers. The lawyer meets the fiance, who finally agrees to help. He visits Shirin and asks her for her motive. She begins to reveal her story: When she was a child, her parents were at work most of the time and entrusted her to an assistant named Morad, who frequently abused her and took pictures of her while they were alone. The police arrest Morad, who denies the accusations. However, when pictures of other girls are found in his house, he is tortured until he confesses to dozens of sexual abuses. As a result, he is sentenced to death. Then Shirin is asked of the reason she killed the janitor. She reveals that as she was preparing to join her fiance, she noticed her neighbors' daughter being abused by the janitor. She freed the girl and killed the janitor. The detective and the lawyer debrief the abused girl and her parents, who refuse to testify, as the disclosure of the daughter's abuse can ruin the family's reputation and become a scandal that is not accepted in Iranian culture. The lawyer tries another way to help Shirin's case. She brings a psychologist to the trial, where the latter states that traumatic events in childhood can affect the person's mental state and behavior. The court does not accept that and sentences Shirin to qisas. Since the death sentence can be replaced by diyya if a family member of the victim exists, the lawyer and the fiance search for the janitor's family. They discover that there is a living brother, and the fiance meets a carpet salesman who knows of the brother's whereabouts. The salesman initially refuses to talk. The fiance threatens to burn the carpets and the salesman eventually reveals the location. The fiance and the lawyer head there, but discover the brother is dying of a drug overdose. They take him to a hospital but the brother dies. As a result, Shirin is transferred for execution."

Shy by nature, Mudit tries all possible ways to talk to Sugandha but fails. Finally, he decides to send her an online marriage proposal. When the two finally meet, they feel the sparks and decide to take it to the next level. Sugandha takes her time deciding whether to accept the proposal and later calls it her first major decision for her own life. A formal marriage proposal is exchanged between their families. When Sugandha's parents are out of town, Mudit and Sugandha try getting intimate and when they finally reach the bed, a visibly uncomfortable Mudit declares that he needs to use the washroom. But when he returns, he gets dressed and makes for the main door. When a concerned Sugandha asks him about this sudden change of plans, he simply hints at his problem with the help of a biscuit, getting Sugandha to realize that he is facing a bout of erectile dysfunction. Mudit and Sugandha try different ways to solve the problem but fail, and when Mudit comes face to face with the reality of his impending marriage, he decides to cancel it. They argue. Now deeply in love, Sugandha refuses to cancel the wedding and says she will expect him and his baaraat (wedding procession) at the venue. Eventually, accompanied by a posse of assorted relatives, Mudit leaves for Haridwar where the marriage is scheduled to take place. During the journey, Mudit constantly receives calls from someone stating that he is a well-wisher and knows about his problem. When he reaches Haridwar and the calls continue, Sugandha takes the call and showers abuses on the unknown person before suddenly realizing that the well-wisher is none other than Sugandha's father. Mudit's future father-in-law takes him to consult with a veterinarian who suggests that the cause is stress. A day prior to the wedding, Sugandha and Mudit try getting intimate one more time, egged on by relatives from both sides of the family. When they exit the room sometime later, they find every family member waiting expectantly about Mudit having done 'it'. Mudit says that he managed to perform but Sugandha disagrees. The families are now deeply worried. As the hour of the wedding approaches and troubles and disagreements pile on, Mudit stands up for Sugandha and their relationship against family/societal expectations. He even risks his life to stand up for the love of his life, Sugandha. He rejects toxic masculinity and they together define their marriage as a team of equal players. The wedding takes place. In the closing narration, Sugandha says that nothing happened (i.e. Mudit still presumably had erectile dysfunction) on the first night or their honeymoon and then, they simply got busy with their lives. And one fine day, it simply happened, even as the whole family was busy in a pooja (prayer ceremony)."

Cudi would later run into West again, while Cudi was working at the BAPE store in NYC: \"I remember Kanye coming in one time and I was helping him get a couple things,\" Cudi said. \"I forgot to take a sensor off of one of the jackets he bought and I had to run out the store to catch him before he left. Pretty funny me chasing after him in SoHo.\" In 2008, Kid Cudi caught the attention of Kanye West's A&R at the time, Plain Pat, who had initially met Cudi at a Def Jam meeting and picked up a copy of his demo. Plain Pat went on to introduce Cudi's music to West, subsequently leading West to sign Cudi to his GOOD Music imprint later that year. Following Cudi's signing to GOOD, he began heavily working with West. West first called upon Cudi to reference hooks for American rapper and mogul Jay-Z, and while in the studio Cudi and West went from working on The Blueprint 3 (2009) to West's R&B-esque fourth solo album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Cudi's assistance on the latter includes co-writing credits and/or vocals on \"Heartless,\" \"Welcome to Heartbreak,\" \"Paranoid\" and \"RoboCop.\" Kid Cudi proved to be a prominent songwriter and featured artist on 808s & Heartbreak, with \"Paranoid\" and \"Heartless\" being released as singles respectively, while \"Welcome to Heartbreak\" charted as an album cut and peaked at number 87 on the Pop 100. The two continued to work on Cudi's debut album Man on the Moon: The End of Day (2009), with West serving as an executive producer. West had also produced two songs, namely \"Sky Might Fall\" and the Common-assisted third single \"Make Her Say\", which West is also featured on. As of 2018, Cudi had contributed to every West album since 2008's 808s & Heartbreak, with their 2016 effort \"Father Stretch My Hands\", reaching the Top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. After a brief fallout, the two reconnected in late 2016, around the dissolution of West's Saint Pablo Tour, which ended in him being hospitalized. West abruptly canceled his Saint Pablo Tour and sought hospitalization for exhaustion in November 2016. At that time, West's only two live appearances since had both been with Cudi, who also sought mental health treatment in the fall of 2016, for performances of \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\u201d in November 2017 and February. As of 2018, West, however, had not appeared on one of Cudi's songs, or worked on any of his albums, since 2010's Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager."

Cudi revealed in July 2018, that he and West will continue to release music as Kids See Ghosts. \"There are some songs that we didn't use that I\u2019m hopeful we can put out later,\" Cudi explained in an interview with Billboard. \"But the plan is to do more Kids See Ghosts albums... We just have this chemistry that's undeniable, especially when we have to fight for it with each other.\" The duo made their live debut under the moniker at Tyler, the Creator\u2019s Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival on November 11, 2018. They performed their album in entirety as well as Cudi featured Kanye songs \"Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\", \"Welcome to Heartbreak\", \"Paranoid\", and \"Ghost Town\", and Cudi's single \"Pursuit of Happiness.\" At Cudi's 2019 Coachella set, West joined him onstage for performances of \"Feel the Love\", \"Reborn\", \"Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\", \"Ghost Town\", and \"Ghost Town Pt. 2\". 070 Shake and Ty Dolla $ign, frequent collaborators of the duo, came onstage for their features on the latter two songs. In a September 2019 interview with Complex, Kid Cudi assured fans that more material from him and Kanye West would be coming. \"There will be more Kids See Ghosts albums. Kanye already told me he wants to start working on the second one,\" he said. \"With the first album, I didn't know how serious he was about making a collab album with me,\" he continued. \"He had mentioned it, but I thought it was just a good idea he had in the moment. But then he kept bringing it up and kept having me come to his house, listen to music, and work on beats, so I was like, 'Wow, he's really into this.' We had a discussion where he said he wanted to make a spiritual album and I told him, 'Great. That's what I do. I would love to do that, something I can sink my teeth into.' So there will definitely be more.\""

        "content": "\"I Thought About Killing You\" is a song by American rapper Kanye West, released as the opening track on his eighth studio album, Ye (2018). The song was produced by West, Francis and the Lights, and Benny Blanco, with additional production from Mike Dean, Andy C and Aaron Lammer. The production is driven by repetitive a capella intonations, which play in the background. The lyrical content of the song centers around West's thoughts of suicide and homicide, delivered in both rapping and spoken word. West imparted that he has had suicidal thoughts in an interview with The New York Times. \"I Thought About Killing You\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, with some directing praise towards its lyrical content and the beat switch, though other critics expressed negative feelings of such content. The original version of the song contained an unlicensed sample of \"Fr3sh\" by Kareem Lofty. The sample was removed in November 2018 after legal action was threatened by Lofty's record label, PAN. Though not released as a single, the song peaked at number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100, while it reached top 40 positions on the Canadian Hot 100 and Irish Singles Chart."

In addition to \"I Thought About Killing You\", Francis and the Lights helped produce Ye tracks \"All Mine\" and \"Ghost Town\". The project produced the song with West and Benny Blanco, while additional production was handled by Mike Dean, Andy C and Aaron Lammer. British grime rapper Wiley commented on West's TMZ interview in which he suggested slavery was a choice via Twitter on May 3, 2018, claiming in one of his tweets that \"Slavery was not a choice it was forced upon us. We were born into it.\" Despite tweeting out against his remarks, Wiley described West as \"very smart.\" The contributions of Wiley and fellow British rapper Skepta weren't revealed until the credits of Ye were updated on June 14, 2018 to show them as co-writers on \"I Thought About Killing You\". It stands along with \"Yikes\" as one of only two tracks on the album where the vocals are solely by West. West explained that he has had contemplations of suicide during an interview with The New York Times on June 25, 2018; the album was recorded that same year. When asked to what degree song's title was literal and metaphoric, West replied, \"Oh yeah, I've thought about killing myself all the time. It's always an option and [expletive]. Like Louis C.K. said, I flip through the manual. I weigh all the options. I'm just having this epiphany now because I didn't do it, but I did think it all the way through. But if I didn't think it all the way through, then it's actually maybe more of a chance of it happening.\" On June 14, 2018, West posted a tweet that indicated his thoughts linked to the song were about killing his ego, and West revealed that without his ego he is \"Just Ye,\" giving potential context into why West titled his album as such. West's wife Kim Kardashian posted a photo to her Instagram with the caption \"I thought about killing you\" on August 15, though did not directly reference him. The original version of the song contains an uncredited sample from \"Fr3sh\", as performed by Kareem Lotfy. Bill Kouligas, head of Lotfy's label PAN, criticized West for the unlicensed sample and indicated intent to pursue legal action, saying \"It's sadly another case of an artist who capitalizes on culture without any original ideas\" and calling West \"the ultimate narcissist.\" Francis and the Lights, who produced the track with West, took responsibility for the sampling and apologized, saying that he would be \"reaching out\" to rectify the issue and that the sample was added \"at the last minute.\" On November 7, 2018, an alternative version of the album on streaming services revealed the song with its sample removed and the beat revised. On the night of the album's premiere, West said that specific lyrics had been cut from it after his controversial interview with TMZ in which he made comments about slavery. On June 7, 2018, six days after the release of Ye, the clean version of \"I Thought About Killing You\" had the lyric \"Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave\" added at approximately three minutes and 30 seconds into the song in reference to those comments. The line has not been added to the explicit version of the song."

At precisely two minutes and 20 seconds into the song, West begins to rap after having delivered spoken word and soft drums kick in at this point. When rapping, West mispronounces \"cache\" as \"cash-ay\" at one point, which may have been purposeful due to his history with neologisms.

In a highly positive review, Christopher Hooton from The Independent analysed the song as something that \"has shades of the Kanye genius of yore, showing the instinctive command of melody of a musical aesthete who builds momentum in a song like no other\" and Hooton also praised the beat switch, noting it as being addictive. Douglas Greenwood of NME described the song's position on the album as being \"a bold opener lyrically\" and what is \"made even darker by the fact he seems to abandons the song's style two thirds of the way through,\" with Greenwood viewing it as becoming a totally new track after the style is abandoned by West. Reviewing Ye for Exclaim!, Kyle Mullin viewed the song's vocal effects employed by West \"that help him evoke the myriad voices that ring in a deranged mind\" as being one of the \"moments devoted to mental health\" that truly give the album a purpose. In response to West's performance, Zachary Hoskins from Slant Magazine wrote \"'Sometimes I think really bad things,' he confesses on the stark, harrowing opener 'I Thought About Killing You,' his voice dipping into an artificial chopped-and-screwed baritone. 'Really, really, really bad things.'\" Courtney E. Smith of Refinery29 viewed the song as \"a track punctuated by screams that deals with heavy themes of death and violence\" and described it as feeling \"eerie to listen to these dark thoughts next to that dark production from Mike Dean,\" looking at Dean's production as combining synths and dirty bass, while claiming that the gloom should be attributed \"to West (think of Bey's 'Partition' verses West's 'Monster,' which encapsulate the different directions in which an artist can push Dean's signature sound).\" Alexis Petridis was more mixed in The Guardian, claiming that despite there being \"something audacious about the way 'I Thought About Killing You' suddenly turns into a completely different track three-quarters of the way through, neither of its two contrasting parts are anything to write home about.\" The staff of XXL noted West's \"series of spoken word phrases\" within the track for being repetitive, while claiming that the phrases are succeeded by him \"launching into a completely unrelated rap that offers no real payoff\" and cited the track as an example of \"waiting for moments of enlightenment or engagement that ultimately never arrive\" on Ye. In reference to the lyrics \"Sometimes I think bad things... Really, really, really bad things,\" Andrew Barker of Variety criticized the album's \"emotional trajectory\" for being \"fairly obvious, beginning with West at his lowest\" and slammed the song as \"his pitch shifting ever downward to a woozy, demonic register.\" In Consequence of Sound, Wren Graves claimed that \"some of that Life of Pablo rambling starts to creep in\" when the first two minutes of the track \"feel repetitive after just a few listens.\" Ross Horton from The Line of Best Fit characterized the track as \"comically bad\" and being \"an interesting, sinister concept that is executed in so poorly that you begin to question where the record is going.\""

The couple adopts the child and names him Brandon. They hide the spaceship in their barn to conceal the truth from him. 12 years later, in 2018, the ship begins transmitting an alien message, causing Brandon to sleepwalk to the barn. He tries to open the cellar, but Tori intervenes. Brandon begins to exhibit superhuman powers. One day during a trust exercise in PE, Brandon falls toward a girl in his class named Caitlyn Connor; she lets him drop to the ground and accuses him of being a pervert, having previously seen him in her room at night. Caitlyn is forced to help Brandon up, and Brandon, frustrated by her accusation, crushes her hand. That night, Brandon sleepwalks once again to the ship and breaks into the barn where it is hidden. Tori follows and sees him levitating, chanting the ship's message: \"Take the world.\" Tori reveals the truth of his origin, and Brandon goes on a rampage, killing Erika Connor, Caitlyn's mother, after Erika expressed displeasure towards him because he broke Caitlyn's hand. Police find a series of runes drawn on a window while investigating Erika's disappearance. The next day, Brandon kills his uncle Noah by lifting and dropping his vehicle. The following morning, Tori and Kyle inform Brandon of Noah's death, but Brandon shows no emotion or empathy, angering them both. Kyle accuses Brandon of murder and grabs him, and Brandon retaliates by violently shoving him. Kyle finds Brandon's blood-stained shirt and shows it to Tori, but she refuses to believe it. Kyle takes Brandon on a father-son hunting trip in the woods. Kyle attempts to shoot and kill Brandon with his hunting rifle, but the execution fails when the bullet bounces off the back of Brandon's head. Realizing what Kyle has just tried to do, Brandon chases him and kills him with heat vision. A sheriff arrives at the Breyers' and asks to see Brandon. Tori tells the sheriff that Kyle and Brandon are not home, so he shows Tori the symbol found at the scenes of Erika's and Noah's deaths. Tori finds Brandon's notebook with drawings of his murders and his message to \"take the world\" and begins to believe Kyle. She tries calling Kyle, but Brandon answers and implies he is now coming for her. Brandon returns and begins destroying the house, easily killing all cops who come to the rescue. Remembering that the ship can injure Brandon, Tori runs to the barn and discovers Erika's eviscerated body. As Brandon pursues her, Tori tries to tell him about how much she loves him. She then tries to stab him with a piece of the ship, but Brandon sees it coming and avoids it. In retaliation, Brandon flies Tori miles into the sky above the clouds and drops her to her death, just as an airplane approaches. The next day, the airplane is revealed to have mysteriously crashed into the farmhouse (and the spaceship, Brandon's only known weakness, presumably destroyed), with the news reporting that everyone on board was killed and that Brandon was the only survivor. During the credits, Brandon begins his worldwide attacks, which news reports cover. Brandon is also dubbed \"Brightburn\" by the media. A conspiracy theorist named Big T discusses the Brightburn incident and the existence of other super-powered beings, pleading with humanity to take action."

On December 8, 2018, the first trailer for Brightburn was released online. Critics viewed the trailer as an \"Ultraman horror movie\" due to the intentional similarities to Superman's origin story and as a deconstruction of the character. Fast Company stated that \"although it's not officially a Superman movie, it walks viewers through every step of Clark Kent's origin story before taking a hard left turn\". On April 3, 2019, an art contest was launched after the release of the trailer to promote the film, and had concluded on May 20. The winners of the contest had their artworks used in marketing for the film, and received $2,000. On May 21, 2019, IGN promoted the film by uploading a prank of unsuspecting volunteers with the character Brandon Breyer. It was uploaded to their website and YouTube channel. Another art contest was launched on August 5 to promote the home media release of the film titled \"Band with Brightburn\".

Frank Scheck\u00a0of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"While not exactly original, the premise is certainly effective enough. But Brightburn lacks the visual stylization or wit to elevate it from the realm of the crudely effective B-movie.\" James White from Empire wrote, \"Crossbreeding superhero tropes with horror staples was an idea laden with promise. Brightburn is enlivened by trademark James Gunn black comedy, but hamstrung by sketchy writing and a botched sense of dread.\" Alex Arabian from The Playlist wrote, \"The film is a gem, especially for anyone yearning for a superhero film that gleefully torches the familiar 'good versus evil' formula and introduces far more sinister sensibilities.\" Ed Gonzalez from Slant\u00a0also gave a negative review, \"The way the film shuttles through its 90 minutes, it\u2019s as if it\u2019s been stripped of its most crucial narrative parts.\""

In June 2019, producer James Gunn stated that discussion of the sequel was happening, but he was busy writing and directing The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. In August 2019, actor Jackson A. Dunn stated in an interview with Screen Rant that he would be interested in reprising his role as Brandon Breyer. In addition, Dunn said that he would like that future films cast up-and-coming actors in the lead roles."

        "content": "\"Save Your Tears\" received universal acclaim. Billboard hailed the song as the best track on After Hours, stating: \"Although 'Save Your Tears' is one of the most pop-driven songs on the album, the Weeknd doesn't hold back when it comes to the rather cold nature he usually finds himself adopting when it comes to his lovers. The production remains upbeat and steady the entire time, thanks to work from Max Martin, Oscar Holter, DaHeala, and The Weeknd himself, combining the best of his old content and some newer, more mainstream-driven sounds\". Craig Jenkins of Vulture raved, \"The Weeknd perfects the kitschy '80s genre experiment with 'Save Your Tears', a gutting breakup tune gorgeous and simple enough to stand alongside peak '80s pop like the Cars' 'You Might Think' (and slick enough to swipe a bit of melody from Wham!'s 'Everything She Wants' in the chorus). The piece concocts sound informed by both trap and dance music, encased in dense atmospherics, and heavy on crisp, bright keys\". \"'Save Your Tears' has both tonal echoes of Depeche Mode's melancholy and a nod to 'Everything She Wants' by Wham!, exhibiting shimmery mid-80s luxuriance\", praised The New York Times editor Jon Caramanica. Slant columnist Seth Wilson observed, \"'Save Your Tears' revels in spite, flaunting how over-it Tesfaye is in front of his ex while teasing the possibility of reconciliation. Tesfaye's distinct brand of R&B consistently draws from other genres, but hearing him embrace a straight-up synth-rock sound here is an exciting change of pace\". \"He draws on synth-pop nostalgia to mirror the tragic glitz of '80s Hollywood: the plinking synths and slick hand-claps of 'Save Your Tears' evokes a long-lost Wham! track. His bleeding-heart melodies and unforgettable hooks remind us why we keep listening to the '80s first place\", exclaimed Pitchfork writer Isabella Herrera. Jem Aswad of Variety commented, \"'Save Your Tears', which could have been an MTV staple in the early '80s, is begging for period-appropriate videos. The record has thwacking electronic percussion and the vocoder hearkening back to Electric Light Orchestra's 'Mr. Blue Sky'\". Mark Richardson from The Wall Street Journal asserted that \"'Save Your Tears' includes soaring melodies that provide ample opportunity for Mr. Tesfaye to show off his vocal range, being used on television singing competitions. By design, it is big and broad, less specific lyrically and further from the shadowy persona at the heart of the Weeknd\u2014Mr. Tesfaye often seems downright affable here. Mr. Martin and the Weeknd show the influence of 1980s synth pop. The piece sounds like something from a John Hughes soundtrack\". Michael Cragg from Vogue UK praised the record as \"the sort of synth experimentation last heard in 1984 on The NeverEnding Story soundtrack\". GQs Zak Maoui applauded \"Save Your Tears\" as one of the Weeknd's \"best musical offerings to date\". Apple Music applauded the composition, \"Few things about 'Save Your Tears' mark it as a breakup song: For one, the production is drenched in bright, '80s-style synths that sound more glamorous than forlorn. Yet the Weeknd manages to imbue the single with a sense of heartbroken remorse, a rare emotion in his arsenal. Many came to love him through his more shadowy offerings, but there's no denying the power he brings to the nostalgic, splashy pop style he exhibits here\"."

It was released the following day. Directed by Cliqua, the video sees the Weeknd wearing a diamond-adorned version of his original red-jacketed outfit. The bruises on his face are no longer present, although his character has apparently undergone a bizarre plastic surgery. He performs in a lavish nightclub occupied by formally attired members wearing glittery, full-face masks that pay homage to scenes from Stanley Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut; his backing band is also wearing masks. He wanders out into the motionless, seated crowd, guzzling one person's champagne and laying his arm on the head of another, until he notices a gorgeously brilliant, maskless woman in the audience (played by Bianca Rojas) and guides her onstage. While they initially are dancing joyfully, the camera soon reveals that the Weeknd is hiding a pistol behind his back. The lights go out and when the lights are turned back on, the Weeknd has placed his gun in one of her hands with him pointing the gun at his own head. The woman realizes this and shrieks. The scene concludes with the Weeknd holding the pistol to his own head. As the song finishes, he pulls the trigger, releasing confetti. The assembly applauds enthusiastically."

The TikTok video for \"Fancy Like\" has received more than 2.4 million likes and 23,000 comments, and became a popular meme which led to the song becoming a viral hit. In an interview with CMT, he said: \"It's nice to know when you put out something that honestly, I just wrote about my family. There's no pretentiousness there. It's just who we are. When you get to be that honest and the public reacts, it's a real magical thing. And the dances, that's just me being a dad. I mean, that's just how we roll around here.\""
