His vocals were recorded on weekends when he received permission to leave a mental hospital he was staying in at the time for treatment of his long-standing heroin addiction.The original 1975 \"demo\" mix of the album remains unheard, with the exception of three tracks which have been released on various compilations (including A Million in Prizes: The Anthology and Original Punks): \"Johanna\", \"Consolation Prizes\" and \"Kill City\". These tracks sound markedly different from those on the final version of the album, with different guitar parts and, in the case of \"Johanna\", no saxophone.\nPop biographer Paul Trynka said that rock writer Ben Edmonds \"played the first mixes to Seymour Stein in late January 1975\"."

        "content": "There would be no takers for the album until 1977 when, following the success of Pop's solo albums The Idiot and Lust for Life, Williamson got an advance from Bomp! to release the album, some of which was used to fund studio time to finish off the original recordings by adding overdubs and remixing.The master tapes were lost shortly after the release of the original album and all subsequent CD releases were mastered from the original poor quality green vinyl pressing. This partly accounts for the somewhat muddy sound of the album.\nPop appeared as himself, performing the album's title track, on the \"For Cryin' Out Loud\" episode of the Tales from the Crypt TV series, aired on May 22, 1990.In 2010, Williamson and engineer Ed Cherney remixed the album once more from the original multitracks. The resulting mixes formed a new version of the album, released on Bomp! on October 19, 2010."

Sothcott said, \"My model works through a series of minimum guarantees from distributors so that, on paper at least, my films are in profit before they are even released. The distributors know that, from my track record, I will deliver a certain type of film in a certain type of genre on time and on budget.\" Sothcott said that the main criticism has to do with the strippers not stripping enough. Robert Englund, Steven Berkoff, Lysette Anthony, and Sarah Douglas have cameo appearances. The film opens with the song \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" by Duran Duran, but the rendition was played by the band Wild Moon. Despite the title, there is no stripping in the film although there are characters dancing somewhat erotically. The film was released on Blu-ray with a commentary by the producers and 11 minutes of behind the scenes footage. Inside Pulse reviewer Mike Noyes said, \"Most of the film is shot very well, sometimes not so much. But good or bad, the transfer always looks great and the sound is great too.\" It was also released on DVD."

        "content": "Raman Raghav 2.0 (released internationally as Psycho Raman) is a 2016 Indian neo-noir psychological crime thriller film directed by Anurag Kashyap. Produced by Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Vikas Bahl, and Madhu Mantena, the film stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vicky Kaushal, and debutante Sobhita Dhulipala. It depicts in eight chapters the cat and mouse chase of serial killer Ramanna (Siddiqui) by corrupt cop Raghavan (Kaushal). Real-life killer Raman Raghav, who operated in Mumbai during the 1960s, inspired the film.\nKashyap initially wanted to make a period film about Raman Raghav, but after the commercial failure of Bombay Velvet (2015), his previous film that was also set in the 1960s, he realized that he would be unable to find financing. Abandoning the period-piece concept, he co-wrote the film with Vasan Bala, setting it in the contemporary time. The film's music was composed by Ram Sampath, and Varun Grover wrote the lyrics. Jay Oza served as the film's cinematographer and Aarti Bajaj as its editor.\nRaman Raghav 2.0 premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. It also screened at the 2016 Sydney Film Festival, the Singapore International Film Festival, the Fantasia International Film Festival, Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival, and the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. The film was released in India on 24 June 2016, received universal critical acclaim, and proved to be a moderate commercial success, grossing over \u20b970 million (US$1.1 million)."

However, his plan to purchase drugs is foiled\u2014the dealer and another man have been murdered. Investigating the murders the next day, he receives a hammer followed by an anonymous phone call.\nIn 2015, a man named Ramanna surrenders to the police and confesses to killing nine people. He is detained and beaten by the police but manages to escape with the help of a group of boys nearby. Seeking food at the home of his sister Lakshmi, Ramanna argues with his brother-in-law. After leaving the house he quickly returns and kills the couple and their son. Raghavan is among the police who later investigated the family's murder, where he finds a picture of Ramanna with Lakshmi, confirming Ramanna's involvement in the crime.\nRaghavan is in a relationship with Smrutika \"Simi\" Naidu, but he is an abusive partner: he beats her and has forced her to have three abortions. Ramanna surveils Raghavan and Simi, suggesting a link exists between the cop and the killer. This surveillance escalates into more murders when Ramanna stalks and kills Simi's maid and her husband. After these killings, Ramanna is caught by the police with assistance from an onlooker. However, Ramanna escapes from custody again and kills the man who aided his capture. Raghavan proves to be a killer himself when, after a trip to visit his father, he murders an African drug dealer.\nThat evening Raghavan picks up a woman named Ankita at a nightclub and brings her to Simi's house. Incapacitated by drug use, Raghavan is unable to perform sexually, prompting mockery from Ankita. In response he assaults her. Still enraged, he searches for the stash of drugs he keeps at the house but is unable to find it. In this state he confronts Simi and they argue. When Simi demands he leave with Ankita, he strikes Simi; her head hits a glass table killing her instantly.\nAnkita locks herself in the bathroom and tries to call for help, but desists when Raghavan threatens and coerces her. He then clears away incriminating evidence and arranges the scene to implicate Ramanna for the murder. He retrieves a tyre iron similar to Ramanna's favored murder weapon and smashes Simi's head with it. During these preparations, Ankita escapes.\nThe next day Ramanna surrenders to Raghavan and claims a deep connection with him: each man is the missing half of the other. Ramanna also reveals his role in the two 2013 murders that opened the film and initiated this connection. He confesses to one of the killings but witnessed Raghavan kill the other man, and thus began his surveillance of the policeman. Ramanna offers to accept the charge for Simi's murder, but only if Raghavan will kill the eyewitness, Ankita. In the final scene Raghavan's descent into evil matches Ramanna's when he murders Ankita in her home."

Hancock was approached to collaborate on this recording that would go towards a postmodern direction, instead of his usual jazz-fusion. The result was a hip-hop influenced album, released under Hancock's name, which combined Hancock's keyboard playing with Laswell's arrangements and Grand Mixer DXT's turntablism.\nAccording to 1999 re-issue's liner notes, when Laswell went to buy speakers at a music equipment store he would insist on testing them by playing the demos of \"Rockit\" and \"Earth Beat\". While those songs were played through the speakers, passing by customers apparently liked what they heard and danced to the music. Soon after Laswell let Hancock know about the incident, eventually telling him \u2013 \"We got something good here.\"\nFuture Shock is the title name from Hancock's remake of the Curtis Mayfield song from ten years earlier, also featured here.\n\"Rockit\", the album's big hit, was accompanied by one of the most successful music videos of the era. The video, directed by Godley and Creme of 10cc fame, featured dancing robots made by Jim Whiting, moving around to the beat of the music and the turntable scratching. Hancock won several MTV Music Video awards in 1984, as well as the Grammy award for best R&B performance.\nThe album's cover art was derived from \"Approach\", a work created by David Em."

Small thanks to Herbie, lots to Material and Grand Mixer D.ST, it's the best novelty instrumental in years and the best pop of Hancock's life. Elsewhere various bright ideas, such as Pete Cosey, are obscured by the usual aura of set-piece dink \u2014 jumpy enough and often fun, but fusoid nevertheless.\" Richard S. Ginell of AllMusic wrote how \"Herbie Hancock completely overhauled his sound and conquered MTV with his most radical step forward since the sextet days. He brought in Bill Laswell of Material as producer, along with Grand Mixer D.ST on turntables\u2014and the immediate result was \"Rockit,\" which makes quite a post-industrial metallic racket. Frankly, the whole record is an enigma; for all of its dehumanized, mechanized textures and rigid rhythms, it has a vitality and sense of humor that make it difficult to turn off. Moreover, Herbie can't help but inject a subversive funk element when he comps along to the techno beat\u2014and yes, some real, honest-to-goodness jazz licks on a grand piano show up in the middle of \"Auto Drive.\""

Released on the Gordy (Motown) label, and produced by Norman Whitfield, it features on the group's 1971 album, Sky's the Limit. When released as a single, \"Just My Imagination\" became the third Temptations song to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. The single held the number one position on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart for two weeks in 1971, from March 28 to April 10. \"Just My Imagination\" also held the number one spot on the Billboard R&B Singles chart for three weeks, from February 27 to March 20 of that year.Today, \"Just My Imagination\" is considered one of the Temptations' signature songs, and is notable for recalling the sound of the group's 1960s recordings. It is also the final Temptations single to feature founding members Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. During the process of recording and releasing the single, Kendricks left the group to begin a solo career, while the ailing Williams was forced to retire from the act for health reasons. In 2010, Rolling Stone magazine listed \"Just My Imagination\" as number 399 on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time but exited after the 2021 update. The song was covered by the Rolling Stones on their Some Girls album in 1978."

        "content": "A full orchestral arrangement with strings and French horns adorning a bluesy rhythm track and bass line provides the instrumentals. Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of allmusic notes that the song is narrated by a man who imagines a relationship with the woman he loves, is canny enough to realize that his daydreams are fiction, yet is overwhelmed by them. The lyrics capture his resignation to his fantasies. The song as a whole captures their full emotional effect on him. The first two verses establish the theme and explore the narrator's daydreams, in which he and the object of his affections are lovers preparing to be married, to \"raise a family\" and build \"a cozy little home / out in the country / with two children, maybe three\". In the bridge, the narrator prays that he will never lose her love to another, or he will \"surely die\". By introducing this doubt, the musical bridge simultaneously connects the movement from dream to reality, completed when the final lines shift from imagery to bald statement: \"But in reality / she doesn't even know me\". For Erlewine, \"the Temptations' performance has a dream-like quality, quietly drifting through the singer's hopes and desires.\""

By 1970, the Temptations had released psychedelically influenced hits such as \"Runaway Child, Running Wild\", \"Psychedelic Shack\", \"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)\", and the Grammy Award-winning \"Cloud Nine\". In a 1991 interview, Eddie Kendricks recalled that many of the Temptations' fans were \"screaming bloody murder\" after the group delved into psychedelia, and demanded a return to their original soul sound.\"Just My Imagination\" was the result of one of the few times that Whitfield relented and produced a ballad as a single for the group. Whitfield and Strong wrote the song in 1969, but with the Temptations' psychedelic soul singles consistently keeping them in the US Top 20, Whitfield and Strong decided to shelve the composition and wait for the right time to record it. In late 1970, the Temptations' single \"Ungena Za Ulimwengu (Unite the World)\", a psychedelic soul song about world peace, failed to reach the Top 30, and Whitfield decided to record and release \"Just My Imagination\" as the next single. He approached Barrett Strong, and asked him to pull out \"that song we were messing around with a year ago... because I'm going to record it today.\" Except for their late 1960s duets with Diana Ross & the Supremes, the Temptations had not released a single that was not based in psychedelia since \"Please Return Your Love to Me\" from The Temptations Wish It Would Rain in 1968."

        "content": "Norman Whitfield began the recording of \"Just My Imagination\" by preparing the song's instrumental track. Whitfield arranged and recorded the non-orchestral elements of the instrumental with Motown's studio band, The Funk Brothers, who for this recording included Eddie Willis and Dennis Coffey on guitar, Jack Ashford on marimba, Jack Brokensha on timpani, Andrew Smith on drums, and Bob Babbitt on bass. Jerry Long, an arranger who had previous experience with scoring films in Paris, worked on the orchestral arrangement and conducted several members of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra in performing the horns and strings for the recording. The Temptations had heard the Funk Brothers' tracks and loved them, but were \"totally knocked out\", according to Otis Williams, when they heard \"the finished record with all the strings\".The Temptations added their vocals at Motown's Hitsville USA headquarters. While all five Temptations usually sang lead on singles during the psychedelic soul era, \"Just My Imagination\" is primarily a showcase for Eddie Kendricks, who sang lead on such Temptations hits as \"Get Ready,\" \"The Way You Do the Things You Do,\" and \"You're My Everything\"; in fact, this is the only Temptations hit in which Dennis Edwards did not have a lead vocal during his entire tenure with the group. The Temptations remained at Hitsville overnight recording \"Just My Imagination,\" and while the other four members went home at six o'clock in the morning, Kendricks remained in the studio, spending several additional hours recording takes for his lead vocal.\nThe song was recorded in the midst of a bitter feud between Kendricks and the Temptations' de facto leader, Otis Williams. Dissatisfied and frustrated with Williams' leadership, Kendricks began to withdraw from the group, and picked several fights with either Williams or his best friend, bass singer Melvin Franklin. When Kendricks told his friend ex-Temptation David Ruffin about his problems in the group, Ruffin convinced Kendricks that he should begin a solo career. After a final altercation during a November 1970 Copacabana engagement, both Kendricks and Williams agreed that it would be best for Kendricks to leave the group. By the time \"Just My Imagination\" was recorded, Williams and Kendricks were no longer on friendly speaking terms. Nevertheless, Williams was impressed by Kendricks' performance on the recording, and in his 1988 Temptations biography referred to \"Just My Imagination\" as \"Eddie's finest moment\".Paul Williams, the Temptations' original lead singer and Kendricks' lifelong best friend, who sings the first line in the bridge (\"Every night, on my knees, I pray...\"), had suffered for three years from health problems related to alcoholism and sickle-cell disease. By the time \"Just My Imagination\" was cut, Paul Williams' contributions to the Temptations' recordings had been reduced, and the group had Otis Williams' old associate Richard Street lined up as Paul Williams' replacement. As for Kendricks, he was eventually replaced by Damon Harris, who would be featured in the group's 1972 hit \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\"."

        "content": "Motown released \"Just My Imagination\" as a single on their Gordy label on January 14, 1971, with the up-tempo psychedelic soul song \"You Make Your Own Heaven and Hell Right Here on Earth\", from the 1970 Psychedelic Shack LP, as the B-side. The Temptations performed \"Just My Imagination\" and \"Get Ready\" for their final appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, broadcast live on January 31. On-screen, for \"Get Ready\" Kendricks stood several feet away from the other Temptations, and made little eye contact with them, and for \"\"Just My Imagination\" sat on a separate piece of staging; Otis Williams later remarked that one could see the group was no longer a complete unit:\n\nBut there was such a bittersweet feeling. Eddie had really changed. Paul was on his last legs. Watch the clip of us doing the song on Ed Sullivan we're not together. Eddie is off by himself. There was no more group. Sure enough, when we played the Copa that week, Eddie left between shows. He didn't come back.\nCash Box described the song as The Temptations' \"softest single performance in recent time,\" stating that it is \"exceptional material for markets that generally overlook the team's material.\"On February 7, 1971, \"Just My Imagination\" entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 71 and later number one on both the Hot 100 and the U.S. Billboard R&B Singles charts. It also became the group's first entry on the Adult Contemporary chart, reaching number 33; the group would not return to that chart until 1984.The single was included along with \"Unite the World\" on the Temptations' ninth regular studio album, Sky's the Limit, which included the final Temptations recordings to feature Eddie Kendricks. He began working on his solo album All By Myself shortly before officially leaving the group.The intended follow-up to \"Just My Imagination\" was \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\", on which Kendricks sang lead. When Kendricks left, they released, instead, \"I'm the Exception to the Rule\", a song in the same vein (featuring Kendricks, Otis Williams and Edwards on lead) which follows \"Just My Imagination\" on the album. Unable to promote the song because they did not have anyone to do his parts in concert, the song failed miserably so the company pushed the \"B-side\" \u2013 the group's re-recording of \"It's Summer\", initially the B-side of \"Ball of Confusion\", at the last-minute, and Norman Whitfield had The Undisputed Truth record \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\", for whom it was a major hit. The Temptations and Norman Whitfield returned to psychedelic soul for their next album, Solid Rock, whose second single, \"Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)\", was written by Whitfield and Barrett Strong as an alleged criticism of both Kendricks and David Ruffin."

From the time the first Paradise Lost film was released in 1996, a growing number of supporters began to protest the innocence of the West Memphis Three.Much like the Paradise Lost films, West of Memphis chronicles the history of the imprisoned men all the way up to their release in 2011 through interviews conducted with lawyers, judges, journalists, family members, witnesses, and the West Memphis Three themselves. West of Memphis focuses on Terry Hobbs, stepfather of Stevie Branch (one of the murder victims), as a potential suspect, due to physical evidence linking him to the crime, a history of violent behavior, and his lack of an alibi for the time the murders were committed, as well as damaging statements made by his ex-wife, former neighbors, and, most recently, his own nephew, who claims Hobbs confessed to him. The film reveals that, inexplicably, Hobbs was not interviewed by police at the time of the murders."

He wrote that director Amy Berg \"has a dramatist's eye for what was irretrievably lost \u2014 the innocent lives of the children, plus 18 years of three other innocent lives. And she saw, equally well, what was there to be gained: dramatic new insights into an inexorable progression from random arrests through groundless supposition, fevered conjecture and flagrant perjury to official disgrace in a supposedly airtight case.\"Film critic Philip French of The Observer called West of Memphis \"riveting\", and a \"shocking indictment of the American criminal justice system and a tribute to the dedication of selfless civil rights lawyers and their supporters from all over the world\".Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \"A\u2212\" and wrote that it \"casts a hypnotic spell all its own. It artfully sketches out the events for anyone who's coming in cold, but basically, its strategy is to take what we already know and go deeper. [...] West of Memphis goes after another possible suspect, Terry Hobbs, who was stepfather to one of the victims and who has denied any involvement. In doing so, the film reframes the story's terrible darkness, even if it can't give us the closure we hunger for.\"Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a perfect four star rating, writing: \"Do we need a fourth film? Yes, I think we do. If you only see one of them, this is the one to choose, because it has the benefit of hindsight.\""

His second son, Sibi, is an alcoholic, but a normal guy struggling to get out of his father's stranglehold. He rebels once in a while but is incompetent and lazy to go his own way. Mathukutty's only daughter, Annie, is a nymphomaniac, who has no feelings for her husband Andrews or daughter. Her husband is fed up with her wayward lifestyle. Annie comes to live with her maternal family every month, in the pretense of some fight with her husband, so that she can sleep with Mathukutty's henchman and rubber employee, Unnunni. Mathukutty and Koshy are not aware of Annie's wayward lifestyle and think their son-in-law is unduly suspicious by nature. They mince no words while chastising Annie's husband for being the guilty party in the marriage. Koshy even roughs him up when Andrews refuses to come for a reconciliation meeting.\nMathukkutty's youngest son, Baby, is an engineering student. At college, he fantasises about murder and gushing blood. He shows early signs of antisocial behaviors which manifests itself when ragging a junior (freshman). He strangles a junior student with an electric wire. Baby is suspended from the college and returns home. The junior student is admitted to the hospital in a serious condition. His family gets to know of the incident through a newspaper article and dismisses it as a ragging incident gone bad. Baby always keeps the electric wire in his bag as a memento of the incident. Baby is a marijuana addict and shows no alarming outward symptoms of his mental illness. His uncle, Bishop, senses something wrong with his nephew and cannot get through to him.\nBaby observes Annie's affair with Unnunni and decides to murder him. He manages to strangle Ununni to death at the tools shed where Unnunni and Annie meet up. Baby hangs the body to stage a suicide. Upon discovering the body, the family disposes of the body to avoid any police investigation into the unnatural death.\nBaby has violent dreams, constantly plays with his father's rifle, and imagines murdering Annie, multiple times, using his electric wire and gun. He likes Nirmala, a village girl from a poor family. Nirmala, a young teenager, keeps him interested and even makes love to him under the shade of coffee shrubs in broad daylight. She loves Baby but is well aware of the caste and class divide between them. Nirmala gets engaged to a local shop owner, Balan. She ends the relationship with Baby. Baby murders Balan by strangling him with his preferred weapon, the electric wire. The murder goes unsolved as Baby removes money from the shop making it look like a robbery gone bad.\nNirmala believes that Baby is behind Balan's death and confronts him when they meet at the river. Baby tries to kill her as well, but Nirmala escapes without knowing his intention. Nirmala's mother fixes her wedding to Raghavan, a rubber tapper and Baby's friend. Baby tries to strangle Raghavan too, but fails in his attempt. Raghavan sees Baby's face when the mask he was wearing comes out and reports it to the police. The cops start searching for Baby, who goes into hiding. While his family tries to find him, he suddenly appears with a revolver. He shoots at Koshy, who confronts him, and his father when he shouts at him to stop. Mathukutty escapes the shot, but Koshy is hit though not fatally. While the scuffle is going on, Baby is shot dead by Mathukkutty, using his rifle.

        "content": "Singin' in the Rain is a 1952 American musical romantic comedy film directed and choreographed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, starring Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds and featuring Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell and Cyd Charisse. It offers a lighthearted depiction of Hollywood in the late 1920s, with the three stars portraying performers caught up in the transition from silent films to \"talkies\".\nThe film was only a modest hit when it was first released. O'Connor won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and Betty Comden and Adolph Green won the Writers Guild of America Award for their screenplay, while Jean Hagen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. However, it has since been accorded legendary status by contemporary critics, and is often regarded as the greatest musical film ever made and one of the greatest films ever made, as well as the greatest film made in the \"Freed Unit\" at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It topped the AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals list and is ranked as the fifth-greatest American motion picture of all time in its updated list of the greatest American films in 2007.\nIn 1989, Singin' in the Rain was one of the first 25 films selected by the United States Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2005, the British Film Institute included it in its list of the 50 films to be seen by the age of 14. In 2008, Empire magazine ranked it as the eighth-best film of all time. In Sight & Sound magazine's 2022 list of the greatest films of all time, Singin' in the Rain placed 10th."

        "content": "In 1927, silent film stars Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont attend the premiere of their latest film, The Royal Rascal. Film studio Monumental Pictures encourages rumors of a romance between Don and Lina. Don dislikes the rumors and barely tolerates Lina, but Lina believes Don loves her. At a red-carpet interview, Don tells the story of his rise to stardom. Don says he grew up cultured and highly educated, but his words are contradicted by flashbacks showing his humble roots as a hoofer, vaudeville musician and stuntman, alongside his childhood best friend, Cosmo Brown (\"Fit as a Fiddle\").\nAfter the premiere, Don escapes a mob of his fans by jumping into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden. Kathy, who claims to be a theater actress, drives Don to the premiere's afterparty, but expresses disdain for the art of film acting. At the afterparty, Monumental Pictures head R. F. Simpson shows a short demonstration of the newfound talking picture. His guests are unimpressed and assume talking pictures will be a fad. Kathy is then revealed to be a chorus girl hired to perform at the party (\"All I Do is Dream of You\"). Furious at Don's teasing, she throws a cake at him, but he dodges it and the cake hits Lina. Kathy runs away before Don can catch up with her.\nThree weeks later, Don has fallen in love with Kathy but cannot find her. Cosmo tries to cheer Don up (\"Make 'Em Laugh\"). Lina reveals that she got Kathy fired. On the studio lot, Cosmo finds Kathy working as an extra in another Monumental Pictures production (\"Beautiful Girl\"). Kathy admits to actually being a fan of Don's, while Don professes his feelings for her (\"You Were Meant for Me\").\n\nRival studio Warner Bros. releases its first talking picture, The Jazz Singer, to wide acclaim. R. F. decides he has no choice but to convert the next Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie; Lina and Don undertake elocution lessons in preparation (\"Moses Supposes\"). The production is beset with difficulties, most notably Lina's grating, high-pitched voice and the actors being unfamiliar with the recording technology. Due to multiple complications (including awkward microphone placements, Don's uninspired improvising and the audio going out of sync), The Dueling Cavalier's preview screening is a failure.\nAfterward, Kathy and Cosmo suggest The Dueling Cavalier be turned into a musical (\"Good Morning\"). Cosmo, inspired by the film's synchronization error, suggests Kathy should dub Lina's voice. Don happily agrees. Don takes Kathy home, then dances through her neighborhood in the rain (\"Singin' in the Rain\"). Don and Cosmo pitch their idea to R. F., changing the title of the film to The Dancing Cavalier and adding a modern framing device. R. F. approves but tells them not to inform Lina of Kathy's involvement.\nHaving learned the truth, a furious Lina barges in on a dubbing session. She becomes even angrier after being told that Don and Kathy are in love, and that R. F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity buildup. Lina threatens to sue R. F. unless he makes sure no one ever hears of Kathy and that she keeps dubbing Lina for the rest of her career. R. F. reluctantly agrees because of a clause in Lina's contract which holds the studio responsible for positive media coverage.\nThe premiere of The Dancing Cavalier is a success (\"Would You\"). When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo, and R. F. tell her to lip sync into a microphone while Kathy, concealed behind the curtain, sings into a second one. While Lina is \"singing\" (\"Singin' in the Rain Reprise\"), Don, Cosmo and R. F. open the curtain, revealing the ruse. The defeated Lina flees in humiliation. Kathy tries to run away as well, but Don proudly announces to the audience that Kathy is \"the real star\" of the film (\"You Are My Lucky Star\"). Some time later, Kathy and Don kiss in front of a billboard for their new film, Singin' in the Rain."

Following the non-album single \"Judge Fudge\", Factory allotted the band a budget of \u00a3150,000 for their next album. After settling on producers Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, both members of Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, Happy Mondays decamped to Blue Wave Studio in Saint Philip, Barbados, in February 1992. The sessions were plagued by a variety of issues, such as frontman Shaun Ryder developing a crack habit and dancer Bez breaking his arm three times. With little finished material and a lack of lyrics, the band returned to the United Kingdom; Ryder was admitted into a detox centre. Recording continued for two weeks in May 1992 at Comfort's Place Studio in Lingfield, Surrey, where Ryder did his vocals. Yes Please! is a soul funk album with a bleak sound that earned it a comparison to Unknown Pleasures (1979) by Joy Division.\nYes Please! received mixed reviews from music critics, a few of whom found it to be uninspired, while others said it had some high points. It peaked at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart, going on to sell 50,000 copies by the end of the year. Happy Mondays toured the UK in October 1992, which was followed by a one-off Japanese show. Factory Records went into administration the next month; the band broke up in early 1993. \"Stinkin' Thinkin'\", released as the lead single from Yes Please! on 31 August 1992, topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in the United States and peaked at number 31 in the UK. \"Sunshine and Love\", released as the album's second single on 9 November 1992, reached number 5 on the Dance Club Songs chart and reached number 62 in the UK."

A public relations representative from the band's label, Factory Records, had to issue a statement on Ryder's behalf, denouncing his drug use. The album was promoted with a UK arena tour, a trek to mainland Europe, and a two-month stint in the United States, ending with a variety of headlining shows and festival appearances in August 1991.Guitarist Mark Day got married as bassist Paul Ryder's marriage was coming to an end, resulting in him and Shaun Ryder doing more heroin. The latter Ryder increased his crack intake, while drummer Gary Whelan began suffering from depression and turned to alcohol. Rehearsals bore no new ideas; a recording session with Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne, producers of Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches, resulted in \"Judge Fudge\" and the unfinished \"Baby Big Head\". While the idea of a new album was suggested, both producers felt that the timing was not right, saying it would descend into chaos due to the state of the band. During this time, the Madchester and baggy scenes had fallen out of popularity as Nirvana released Nevermind (1991), allowing for the success of grunge acts such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. \"Judge Fudge\" was released as a non-album single in November 1991, charting within the UK top 30.Despite Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches being a commercial success, Factory Records was struggling financially. To help alleviate some of it, Factory released Happy Mondays' first live album, titled Live. Factory Records had a distribution and licencing deal with major label London Recordings, which helped to push the visibility of Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches in European countries. A potential buyout from London was threatened if Factory was unable to handle its financial security. Misguided artist development, property investments, and overspent album budgets for Happy Mondays and New Order meant that Factory had little funds left. In an attempt to recoup costs, Happy Mondays manager Nathan McGough and New Order manager Rob Gretton promised Factory founder Tony Wilson that neither of their respective bands' next albums would exceed a budget of \u00a3150,000."

        "content": "Musically, the sound of Yes Please! has been described as soul funk. In his biography of the band, writer Simon Spence said the album's title was the result of the studio manager at Blue Wave Studio answering the phone: \"Happy Mondays... Yes Please!\" Shaun Ryder, on the other hand, said it was a saying their former manager, Phil Saxe, would exclaim in response to questions. He wanted to name it Rubber Lover \"because of the picture of 'Our Lady and baby Jesus' on the sleeve\". In a retrospective piece for The Quietus, writer Ben Cardew compared its bleak nature to Unknown Pleasures (1979) by Joy Division. Unlike that album, which relied on matching its dark lyrics with similar-sounding music, Yes Please! \"pairs words of weary disgust with music that forces the Caribbean surroundings in which the album was recorded through a Manchester funk filter\". Shaun Ryder said he \"kind of gave up\" with the album, letting Paul Ryder and Davis pick the song titles, such as \"Theme from Netto\" and \"Angel\". Machan did programming and sampling, while Bruce Martin provided percussion, as well as additional programming and samples.\"Stinkin' Thinkin'\" details Shaun Ryder's time in rehabilitation. Its title phrase came from an American doctor who treated Ryder: \"Listen, don't be thinking negative thoughts, it's stinking thinking\". Part of the lyrics also deal with the relationships between band members and the state of Factory Records, as well as being lifted from a Brian Eno interview. \"Monkey in the Family\" is a bass-centric track with an electro song arrangement in the style of EMF and Jesus Jones and Arabic vocalizations. Ryder said the lyrics stemmed from Frantz writing down various words and telling him to include as many of them as he could. \"Sunshine and Love\" is driven by Talking Heads-lite percussion, with a gospel-esque chorus section from Rowetta. \"Dustman\" sees Ryder yelling the lyrics incomprehensibly and out of time with the music, which consisted of bongos, scratch guitar playing, and a Hammond organ.\"Angel\" is about visiting a doctor; part of the lyrics were lifted from a newspaper article that quoted Marlene Dietrich. Shaun Ryder wrote \"Cut 'em Loose Bruce\" after hearing a story of a judge letting crack users off scot-free. With the song, Whelan said the band attempted to make darker Caribbean music. \"Theme from Netto\" is an instrumental track \u2013 Ryder claimed \"Netto is Mancunian for Nothing\" \u2013 that Davis wanted to write and is followed by the 1970s disco song \"Love Child\". The final song of the album, \"Cowboy Dave\", was written in reference to Dave Rowbotham, former guitarist of Factory band the Durutti Column, who was murdered by an unknown assailant; the song speculates that the perpetrator was his girlfriend, who discovered his body. The members of Happy Mondays were questioned by the police as they were Factory associates and involved with drugs. Ryder said the lyrics were \"what was said in that police interview, pretty much word for word\"."

The staff at Q said the band was \"back on the case\" and \"against all odds, they've pulled it off again\". The staff at Melody Maker called it \"actually pretty good. At best, we're talking about the oceanic funk of late, late Can; at worst, a typically tropical soundtrack to the Mondays' expensive vacation\". The NME said that despite the band's attitude over the preceding two years, \"they're back again, unflinching and honest and sick after their own shaggy fashion\".For Trouser Press, Doug Brod and Michael Krugman said that due to the rift between Shaun Ryder and his bandmates, the album \"often feels like a document of a band at odds with itself \u2014 the sprightly dance tracks clash with Shaun's deeply bent mindfuck wordiness.\" Doug Iverson of The Blade saw the album as a regression, with the band's energy being compromised by Frantz and Weymouth. Spin's Al Weisel, on the other hand, saw it as a \"kinder, gentler\" release, aided by the band and Frantz and Weymouth sharing a \"similar philosophy: 'Who needs to think when your feet just go?'\" Cardew said it was \"steeped in age and regret, haunted by a 30-year-old Shaun Ryder who surveys the wreckage of his life and doesn't like what he sees.\" In a review for Select, journalist Andrew Harrison saw it as \"so disappointing\", describing it as an \"unwieldy collision of beach-barbie niceness with the products of Shaun Ryder's depraved extracurricular activities\".Yes Please! peaked at number 14 in the UK, selling 30,000 copies in its first week of release. By the end of the year, sales stood at 50,000. The album also charted at number 99 in Australia. \"Stinkin Thinkin\" charted on the US Billboard charts at number 1 on Dance Club Songs, number 15 on Dance Singles Sales, and number 21 on Alternative Airplay. It also appeared at number 31 in the UK. \"Sunshine and Love\" peaked at number 5 on the Dance Club Songs chart in the US and at number 62 in the UK. Yes Please! was included in Pitchfork's 2010 list of \"ten career-killing albums\" of the 1990s."

It features a line-up of Trevor Horn, Anne Dudley, Paul Morley and Lol Creme, along with other appearances from John Hurt, soprano Sally Bradshaw, Rakim, and Donna Lewis. As it had been 10 years since their last album, this album carries a completely different sound to that which had defined their four previous albums. The group blended the music of French impressionist composer Claude Debussy with drum and bass, opera, hip hop, jazz, and narration, to create a concept album which they described as \"the soundtrack to a film that wasn't made about the life of Claude Debussy.\"The album was announced in mid-1998 as being due for release by the end of that year, but did not release until mid-1999. The album was only released on CD and MiniDisc formats. The UK edition was released 28 June 1999, while the US edition was released 29 June 1999. The Japan edition was released 1 December 1999.\nIn the U.S., prior to the retail release of the album, a promotional-only item was sent out in a grey, anti-static zip-lock bag. The polybag contained several sheets of 5x5\" paper listing people and groups who were inspirations; two cardboard cover pockets, one containing the album, and the other an ep titled Sources & Methods with the following five tracks: \"Moments In Love\", \"Close (To The Edit)\", \"(Three Fingers of) Love\", \"Beat Box (Diversion 1)\", and \"A Time For Fear (Who's Afraid)\"."

        "content": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" is a song by American singer Madonna for her seventh studio album, Ray of Light (1998). It was written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, and was produced by the singer with William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was released as the sixth and final single from the album on February 9, 1999, by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records. An electronic dance track on which Madonna experiments with different musical genres, \"Nothing Really Matters\" includes ambient music and electronic noise frequencies that were added by De Vries. Lyrically, the recording delves on the singer's first daughter Lourdes Leon, having also themes of selfishness, affection, and motherhood.\nThe song was critically appreciated for its lyrical content and composition, and was declared by reviewers as one of Madonna's most personal efforts; however, some critics felt it was tepid and lacklustre compared to other tracks from Ray of Light. In the United States, the song remains Madonna's lowest entry on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 93. Its low chart peak was due to lack of airplay and the delay in releasing it in CD single formats, to which the singer's fans protested against Warner Bros. The song became her 23rd number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart, reaching the top spot in Hungary and Spain, and entering the top ten in countries including Canada, Finland, Iceland, Italy, Scotland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Swedish director Johan Renck, and was released on February 13, 1999. Inspired by Arthur Golden's 1997 novel Memoirs of a Geisha, the video portrays Madonna as a geisha, dancing in a small room. The red kimono worn by her in the video was designed by French fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier. It was worn by the singer during her performance of the song at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. \"Nothing Really Matters\" is cited as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. The costume and music video has been cited by journalist and academics as one of Madonna's most iconic and best re-inventions."

        "content": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" was written by Madonna and American producer and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries. The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom she gave birth to in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. \"That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before,\" she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including \"Nothing Really Matters\". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of \"Nothing Really Matters\"'s music. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work for a long time and was pleased with the demo version, which he started to work on.De Vries, who had worked on the demo, asked Orbit to help produce the song, and was enlisted. According to Madonna: Like an Icon writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had originally composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution \"off-putting\", to which the latter confessed, \"On all the collaborations I'd left a lot of space for him, but for this I wanted to put something on the table and say, 'This is what I think'\". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a \"vision on how the song should be finished\". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the \"DAT's broken\". De Vries defended his contribution saying that it was supposed to be \"like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune.\" Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on. In J. Randy Taraborrelli's book Madonna: An Intimate Biography, the singer said that the main inspiration behind \"Nothing Really Matters\" and \"The Power of Good-Bye\" from the same album, was other people judging and dissecting her creative process. Elaborating on the statement, she added,\n\nIn 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I want people to have a visceral and emotional reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I wanted to say that it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't want people to be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance."

        "content": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" was recorded alongside the rest of the album at Larrabee North Studio in North Hollywood, California. Only three other people were in the studio with Madonna during the recording of the song and album: Orbit, recording engineer Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. The track featured no live instrumentation, and was part of a machinery issue that delayed initial recording as Orbit preferred working with sample loops and synth-based instrumentation. As a result, it took a while to finish production of the song, until the computers were repaired. The song was mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Studios in New York, and included background vocals from Donna De Lory and Niki Haris.\n\n\"Nothing Really Matters\" is a mid-tempo EDM song which contains influences of techno, downtempo pop, and house music. It is set in time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of F major, with a moderate tempo of 117 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from the lower octave of F3 to the higher note of A\u266d4. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune labelled the production as a \"worldly, and weary Madonna\". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly noticed that the \"hard-step beats and synth washes make the romantic-physical yearnings (and hooks) of 'Skin' and 'Nothing Really Matters' even tauter [...]\". J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun felt the song was a \"smart, groove-intensive tune\". Chuck Taylor from Billboard compared the composition of \"Nothing Really Matters\" to the \"disco-encrusted\" \"Vogue\" (1990). However, he found that the \"core\" important part of the song was its \"sweetly-spiritual\" and \"simple\" lyrical content.The song begins with a \"strange, electronic, slightly broken noise\" that spans between the start of the song up until 54 seconds. The ambient-influenced beginning gives the impression that \"Nothing Really Matters\" would be a ballad, but in the minute mark, it changes to a mid-tempo dance-pop song. The ambient music becomes restrained, although a cursory bleeping sound can be heard from the right to the left. The background has a number of faint strings in it, which signifies the depth of the stereo field. The chorus starts with a fast-pacing dance sound, over which Madonna sings, \"Nothing really matters / love is all we need / everything I give you / all comes back to me.\" Throughout the entire song, it includes two verses, three choruses, one bridge section, and an outro. The bridge is backed by piano sounds with a descending sequence by a couple of bars. Madonna sings the same lyrics in the outro, but is slowed down and echoed longer until the music fades out.The lyrics are about the birth of Madonna's daughter Lourdes, and the realization of motherhood. In an interview with the Wesleyan University Press, the singer stated: \"There's a song on the album called 'Nothing Really Matters', and it is very much inspired by my daughter. it's just realizing that at the end of the day, the most important thing is loving people and sharing love. The birth of my daughter has been a huge influence. It's different to look at life through the eyes of a child, and suddenly you have a whole new respect for life and you kind of get your innocence back. It's this realisation which I incorporated in 'Nothing Really Matters', 'Little Star' and 'Mer Girl'.\" Based on the lyrical content, Bryan Lark from The Michigan Daily reviewed the parent album, and concluded that as the single \"Ray of Light\" was about confronting the past, \"Nothing Really Matters\" conversely is about \"moving onward.\""

Johnson from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Chris Gernard from Metro Weekly highlighted \"Nothing Really Matters\" as one of Ray of Light's best tracks. Erlewine, who also wrote Madonna's biography for the website, cited the song as one of her career standouts. Chuck Taylor from Billboard labeled the song as a \"gem\" and commended the \"irresistible hook\". From the same publication, Jason Lipshutz commented, \"What if the suave dance of 'Nothing Really Matters', the eye-popping 'Ray of Light' music video or the stark beauty of 'Frozen' never existed? Luckily, we never need to find out.\" Paul Moody from NME noted that the song \"floats by almost as if it's asleep, a knowing return to the disco diva-effortlessness of 'Vogue', but with Madonna free from the narcissistic outer-shell of old, free to announce: \"I've realised/No-one wins...\"\" Rolling Stone said, \"Songs like the title track and 'Nothing Really Matters' are filled with warmth and wonder.\" \"A bubbly, infectious piece of shufflebeat\u2026\" Stuart Maconie wrote in a Q review of Ray of Light, \"but aberrant items continually swim into view, like a tumbling, atonal piano solo right out of Schoenberg.\" Sunday Mirror said it is the \"best pop tune\" from the album. Stephen Thompson from The A.V. Club was positive, stating that the \"chugging\" chorus and composition \"should ring across dance floors for years to come[...]\" Nathan Smith from the Houston Press was also positive, stating, \"Few singles illustrated [Madonna's change in musical approach] better than 'Nothing Really Matters'\". He concluded, \"It's a great, bouncy dance track that never received the love it deserved, and its family-friendly themes are a good fit for the event.\"However, Enio Chiola from PopMatters felt the song's commercial appeal and production was inferior to other album tracks, and stated that \"Skin\"\u2014another song from Ray of Light\u2014would have been a better release. Jose F. Promis from AllMusic reviewed the single and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of five. He suggested that the original album version was somewhat \"tepid\", and commented, \"This single is a case of where the production supersedes the song, which in and of itself is among Madonna's simplest and least interesting tunes.\" However, he commended the remixes, including the \"Eastern Asian\", \"chillout\" and \"several club cuts\". Medium's Richard LaBeau opined that it was a \"perfectly fine cut from her best album, but there are several other songs on the album that are better and would have made more interesting singles\". Billboard's Nolan Feeney noted, \"She keeps the platitudes from sounding empty by taking her younger self to task [...] Dance music is often a tool for artists and listeners to build their identities; here, Madonna uses pulsing beats to shed her skin\". Ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, The Guardian's Jude Rogers placed \"Nothing Really Matters\" at number 39, calling it a \"heavenly ode to motherhood\".At the 2000 ASCAP Rhythm and Soul Awards, \"Nothing Really Matters\" was nominated for the Award-Winning Dance Song award; this was Madonna's first nomination in that category, and was her second nomination at the awards since the previous year, when her song \"Ray of Light\" was nominated, and eventually won the Top Dance Song award. \"Nothing Really Matters\" eventually won the award, becoming her first win in that category; she won it again in 2002 for \"Don't Tell Me\"."

Jose F. Promis from AllMusic believed the single's lack of charting success in North America was due \"to the terrible timing of the single's release, which was much after radio and club airplay had peaked.\" Many fans in North America blamed Warner Bros.

In Canada, the song reached a peak of number seven on the RPM Singles Chart.In the United Kingdom, \"Nothing Really Matters\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number seven on March 13, 1999. It was later certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 200,000 units. According to Official Charts Company, the song has sold 128,137 copies as of August 2008. In Belgium's Flanders region, the song debuted and peaked at number 43 on March 13, 1999, while in the Wallonia region it had a similar performance, spending a sole week on the chart. In the Netherlands, the song debuted at number 73 on the Single Top 100 chart, and reached a peak of 34 on March 13, 1999. The recording peaked at number 38 in Germany, spending a total of nine weeks on the chart. In Finland, the song debuted at number six on the Finnish Singles Chart, and spent two weeks overall. In Spain, it was number one on the Spanish Singles Chart and stayed there for three consecutive weeks.In Australia, \"Nothing Really Matters\" debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at its peak of number 15 on March 4, 1999. The next week, it descended to number 22, and continued down to its final appearance at number 49, being present for a total of six weeks on the chart. In New Zealand, the song debuted at number seven on the New Zealand Singles Chart on April 11, 1999. It stayed there for two weeks, until descending to number 45. It rose to number 26 on its final peaking week, and was present for a total of nine weeks on the chart."

        "content": "On February 24, 1999, Madonna performed \"Nothing Really Matters\" as the opening number of the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. The performance was held and recorded at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California. The stage had two large Japanese infrastructures on either side, a black screen, and a semi-large bench on which Madonna stood. The performance opened with the lights beaming on Madonna, who wore the red Gaultier kimono, red platform boots, and black bob hairstyle. The chorus started with four back-up dancers holding plastic bag, similar to the Japanese people in the music video, and a background dancer being projected on screen. By the second chorus, Madonna's back-up vocalists started singing atop the benches wearing similar kimonos. During the song's bridge interlude, a man entered the stage and started performing with flamed rope. When Madonna won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the same ceremony, she came onstage with Orbit to accept the award in the red kimono.The live performance received positive reviews from most music critics; Jason Kaufman from NY Rock commented, \"Her constant nationality morphing has got to go. With her geisha-girl-gone-club-hopping outfit last night, [...] the woman proved she's a walking Epcot Center, long on fashion and short on culture. And what were those women dancing behind her in her musical number holding? The objects looked like fetuses from last week's The X-Files\". Bradley Stern from Idolator hosted a poll, asking viewers what was their best Madonna Grammy performance. Alongside the 1999 Grammys, Stern listed Madonna's performances of \"Music\" at the 2001 ceremony, \"Hung Up\" at the 2006 ceremony, and \"Same Love\" and \"Open Your Heart\" at the 2014 ceremony. \"Nothing Really Matters\" came third in the poll with 102 votes. InStyle staff highlighted the performance as one of the best Grammy performances to date.The song is performed as the opening number for Madonna's 2023-2024 Celebration Tour. During the performance, she wore a floor-length black kimono and a diamond radial headdress while a large white light shined above her. The headdress was designed by German designer Malakai specifically for the tour, adorned with 25 large Swarovski crystals and paved with micro-crystals. It was designed\nwith \"Madonna's iconography and what she stands for\" in mind. Matt Cain from BBC Culture pointed out how \"there are no distracting theatrics, just Madonna, her image and her voice \u2013 which has never sounded better\" and described the performance as a \"heartfelt rendition\". According to Liam Hess of Vogue, given that \"Nothing Really Matters\" is one of Madonna's most personal tracks, \"it made for a neat introduction to a show that offered a deliberately looser, chattier glimpse at Madonna, the woman\"."

        "content": "\"Nothing Really Matters\" has been noted as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. Louis Virtel from NewNowNext listed the song at number 94 on their Top 100 Madonna Songs list, stating, \"Copping both new-age maxims and Beatle sentiments ('Everything I give you all comes back to me'), 'Nothing Really Matters' is as queer and curious as a red patent-leather geisha costume.\" The Gaultier kimono has been cited by several publications as one of Madonna's most notable re-inventions and looks, including fashion magazines InStyle, Elle and Harper's Bazaar. Alongside this, the kimono has been recognized as one of the Grammy's best and worst looks.Louis Virtel listed the music video at number 49 on his ranking of 55 Best Music Videos by Madonna. Julien Sauvalle from Out listed the video at number eight on his Top 20 Most Stylist Madonna music videos list. Idolator's Nicole Sta called the clip as one of Madonna's best music videos. Nikki Ogunnaike from Glamour magazine listed the video as one of Madonna's Top 5 Most Fashionable music videos.The geisha look was further reproduced for Madonna's appearance on the May\u2013June 1999 issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine. The singer took partial creative control of the issue, and requested photographer of the shoot Patrick Demarchelier to incorporate elements of the novel Memoirs of a Geisha into it, both visually and typographically. Three covers were selected for different regions around the world. In 2016, the geisha look was adapted on the Logo TV series RuPaul's Drag Race, season eight. The show's host, RuPaul, announced that contestants had to create a gown that was inspired by Madonna's iconic looks. Four drag queen contestants wore the geisha look, including one sporting a similar look from the singer's music video \"Paradise (Not for Me)\". A fifth contestant decided on wearing a kimono from the video of \"Nothing Really Matters\", but changed. This runway show was criticized by Vulture, for the lack of variety of Madonna's iconic looks outside of \"Nothing Really Matters\".Masahiro Ito has cited the song's music video as one of the inspirations for his work on the video game Silent Hill 2 (2001)."

        "content": "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is the eleventh studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was released on 22 November 2004 in the United Kingdom by Island Records and a day later in the United States by Interscope Records. Much like their previous album All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000), the record exhibits a more mainstream rock sound after the band experimented with alternative rock and dance music in the 1990s. It was produced by Steve Lillywhite, with additional production from Chris Thomas, Jacknife Lee, Nellee Hooper, Flood, Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Carl Glanville.\nLooking for a more hard-hitting sound than that of their previous album, U2 began recording How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February 2003 with Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results. The group subsequently enlisted Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. U2 lead singer Bono described the album as \"our first rock album. It's taken us twenty years or whatever it is, but this is our first rock album.\" Thematically, the record touches on life, death, love, war, faith, and family.\nHow to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received generally positive reviews from critics and reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled the band's previous personal best. The album and its singles won all eight Grammy Awards for which they were nominated. It was also the fourth-highest-selling album of 2004, with almost ten million copies sold, and it yielded several successful singles, such as \"Vertigo\", \"City of Blinding Lights\", and \"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\". The album was included on Rolling Stone's list of the \"100 Best Albums of the Decade\" at number 68."

        "content": "Lead singer Bono explained that he had to ask himself a few hard questions before carrying on recording: \"I wanted to check where I was to where I am. So I went back and listened to all the music that made me want to be in a band, right from the Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo & The Bunnymen, all that stuff. And what was interesting is, that was what a lot of people in bands now are listening to anyway. So in a funny way, it made us completely contemporary.\"Looking for a harder-hitting rock sound than that of their previous record, All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 began recording How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February 2003 with producer Chris Thomas. After nine months of work, the band had completed an album's worth of songs. In October, they met in Dublin to review their work. Bono and guitarist the Edge believed it was good enough to release; Bono said, \"All we needed was the assent of the politburo and the record would have been out for Christmas.\" Bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr., however, disagreed with their bandmates and voted against releasing the record. Mullen said that the songs \"had no magic\", while Clayton said, \"When it comes to signing off on a project, you ask questions like, 'Have we got a first single to open the campaign?' Frankly, we were missing more than just a first single.\" Clayton and Mullen also had a nagging feeling that All That You Can't Leave Behind had been overpraised when it only produced one hit\u2014\"Beautiful Day\". Clayton thought that if U2's goal was to continue to be the world's biggest band, they needed three or four hits from their album that could attract new fans.\nThe group brought in their long-time producer Steve Lillywhite to mediate the disagreement. After they played him the album, Lillywhite assessed that it felt like \"it had the weight of the world on its shoulders. It certainly wasn't any fun.\" After lengthy discussions, Bono and the Edge were convinced that the album needed more work. Bono thought their songs were good but admitted \"good won't bring you to tears or make you want to leave your house and tour for a year\". The group subsequently dismissed Thomas and enlisted Lillywhite to take over as the album's producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \"sonic cohesion\".A demo version of the album (guitarist the Edge's copy) was stolen while the band were having their photo taken for a magazine in France in July 2004. It contained unfinished versions of several songs that made it onto the album. The band publicly announced that if those tracks were leaked online, they would release the album immediately via the iTunes Store. Several months later, the finished album was leaked online, but the band did not release it earlier, despite previous comments.In late 2004, \"Mercy\", an unreleased track taken from the How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb sessions, surfaced on the Internet through a fan who had been given a copy of the album containing the extra track. The track is of less than standard audio quality, but managed to become a favorite on fan websites. It was cut from the final release, but was described by Blender as \"a six-and-a-half-minute outpouring of U2 at its most uninhibitedly U2-ish\". The lyrics to the song can be found in the booklet for the Special Limited Edition. A significantly revised version of the song was performed during the European leg of the U2 360\u00b0 Tour; it made its live debut on 12 September 2010 during the second Z\u00fcrich concert, and was officially released as the opening track on the band's Wide Awake in Europe vinyl-only live EP that November."

        "content": "As with All That You Can't Leave Behind, this album finds U2 returning to \"more 'stripped down' rock and pop sounds\", according to musicologist Susan Fast.Adam Clayton said of Atomic Bomb, \"It's very much a guitar record. \"Vertigo\", \"Love and Peace\", \"City of Blinding Lights\", \"All Because of You\", all pretty up, rocky tunes. A lot of them are a kick-back to our very early days, so it's like with each year we have gathered a little bit more and this is what we are now.\"\nIn 2003, Bono said one of their new songs called \"Full Metal Jacket\" was \"the mother of all rock songs\" and \"the reason to make a new album\". A similar demo called \"Native Son\" was also recorded. Both of these demos would later become \"Vertigo\".\nContemporary Christian artist Michael W. Smith joined the band in the studio during the Atomic Bomb sessions and worked on at least one track with them, entitled \"North Star\". That track, which was a tribute to Johnny Cash, has not yet surfaced officially or unofficially in any form. A song introduced by Bono as \"North Star\" was played in Turin during the U2 360\u00b0 Tour; however, it is unknown whether or not this is the same song that was worked on during the sessions. Other tracks, such as \"Shark Soup\" (another version of \"Vertigo\"), \"Lead Me In The Way I Should Go\", and \"You Can't Give Away Your Heart\", were referenced in the media and by the band themselves, but have not been released.\n\nThe very earliest versions of \"Love and Peace or Else\" originated during the recording sessions for All That You Can't Leave Behind. It serves as Atomic Bomb's \"big plea for peace\" song, following in the footsteps of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", \"Miss Sarajevo\", \"Please\", and \"Peace on Earth\". During performances on the Vertigo Tour, \"Love and Peace Or Else\" featured Mullen moving out to the center of the ellipse-shaped ramp, where he played a floor tom and crash cymbal for the majority of the song. Near the end, Bono took over and played the drum until the song segued into the opening drumbeat of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\". Most live performances of the song also saw Mullen singing the \"release, release, release, release\" part during the chorus alongside Bono.\n\"Crumbs from Your Table\" is about the relationship between Western countries and developing countries. The verses and chorus address the relationship from the perspective of citizens from the developing world, focusing on the disparity between the long-term socioeconomic planning stressed by the West (\"You speak in signs and wonders\") and the developing world's immediate need for sustenance (\"But I'm begging for the crumbs from your table\"). One line (\"You speak in signs and wonders\") was meant as a criticism of the Catholic Church. The bridge (\"Where you live should not decide / Whether you live or whether you die\") is statement from Bono that follows with the theme in his speeches in which he tries to raise awareness about African poverty. Bono stated on a bonus DVD included with special editions of the album that the band has no recollection of writing the song, as they were intoxicated at the time. A studio performance is also included on the aforementioned bonus DVD. It was only played a handful on times during the third leg of the Vertigo Tour.\"One Step Closer\" is a slow tempo song, with Bono's lyrics centered around traffic images, leading to the singer being stranded on a refuge island. The origins of the song go back to the All That You Can't Leave Behind sessions.  It was revived for Atomic Bomb, with Lanois introducing a pedal steel guitar, in addition to guitars from the Edge and Bono, and musical influences varying from country music to The Velvet Underground making themselves felt.  One recording of the song ran for more than 15 minutes, with Bono adding many verses that were subsequently dropped. Jacknife Lee also contributed to the final form of the recording. \"One Step Closer\" is billed in the album with thanks to Noel Gallagher of Oasis. The title of the song comes from a conversation Bono had with Gallagher about Bono's dying father, Bob Hewson. Bono asked, \"Do you think he believes in God?\" to which Gallagher replied, \"Well, he's one step closer to knowing.\" Through the end of the Vertigo Tour, the song had never been performed in any U2 concert. The title of the album derives from a lyric in the song \"Fast Cars\", which was only available on some versions of the album."

It is set before the events of both the series and the first film, showing how Fred and Barney meet Wilma and Betty. The title is a play on the Elvis Presley song, Viva Las Vegas, also used as the title of an MGM musical film.\nNone of the original cast from the first film reprise their roles in this film. The film stars Mark Addy as Fred Flintstone, Stephen Baldwin as Barney Rubble, Kristen Johnston as Wilma Slaghoople, and Jane Krakowski as Betty O'Shale, replacing John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, and Rosie O'Donnell respectively. The supporting cast features Joan Collins, Thomas Gibson, Harvey Korman (in his final film performance), and Alan Cumming as both The Great Gazoo and Mick Jagged, a parody of Mick Jagger. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who created the original cartoon series, make cameo appearances at the end of the film.\nThe film was a box office failure, grossing $59.5 million against its $83 million budget.

Soon to be employed, they hope to score dates, and a little green alien The Great Gazoo, exiled to Earth by his species, offers to help, although only they can see him. Meanwhile, Wilma Slaghoople wants a normal life, though her controlling mother Pearl wants her to marry suave casino-owner Chip Rockefeller.  After Wilma angrily escapes to Bronto King in Bedrock, waitress Betty O'Shale, mistaking her as \"caveless\", offers to share her apartment and gets her a job.\nSmitten with the waitresses, the two men invite them to a carnival, with Fred dating Betty and Barney taking Wilma. However, the couples fail to bond until both men switch dates. Fred wins an egg in a carnival game which hatches into a baby dinosaur, which he names \"Dino\". Wilma invites her new friends home to a birthday party for her father, Colonel Slaghoople, where all are shocked by her wealth. Intending to propose, Fred changes his mind after meeting Chip, who mocks his low-level job at Slate & Company. Pearl despises the three new friends, but the Colonel, glad for Wilma's happiness, accepts them and privately gives Wilma a valuable pearl necklace that his great-grandmother once wore. After the boys humiliate themselves at dinner, Wilma nevertheless proclaims her pride and follows them out.\nChip congratulates Fred on attracting Wilma, apologizes for lampooning Fred's job, and invites the group to his Rock Vegas resort as an olive branch. However, unbeknownst to the group, Chip plots to ensure Fred gambles so Wilma dumps him, whereas Fred sees it as a chance to win big so he can impress Wilma with money like Chip's. Gangsters Big Rocko and Little Rocko visit Chip and his girlfriend Roxie to collect a sum of money that Chip owes their boss. Gazoo overhears Chip claiming his upcoming marriage to Wilma will allow him to access the Slaghoople fortune. Considering that plan creditable, the gangsters agree to suspend collections until after the wedding. When Barney tries to keep Fred from high-stakes poker, Chip sends Roxie to seduce and escort Barney to an all-you-can-eat buffet.\nChip keeps Fred gambling and he misses his dinner date with the others. Betty sees Barney wipe cream from Roxie's chest, misinterpreting the gesture as a pass. Mick Jagged comforts the weeping girl, and they go on a date. Wilma breaks up with Fred over not spending any time with her. Chip warns her of burglaries and arranges that Fred loses everything before slipping Wilma's pearls in Fred's pocket and asking him to empty them. Hotel security arrest Fred for robbery, but when Barney protests that Fred is incapable of robbery, Chip accuses Barney of being Fred's accomplice and also has him arrested. Hurt that the two stole from her, Wilma goes back to Chip.\nGazoo visits the men in prison, revealing that Chip is severely indebted to the mob and hopes to solve both his problems by framing Fred for the robbery and marrying Wilma to get the Slaghooples' money. Barney slips through the bars, steals the keys, and unlocks the cell. Disguised in drag as dancers, they accidentally run into Jagged's dressing room. Barney tells Betty he loves her, and they reconcile after the misunderstanding involving Roxie at the buffet is cleared up.\nFred plans to disguise himself as Jagged in an attempt to reconcile with Wilma. Meanwhile, in the audience, Chip proposes to an unimpressed Wilma. Fred then comes on stage disguised as Jagged and briefly sings to Wilma, apologizing for his behavior earlier before proposing to her. Knowing that she still loves Fred, Wilma happily accepts, rejecting Chip, and they marry in the Rock Vegas Chapel of Love. After the pastor proclaims them husband and wife, everyone sings \"Meet the Flintstones\". When Jagged sings \"Viva Rock Vegas\" at a party, Betty catches Wilma's tossed bouquet and kisses Barney. The newlyweds drive away with Dino and Gazoo to goodbye waves from their friends, family, and even a handcuffed Chip and Roxie."

Jaggubhai returns to India as a dejected officer, failing in both his official duty and personal life. However, fate had something in store for him. 20 years later, or as he says it 21 years later, he gets a call from Australia stating that Ilavarasi is dead and has left him a will. He reaches Australia and is shocked to know that the brief encounter with Ilavarasi had resulted in a daughter named Monisha, who is now a teenager. Jaggubhai realises that he has left behind his daughter and her wish that he should protect her. Monisha thinks he is her mother's friend and tries to act cranky. The threat comes in the form of some antisocial elements who want to eliminate Monisha. These thugs were the same ones who had tricked Jaggubhai 21 years earlier and who had killed Ilavarasi. Now, it is Jaggubhai's duty to save his only daughter and settle old scores with the thugs. He now meets his former colleague Kaaliyappan or MIB.

There is a massive, continent-wide power outage that appears to be part of a region-wide technological collapse. The car battery is drained, so they are left stranded for days. Their father eventually gets the car working and they make it to the nearest town, where they buy supplies including gas from a man named Stan. Eva later attends dance class while her sister meets up with her boyfriend, Eli. Returning home, they see a stranded car and the girls' father offers to help the passengers, but the family move on after they brandish guns. The father says that they will not return to town until the power is restored. Later, while cutting down a tree, he cuts his leg badly with a chainsaw. Knowing he is bleeding to death, he tells the girls to take care of each other and love one another. They bury him where he died in the forest.\nAt two months without power, the girls are low on food. They get by using the skills their father taught them, though they miss the creature comforts they used to enjoy. For example, Eva must dance to a metronome since she can no longer dance to music.\nEli arrives one night, having walked there looking for Nell. He says that all the surrounding houses are abandoned. Nell experiences sex for the first time with Eli. Later, he says there is electricity, food, order and jobs again in Boston. He convinces Nell to go with him but she returns after only one night away, unwilling to leave Eva alone. Nell researches plants for food and medicine and forages. When Nell is certain she is not pregnant, she and Eva celebrate. \nSix months pass without power. While Nell is foraging in the forest, Eva is surprised by Stan while chopping wood. He assaults and rapes her, then steals most of the remaining gas and the car. As a result, Nell boards up the house and brings a gun with her whenever venturing outside while Eva stays indoors. At eight months without power, Eva experiences morning sickness and realizes she is pregnant. Nell suggests an abortion but to her surprise, Eva wants to have the baby. Eva explains that she doesn't think any baby should be unwanted, that kids aren't responsible for their parents' actions, that it is its own person, and that she does not think she can lose anything else now. To help nourish Eva during her pregnancy, Nell hunts and butchers a pig.\nFifteen months pass without power. Several roof beams break during a storm and Eva goes into labor. The continually weakening house creaks and groans as both the storm and Eva's labor progresses. Fearing the house will collapse, the sisters flee to a hollowed out tree stump that once served as their play house where Eva gives birth to a baby boy and rejoices. Returning to their ruined home, Eva decides to burn the house down with the remaining gas so they will be safe because anyone passing by will think they died in a fire. They gather all the food and items important to them: books, keepsakes and a family photo. At nightfall they set the house ablaze, then journey into the forest."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 70, based on 24 reviews. Billboard described Drake and Future's chemistry as expected and said \"Future deals with personal demons that he tries, and fails, to drown in drugs; Drake is mostly about insecurities and lesser gravity\". Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, attributing the \"fresh and spontaneous\" feel to the quick production of the album, where \"both artists [are] playing off their louder-than-life personalities without overthinking the details\". However, Sheldon Pearce in a Pitchfork review suggests that this limited time-frame for making the album is the sonic downfall of the mixtape arguing that the album \"wasn't created with the care or the dutiful curation we've come to expect from both artists when solo.\"In a mixed review, Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork criticizes the \"decided lack of chemistry between these two\", because \"they have difficulty sharing the same space\" when on the same song. Pearce goes on to highlight how Future's presence, both in content and persona, is much more prevalent than Drake's, where the latter appears to be a \"bystander\" and \"out of his element\". Yet, he highlights moments where the collaboration works most effectively. On \"Scholarships\", Drake \"throws Future the perfect alley-oop\", \"Jumpman\" is a banger, and \"Diamonds Dancing\" is the first track between the two artists that \"clicks on all cylinders\". Additionally, Pearce lauds the production by Metro Boomin as \"glimmering\" and hails both rappers when they are able to work on their own and make music in their respective comfort zones in songs like Future's \"Jersey\" and Drake's \"30 for 30 Freestyle\".Complex said about Drake verses; \"despite a corny bar here or there, Drake sounds way more energized with much better flows.\" Entertainment Weekly was disappointed with Drake on the album, quoting \"despite a beat by Drake whisperer Noah \"40\" Shebib, the album-closing \"30 For 30 Freestyle\" doesn't come near clearing the admittedly high bar Drake has set for himself in 2015.\""

        "content": "Set in the 1860s, Rawhide portrays the challenges faced by the drovers of a cattle drive. Most episodes are introduced with a monologue by Gil Favor (Eric Fleming), trail boss. In a typical Rawhide story, the drovers come upon people on the trail and involve themselves in other people's affairs, usually encountering various corrupt individuals. Many times, one or more of the crew venture into a nearby town and encounter some trouble from crooked townspeople or lawless politicians from whom they need to be rescued. Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood) was young and at times impetuous in the earliest episodes, and Favor had to keep a tight rein on him.\nFavor is a savvy and strong leader, who always plays \"square\" with his fellow men \u2013 a tough customer who can handle the challenges and get the job done. (Producer Charles Warren called on the diary written in 1866 by trail boss George C. Duffield to shape the character of Favor.) Although Favor had the respect and loyalty of the men who worked for him, the people, including Yates, are insubordinate to him a few times, after working too hard or after receiving a tongue lashing. Favor has to fight at times and usually wins.\nSome Rawhide stories were easy in production terms, but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its story lines ranged from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and others. A frequent story line was the constant need to find water for the cattle. The scout spent much of his time looking for water, sometimes finding that water holes and even rivers had dried up.\nRawhide frequently dealt with controversial topics. Robert Culp played an ex-soldier on the drive who had become dangerously addicted to morphine. Mexican drover Hey Soos faced racism at times from outside of the crew.\nSeveral shows deal with the aftermath of the American Civil War, which ended four years earlier. The \"Poco Tiempo\" episode reveals that Yates' father's name was Dan, that Yates came from Southwestern Texas, that he joined the Confederate States Army at 16, and that he was later held in a federal prison camp.\nFavor also served in the CSA as a captain. \"Incident on the Edge of Madness\" in season one, guest-starring Lon Chaney Jr., had Favor's old commanding officer attempting to enlist the aid of Favor and his men to start the \"New Confederacy of Panama\" much to Favor's dismay. In that same episode, Favor and Nolan were revealed to have been in the Confederate forces up on Marye's Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and they \"felt shamed\" at killing so many Union soldiers.\nSome American Indians demanded cattle as payment for going through their land. Rough characters were in the shows, and in one episode, Gil Favor is tortured by having his face held near a fire. In \"Incident of the Town in Terror\", people think that a sick Yates has \"the plague\" (anthrax), and they enforce at gunpoint a quarantine of the cattle drovers outside the town. Also, cattle rustlers were around, including Commancheros.\nOn occasions, Rawhide was eerily atmospheric. \"Incident with an Executioner\" featured a mysterious dark rider (Dan Duryea) seen on the hillside following the herd, \"Incident of the Haunted Hills\" featured a sacred Indian burial ground, \"Incident of the Druid Curse\" and season two's \"Incident of the Murder Steer\" (where anyone sighting a rogue steer with \"Murder\" carved on its side soon after dies, based on an actual legend of the Old West). The series also featured episodes with ghost towns, cattle with horns lit up by St. Elmo's fire at dusk, cowboys struck by lightning, plus a strange, totally enclosed gypsy wagon, apparently steering itself, repeatedly turning up, all stand out as curiously \"spooky\" tales for a bustling dusty cattle drive; the show's often stark incidental music suited these stories perfectly.\nIn episode 67, \"Incident Near the Promised Land\" (most episode titles began with \"Incident\" until Bruce Geller and Bernard L. Kowalski became the producers for season six), the cattle drive finally reached Sedalia for the first time in the series. Unusually, episode 68 continues on from that, where the cattle have been sold and the men celebrate in town and decide on their futures with even Favor thinking of leaving the business. Instead of the usual ending, wherein Favor gives the command \"Head 'em up! Move 'em out!\" and the cattle move off, this episode had the end titles over a view of a Sedalia street.\nEpisode 69 has Favor visiting his two daughters, Gillian and Maggie, who live with their aunt Eleanor Bradley in Philadelphia. In episode 70, a number of the men are back together and heading back to San Antonio about 650 miles away, with a herd of horses (used in the titles) instead of cattle. Episode 71 has a new cattle drive ready to go, but the owner of 1600 of the cattle wants to be in charge, so Favor reluctantly signs on as a ramrod, but after problems, Favor becomes boss again at the end of the show. These five episodes made up one storyline instead of the usual single-episode stories, which could have been set anywhere in the West.\nFavor had many bad moments in the series, but none worse than the \"Lost Herd\" episode. Close to drive's finish, Favor wants to beat another herd to town to get the best prices. He takes a narrow shortcut; due to thunder and lightning, the herd stampedes over the cliffs, leaving him just 9 out of 3000 cattle when the drive reaches town. He does not have the money to pay the drovers and has to face the owner (Royal Dano), whose cattle he has lost, knowing that he might never work in the business again.\nFrom the second season, episodes began to feature individual cast members, notably Clint Eastwood's Yates (sole star in \"Incident on the Day of the Dead\", which opens season two); later, both Scout Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley) and even cook G. W. Wishbone (Paul Brinegar) were featured as leads, while Fleming's Gil Favor remained in overall charge.\nPete Nolan (Wooley), the scout, departs as a regular cast member after \"The Deserter's Patrol\" (season four, episode 18, 9 Feb 1962), but returns for a single episode \"Reunion\" (episode 26, 6 April 1962), and for a further nine episodes in season seven from \"Texas Fever\" (episode 18, 5 February 1965).\nCharles H. Gray's character Clay Forester, having played a villain in three episodes of season four (from \"The Inside Man\", episode six), then reforms and replaces Nolan as scout from \"The Greedy Town\" (season four, episode 19). Gray remained in the regular cast for the rest of seasons four and five (though in a number of later episodes, he is credited but not seen).\n\nIn the eighth and final season of Rawhide, Fleming left the series after an apparent disagreement with the producers. Rawhide had fallen in the ratings, from sixth in 1960\u201361 to 13th, 22nd, then 44th. Eric Fleming, who played Favor, was let go. \"They fired me because they were paying me a million dollars a year\" (actually $220,000), Fleming told TV Guide in 1965. Cast members Sheb Wooley, James Murdock, Rocky Shahan, and Robert Cabal were also let go. Eastwood was promoted to series star as Yates finally becomes the trail boss. This outcome was hinted at in earlier episodes when Favor indicates he is training Yates to replace him as trail boss. The impression given is this was a later cattle drive with Yates now in charge, at a time after Favor had either \"retired\" or given up as boss, presumably having made his money or opted for a career change, since no mention is ever made onscreen of him or the reason for his absence in the final season's episodes. In its casting of the series, Robert Carricart was originally cast as George Washington Wishbone, but was replaced by Paul Brinegar. Carricart only played the role for the series unaired pilot.John Ireland as Jed Colby and Raymond St Jacques as Simon Blake also joined the Rawhide cast at this time, plus semiregular minor cast member David Watson as Ian Cabot. With Fleming gone, ratings plunged and the revised format only lasted 13 episodes before Rawhide was suddenly cancelled in midseason."

Gray were actors; all also worked in Rawhide.\nChisholm Trail is the classic novel by Borden Chase that inspired the epic motion picture Red River starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift.\nThe diary of trail boss George C. Duffield was written during a cattle drive from San Antonio to Sedalia in 1866. The narrations with which Gil Favor begins each episode are similar in style and breadth to the entries in Duffield's journal, lending the show an extra measure of authenticity.Filming for the first season of Rawhide took place at Universal-International Studios in Hollywood. The extensive railroad scenes in the third season were filmed in one month on the Sierra Railroad in Tuolumne County, California.The premiere episode of Rawhide reached the top 20 in the Nielsen ratings.\nThe show had a grueling production schedule, being mostly weekly with a three- to four-month break between seasons. After the first season of 22 episodes, seasons two to seven were each 30 episodes. Often, the only way the lead actors could get a break was if they were said to be off on business. On rare occasions, the show featured a small number of the actors and some misfortune, maybe in a town, which would give the others time off.\nEric Fleming drowned at the age of 41 when a canoe flipped over on location in Peru six weeks into filming the movie High Jungle in 1966. The picture was abandoned as a result."

        "content": "In Stratford, Ontario, in 1904, William Spence (Fredric March), a medical student on the verge of becoming a doctor, receives \"The Call\" while passing a Methodist church one Sunday. His bride-to-be, Hope Morris (Martha Scott), accepts his decision to enter the ministry with a whole heart despite the disappointment of her prominent and affluent parents.\nWill \"dives right in,\" but, with no vacancies in Canada, is posted as a circuit minister to a small town in rural Iowa, beginning a life for them of frequent moves around the district, dingy parsonages, and scraping a living from poor boxes and performing weddings. Hope yearns for a decent parsonage and a sense of permanence for their children, but uncomplainingly provides them a good life and a supportive home for Will.\nFor his part, Will understands his own nature and laughs at his own foibles, bending where he can in good conscience. He often enters situations in anger or to instruct but leaves humbled and renewed in spirit. While Will sincerely lives by and teaches by example (which includes his family) the tenets of the Methodist Discipline, he also learns from his congregations to be flexible and change with the times.\nWhen their third child, a boy, is born, Hope and Will cannot agree on a name and he remains unbaptized for three months. Hope wants to name the baby William Spence Jr., but Will does not like the idea of his son going without a middle name as he did. He wants the boy to have and be called in \"the good old Canadian custom\" by the middle name of Frazer. Will seems to give in to Hope but the following Sunday baptizes him William Frazer Spence. Hope serenely accepts the change.\nOldest son Hartzell (named for Will's guiding bishop) has a hard time coping with the idea that a minister's son should be an example to the other boys. Will explains that \"a pastor's family walks a tightrope, balancing with one foot on earth and one foot already in Heaven.\" After learning that Hartzell has been sneaking into the movies, a pastime seemingly forbidden by the Discipline, Will takes him to the theater to point out why the film is bad for him. They see a western but rather than finding it sinful, Will is impressed by its moral. The following Sunday he preaches a sermon advising his congregation that young people may have something to teach their elders.\nIn the 1920s, the family is assigned to a church in Denver, Colorado, that, despite having many well-heeled members, is old, uncomfortable and decrepit. In a time of economic prosperity for the country, the Spences cope with possibly their most dilapidated parsonage yet. Will has come to appreciate his wife's serenity with life and resolves to provide her a decent parsonage by building a new church.\nHis plans at first are thwarted by power struggles among several snobbish members of the church. He loses one wealthy patron, Mrs. Sandow (Beulah Bondi), to the Baptists when he refuses to stop ministering to her chauffeur (Harry Davenport), and another, influential banker Preston Thurston (Gene Lockhart), after organizing a children's choir to replace the off-key church choir, run for years by Mrs. Thurston (Laura Hope Crews), her family and social circle. Soon after, Hartzell (Frankie Thomas) is expelled from school because of a gossip campaign falsely accusing him of making a young girl pregnant and forcing her family to move to San Francisco.\nA deeply discouraged Will investigates a job offer in California that offers the beautiful church and parsonage he and Hope have always dreamed of but discovers that he cannot surrender in his struggles with the Thurstons. He seeks out the girl's family and learns that there is no truth to any part of the rumor. Returning to Denver, Will confronts Mrs. Thurston and her circle, who started the rumors to punish Will, and suggests that if they don't contribute substantially to the building of the new church, he will call them out in his sermons.\nA repentant Mrs. Sandow begs to return to the church and Will inveigles from her the stained glass window, new Skinner organ, and carillon that as luxuries are being cut from the plans to finance a recreation center for the church. A year later, their dream church and parsonage finished, Will accepts the challenge of returning to Iowa to aid a small church in trouble, confident that he leaves behind a revitalized church when its members, including all those with whom he locked horns, gather spontaneously on a weekday morning to sing \"The Church's One Foundation\" as he plays it on the new carillon."

        "content": "Exile on Main St. is a studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 26 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records. The 10th released in the UK and 12th in the US, it is viewed as a culmination of a string of the band's most critically successful albums, following Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969) and Sticky Fingers (1971). Exile on Main St. is known for its murky, inconsistent sound due to more disjointed musicianship and production, along with a party-like atmosphere heard in several tracks.\nRecording began in 1969 at Olympic Studios in London during sessions for Sticky Fingers, with the main sessions beginning in mid-1971 at a rented villa in the South of France named Nellc\u00f4te after the band became tax exiles. Due to the lack of a professional studio nearby, they worked with a mobile recording studio and recorded in-house. The loose and unorganised Nellc\u00f4te sessions went on for hours into the night, with personnel varying greatly from day to day. Recording was completed with overdub sessions at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles and included additional musicians such as the pianist Nicky Hopkins, the saxophonist Bobby Keys, the drummer and producer Jimmy Miller, and the horn player Jim Price. The results produced enough songs for the Stones' first double album.\nThe band continued a back-to-basics direction heard in Sticky Fingers after the experimental instrumentation of previous albums, yet Exile exhibited a wider range of influences in blues, rock and roll, swing, country and gospel, while the lyrics explored themes related to hedonism, sex and time. The album contains frequently-performed concert staples and topped the charts in six countries, including the UK, US and Canada. It included the singles \"Happy\", which featured lead vocals from Keith Richards, country music ballad \"Sweet Virginia\", and worldwide top-ten hit \"Tumbling Dice\". The album's artwork, a collage of various images, reflected the Rolling Stones' prideful rebellion. After its release, the Stones embarked on an American tour, gaining infamy for riotous audiences and performances.\nExile on Main St. was originally met with mixed reviews before receiving strong reassessments by the end of the 1970s. It has since been recognized as a pivotal hard rock album, viewed by many critics as the Rolling Stones' best work and as one of the greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album number 7 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2003 and 2012, with it dropping to number 14 in the 2020 and 2023 editions, consistently as the highest-ranked Rolling Stones album on the list. In 2012, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the band's fourth album to be inducted. A remastered and expanded version of the album was released in 2010 featuring a bonus disc with 10 new tracks. Unusual for a re-release, it also charted highly at the time of its release, reaching number one in the UK and number two in the US."

        "content": "According to Bill Janovitz, in his account of the album for the 33\u2153 book series, Exile on Main St. features \"a seemingly infinite amount of subtle (and not so subtle) variations on rock & roll \u2013 a form that had seemed to be severely limited to basic, guitar-driven music.\" Music biographer John Perry writes that the Rolling Stones had developed a style of hard rock for the album that is \"entirely modern yet rooted in 1950s rock & roll and 1930s\u20131940s swing\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, described Exile on Main St. as \"a sprawling, weary double album\" featuring \"a series of dark, dense jams\" that encompass rock and roll, blues, country, and gospel styles. Rolling Stone writer Richard Gehr compares the album to outlaw music and observes a strong influence of music from the American South in its \"loose-limbed\" explorations of 1950s rock, African-American soul, and gospel country.Although Exile is often thought to reflect Richards' vision for a raw, rootsy rock sound, Jagger was already expressing his boredom with rock and roll in several interviews at the time of the album's release. Jagger's stance on Exile's rock and roll sound at the time is interpreted by the music academic Barry J. Faulk to seemingly \"signal the end of the Stones' conscious attempt to revive American-style roots rock\". With Richards' effectiveness seriously undermined by his dependence on heroin, the group's subsequent 1970s releases \u2013 directed largely by Jagger \u2013 would experiment to varying degrees with other musical genres, moving away from the rootsy influences of Exile on Main St.According to Robert Christgau, Exile on Main St. expands on the hedonistic themes the band had explored on previous albums such as Sticky Fingers. As he writes, \"It piled all the old themes \u2013 sex as power, sex as love, sex as pleasure, distance, craziness, release \u2013 on top of an obsession with time that was more than appropriate in men pushing 30 who were still committed to what was once considered youth music.\""

        "content": "For Exile on Main St., Mick Jagger wanted an album cover that reflected the band as \"runaway outlaws using the blues as its weapon against the world\", showcasing \"feeling of joyful isolation, grinning in the face of a scary and unknown future\". As the band finished the album in Los Angeles, they approached designer John Van Hamersveld and his photographer partner Norman Seeff, and also invited documentary photographer Robert Frank. The same day Seeff photographed the Stones at their Bel Air mansion, Frank took Jagger for photographs at Los Angeles' Main Street. The location was the 500 block near the Leonide Hotel. At the time there was a pawnshop, a shoeshine business and a pornographic theatre (The Galway Theatre) at the location. Still, Van Hamersveld and Jagger chose the cover image from an already existing Frank photograph, an outtake from his seminal 1958 book The Americans. Named \"Tattoo Parlor\" but possibly taken from Hubert's Dime museum in New York City, the image is a collage of circus performers and freaks, such as \"Three Ball Charlie\", a 1930s sideshow performer from Humboldt, Nebraska, who holds three balls (a tennis ball, a golf ball, and a \"5\" billiard ball) in his mouth; Joe \"The Human Corkscrew\" Allen, pictured in a postcard-style advertisement, a contortionist with the ability to wiggle and twist through a 13.5-inch (34 cm) hoop; and Hezekiah Trambles, \"The Congo Jungle Freak\", a man who dressed as an African savage, in a picture taken by the then recently deceased Diane Arbus. The Seeff pictures were repurposed as 12 perforated postcards inside the sleeve, while Frank's Main Street photographs were used in the gatefold and back cover collage made by Van Hamersveld, which features other pictures Frank took of the band and their crew\u2014including their assistant Chris O'Dell, a former acquaintance of Van Hamersveld who brought him to the Stones\u2014and other The Americans outtakes."

        "content": "Exile on Main St. was first released on 12 May 1972 as a double album by Rolling Stones Records. It was the band's tenth studio album released in the United Kingdom. Preceded by the UK (number 5) and US (number 7) Top 10 hit \"Tumbling Dice\", Exile on Main St was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 1 worldwide just as the band embarked on their celebrated 1972 American Tour. Their first American tour in three years, it featured many songs from the new album. The Richards-sung \"Happy\" was released as a second single to capitalize on the tour; it would peak at number 22 in the United States in August.After the release of Exile on Main St., Allen Klein sued the Rolling Stones for breach of settlement because five songs on the album were composed while Jagger and Richards were under contract with his company, ABKCO: \"Sweet Virginia\", \"Loving Cup\", \"All Down the Line\", \"Shine a Light\" and \"Stop Breaking Down\" (written by Robert Johnson but re-interpreted by Jagger and Richards). ABKCO acquired publishing rights to the songs, giving it a share of the royalties from Exile on Main St., and was able to release another album of Rolling Stones songs, More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies).Exile on Main St. was not well received by some contemporary critics, who found the quality of the songs inconsistent. Reviewing in July 1972 for Rolling Stone, Lenny Kaye said the record has \"a tight focus on basic components of the Stones' sound as we've always known it,\" including blues-based rock music with a \"pervading feeling of blackness\". However, he added that the uneven quality of songs means \"the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come\". Richard Williams of Melody Maker was more enthusiastic and deemed it the band's best album, writing that it will \"take its place in history\" as the music \"utterly repulses the sneers and arrows of outraged put down artists. Once and for all, it answers any questions about their ability as rock 'n' rollers.\" Geoffrey Cannon of The Guardian agreed, stating: \"Exile On Main Street will go down as [the Stones'] classic album, made at the height of their musical powers and self-confidence.\" The NME's Roy Carr gave additional praise to the tracks, praising the styles present, the performances of the band and the lyrical content. In a year-end list for Newsday, Christgau named it the best album of 1972, stating the \"fagged-out masterpiece\" marks the peak of rock music for the year as it \"explored new depths of record-studio murk, burying Mick's voice under layers of cynicism, angst and ennui\"."

        "content": "Critics later reassessed Exile on Main St. favourably, and by the late 1970s it had become viewed as the Rolling Stones' greatest album. In retrospect, Janovitz called it \"the greatest, most soulful, rock & roll record ever made\" because it seamlessly distills \"perhaps all the essential elements of rock & roll up to 1971, if not beyond\". He added that it is \"the single greatest rock & roll record of all time\", distinguished from other contending albums by the Beatles or Pet Sounds, which are more \"brilliant pop records\". On the response to the album, Richards said, \"When [Exile] came out it didn't sell particularly well at the beginning, and it was also pretty much universally panned. But within a few years the people who had written the reviews saying it was a piece of crap were extolling it as the best frigging album in the world.\"In 2003, Jagger said, \"Exile is not one of my favourite albums, although I think the record does have a particular feeling. I'm not too sure how great the songs are, but put together it's a nice piece. However, when I listen to Exile it has some of the worst mixes I've ever heard. I'd love to remix the record, not just because of the vocals, but because generally I think it sounds lousy. At the time Jimmy Miller was not functioning properly. I had to finish the whole record myself, because otherwise there were just these drunks and junkies. Of course I'm ultimately responsible for it, but it's really not good and there's no concerted effort or intention.\" Jagger also stated he did not understand the praise among Rolling Stones fans because the album did not yield many hits.Richards also said, \"Exile was a double album. And because it's a double album you're going to be hitting different areas, including 'D for Down', and the Stones really felt like exiles. We didn't start off intending to make a double album; we just went down to the south of France to make an album and by the time we'd finished we said, 'We want to put it all out.' The point is that the Stones had reached a point where we no longer had to do what we were told to do. Around the time Andrew Oldham left us, we'd done our time, things were changing and I was no longer interested in hitting Number One in the charts every time. What I want to do is good shit\u2014if it's good they'll get it some time down the road.\""

This remaster was initially released in a Collector's Edition CD, which replicated in miniature many elements of the original vinyl album packaging, including the postcards insert.\nUniversal Music, which remastered and re-released the rest of the post-1970 Rolling Stones catalogue in 2009, issued a new remastering of Exile on Main St. in Europe on 17 May 2010 and in the United States the next day, featuring a bonus disc with ten new tracks. Of the ten bonus tracks, only two are undoctored outtakes from the original sessions: an early version of \"Tumbling Dice\" entitled \"Good Time Women\", and \"Soul Survivor\", the latter featuring a Richards lead vocal (with dummy/placeholder lyrics). The other tracks received overdubs just prior to release on this package, with new lead vocals by Jagger on all except \"I'm Not Signifying\", backing vocals in places by past and current Stones tour singers Cindy Mizelle and Lisa Fischer, and several new guitar parts by Keith Richards and Mick Taylor on \"Plundered My Soul.\" On the selection of tracks, Richards said, \"Well, basically it's the record and a few tracks we found when we were plundering the vaults. Listening back to everything we said, 'Well, this would be an interesting addition.'\". All harmonica heard was added during 2010 sessions by Jagger, and Richards added a new guitar lead on \"So Divine\". \"Title 5\" is not an actual outtake from the sessions for Exile, it is an outtake from early 1967 sessions. It features the MRB effect (mid-range boost) from a Vox Conqueror or Supreme amp, as used by Richards in 1967 and 1968. \"Loving Cup\" is an outtake from early June 1969, but is actually an edit from two outtakes. The first 2 minutes and 12 seconds is the well-known 'drunk' version, as has been available on bootlegs since the early 1990s, but the second part is spliced from a second, previously unknown take. \"Following the River\" features Jagger overdubs on a previously uncirculated track featuring Nicky Hopkins on piano.\nThe re-released album entered at number one in the UK charts, almost 38 years to the week after it first occupied that position. The album also re-entered at number two in the US charts selling 76,000 during the first week. The bonus disc, available separately as Exile on Main St Rarities Edition exclusively in the US at Target also charted, debuting at number 27 with 15,000 copies sold.\nIt was released once again in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version."

The first time they battled with club, sword or machine gun. The second time they had none of these weapons. Yet this by far, was the greatest battle. It was fought with abiding faith and raw courage and in the end, Victory was achieved. This is the story of such a group of men. To them this film is dedicated.\n\nDuring World War II, U.S. Army Lieutenant Ken Wilocek is shot in the back by a sniper, injuring his spinal cord. In the years that follow, he faces a series of ongoing struggles in accepting his condition, in rehabilitation and in re-entering society. The film also focuses on the challenges facing Ken and Ellen, his fianc\u00e9e, as individuals and as a couple, before and after they marry. It also highlights events in the lives of the other men in the Veterans Administration hospital, from a wedding celebration to a sudden death from meningitis. Dr. Brock heads the team of doctors, nurses and physical therapists. Near the end of the film, when Ken accuses him of not understanding the difficulties threatening his marriage, Brock tells Ken about his own frustration: \"I can never see a patient walk out of here, never. I can keep a man alive, but in his heart he feels I failed him. You feel that way, don't you? Took me a long time to get used to that.\" He reveals that he began specializing in paraplegia 18 years ago, after his wife was injured in a car accident. \"Paraplegia was a new field, then. At least she didn't have to suffer too long ... I'd give anything I've got to know that when I go home I'd find her there, waiting for me, in a wheelchair.\" He can't promise that everything will work out with Ellen, but if she loves Ken, and he behaves, chances are good. Anyway, he says, Ken has a lot of living to do, and he has to do it for himself.\nKen drives to Ellen's parents' home, some distance from the hospital, takes out his wheelchair and goes up the steep brick front walk until a step blocks him. Ellen comes out. \"You've come a long way\", she says. \"Do you want me to help you up the steps?\" He replies, \"Please.\" The film ends in a long shot of Ellen helping him to push his wheelchair into the house."

The subject of having children (and, by implication, sexual relations) with a paraplegic husband is discussed, and Brock tells them that the ability to beget children varies in individual cases, but was unlikely overall. (Late in the film, Ellen asks Dr. Brock about children\u2014or more specifically, her parents' desire for grandchildren.)\nUpon release, The Men received generally positive reviews, particularly for its screenplay. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 77% based on reviews from 13 critics. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave the film a positive review and wrote: \"Stern in its intimations of the terrible consequences of war, this film is a haunting and affecting, as well as a rewarding, drama to have at this time.\" Variety also gave a favorable review, and noted: \"Producer Stanley Kramer turns to the difficult cinematic subject of paraplegics, so expertly treated as to be sensitive, moving and yet, withal, entertaining and earthy-humored.\"Brando's screen debut received much praise, and The Hollywood Reporter acclaimed him as \u201can important new star in the Hollywood horizon.\" Variety saw it differently: \"Brando fails to deliver with the necessary sensitivity and inner warmth which would transform an adequate portrayal into an expert one. Slight speech impediment which sharply enhanced his Streetcar role jars here. His supposed college graduate depiction is consequently not completely convincing.\"In 1950, The New York Times' Bosley Crowther covered the film in several articles."

James said in an interview with the digital newspaper Scotsman.com: \"I'm sure a lot of fans will be excited by the following: It's closer in spirit to the first album \u2013 it's got real soul to it. We've gone more for the emotional, tugging at the heartstrings approach. We went off on a bit of a rock tangent on the last album. It was good fun but it's time to get back to our roots.\"\n\nOn 21 March 2008, James Walsh wrote: \nThere has been an emphasis on strong melodies and simple arrangements for this album and the guitar playing of Richard Warren has definitely enhanced the sound. I'm not one for slagging off the last album and saying this one is 100 times better because the last album definitely had its merits. However we have spent a lot longer writing and recording this one and the result is the perfect companion to Love Is Here.\nAccording to Manchester Evening News, there isn't a particular theme to All the Plans but \"married life and international politics are some of the key ingredients.\" Walsh said, \"We've tried to write classic songs.\"\n\nIn an interview with James Oldham, Walsh commented that he thought the band had perhaps become a bit too defensive to media impressions: \nWe wanted to prove people wrong. Working with Phil Spector on the second record [he actually only produced two tracks before he was fired] and then making a more American sounding rock record [2005's On the Outside] was just our way of trying to prove ourselves to our detractors. The new album is us realising that that was unnecessary and returning to the sound that we love and established us in the first place.\" \nThe album was postponed one week in order not to clash with U2's then-forthcoming album, No Line on the Horizon. According to Walsh, when the band was recording a live session on Radio 2 on 13 January 2009, radio hosts Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie highlighted the fact that Starsailor would release All the Plans on the same day as U2 and else suggest calling Bono and \"toss a coin for who moves their release date.\" Bono called \"heads\" ,winning the toss, and so All the Plans was postponed for a week."

According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 62, based on 9 reviews.On 5 February 2009, the newspaper Washington Square News posted the world's first review of All the Plans, giving a generally positive assessment. Kadeen Griffiths from Washington Square News wrote that: \"The band's fourth studio album is both its first with Virgin Records and with Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood. The result is a cohesive blend of solid beats and fantastic harmonies. The addition of subtle, simple sounds like the tambourine on \"Boy in Waiting\" and the piano intro to \"Change My Mind\" gives the album a homey, personal feel. Tambourine and piano may not be the most innovative, but they provide a glimpse into the heart and soul of the band through their simple sounds.\"On 13 February 2009, Nigel Goulds from Belfast Telegraph stated, \"The band have served up another collection of heart-tugging tracks which again benefit from James Walsh's \u2013 who's based in Belfast much of the time \u2013 unique set of vocal cords. There's really nothing new to add to the Starsailor repertoire but when they produce songs of uncluttered grandeur they really are in a league of their own.\"On 26 February 2009, The Guardian gave the album its first rave review, praising the quality of the songs, the emotional core, and Ron Wood's guitar work, summarising \"With no one expecting it but themselves Starsailor have delivered.\" PopMatters called the lyrics \"a rather pedestrian litany of breakup woes\" but concurred that the melodies were well written and asserted that they, and most especially Walsh's vocals, more than made up for such flaws. They concluded \"Starsailor are the most consistently good of the English pop troupes, with each of their efforts succeeding gracefully at what they attempt to accomplish.\"On 8 March 2009, Dan Cairns from The Times claimed that, \"What has changed is that the self-consciousness and anxiety that marred 2005's On the Outside has gone. On All the Plans, Starsailor sound like a band in love again with being a band,\" and added that \"there is a real sense here of a band finally settling into their own skin, and rather liking the feeling.\"On 9 March 2009, Andrew Hirst from the Huddersfield Daily Examiner said that, \"Now nine years into their topsy turvy career, Starsailor have reached a new peak with an album of stunning elegance and presence.\"On 12 March 2009, The Glaswegian named All the Plans as \"album of the week,\" stating that, \"After their last misfiring album, All the Plans can be seen as something of a comeback. It's also a return to form, as, while the Chorley lads may have lost a little ground, they've not lost their way with emotional, melodic music. The title track, which boasts an appearance from Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, could be Oasis at their most anthemic, while James Walsh's voice has rarely sounded better than it does on \"Hurts Too Much.\" The real stars of the show are the rootsy \"Stars and Stripes\" and the album's penultimate track \"Listen Up,\" which might be the best song the band ever wrote.\"However, Mojo wrote a negative review, stating that, \"You try to remember a single melody or hook from the record and you're found wanting\", while James Skinner of Drowned in Sound went as far as to single out the lyrics to 'Change My Mind', stating that \"Starsailor are so wantonly unoriginal, so brazenly mediocre on every level, it's almost like they don\u2019t even realise that they are and totally mean all this stuff.\" Entertainment.ie's review echoed these sentiments, remarking \"If you're looking for any more reasons to dislike Starsailor, you'll find them in abundance on album number four, which is a continuation of the dull pub-rock sound that they've rarely deviated from during their nine-year career.\" Gillian Watson of The Skinny was yet another voice in this chorus, asserting that \"The culprit here is frontman James Walsh, whose banal lyrics and achingly sincere vocals are a wearying and occasionally embarrassing listen.\""

During the theft, 10-year-old Peter (David Mendenhall), slips aboard the freighter to hide, and the pirates steal the ship unaware he is aboard. After the freighter rendezvouses with Hawk's ship, the crew fight to save the life of a comrade wounded during the shootout. Meanwhile, Peter comes out of hiding and asks to be taken home.\nAt first, Hawk considers ransoming the child, but during a skirmish with Company fighters, Hawk's feelings change when Peter courageously volunteers to squeeze into a tight compartment and fixes a damaged power conduit that allows them to escape. Hawk promises to return Peter to his home planet, Procyon III. First, however, Hawk's crew stop to rest at a space station owned by an alien crime lord, Zariatin (Ray Stewart).\nOn Procyon III, Peter's father meets with The Company's security director who decides to locate the boy with an advanced robot ship. This  massive, fully automated battle cruiser can track an identity tag that Peter wears around his neck.\nBack at Zariatin's station, a pair of bounty hunters spot Peter and realize he is a \"Company kid\" worth a hefty ransom. When Peter wanders off, Flightplan (Thom Christopher), a psychic alien member of Hawk's crew, senses the boy is in danger. When Hawk finds him, Zariatin arrives and is furious a child is snooping around his station. Hawk promises the kid will not be a problem, but threatens to kill Zariatin if he tries to lay a hand on him.\nWhile Hawk and crew relax in the bar, a bored Peter slips out of his cabin and the bounty hunters follow. Meanwhile, Zariatin calls Hawk to remind him that his service fees are long past due. Zeriatin demands that Hawk steal four Company fuel ships from a depot on Regulus V, but to guarantee performance, the boy must remain at the station. Hawk refuses to leave Peter behind, but he agrees to steal the ships. He orders his crew member Amanda (Patsy Pease) to take Peter home in one of ships once the job is accomplished.\nHawk returns to Peter's cabin, but finds the boy missing and races back to the bar. In the meantime, Peter spots the bounty hunters and a chase ensues, but he is captured. Thinking Zeriatin has taken Peter, Hawk confronts him, but just then, Zariatin is alerted that the bounty hunters are making an unauthorized departure which Hawk believes can only mean that they have the boy. Hawk immediately chases after the bounty hunters, but they encounter the Company robot ship. Programmed for self-defense, the ship reacts to being fired upon and destroys the bounty hunter's ship. Peter survives by using an escape pod which Hawk retrieves.\nBack on course to Regulus V, Hawk teaches Peter how to fire the ship's lasers using asteroids as target practice. Once at the planet, Hawk's crew go after the tanker ships and Hawk says goodbye to Peter. After a battle with security robots, Hawk's crew takes the ships, but nearby, the Company observes the theft with the robot ship and orders it to follow the convoy.\nAs Amanda travels to take Peter home, her ship is ambushed by Zeriatin's starfighters and crashes on a nearby planet. Amanda is killed by Zeriatin's thugs, and Peter is captured for ransom. Flightplan rescues the boy but is shot by Zeriatin's guards. Peter finds Hawk in the bar with his two remaining crewmen. The station is alerted to the approaching robot ship. The station launches several defense ships in response, but none can stop it. Peter and the remainder of Hawk's crew try to flee the station, but they are confronted by Zeriatin and his men. The last two of Hawk's crew are killed off, and Hawk manages to kill Zeriatin, but not before being shot himself. Peter struggles to help Hawk to his ship where they escape before the station explodes.\nThe robot ship pursues Hawk's ship. Unable to outrun it, Hawk tells Peter to fire the lasers the moment the robot ship lowers its defenses, which it must do to fire its weapons. Peter successfully destroys the enemy ship. A weakened Hawk returns to consciousness and takes Peter home. A sad and worried Peter disembarks the ship, and Hawk, severely wounded, flies back into space."

Her cover was published online and released as a single on 10 February 2017. On the digital single, two different remixes of her song were featured as well as an instrumental version. Lee decided to rework the song while in Italy, working on the music video of her song \"Speak to Me\" recorded for the film Voice from the Stone (2017). The singer revealed that she had heard \"L'amore esiste\" on the radio, and afterwards \"it seemed to follow me everywhere, got under my skin and just wouldn't leave\". She elaborated, \"I couldn\u2019t stop listening to it, over and over the whole way home. I started piecing together what the lyrics meant and wrote my own twist on them in English.\" The singer afterwards presented her work to producer Guy Sigsworth whom she convinced to join her in New York and help her recreate \"L'amore esiste\". Dave Eggar was the one responsible for the string arrangement and the group recorded the song in a week at Flux Studios. Lee further elaborate on the work behind the song, saying,\n\n\"What an incredibly fulfilling experience it was to make this beautiful thing. And with such a talented, down-to-earth, and inspired team- with no rules or limitations beyond the ones we created. Guy pushed me in new ways and I learned a few things. It was a unique honor to work beside someone I admire so much on something that at the time had no plan, no album to go on, and made no sense other than how good it felt. It's easy to get bogged down by the 'point' sometimes, when what matters most in my opinion, in music-making, is following your heart. Finding a way to satisfy that deep need to express something that can't be said with words alone.\"\n\nThe ballad begins with a gentle synthesizer and a delicate melody which progressively adds more layers, including string arrangements. Lee's vocal performance in the song was described as \"tranquil, subdued\" during the verses and with \"uplifting power and a soulful wail\" during the chorus. Joe DiVita from the website Loudwire felt that overall, the song \"resides on the more soothing side of things\". Idolator writer Mike Wass praised \"Love Exists\", calling it \"the best power ballad Celine Dion never sang \u2014 albeit with a pleasing twist of darkness\".

Highly praised by the critics and the audience, the film succeeds in portraying the tenderness, the genuine integrity and the deep humanity between the controversial writer and his wife. It gathers sequences from Madrid to Helsinki to Rio de Janeiro. It includes sequences life in Lanzarote, and during trips around the world (presenting Jos\u00e9's books, signing autographs, making speeches) as well as their simple, transient and quotidian moments during the period Jos\u00e9 writes his \"The Elephant's Journey\".

The film shows us an unknown Saramago, unravels any preconceived ideas we may have about the man and demonstrates that genius and simplicity can indeed be compatible. Jos\u00e9 and Pilar is a glimpse into one of the greatest creators of the Twentieth Century and shows us that, as Saramago said, \"everything can be told in a different way.\""

Alex Henderson of AllMusic noted that Martin wanted a different production style for her second album. While her first album had a very slick, high-tech, synthesizer-driven sound, this album favored a more organic production style. Still, in terms of the songs themselves, this release was not all that radical a departure from her first album. Martin was still aiming to be a commercial, radio-friendly pop/rock vocalist. Her appreciation for R&B showed up on tracks like \"Try Me\", the title song, and the single \"Possessive Love\". \"This Is Serious had the makings of a hit,\" Henderson wrote, \"Even though 'Marilyn Martin' is the more essential of her two albums, 'This Is Serious' is also quite enjoyable.\"In The Philadelphia Inquirer of May 29, 1988, a review of the album stated \"Martin has built a career as a backup singer for many artists, including Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Nicks. The usual problem when a good backup singer performs as a lead singer is that she's so used to subsuming her vocal personality to another that the result is technically perfect but bland music. Martin neatly avoids this trap by permitting the rough edges in her voice to surface and by singing in an intimate, conversational tone. It helps, too, that with the exception of a few bombastic ballads, her material is strong pop-rock.\""

Dio, who had read Sir Walter Scott, Arthurian tales, and science fiction growing up, had previously used fantasy lyrics in his early 1970s band Elf.

Holy Diver remains the undisputed highlight of Dio's career...and, indeed, one of the finest pure heavy metal albums of the 1980s.\" Canadian reviewer Martin Popoff describes the album as \"quintessential traditional metal\", with Ronnie James Dio \"almost single-handedly reinventing gothic hard rock for the '80s, incorporating strong melodic hooks and more than the genre's usual share of velvety, classical-based pyrotechnics.\" Kerrang! gave the album a positive review in 1983 and Holy Diver ended up at no. 5 in the British magazine's End of Year list of best releases. Today, Kerrang! still considers it a \"perfect melodic metal album\" and an \"essential purchase\".The rock historian Ian Christe relates that for the post-Sabbath solo career \"Dio simplified his stories substantially for a younger heavy metal audience. The 1983 debut Holy Diver, by his band Dio, reduced lush moral landscapes to simple good-versus-evil conflicts, using the lyrical duality of 'Rainbow in the Dark' and 'Holy Diver' to raise questions about deceit and hypocrisy in romance and religion. In the sharp contrasts of Dio's imagery, there was always a built-in contradiction that fed adolescent revolt: a black side to every white light, and a hidden secret behind every loud proclamation of truth. In a similar way, Dio's music balanced torrents of rage with brief acoustic interludes.\"On IGN's list of \"Top 25 Metal Albums\", Holy Diver is at number 8, and this statement followed, \"In all his bands, in all his roles, in all his musical vagabond choices, Ronnie James Dio has been fortunate enough to be associated with some of heavy metal's best -- Sabbath, Rainbow, and his own band Dio. To best represent his tenure in the genre, one must look no farther than Holy Diver. His first album with his new band was also his best. It is one of metal's best albums, and it spawned two of the greatest metal songs of the '80s: 'Holy Diver' and 'Rainbow in the Dark'. Featuring the underrated Vivian Campbell on guitar, this album showed that Dio could do it on his own.\" In 2017, it was ranked 16th on Rolling Stone's list of \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\"."

Ashok is a businessman who is facing some trouble at his company, but hides this from his wife and brother, Ajay. Later Ajay is sent to Bangalore for training.\nAjay gets a message that his brother is in Bangalore. When he reaches the hotel he finds that Ashok has already left without leaving any message for him. Later that day he receives a call from Ashok, who in an inebriated state, is trying to tell him something which has been troubling him for a long time but the phone cuts abruptly. When he returns from Bangalore, he finds that his brother is missing. His inquiries and a police complaint only lead him to frustration and violent outbursts. Some time later, he comes across Ashok's friend (Annu Kapoor), a drug addict, who reveals all the dark secrets.\nEarlier when Ashok faced losses in his business, a reputed businessman Balwant Rai (Amrish Puri) had come to his rescue. Balwant becomes a partner in Ashok's company and settles all the debts. This arrangement is in fact a cover for Balwant's illegal activities. Balwant routinely traps honest people to provide cover for his illegal business and Ashok is one of his innocent victims. Initially when Ashok resists, Balwant threatens him of dire consequences, but Ashok persists with his requests to shut down illegal trade. Later, Ashok collects evidence to frame Balwant and that's where the trouble starts. Balwant kidnaps Ashok and tortures him to reveal where he has kept the evidence.\nSomehow the henchmen of Balwant find out Ajay's knowledge of this incriminating evidence and Balwant instantly kills Ashok. Ajay is later framed for the murder and accused of having an illicit relationship with his sister-in-law. Ajay realises in court that the roots of evil are very deep and even his near ones have turned hostile towards him. His faith in the law is crushed and he seeks justice his own way. His sister-in-law is not able to bear the trauma and cruel comments of her neighbours and commits suicide.\nWhile in jail, Ajay makes friends with some other hardcore convicts, who are good at heart. Then one day, they escape from the jail by overpowering the guards. Then begins Ajay's fight for justice, to take down Balwant Rai. One by one he takes down the cronies of Balwant who had framed him in the murder. Varsha is captured by Balwant, but Ajay rescues her and chases Balwant to an amusement park. He beats up Balwant before the police pull them apart and arrest Balwant. Varsha comes and embraces Ajay while slipping him a secret gun. In a form of poetic justice,  Ajay fatally shoots Balwant in front of people and police, who are meek witnesses. The film ends as Ajay is arrested."

He is flustered by women's priorities and avoids commitment, much preferring transient physical relationships. At the office of his eye surgeon, Peter meets a leggy, eye-catching strong-willed woman named Terri Kozlenko. He likes her very much, but discovers later that she is a single mother to three children, Caroline, Linda, and David. The first thing she learns about him, from his ophthalmologist, is that he's in danger of losing his sight, which would make it impossible for him to continue his work.\nNevertheless, they develop a close friendship that grows into romance, when Peter realizes that Terri is the only woman who can tolerate his strong anti-feminist opinions. When she rejects his plan of a sexual relationship conducted exclusively at his bachelor pad (so that he doesn't have to bond with her demanding family), he reluctantly proposes to her. They get married and he moves into her apartment, but her rogue ex-husband Stephen appears to spend more time with their children. Stephen and Peter clash at first, but they soon become good drinking friends, much to Terri's disapproval. Peter also begins to bond with David, who has had no stable male role model with his father perpetually off photographing war zones.\nPeter's eyesight gradually worsens and his boss, Howard Mann, begins to criticize his work. On the advice of his ophthalmologist, Peter schedules an operation that could cure his problem, and tries to keep it a secret from Terri to avoid worrying her.  Howard gets hysterical and inadvertently ruins Peter's alibi of working away from home on a book. Terri tells him that she had known that Peter was going blind before they ever got involved. This revelation enrages Peter, and he accuses her of only going to bed with him out of pity.  She says she never once felt sorry for him, but his pride is too wounded to accept this.\nThe operation is partly successful in restoring Peter's vision, and he moves out of the house to his old studio to begin work on a new book, The Last Flower.\nStephen is killed on assignment, which traumatizes everyone, but Linda in particular.  Her stammer is getting progressively worse. Terri insists she go talk to Peter, who takes her on an imaginary visual tour of his new book\u2014which is about war and human stupidity, but also love and hope and restoration. She begins to conquer her stammer, and he realizes he was wrong to leave his new family, who need him.  He meets Terri at a party related to the release of his new book, and they renew their bond.  Much against his misanthropic nature, he is forced to rejoin humanity."

The members, who had met each other through mutual friends, had all been in a prior band, the HIVs, which had broken up after writing two songs. Guitarist Randy Strohmeyer was invited to join Finch after they saw him play with his band Evita Fresh. Strohmeyer became friends with Drive-Thru Records' owner Richard Reines, following a fan letter he had sent in a few years earlier about the Rx Bandits. Strohmeyer had suggested that the label check out his former band, which they showed no interest in. When he mentioned this to the other members of Finch, they were enthusiastic about potentially signing with the label. Richard offered the band a chance to perform for Drive-Thru Records and subsequently invited his sister, and co-label owner, Stefanie Reines to the performance. The pair were impressed by the performance and signed Finch afterwards, though they did not sign a contract for another 11 months.Pre-production and demos were done at DML Studios in Escondido, California, in February and April 2001. Finch began recording What It Is to Burn in June of that year at Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, California, with producer Mark Trombino. Strohmeyer was a fan of Trombino's production work, while Pappas enjoyed Bleed American (2001) by Jimmy Eat World, which Trombino produced. The Reines' sent Finch's demos to Trombino, who was interested in producing them. The band started tracking guitars for the album in July 2001.Strohmeyer used Fender guitars and Marshall amplifiers, while Linares used ESP guitars and Mesa amplifiers.

Daryl Palumbo of Glassjaw performs guest vocals on \"Grey Matter\" and \"Project Mayhem\". Doherty, Linares and Strohmeyer first met Palumbo at a Deftones show, and later when they played with Earth Crisis, and kept in contact with him. While they were recording for the album, the band asked Palumbo if he wanted to participate, prompting in him flying out to the band. Trombino completed programming before he mixed the recordings at The Robot Factory in Los Angeles, California; Stephen Marcussen mastered the tracks at Marcussen Mastering."

The album received comparisons to the music of Glassjaw, New Found Glory, Linkin Park, and Blink-182. Barcalow switches between crooning and screaming on What It Is to Burn; though he has a pop punk-inspired vocal delivery, his screams were compared to the likes of Palumbo and Deftones frontman Chino Moreno. The writing process revolved around Finch jamming. Linares said they could sometimes write a song in two hours, and at other times take a whole day. Collectively, Strohmeyer said it took a year to write all the material on the album, which was done at either Strohmeyer or Pappas' home. He also said that if they did not go with Trombino, they would be \"less electronics\", adding that he was \"such a genius when it comes to programming [...] he came up with some of the most amazing beats\". They had an acoustic song, \"Once Upon My Night Stand\", which was dropped as it did not fit the atmosphere of the album.The opening track, \"New Beginnings\", begins with a distorted guitar fading in, before the song shifts to aggressive power chords and octave parts. The song sets the tone for What It Is to Burn with its memorable melodies and tuneful choruses. Barcalow said \"Letters to You\" was about the \"emotion of being away from somebody and missing them and trying to keep them happy through communication because you can\u2019t physically see them\". His vocals on the song border on near-screamo in places. Despite the track having three-part harmonies, it was written when the only members in the band who could sing were Barcalow and Strohmeyer. Palumbo's singing voice on \"Grey Matter\" recalled Bad Brains frontman H.R. \"Awake\" was one of Finch's oldest songs, which Barcalow said is about a couple resolving an argument. \"Project Mayhem\" initially existed as a two-minute track, before Trombino altered it into the final version, and incorporated programming. \"Ender\" begins with a subdued intro that steadily coalesces by the third minute, when it progresses with a constant piano part, and ends with an ambient instrumental section. \"What It Is to Burn\" is written from the perspective of a man in hell sending a letter to his partner. Barcalow said it dealt with loneliness and being able to relate with someone that is also experiencing that same emotion."

Exclaim!'s Amber Authier commented that Finch \"doesn't do a bad job\" of merging punk rock and metal together. However, she felt that the lyrical content on What It Is to Burn came across as a \"little too deep, separating the two styles instead of blending them into something a little different.\" Lina Lecaro of the Los Angeles Times said the band bounced \"between soothing croons and throat-burning wails, metallic riffs and bubbly beats,\" a fusion that \"kept things interesting ... even if the shifts weren't always seamless.\" While Barcalow \"proved himself to be a versatile vocalist on tunes ... his range didn't quite make up for his lack of charisma,\" Lecaro added. Kerrang! reviewer Paul Travers criticized the titles of the songs on the album, saying that Finch were \"in need of a good slap ... you can almost taste the salty tang of tears spilling out of the speakers.\""

Matt Bjorke of Roughstock wrote that Farr's \"strong, likable voice [that] is put to ample use on the eleven tracks held within and it also suggests there's even more to the man that we've only scratched the surface of.\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was critical of the album containing country music clich\u00e9s and production that's indebt to hip-hop but gave note of Farr's performance sounding \"freshly showered and eminently respectable,\" concluding that \"[T]his inherent politeness does mean his rowdy redneck ways feel a bit like schtick, but it's a good act performed with enough cheer that Farr's slickness sells Redneck Crazy whenever the tunes drift toward the generic.\" Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time criticized the overall content for utilizing \"the three most standard clich\u00e9s in country music\" found in \"Chicks, Trucks and Beer\" and Farr's vocal delivery for being too hip-hop influenced and \"raspy\", concluding that \"In reality, there's not a whole lot of excitement.

        "content": "\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as the \"White Album\"). It was written by George Harrison, the band's lead guitarist. Harrison wrote \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" as an exercise in randomness inspired by the Chinese I Ching. The song conveys his dismay at the world's unrealised potential for universal love, which he refers to as \"the love there that's sleeping\".\nThe song also serves as a comment on the disharmony within the Beatles after their return from studying transcendental meditation in India in early 1968. This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band's initial apathy towards the composition, which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator, Eric Clapton, to contribute to the recording. Clapton overdubbed a lead guitar part, although he was not formally credited for his contribution. Harrison first recorded it with a sparse backing of acoustic guitar and harmonium \u2013 a version that appeared on the 1996 Anthology 3 outtakes compilation and, with the addition of a string arrangement by George Martin, on the Love soundtrack album in 2006. The full group recording was made in September 1968, at which point the song's folk-based musical arrangement was replaced by a production in the heavy rock style. The recording was one of several collaborations between Harrison and Clapton during the late 1960s and was followed by the pair co-writing the song \"Badge\" for Clapton's group Cream.\nOn release, the song received praise from several music critics, and it has since been recognised as an example of Harrison's maturing as a songwriter beside his Beatles bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Rolling Stone ranked \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" 135th on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", seventh on the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\", and at number 10 on its list of \"The Beatles 100 Greatest Songs\". Clapton's performance was ranked 42nd in Guitar World's 2008 list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\". Harrison and Clapton often performed the song together live, during which they shared the lead guitar role over the closing section. Live versions featuring the pair were included on the Concert for Bangladesh album in 1971 and Live in Japan in 1992. Backed by a band that included McCartney and Ringo Starr, Clapton performed the song at the Concert for George in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death."

        "content": "George Harrison wrote \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" after his return from India, where the Beatles had been studying transcendental meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi during the spring of 1968. The visit had allowed Harrison to re-engage with the guitar as his primary instrument, after focusing on the Indian sitar for the previous two years, and also marked the start of a prolific period for him as a songwriter. Inspiration for the song came to him when he was visiting his parents in Warrington, Cheshire, and he began reading the I Ching, or \"The Book of Changes\". As Harrison put it, \"[the book] seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else, as opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental.\" Embracing this idea of relativism, he committed to writing a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a book, which happened to be \"gently weeps\". Harrison continued to work on the lyrics after this initial writing session.The song reflects the disharmonious atmosphere within the Beatles following their return from India. Harrison had led the band in their highly publicised endorsement of transcendental meditation and viewed this spiritual pursuit as superior in importance to their career momentum. When discussing another song he wrote at this time, \"Not Guilty\", Harrison said it referred to \"the grief I was catching\" from John Lennon and Paul McCartney for leading them to Rishikesh and supposedly hindering the group's career and the launch of their Apple record label. Eric Clapton, with whom Harrison collaborated on several recordings throughout 1968 as a distraction from the Beatles, said that \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" conveyed Harrison's spiritual isolation within the group. Author Jonathan Gould writes that, although in the past each of the Beatles had become temporarily subsumed in fads and personal interests, the level of Harrison's commitment to Indian spirituality as an alternative to the band was unprecedented.A demo that Harrison recorded at his home in Esher includes an unused verse: \"I look at the trouble and hate that is raging / While my guitar gently weeps / As I'm sitting here, doing nothing but ageing \u2026\" This version also includes the line \"The problems you sow are the troubles you're reaping\", which he similarly discarded. An early acoustic guitar and harmonium performance of the song features a slightly different third verse: \"I look from the wings at the play you are staging / While my guitar gently weeps / As I'm sitting here, doing nothing but ageing \u2026\" This version was released on the 1996 compilation Anthology 3 and was used as the basis of the 2006 Love remix, with a string arrangement by George Martin."

        "content": "Apple Records released The Beatles on 22 November 1968. One of four Harrison compositions on the double album, \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was sequenced as the penultimate track on side one in the LP format, between Lennon's \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\" and \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\". The song was issued as the B-side of \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", a McCartney-written song that had also tested the Beatles' patience during the White Album sessions. This single was an international hit, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Switzerland and West Germany, but was not released in Britain or the United States.\nRecalling the release in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever, Nicholas Schaffner said that, in returning to pop/rock songwriting after his excursions into the Indian classical style, Harrison's four White Album songs \"firmly established him as a contender\" beside Lennon and McCartney. In Schaffner's description, \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was the most instantly popular of \"a quartet of more conventionally accessible pop songs [written by Harrison] that many felt were among the finest on the album\". According to Beatles historian Erin Torkelson Weber, the release of the White Album marked the start of a period when many observers began to consider his songs \"equal to some of Lennon and McCartney's best compositions\", a view that was heightened with his two contributions to the Beatles' 1969 album Abbey Road, \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\". New Yorker columnist Mark Hertsgaard, writing in his 1995 book A Day in the Life, said \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was \"the first great composition of George's career and perhaps the single most impressive song on the White Album\".Among contemporary reviews, Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone said that \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was \"one of George Harrison's very best songs\", and likened it to \"Blue Jay Way\" in that it \"recalls California, the simple Baja California beat, the dreamy words of the Los Angeles haze, the organic pace lapping around every room as if in invisible waves\". Wenner found the lyrics \"slightly self-righteous and preaching\", representing \"a general set of incidents, a message, like a sermon, impersonally directed to everyone\", and concluded: \"I am willing to bet something substantial that the lead guitarist on this cut is Eric Clapton, yet another involution of the circular logic on which this song [is] so superbly constructed as a musical piece.\" In his review for the International Times, Barry Miles said the song was a \"great tune\" with \"nice hi-hats\" but a \"lifeless\" guitar part.Alan Smith of the NME credited the \"warm voice\" and \"very strong melody\" to McCartney and said that the track was one of the \"highlights ... moving into a slightly Hendrix thing\" and was bound to be \"Another hit for somebody\". Three weeks later, Smith acknowledged that the singer and composer was in fact Harrison, and added: \"the words are evocative and the melody line is creeping into my mind to stay.\" Geoffrey Cannon wrote in The Guardian: \"George Harrison has seen the truth, and is anxious that we should see our truth. He's a preacher, man of fire. When his songs speak of 'you', the address is direct. He achieves his character in 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', which, with Phil Ochs's 'Tape from California', is the first track I know that succeeds in making magnanimous love serious and touching.\""

In 1973, it appeared on the Beatles' double album compilation 1967\u20131970, as one of only three tracks representing the White Album. Capitol Records included it on The Best of George Harrison in 1976; a year before this, Harrison released a sequel to the song, titled \"This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)\", which also served as the final single issued by Apple in its original incarnation. The Beatles' recording appeared on the soundtrack to Withnail and I, a 1987 comedy film set in late-1960s London and produced by Harrison's company HandMade Films.Writing for The Observer in 2004, Pete Paphides described \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" as \"George Harrison's startling coming of age as a songwriter\" and one of the few tracks that \"pick themselves\" when listeners attempt to edit the double album down to a single disc. In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald was less impressed with the track, saying that it \"exudes a browbeating self-importance which quickly becomes tiresome\". McCartney identified it as one of his favourite selections on the 1995\u201396 Anthology outtakes series, and he grouped the song with \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\" as candidates for Harrison's \"greatest track\". Starr paired it with \"Something\" as \"Two of the finest love songs ever written\", adding: \"they're really on a par with what John and Paul or anyone else of that time wrote.\" In their written tributes to Harrison following his death in November 2001, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards each expressed their admiration for the song. Jagger said: \"It's lovely, plaintive. Only a guitar player could write that ...\"Rolling Stone ranked \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" 136th on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", seventh on the \"100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\", and at number 10 on its list of \"The Beatles 100 Greatest Songs\". Clapton's performance was ranked 42nd in Guitar World's 2008 list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Solos\". Among other critics' lists of the best Beatles songs, Paste magazine and Ultimate Classic Rock each ranked it at number 4, while Mojo placed it at number 17. In his commentary for the Mojo selection, English songwriter Chris Difford said that he had only come to fully appreciate the lyrics following Harrison's death in 2001; describing them as a \"riposte\" to Harrison's bandmates, particularly Lennon and McCartney, Difford added: \"George was the one who came back from India with the spiritual awakening and carried it through to the rest of his life, whereas the others came back with the postcards.\" In 2018, the music staff of Time Out London ranked \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" 20th on their list of the best Beatles songs. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the White Album's release, Jacob Stolworthy of The Independent listed it at number 1 on his ranking of the album's 30 tracks. He said the song was \"hands down one of The Beatles' greatest\" and, having been conceived through \"disharmony \u2013 in the world, as well as in the band he'd grown up with\", \"testament to Harrison's genius\"."

        "content": "Harrison played \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" at every one of his rare concerts as a solo artist. Writing for Mojo in 2003, Ashley Kahn attributed the track's \"classic\" status to its evocation of \"a band falling out of harmony\" and, with regard to the enduring musical bond between Harrison and Clapton, its standing as \"their song\". At Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh, held at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 August 1971, Clapton performed the song on a Gibson Byrdland, a hollow-body guitar more suited to jazz or country music than rock. He later said that this was a poor decision and, as with his substandard playing at the event, one that was indicative of his descent into heroin addiction. In his entry for The Concert for Bangladesh in the book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon nevertheless describes Clapton and Harrison's interplay as \"one of the more thrilling two-man guitar explorations in rock\", adding: \"As they finish each other's thoughts, the two extend and amplify the song's intent: You haven't heard the full gamut of gentle (and not so) guitar weeping until you've heard this.\"The version performed by Harrison during his brief set at the 1987 Prince's Trust Concert reunited him with Starr and Clapton, and features an extended coda with the guitars of Harrison and Clapton interweaving. On their 1991 tour of Japan, Harrison and Clapton performed \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" with additional background vocals. An edit combining parts of the 14 December and 17 December Tokyo Dome performances of the song was included on Harrison's 1992 double album Live in Japan.Harrison also featured the song in the set list for his only other tour as a solo artist, a series of North American concerts over November\u2013December 1974 with Ravi Shankar. Harrison shared the lead guitarist's role with Robben Ford, often extending the piece to eight minutes. While it was a popular inclusion in a set list that barely acknowledged Harrison's past as a former Beatle, his alteration of some of the lyrics \u2013 so that his guitar \"gently smiles\" and \"tries to smile\" \u2013 disappointed many concert-goers and reviewers. Author Simon Leng comments that on Harrison's return to Madison Square Garden towards the end of the tour, his playing on the song nevertheless received a standing ovation."

Harrison participated in the recording, contributing on acoustic guitar and backing vocals. Also issued as a single, Healey's version peaked at number 27 in Canada, number 85 in the UK and number 25 in New Zealand.During the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II concert at Buckingham Palace Garden on 3 June 2002, McCartney performed the song with Clapton, as a tribute to Harrison. The performance appears on the DVD release Party at the Palace. On 29 November the same year, Clapton, backed by a large band that included McCartney, Starr, Dhani Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Marc Mann, performed \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" at the Concert for George in memory of Harrison. Author Ian Inglis writes that while Clapton was already \"permanently associated\" with \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" due to his presence on the White Album recording and the Concert for Bangladesh and Live in Japan versions, his long, closing solo at the Concert for George contained \"perhaps the most expressive\" playing of all those versions.American musician Todd Rundgren covered \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" for the 2003 album Songs from the Material World: A Tribute to George Harrison. Rundgren said of his contribution to the multi-artist tribute: \"[Before the Beatles], I'd never heard the term 'lead guitarist.' George created the job description for my first paying gig, the vocation that I'm still lucky enough to practice today \u2026\" Johnny Loftus of AllMusic views the recording as one of the collection's highlights, saying that Rundgren \"effortlessly replicates the grandeur\" of the Beatles' track. As his personal tribute to Harrison, Peter Frampton released a version of the song on his 2003 album Now.In 2004, when Harrison was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was played in tribute by a large band that included Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Steve Winwood, Marc Mann, Dhani Harrison, Prince and Steve Ferrone. The performance concluded with a highly acclaimed extended guitar solo by Prince, who was also being inducted into the Hall of Fame.Among other cover versions, the song has also been recorded by guitarists such as Marc Ribot, Phish and Charlie Byrd, and on ukulele by Jake Shimabukuro. Toto did a cover version for their album Through the Looking Glass and in a live performance in Live in Amsterdam. Santana did a cover for his twentieth album Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time, in 2010, featuring singer India Arie and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Released as a single, it charted on Billboard's Adult Contemporary. A recording of the song by Regina Spektor appears in the 2016 film Kubo and the Two Strings."

She was the only member of the pop group Wilson Phillips to remain on her label, EMI, after the group broke up in late 1992. The album didn't see strong sales, selling 22,000 copies in the United States according to Billboard.com, but received good reviews. Chynna co-wrote 8 of the album's 11 songs (writing the last track on her own), which featured productions from Rick Nowels, Glen Ballard (who produced the majority of Wilson Phillips' previous work), and Desmond Child. According to Phillips, she was offered $1 million to record a solo album for EMI and was dropped shortly after due to the album's disappointing sales.\nThree singles were commercially released from the album: \"Naked and Sacred\", \"I Live for You\" (which was featured in the end credits of the 1996 film Striptease starring Demi Moore), and \"Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me\" (written by Diane Warren, and later recorded as a duet by country music singers Faith Hill and Tim McGraw for Hill's 1998 album Faith). The album track \"Remember Me\" was released in promo form and sent to U.S. radio in 1996 but was never commercially released."

This version was played on Russian radio stations to promote the release and got positive reviews by Bon Jovi fans, but Olivia's version appeared on the Russian CD due to Universal Music Russia's decision.\nTwo new songs, \"Last Man Standing\" and \"Thief of Hearts\", were written and recorded for inclusion of the album. \"Last Man Standing\" was a song revealing lead singer Jon Bon Jovi's anger toward the state of the music industry. Bon Jovi believed that it would become more difficult for artists to find success in the music industry. This was Bon Jovi's reason for later removing the two new songs from the album, however Last Man Standing was later reworked and turned into a much more heavy aggressive rock song for inclusion on Bon Jovi's 2005 studio album, Have a Nice Day, a somewhat opposite effect of the This Left Feels Right project. The original version of \"Last Man Standing\" and \"Thief of Hearts\" were both later released as part of the box set 100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong and are also included as live versions on the This Left Feels Right Live DVD."

Among the other persons who are shown being subjected to the deprogramming are a corrupt politician and a drug dealer.The film also depicts a conflict among the members of the Drop Squad as to the tactics they should use. Rocky (Vondie Curtis-Hall), the squad's leader, believes in using only nonviolent tactics, such as \"subjecting them to a barrage of slides, posters, slogans and family photographs in hopes of restoring their sense of community\", while Garvey (Ving Rhames) believes that harsher methods have become necessary."

I was getting out of bed and putting on a coat and the director finessed me into doing it nude. There was absolutely no reason on earth for me to get out of that bed naked.

        "content": "The Simpsons is an American  animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Developed by Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon, the series is a satirical depiction of American life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. Set in the fictional town of Springfield, it caricatures society, Western culture, television, and the human condition.\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer Brooks. He created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it sounded similar to \"simpleton\". The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u20131990).\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989, 763 episodes of the show have been broadcast. It is the longest-running American animated series, longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, both in seasons and individual episodes. A feature-length film, The Simpsons Movie, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, to critical and commercial success, with a sequel in development as of 2018. The series has also spawned numerous comic book series, video games, books, and other related media, as well as a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The Simpsons is a joint production by Gracie Films and 20th Television.On January 26, 2023, the series was renewed for its 35th and 36th seasons, taking the show through the 2024\u201325 television season. Both seasons contain a combined total of 51 episodes. Seven of these episodes are season 34 holdovers, while the other 44 will be produced in the production cycle of the upcoming seasons, bringing the show's overall episode total up to 801. Season 35 premiered on October 1, 2023.The Simpsons received widespread acclaim throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered its \"golden age\". Since then, it has been criticized for a perceived decline in quality. Time named it the 20th century's best television series, and Erik Adams of The A.V. Club named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\". On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 37 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and 2 Peabody Awards. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase of \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcom television series."

        "content": "The Simpsons uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle. However, because of its animated nature, The Simpsons' scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment. Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of television channels, which enables the producers to make jokes about the entertainment industry and the press.Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias. Al Jean acknowledged in an interview that \"We [the show] are of liberal bent.\" The writers often evince an appreciation for progressive leanings, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum. The show portrays government and large corporations as evil entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are dismissive to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent. Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.Sexuality is often a source of jokes in the series or serves as the theme of certain episodes. Even though homosexuals are sometimes sources of gags, the series often comments on how American society treats them, with \"Homer's Phobia\" devoting an entire episode to the family making a gay friend and Homer's initial hostility to him. In 1990, The Simpsons became the first animated early evening show to depict a kiss between two men in \"Simpson and Delilah\"."

The Simpsons has been used as a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including Clue, Scrabble, Monopoly, Operation, and The Game of Life, as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons Jeopardy!. Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial Simpsons books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of Chappelle's Show. In particular, seasons one through seventeen were released on DVD for 13 years between September 2001 to December 2014 in the U.S./Canada (Region 1), Europe (Region 2), and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America (Region 4). However, on April 8, 2015, Al Jean announced that the Season 17 DVD would be the last one ever produced, leaving the collection from Seasons 1 to 17, Season 20 (released out of order in 2010), with Seasons 18, 19, and 21 onwards unreleased. Jean also stated that the deleted scenes and commentaries would try to be released to the Simpsons World app, and that they were pushing for Simpsons World to be expanded outside of the U.S. Two years later, however, on July 22, 2017, it was announced that Season 18 would be released on December 5, 2017, on DVD. Another two years later, on July 20, 2019, it was announced that Season 19 would be released on December 3, 2019, on DVD.In 2003, about 500 companies around the world were licensed to use Simpsons characters in their advertising. As a promotion for The Simpsons Movie, twelve 7-Eleven stores were transformed into Kwik-E-Marts and sold The Simpsons related products. These included \"Buzz Cola\", \"Krusty-O\" cereal, pink doughnuts with sprinkles, and \"Squishees\".In 2008, consumers around the world spent $750 million on merchandise related to The Simpsons, with half of the amount originating from the United States. By 2009, 20th Century Fox had greatly increased merchandising efforts. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, to commemorate the show's twentieth anniversary. The Simpsons is the first television series still in production to receive this recognition. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. Approximately one billion were printed, but only 318 million were sold, costing the Postal Service $1.2 million."

        "content": "Paul Ehrlich is a physician working in a German hospital. He is dismissed for his constant disregard for hospital rules, which are bound by bureaucratic red tape. The reason for his conflict is his steadily rising interest in research for selective color staining, the marking of cells and microorganisms using certain dyes and marking agents which have a certain 'affinity' for their target and nothing else. Emil von Behring, whom Dr. Ehrlich meets and befriends while experimenting with his staining techniques, is impressed with Dr. Ehrlich's staining methods and refers to it as 'specific staining,' adding that this optical microscopy  diagnostic technique is one of the greatest achievements in science. \nAfter attending a medical presentation of the eminent Dr. Robert Koch demonstrating that tuberculosis is a bacterial disease, Ehrlich is able to obtain a sample of the isolated bacterium. After an intense time of research and experimentation in his own lab, paired with a portion of luck and thanks to the empathy of his wife, he is able to develop a viable staining process for the microbe. This result is honored by Koch and medical circles as another highly valuable contribution to diagnostics.\nDuring his work Dr. Ehrlich is infected with tuberculosis, then an often-deadly, uncurable disease. To recover, Ehrlich travels with his wife Hedwig to the hot dry climate of Egypt. There he starts to discover the properties of immunity. This discovery helps Ehrlich and colleague Dr. von Behring to fight a diphtheria epidemic that is killing off many children in the country. The two doctors are rewarded for their efforts.\nEhrlich concentrates on work to create \"magic bullets\" - chemicals injected into the blood to fight various diseases, thus pioneering antibiotic chemotherapy for infectious diseases. Ehrlich's laboratory has the help of a number of scientists like Sahachiro Hata. The medical board, headed by Dr. Hans Wolfert, believes much of Ehrlich's work is a waste of money and resources and fight for a reduction, just as Ehrlich begins to work on a cure for syphilis. Ehrlich is financially backed by the widow of Jewish banker Georg Speyer, Franziska Speyer, and after 606 tries he finally discovers the remedy for the disease. This substance, first called \"606\", then Salvarsan, is now known as Arsphenamine.\nThe joy of discovery is short-lived, as 38 patients who receive the treatment die. Dr. Wolfert denounces the cure publicly and accuses Ehrlich of murdering those who died from the cure. As faith in the new cure starts to dwindle, Ehrlich is forced to sue Wolfert for libel and in the process exonerate 606. Dr. von Behring (who had earlier told Ehrlich to give up his pipe dreams of cures by chemicals), is called by the defense to denounce 606. Behring instead states that he believes that 606 is responsible for a 39th death: the death of syphilis itself. Ehrlich is exonerated, but the strain and stress from the trial are too much for his weakened body and he dies shortly thereafter, his final words being counsel to his assistants and colleagues on the risks involved in advancing medicine."

        "content": "Warner Bros. Studios was concerned about Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet because it was about a venereal disease, syphilis, and because Ehrlich was Jewish. This was before the U.S. entry into the Second World War. Warner Bros. did not want the movie to be political or seem to have a Jewish agenda since Germany was still a market for American films. However, Warner Bros. had already produced a series of medical biographical films during the 1930s, including the Dieterle-directed The Story of Louis Pasteur (1935) and The White Angel (1936) about Florence Nightingale.  In addition, U.S. Surgeon General Thomas Parran Jr. had in late 1936 begun a syphilis control campaign to get the public to consider it to be a medical condition and not a moral failure, suggesting that a film on Ehrlich' life would be acceptable.Ehrlich was one of the greatest Jewish doctors, and in 1908 his work on immunity won a Nobel Prize. However, the Nazi regime in Germany had systematically expunged all memory of Ehrlich from public buildings and street signs and censored books referring to him. The Second World War had already begun but the United States was not yet directly involved. Jack Warner, like other Hollywood moguls, was wary of criticism of pursuing any supposedly \"Jewish\" agenda on the screen. A memorandum circulated by the studio bosses stated with regard to the forthcoming Ehrlich movie: \"It would be a mistake to make a political propaganda picture out of a biography which could stand on its own feet.\" So the words \"Jew\" and \"Jewish\" went entirely unmentioned in the film. Anti-Semitism in Ehrlich's life was no more than hinted at, and then only once or twice. In addition, the original version of the deathbed scene was changed so that Ehrlich no longer would refer to the Pentateuch (books of Moses in the Bible). Nevertheless, the film's story writer Norman Burnside declared \"There isn't a man or woman alive who isn't afraid of syphilis, and let them know that a little kike named Ehrlich tamed the scourge. And maybe they can persuade their hoodlum friends to keep their fists off Ehrlich's coreligionists.\"\nOne prohibited topic of the Motion Picture Production Code adopted in 1930 was \"sex hygiene and venereal diseases\" and after 1934 studios were required to submit films to the Production Code Administration for approval. Aware of the restrictions of the Code, Warner executives seriously considered not mentioning the word \"syphilis\" in the movie. However, Hal B. Wallis, Warner Bros. head of production, while advising caution, wrote to the PCA that \"to make a dramatic picture of the life of Dr. Ehrlich and not include this discovery [the anti-syphilis drug Salvarsan] among his great achievements would be unfair to the record.\" Following negotiations, the film received approval under the Production Code provided no scenes showing treatment of patients with syphilis were shown, and advertising of the film could not mention syphilis.The movie's title role star Edward G. Robinson, himself Jewish, was keenly aware of the increasingly desperate situation of the Jews in Germany and Europe, and anxious for the opportunity to break out of the police and gangster roles in which he was in danger of being forever stereotyped. He met with Paul Ehrlich's daughter who had fled to the US and he corresponded with Ehrlich's widow, who was a refugee in Switzerland. \"During the filming,\" Robinson later recalled with regard to his role as Ehrlich: \"I kept to myself, studied the script, practiced gestures before the mirror, read about his life and times, studied pictures of the man, tried to put myself in his mental state, tried to be him.\""

Despite Aguilera's first three years of commercial success, she was displeased with the lack of control over her image. In response, she desired to create a song that would represent her authentic persona. She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder and suggested using Redman's 2001 song \"Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get in da Club)\" as a guide. The final result, \"Dirrty\", is an R&B and hip hop song that also features rapping verses from Redman and describes sexual activities.\nRCA Records sent \"Dirrty\" to American radio stations on September 3, 2002, as the lead single from Stripped. RCA and Bertelsmann Music Group later released the song as a CD single. The song peaked at number 48 on the US Billboard 100. Outside of the United States, \"Dirrty\" saw significant success in the British Isles, topping the charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, the song peaked within the top ten in many countries including Australia, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\nDavid LaChapelle directed the music video for \"Dirrty\", which was intended to publicize Aguilera's new image. Depicting sexual fetishes such as mud wrestling and muscle worshipping, the controversial video eliminated her previous image as a bubblegum pop singer. Various news publications and other recording artists criticized the video, and it was banned on Thai television, but Aguilera defended the video, calling it inspirational as it put her to the forefront. \"Dirrty\" was included on the setlists of Aguilera's five major concert tours: The Justified & Stripped Tour (2003), The Stripped Tour (2003), Back to Basics Tour (2006\u20132008), The Liberation Tour (2018), and The X Tour (2019)."

She explained to The Sydney Morning Herald her dissatisfaction with being a part of the late 1990s teen pop trend, \"The label [RCA Records] wanted to push the cookie-cutter, [...] almost virginal kind of imagery that wasn't me. I really wanted to squirm away from that, because I really thought it was really fake and superficial and untrue of what I was about.\"\"Dirrty\" was among the last tracks to be recorded for Aguilera's 2002 album, Stripped. It was recorded at the Enterprise Studios in Burbank and Conway Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles by Oscar Ramirez, Wassim Zreik, and Dylan \"3-D\" Dresdow. Desiring to create a \"down and dirty\" song to complement her new image, she approached hip hop producer Rockwilder, who had worked with her on \"Lady Marmalade\", and suggested recording a song similar to Redman's 2001 hip hop song \"Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get in da Club)\". \"Dirrty\" ultimately became a \"near-remake\" of its predecessor, as Entertainment Weekly said. Rapper Redman, who previously appeared on Eminem's 2001 song \"Off the Wall\", in which Eminem disses Aguilera, is featured on the song. Aguilera intended to use a misspelled title to personalize the song, also considering \"Dirtee\" or \"Dirrdy\". The title reflects the music video, which Aguilera describes as \"gritty, [with] underground, illegal stuff going on.\""

According to Stylus Magazine's Todd Burns, the song features a bassline which \"doesn't quite mesh with the song in a natural way\" and an \"effective\" overdubbing technique. The song's lyrics detail sexual activities such as table dancing. Jon Pareles noted that Aguilera was determined to shed her teen pop image that she achieved with her early works, and decided to show her sexuality and aggression in the \"self-explanatory\" \"Dirrty\". A sequel to the song entitled \"Still Dirrty\" was recorded by Aguilera for her 2006 album, Back to Basics."

Michael Paoletta from Billboard called the song \"horribly derivative\", while NME's Jim Wirth said that \"Dirrty\" was \"probably the pick of an inconsistent crop.\" Entertainment Weekly critic Seymour Craig gave it a D\u2212, calling Aguilera's voice \"desperate and shrill,\" and found it to be an unsuccessful attempt to gain street cred. \"Dirrty\" won the Best Single award at the 2003 Q Awards.

She refuses to talk to the police, who believe the janitor was blackmailing her with something until she grew tired and decided to kill him. The detective informs her fiance that she has canceled her marriage with two other men previously, which appears to be what she did not want to get revealed. The fiance gets angry and his father encourages him to forget her.\nShirin's parents hire a famously skilled lawyer, who visits Shirin in detention and manages to make her state her first words after arrest. The lawyer considers this a start and learns from Shirin's mother that in contrast to Shirin's two previous marriage attempts, she chose the last one herself; and that they are true lovers. The lawyer meets the fiance, who finally agrees to help. He visits Shirin and asks her for her motive. She begins to reveal her story: When she was a child, her parents were at work most of the time and entrusted her to an assistant named Morad, who frequently abused her and took pictures of her while they were alone. The police arrest Morad, who denies the accusations. However, when pictures of other girls are found in his house, he is tortured until he confesses to dozens of sexual abuses. As a result, he is sentenced to death.\nThen Shirin is asked of the reason she killed the janitor. She reveals that as she was preparing to join her fiance, she noticed her neighbors' daughter being abused by the janitor. She freed the girl and killed the janitor. The detective and the lawyer debrief the abused girl and her parents, who refuse to testify, as the disclosure of the daughter's abuse can ruin the family's reputation and become a scandal that is not accepted in Iranian culture.\nThe lawyer tries another way to help Shirin's case. She brings a psychologist to the trial, where the latter states that traumatic events in childhood can affect the person's mental state and behavior. The court does not accept that and sentences Shirin to qisas.\nSince the death sentence can be replaced by diyya if a family member of the victim exists, the lawyer and the fiance search for the janitor's family. They discover that there is a living brother, and the fiance meets a carpet salesman who knows of the brother's whereabouts. The salesman initially refuses to talk. The fiance threatens to burn the carpets and the salesman eventually reveals the location. The fiance and the lawyer head there, but discover the brother is dying of a drug overdose.

The success of the single allowed Can to move to a better studio in Weilerswist, where they recorded the rest of the album.\nEge Bamyas\u0131 has received much critical acclaim since its release and has been cited as an influence by various artists, with several playing cover versions of songs from the album.

        "content": "With the commercial success of their hit single \"Spoon\" (which reached #6 on the German charts and sold 300,000 copies), Can were able to hire a large ex-cinema in Weilerswist near Cologne, which they used as a part-working, part-living space, and which they named \"Inner Space\". However, things nearly didn't work out as guitarist Michael Karoli recalled that the sessions were \"frustrated by keyboardist Irmin Schmidt and vocalist Damo Suzuki's playing chess obsessively day in, day out\" and that \"completing recording became a frantic process, with some tracks having to be recorded practically in real time and the single 'Spoon' added to make up for a shortfall in material.\"Ege Bamyas\u0131 was recorded by Holger Czukay at Weilerswist and originally released in 1972 by United Artists. In September 2004, the album, along with the majority of Can's discography, was remastered and released as a hybrid SACD. The re-release includes a booklet with commentary on the album by David Stubbs, as well as previously unreleased photos of the band.\nThe success of the song \"Spoon\" and sales from this album inspired Can to throw a free concert in an attempt to reach a wider audience. The Can Free Concert was filmed by Martin Sch\u00e4fer, Robbie M\u00fcller and Egon Mann for director Peter Przygodda at the Cologne Sporthalle on 3 February 1972 and is included on the Can DVD.In a 2006 interview with David Stubbs in Uncut magazine Irmin Schmidt commented: \"People imagine Can was all done in the editing, but for 'Soup' there was no editing at all. We'd found out the record was too short; it needed ten more minutes of music by the next morning, so we wrote, played and recorded it the night before. No editing!\" Czukay added: \"We recorded Ege Bamyasi in a new studio, which had formerly been a cinema. That new environment affected the sound. The drums were not so heavy and rough, the vocals and instruments were separated out. 'Vitamin C' became the title track of Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street, a movie by Samuel Fuller. That's often how it was. We made music, then found a use for it later. 'Soup' is my favourite track.\""

The general's daughter (and Randall's girlfriend), Jenna Wallace, works for the security contractor providing security at the Manila conference.

        "content": "\"Heroes and Villains\" is a song by the American rock band the Beach Boys from their 1967 album Smiley Smile and their unfinished Smile project. Written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, Wilson envisioned the song as an Old West-themed musical comedy that would surpass the recording and artistic achievements of \"Good Vibrations\". The single was Brother Records' first release. While it failed to meet critical and commercial expectations, it was a hit record, peaking at number 12 in the U.S. and number 8 in the UK.\nThe song was Wilson and Parks' first collaboration. Parks characterized the song as \"historically reflective\" and a \"visual effort\" that was meant to match the ballads of Marty Robbins. He said the lyrics were based on the early history of California, including references to the involvement of the Spanish and American Indians. Some accounts suggest that the song developed partly from a Wilson reworking of the standard \"You Are My Sunshine\". Early versions included sections with lyrics about farm animals (\"Barnyard\") and physical health (\"I'm in Great Shape\"). \n\"Heroes and Villains\" had the most complex making of any song in the band's history. Recording spanned virtually the entire Smile sessions as Wilson experimented with at least a dozen versions of the track, some of which ranged in length from six to eight minutes.  Wilson discarded almost everything that was recorded, with expenses totaling around $40,000 (equivalent to $370,000 in 2023). Most of the final composite was produced in three days at his makeshift home studio. The chorus featured a theme that was cannibalized from another Smile track, \"Do You Like Worms?\".\n\nWilson's bandmates and associates later voiced dissatisfaction with the released version, believing that the mix was vastly inferior to his earlier, lengthier edits. Commentators blame the record's failure on the esoteric lyrics, the \"muddy\" sound quality, and the late timing of the release. It remains one of the lesser-known songs in the Beach Boys' catalog. For Wilson, the single's failure came to serve as a pivotal point in his psychological decline, and he adopted the song title as a term for his auditory hallucinations. In 2004, Wilson remade the song and its related pieces for Brian Wilson Presents Smile. In 2011, The Smile Sessions was released with an entire disc devoted to the song's original recording sessions."

        "content": "Wilson had been working on \"Heroes and Villains\" for some time before he asked Parks to be his lyricist in mid-July 1966.Al Jardine surmised that the song derived in part from the group's improvised scat singing exercises from early in the band's existence. In a 2000 interview, he stated, \"We all became instruments for Brian's barbershop concept. He said, 'Let's all do this, let's sing this idea.' Carl would be one instrument, I'd be another. Mike would be another instrument. [...] With none of us really being players, we would just scat in the car going to a show or something or going to school, anywhere.\" Musician Al Kooper, writing in his 2008 autobiography, recalled that Wilson played him a rough mix of \"Heroes and Villains\" shortly after the release of Pet Sounds. Kooper remembered that the song had \"evolved, I believe, from a Wilson revamping of 'You Are My Sunshine.'\"\n\"Heroes and Villains\" was the first song that Wilson and Parks wrote together. As with the others that they wrote for the Smile album, Parks wrote the words while Wilson composed the music. When presented the descending melody at the initial writing session, occurring a few days after their first meeting, Parks was reminded of the Marty Robbins' 1959 song \"El Paso\" and immediately conceived the opening line: \"I've been in this town so long that back in the city I've been taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long, long time.\"Wilson told Parks that he had thought of the Old West when conceiving the melody. Journalist Domenic Priore speculated that Wilson may have based the verses on Phil Spector's productions of \"River Deep - Mountain High\" and \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" \u2013 particularly the former's bass line. Asked in 2004 about the influence of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue on the recurring melodies and themes on Smile, Wilson responded: \"A little bit, not much. It influenced 'Heroes & Villains' and a couple of others.\" He credited Parks with some of the music and arrangement on \"Heroes and Villains\".In Parks' recollection, all but one section of \"Heroes and Villains\" was written entirely \"in one sitting\". The success of the pair's collaboration led to them writing more songs with an Old West theme, including \"Barnyard\" and \"I'm in Great Shape\". It became an integral track for the Smile project and, later, was often called the album's \"centerpiece\". Wilson envisioned \"Heroes and Villains\" as a three-minute musical comedy that would surpass his achievements with \"Good Vibrations\". In a 1977 radio interview, he offered an anecdote in which he told his father, Murry that he was going \"'to make a record that's better than 'Good Vibrations', something that you could never do. I don't know why in the hell I said that.\"In a self-penned 1969 article, former band associate Michael Vosse wrote that, during one night at Wilson's home, Wilson played a past-tense variation on \"You Are My Sunshine\" on piano that deviated into \"this weird little riff\". Vosse said, \"And it hit him, man, right then that he wanted a barn yard\u2014he wanted Old MacDonald's farm\u2014he wanted all that stuff. So he immediately got Van Dyke over and they did a chart for 'You were my sunshine'\". Although Vosse admitted that his memory may be wrong, since Wilson \"changed things so much\", he recalled that the arrangement then \"developed into an instrumental thing with barnyard sounds\u2014people sawing\u2014he had people in the studio sawing on wood\u2014and Van Dyke being a duck\u2014and it was marvelous.\" Asked about Wilson's rendition of \"You Are My Sunshine\" in 2004, Parks could not remember having been involved with it."

        "content": "There are conflicting reports regarding who came up with the title. Wilson credited Parks with naming the song, but Parks denied this, saying that he wrote the lyrics around the title that Wilson had suggested. Wilson's then-wife Marilyn commented: \"There are so many screwed-up people in the music industry. The good guys and the bad guys [...] That's one thing Brian had in mind when they did 'Heroes and Villains.'\" Biographer Peter Ames Carlin interpreted the song as Wilson projecting \"all of the feelings sensed inside of himself [...] into vibrantly colored, abstract glimpses into another parallel world.\"In Carlin's interpretation, the song describes \"a lawless boomtown somewhere out on the fringes of the Old West\" as told from the perspective of a narrator who \"speaks as a man who has become a part of the scene, but not of it, exactly, because he's still so thrilled and terrified by everything he sees.\" At the song's conclusion, the protagonist \"has aged and seen his children grow to adulthood\" without knowing if his experiences have turned him into a hero or a villain.Alternate versions of the song tell a different narrative, as Stylus Magazine's Ed Howard writes,  \"'Heroes & Villains' told a story, though the actual narrative changed depending on what sections were being added or discarded at any given time.\"  In reference to \"I'm in Great Shape\", Parks commented: \"it's interesting how [in the lyrics] there was, all of a sudden, this turning to eggs and grits. It's because it had something to do with the thought of a barnyard, and that related to that place we were trying to come up with in 'Heroes And Villains'. All those lyrics were visual efforts.\"Contrary to a popular rumor, the song was not written about the nascent war in Vietnam. Parks said the lyrics were actually centered around an American Indian \"thing\" in which he and Wilson \"were trying to exculpate our guilt, to atone for what we had done to the aborigines of our own place. There's a lot of things about belief in Smile, and its very question of belief is what was plaguing Brian at that time. What should we keep from the structure that we had, the hard-wiring that we had with religion?\" Historian Keith Badman speculated that the \"you're under arrest\" line from an earlier version of the song may have been inspired by Wilson witnessing an attempted burglary of his Rolls-Royce.\nArtist Frank Holmes, who designed the Smile cover artwork, created an illustration that was inspired by the song's lyrics: \"The rain of bullets that eventually brought her down\". Along with several other drawings, it was planned to be included within a booklet packaged with the Smile LP. Holmes shared a summary of his design choices in Domenic Priore's 2005 book Smile: The Story of Brian Wilson's Lost Masterpiece. Holmes recalled of the illustration, \"the poultry in the right corner is saying, 'Dude'll do,' a reference to a line in the original lyrics: 'She was unafraid of what a dude\u2019ll do in a town full of heroes and villains.' Van Dyke tells me that Brian saw that image and actually got the other Beach Boys to change their singing to \u2018Dude\u2019ll do\u2019, based on this. So there's a case of the drawing definitely influencing the work.\""

On the evening of July 11, 1967, he was told by his astrologer (a woman named Genevelyn) that the time was right for the record to be heard by the public. Without informing Capitol, Wilson called his bandmates and, accompanied by producer Terry Melcher, traveled by limo to personally deliver a vinyl cut of the record to KHJ Radio. According to Melcher, as Wilson excitedly offered the record for radio play, the DJ refused, citing program directing protocols. Melcher recalled: \"Brian almost fainted! It was all over. He'd been holding onto the record [and] had astrologers figuring out the correct moment. It really killed him. Finally they played it, but only after a few calls to the program director or someone, who screamed, 'Put it on, you idiot!' But the damage to Brian had already been done.\"\"Heroes and Villains\" was among the most highly publicized singles in the history of rock music. Issued on July 24, it was the first release on the Beach Boys' Brother Records and failed to match the commercial success of \"Good Vibrations\" by a considerable degree. It debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 81 on August 6, peaked at number 12 around September 4, and dropped off the charts one week later. In Britain, the single was issued on August 18 and reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart.Filmmaker Peter Clifton compiled a music video of \"Heroes and Villains\" set to footage of surfers riding waves for the BBC. The clip aired on the network's Top of the Pops on August 31. On September 2, the BBC hired a film crew to shoot an official music video of the song that featured the group at Brian's home. The film was scheduled to air on Top of the Pops around September 21 but was later scrapped. On September 18, Smiley Smile was released with \"Heroes and Villains\" as the opening track. It was one of the album's two elaborately-produced tracks (the other being \"Good Vibrations\")."

Makes me think of a psychedelic barbershop quartet!\" Billboard reviewed it as \"clever off-beat rock material with an arrangement that encompasses barbershop harmony and jazz!\"Cash Box called it a \"creatively delivered conglomeration of sounds that run the gamut from amusement park hooplah to barbershop harmony\" and said that the lyrics \"pose some interesting questions.\" Record World called it \"a strange, appealing, harmonious song.\"Bruce Johnston witnessed the record's debut at The Speakeasy Club in London. He recalled, \"Everyone really got up to dance.

And this isn't it!\" In his review for Melody Maker, Nick Jones praised the song as \"another masterpiece of production from Wilson and another move in his flowery progression.\" New Music Review's critic described the song as \"weirdly fascinating\".In an editorial published in December, Rolling Stone founding editor Jann Wenner referred to the song as \"pointless\" and a weak follow-up to \"Good Vibrations\". Music journalist Jules Siegel, who was present throughout the Smile sessions, reported in Cheetah that while it seemed like \"the Beatles had outdistanced the Beach Boys\" during the previous summer, \"some people think ['Heroes and Villains'] is better than anything the Beatles ever wrote.\" At the end of the year, French radio listeners selected \"Heroes and Villains\" as the \"Record of the Year\"."

Badman stated that the dismal reception was the direct cause of Wilson's withdrawal from the public eye, while Howard offered that the pressure to follow up \"Good Vibrations\" with \"an equally ingenious hit\" likely contributed to the collapse of the Smile project. Doggett called the \"saga\" of the song's recording a \"microcosm of the entire Smile tragi-comedy\".Jack Rieley, who managed the band in the early 1970s, stated that the failure of the single \"shook [Brian] to the foundations of his being and self-respect. [...] this is when he started disappearing into his bedroom for a long time. This is when he ate himself into a state where he became horrendously fat.\" Marilyn said that Brian did not perform the song for anybody in the years following its release. In the 1998 documentary Endless Harmony, Love referred to \"Heroes and Villains\" as the last dynamic moment in Wilson's music. Journalist David Bennun concurred, \"In a way, Love is right. Brian Wilson would never again generate something as thrilling as Heroes And Villains, or any of the other, numerous, breathtaking tracks he had constructed for the band in their so far brief career.\"Wilson would sometimes refer to the voices in his head as \"heroes and villains\". Darian Sahanaja, a member of Wilson's supporting band since the 1990s, said that, \"When I first met Brian, you couldn't even mention the words 'Heroes and Villains'; he\u2019d turn around and walk away or he\u2019d say, 'I don\u2019t want to talk about it.'\""

It was one of the last Beach Boys singles to break the US top 20 until \"Rock and Roll Music\" in 1976. Jardine told an interviewer that Parks felt his contributions destroyed the band's commercial momentum: \"Y\u2019know, he actually apologized to me - for 'ruining my career.' I said, 'Van Dyke, not only did you not ruin it but you enhanced it!  You enhanced our knowledge just by being there.\"Wilson's bandmates did not feel that his final edit was as good as his earlier versions, and according to biographer David Leaf, \"all those who heard the original\" believed that the released version was missing crucial sequences that Wilson originally intended for the song. Jardine expressed dissatisfaction with the mix, describing it as \"a pale facsimile\" of Wilson's original vision, and suggested that Wilson deliberately sabotaged the song at the last minute. He blamed the record's lack of \"sonic energy\" on the limited recording equipment and felt that the mastering was probably engineered improperly, commenting, \"I could hear the difference. I could hear the edge was gone.\"  Parks was not involved with the making of the final edit and later said that he was \"astonished\" by its structure and production quality when he heard it on the radio.Howard opined that the song was \"more fractured\" and \"arguably more inspired\" than \"Good Vibrations\", likening it to a \"pocket opera\" (a reference to the term \"pocket symphony\").  Eric Luecking of NPR said that while \"Heroes and Villains\" was more adventurous than \"Good Vibrations\", listeners could not relate to the song's lyrics, which obscured the single's legacy. Academic Larry Starr explained that the Wild West-themed subject matter \"lacked any context whatsoever in the cultural environment of popular music in 1967, an environment immersed in the emerging counterculture and one that tended to prize lyrics with marked personal or social 'relevance.'\" Doggett felt that while the song was \"beautiful and intriguing\", it was \"nowhere near as commercial as 'Good Vibrations'.\"Some commentators blame the shifts in contemporary pop culture for the record's failure. Starr disputed the suggestion; instead, the song's \"relatively limited appeal may be ascribed to two factors that remained problematic, or sometimes even disappointing, in the Beach Boys\u2019 output for the remaining years of the 1960s: the lyrics, and the production values.\"  Considering the rich orchestrations of Pet Sounds, Starr concluded that \"the source of biggest disappointment for listeners, however, may well have been the overall quality of the sound.\"  Stebbins said that while the arrangement was \"generously filled with fantastic Beach Boys vocal harmonies and genius musical twists and turns\", the record's \"disturbingly muddy sound quality [...] undoubtedly hurt its commercial appeal.\"Despite some commentators criticisms of the song, \"Heroes and Villains\" has ranked highly in lists of the Beach Boys' greatest songs, and in some rankings of the greatest songs of all time. Mojo magazine named the song the 7th greatest by the Beach Boys, while the French edition of Rolling Stone ranked it 8th. Crawdaddy! founder Paul Williams listed it as one of the 100 greatest rock singles of all time in his 1993 book Rock and Roll: The 100 Best Singles."

        "content": "\"All Is Full of Love\" is a song by Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk from her third studio album, Homogenic (1997). The lyrics were inspired by love in spring and Ragnar\u00f6k of Norse mythology. Bj\u00f6rk's original version is a trip hop ballad with soul influences, harp, strings, and electronic beats; the version on Homogenic is a minimalist ambient remix by Howie B, emphasising Bj\u00f6rk's vocals. A remix by the German IDM duo Funkst\u00f6rung was released as a single in 1998.\nIn 1999, \"All Is Full of Love\" was released as a single with a music video directed by Chris Cunningham. The video uses Bj\u00f6rk's original mix, and depicts Bj\u00f6rk as a robot being assembled in a factory, who passionately kisses another robot. The video is often cited as one of the best of all time and a milestone in computer animation; it has been displayed in art exhibitions and was on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The single reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and became a dance hit in the United States. The original version of \"All Is Full of Love\" is the opening track on Greatest Hits (2002), whose tracks were voted for by fans. It has been covered by various artists."

        "content": "\"All Is Full of Love\", the closing track of Homogenic, was the album's last song to be written and recorded. Produced by Bj\u00f6rk, the original version of the song was replaced \"at the last minute\" with a remixed version by Howie B. It was inspired by the spring while producing the album in M\u00e1laga, Spain. After living in the mountains among other people for six months, Bj\u00f6rk felt lonely, but a morning walk in April inspired her to write the track. She had a rough winter and then she realised it was spring after she could hear the birds singing. She wrote and recorded the song in half a day.In keeping with Homogenic's theme as a tribute to Bj\u00f6rk's native Iceland, the track was inspired by Icelandic mythology, such as the Ragnar\u00f6k. The previous track, \"Pluto\", stands for death and destruction, whereas \"All Is Full of Love\" stands for a new beginning. Bj\u00f6rk also called it a song about \"believing in love\" and expressed that \"love isn't just about two persons. It's everywhere around you. Even if you're not getting love from Person A, it doesn't mean there's not love there.\" However, she also described it as \"taking the piss\", considering it the most \"sugary song\" ever. As the song opposes the rest of Homogenic's \"macho\" aesthetic, Bj\u00f6rk has said it could have been included on Vespertine.The lyrics begin with a promise of protection and caretaking: \"You'll be given love / You'll be taken care of / You'll have to trust it\". The song moves towards a more reproachful tone as Bj\u00f6rk sings, \"You just ain't receiving / Your phone is off the hook / Your doors are shut\", tempered by the recognition that you have to \"twist your head around you\" because \"love is all around you\". This is musically effected by Bj\u00f6rk's vocals as she sings the lyric \"All is full of love\" in counterpoint with herself.The album version of the track does not have drum accompaniment. It does not have Homogenic's characteristic electronic beats, focusing instead on \"[creating] an intimacy between the growing dynamics of the instrumentation and Bjork's impressive vocal abilities.\" It uses a long reverb, which results in a wash of sound that suggests a very large space suggestive of the \"heavenly\" environment Bj\u00f6rk envisaged for the track. According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the song has a soft pulse with intervals that build up to an electronic orchestration of industrial beats. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called it a \"moony lullaby\" and compared it to the music of Enya. In his review for Spin, James Hunter wrote that the track is one of the times Bj\u00f6rk \"dips her toe into the warm lake of tradition\" and noted its \"rockish minor-key verses traipse off into her gospel.\"The video version of the song is a midtempo trip hop ballad with soul influences. In opposition to the sonically minimalist mix included on the album, this version has been described as \"lushly produced\" and includes \"fluttering\" harps and \"shivering\" strings. Reportedly the best known and the preferred version by Bj\u00f6rk's fans and herself, it is further known under the names of \"Mark Stent Mix\" and \"Video Mix\"."

        "content": "In August 1998, a 12-inch single of \"All Is Full of Love\", containing a remix by German IDM duo Funkst\u00f6rung, was released through FatCat Records as a limited release. This remix had been previously distributed as a B-side for \"Hunter\" (1998), and another remix of the song had been released as a B-side of \"J\u00f3ga\" in 1998. In January 1999, it was announced that the track would be released later that year as a single and that its music video would be shot soon. It was atypical to release a single for promoting an album released two years before, but Bj\u00f6rk purposely decided to do this so that the music video was more of a short film than a marketing move. The original release date for the single was 2 May 1999, but was later extended out two weeks to 17 May. To coincide with this announcement, Funkst\u00f6rung's remix was made available again and an official logo for the release was unveiled.The music video was released that April, although the premiere of the single was pushed back to 7 June 1999. \"All Is Full of Love\" was released as two 12-inch singles, two CD singles, a DVD single, and a box set, which included the CD singles and the music video in VHS format. Some publications regard the single as the first DVD single release. In the United Kingdom, it was also made available as two different promotional singles in 1999, and as two VHS singles. B-sides include remixes by \u03bc-Ziq, Funkst\u00f6rung, Plaid, Guy Sigsworth, Mark Stent and Howie B. The single's artwork consists of shots from the music video and features the official logo, which can be seen in the video as well. The song was also included as the opening track of Bj\u00f6rk's 2002 compilation album Greatest Hits, whose songs were selected by fans through a survey, in which the single was the second most voted song, coming after \"Hyperballad\" (1996)."

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it a \"sublime rebirth\", and Tiny Mix Tapes commented that \"the album ends on an optimistic note\" with the \"exquisite\" song. In a retrospective review, Music Tech described the song as \"hauntingly-beautiful.\" Entertainment Weekly's David Browne was less enthusiastic, considering it \"the weakest track\" of the album.In a review for the DVD single, Alex Castle of IGN gave the music a score of 9 out of 10, writing \"the thing sounds fantastic\" and that the song is \"pretty good\". However, he admitted that he \"would probably not have been particularly impressed\" if he hadn't seen the music video. James Oldham of NME described it as \"magnificent, sultry, pneumatic trip-soul ballad, which gently blooms into a magical garden of fluttering harps and shivering strings.\" He also added that the track \"is no mere soundtrack\" for the video. AllMusic's Heather Phares gave the DVD single four out of five stars, considering it \"a necessary addition to the collections of dedicated Bjork fans\". Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly also gave the single a positive review, commending its B-sides and writing it \"was hardly the most striking piece at the time\u2014but the tune turns out to have been something of a sleeper.\""

        "content": "Bj\u00f6rk first performed \"All Is Full of Love\" live in July 1997, playing the whole album for a press conference and presentation concert concerning Homogenic at the Old Truman Building, an old beer factory in London, wearing a pink dress designed by Hussein Chalayan, which she would later sport in the video for \"Bachelorette\" (1997) and photoshoots. The song was part of the set list for her Homogenic Tour, on which Bj\u00f6rk embarked with Mark Bell and Icelandic String Octet from late 1997 to early 1999. \"All Is Full of Love\" was also performed during the Vespertine World Tour in 2001, which featured Vespertine collaborators Matmos and Zeena Parkins, an Inuit choir, and an orchestra. During the tour, Bj\u00f6rk performed in concert halls and opera houses in order to \"have the best acoustics possible\" and avoid the \"appalling acoustics\" of stadiums and rock venues. The track was the most performed of the tour, alongside \"Frosti\" and \"Pagan Poetry\". Bj\u00f6rk's concert at the Royal Opera House of 16 December 2001, which included a performance of the song, was broadcast on BBC Four and released as the DVD Live at Royal Opera House in 2002. A live version of the track can also be found on the tour documentary DVD Minuscule of 2003. A Vespertine Tour live version of the song was released through Vespertine Live, a live album of the tour included in the box set Live Box (2003).The headliner of the 2002 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Bj\u00f6rk opened the set with the track, wearing a white Comme des Gar\u00e7ons dress. This performance was included on the 2006 video documentary Coachella. The song was also part of the set list of the Greatest Hits Tour (2003), which once again featured the Icelandic String Octet, but with the addition of Vespertine World Tour collaborators Matmos and Zeena Parkins. It was one of the most played songs of the tour. Bj\u00f6rk's performance of the song in New York City during the tour was included in the 2005 documentary film Screaming Masterpiece. \"All Is Full of Love\" was also performed during the Volta Tour (2007\u201308), a tour she undertook with Mark Bell, J\u00f3nas Sen, Damian Taylor, Chris Corsano, and a 10-piece female brass band. Several of the concerts were part of festivals, including Coachella, Glastonbury, and Rock en Seine, among others. A live performance of the track during the tour was included in the box set Volta\u00efc (2009), specifically the CD Songs from the Volta Tour Performed Live at the Olympic Studios. The track was also performed a few times during Bj\u00f6rk's Biophilia Tour (2011\u201313). The song was performed only once on the 2015 Vulnicura Tour."

Reflecting on the situation Queen stated: \"Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again. We have no idea who hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did.\" The collaboration stemmed from Queen's previous collaboration with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album La Revoluci\u00f3n (2009) on \"Perfecto\" which also featured Yaviah."

The screenplay, by Bava, Alberto Bevilacqua, Callisto Cosulich, Antonio Roman and Rafael J. Salvia, was based on an Italian-language science fiction short story, Renato Pestriniero's \"One Night of 21 Hours\". American International Pictures released the film as the supporting film on a double feature with Daniel Haller's Die, Monster, Die! (1965).The story follows the horrific experiences of the crew members of two giant spaceships that have crash landed on a forbidding, unexplored planet. The disembodied inhabitants of the world possess the bodies of the crew who died during the crash, and use the animated corpses to stalk and kill the remaining survivors.\nThe film was co-produced by AIP and Italian International Film, with some financing provided by Spain's Castilla Cooperativa Cinematogr\u00e1fica. Ib Melchior and Louis M. Heyward are credited with the script for the AIP English-language release version. Years after its release, some critics have suggested that Bava's film was a major influence on Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) and Prometheus (2012), in both narrative details and visual design."

Both ships, the Galliott and the Argos, attempt to land on the surface of the fog-encased world. While entering the planet's atmosphere, the crew of the Argos becomes possessed by an unknown force and try to violently kill each other. Only Captain Markary has the will to resist, and is able to force all of the others aboard his ship out of their hypnotic, murderous state. After the Argos lands on the surface, the crew disembarks and explores the eerie landscape in search of the Galliott. Thick, pulsating mists, lit by ever-shifting eerie colors, saturate the terrain. When they finally arrive at the other ship, they find that the crew members have killed each other. Markary's younger brother, Toby, is among the dead. They proceed to bury as many of the corpses as they can, but several bodies are locked inside the ship's bridge. Markary departs to get tools for opening the sealed room, but the corpses disappear by the time he returns.\nSome of the Argos' crew are found dead. Tiona sees their corpses walking in the ship, and becomes paralyzed with fear. Markary advises the survivors that they must escape from Aura. Unfortunately, the Argos incurred serious damage during the landing, and repairs will take time. During the waiting period that ensues, several more killings occur. In a private tape recording, Markary admits that he suspects none of them will survive. While exploring Aura, Wes discovers the ruins of a spaceship a few miles from the Argos. Markary, Sanya and Carter investigate. Inside the ship, they discover large skeletal remains of the long dead crew and thus realize that they are not the first ones to have been drawn to the planet by the distress beacon. Markary and Sanya are temporarily trapped inside the ship, but manage to escape and return to the Argos. Carter inexplicably vanishes.\nTwo crew members of the Galliott, Kier and Sallis, arrive at the Argos to steal the ship's Meteor Rejector device. Kier escapes with the machine, but Markary fights Sallis. Markary tears open Sallis' uniform, exposing his putrescent body. He learns that Sallis' corpse is being manipulated by an Auran, who reveals that the two ships were lured to the planet in order for the Aurans to escape from their dying world. With the crew of the Galliott under their complete control, they plan to use the ship to escape to the humans' home planet. Markary vows to stop them. Markary and his crew rush to the Galliott to retrieve the Meteor Rejector. They are successful, and manage to place explosives in the ship. During a struggle with the Aurans, Dr. Karan and Tiona are killed. Markary and Sanya return to the Argos and manage to escape as the Galliott is destroyed. After takeoff, however, they reveal themselves to be possessed by Aurans. They ask Wes, the last survivor, to join them. Wes refuses and tries to sabotage the Meteor Rejector, but fatally electrocutes himself while doing so. Because the device has been broken beyond repair, Markary and Sanya decide to change course for a nearby planet: Earth (1965)."

Eventually, AIP heads Samuel Z. Arkoff and James H. Nicholson decided to coproduce some of these films, rather than just pay for the rights to distribute them, in order to have more control over their content. Planet of the Vampires was one such coproduction, financed by AIP and Italy's Fulvio Lucisano for Italian International Film, along with some Spanish production money provided by Castilla Cooperativa Cinematogr\u00e1fica. AIP provided the services of writer Ib Melchior, whose previous movies had included such modest hits as The Angry Red Planet (1959) and Reptilicus (1961), as well as the relatively big budget Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964). Melchior wrote the screenplay for the English-language version of the film, with some assistance from AIP producer Louis M. Heyward.American Barry Sullivan and Brazilian Norma Bengell led the cast of international actors. Writer Robert J. Skotak reported that each cast member \"used their own native language on the set, in many cases not understanding what the other actors were saying.\" Sullivan's lines were spoken in English, Bengell's in Portuguese, Evi Marandi's in Italian and \u00c1ngel Aranda's in Spanish.\nRestricted by a low budget, Bava was unable to utilize opticals, so all of the film's extensive visual effects work were done \"in camera\". Miniatures and forced perspective visuals are used throughout, with much colored fog adding atmosphere but also obscuring the sheer cheapness of the sets. Bava explained: \"Do you know what that unknown planet was made of? A couple of plastic rocks \u2014 yes, two: one and one! \u2014 left over from a mythological movie made at Cinecitt\u00e0! To assist the illusion, I filled the set with smoke.\"\nAccording to Tim Lucas, the two plastic rocks were multiplied in several shots by mirrors and multiple exposures. The planet's exterior sequences were filmed on an empty stage obscured by mists, table top miniatures and Sch\u00fcfftan process shots."

Variety's Dool opined, \"Plot is punctuated with gore, shock, eerie music and wild optic and special effects...Color camera work and production values are smooth and first class...Flash Gordon type story...should keep the young on the edge of their seats and the older set from falling asleep\". Richard Davis, in Films and Filming, wrote that \"Bava is tied to a grossly synthetic studio set which doesn't for a moment convince of its extraterrestrial reality...the piece on the whole is poor stuff\". Monthly Film Bulletin noted the film was, \"a triumph of mind over matter, or of Bava over a shoestring budget and appalling dubbed dialogue...[Bava] does atmospheric wonders with pastel-shaded fog and cunning camerawork\". In 1974, Joe Dante wrote that the \"fabulous comic strip sci-fi shows director Mario Bava at his most visually inventive...\" Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction noted in 1984 that the film was \"A gorgeous atmospheric confection from Bava...Bava's ever-moving camera creates a chilling sense of menace. The result is a triumph of the pulp imagination\". Glenn Erickson (aka \"DVD Savant\") wrote in 2001 that \"Bava's stunning gothic variation weaves a weird tale of flying saucers, ray guns and zombies that looks like no other space movie ever filmed\". In Fangoria magazine, Tim Lucas said \"Planet of the Vampires is commonly regarded as the best SF film ever made in Italy, and among the most convincing depictions of an alien environment ever put on film\".On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 73% rating based on 11 reviews (8 \"Fresh\" and 3 \"Rotten\")."

The Terror from Beyond Space, 1958) was a direct influence on Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien. But where Scott's film tried to mask its humble drive-in origins, Planet of the Vampires revels in its origins. The film literally feels like a pulp magazine cover come to garish life...\" Robert Monell, on the DVD Maniacs website, observed, \"[M]uch of the conceptual design and some specific imagery in the 1979 Ridley Scott screamer undoubtedly owes a great debt to Mario Bava's no budget accomplishments.\" Govindini Murty of The Atlantic, in a review of Prometheus, said, \"The striking images Ridley Scott devises for Prometheus reference everything from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires.\"One of the film's most celebrated sequences involves the astronauts performing an exploration of an alien, derelict ship discovered in a huge ruin on the surface of the planet. The crewmembers climb up into the depths of the eerie ship and discover the gigantic remains of long dead monstrous creatures. In 1979, Cinefantastique noted the remarkable similarities between this atmospheric sequence and a lengthy scene in the then-new Alien. The magazine also pointed out other minor parallels between the two films. However, both Alien's director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon claimed at the time that they had never seen Planet of the Vampires. Decades later, Dan O'Bannon would admit: \"I stole the giant skeleton from the Planet of the Vampires.\"Tim Lucas has noted that the basic plot and ideas of the film not only inspired Alien but \"continue to influence filmmakers and inspire the genre today, as witnessed by David Twohy's Pitch Black (2000) and Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars (2000).\"In the late 1970s Atlas/Seaboard Comics published a short-lived comic book entitled Planet of Vampires, which combined plot elements from Bava's film with elements of Planet of the Apes and I Am Legend.It has strongly influenced the 2023 DC film Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom."

Francesca does not have a work permit, and struggles with the other \"illegals\" to find a place on the rice fields. After initial resistance from documented workers and bosses, the illegals are allowed a place in the fields. At work in the fields, Silvana and Francesca meet a soon-to-be-discharged soldier, Marco, who unsuccessfully tries to attract Silvana's interest.\nToward the end of the working season, Walter arrives at the rice farm and becomes involved in a plot to steal a large quantity of rice. Excited by his criminal lifestyle, Silvana becomes attracted to Walter. She causes a diversion to help him carry out the heist, but Francesca and Marco manage to stop Walter and his accomplices. Francesca and Silvana face each other, armed with hand-guns. Francesca confronts Silvana and explains that she has been heartlessly manipulated by Walter. In response, Silvana turns her gun on Walter and kills him. Soon afterwards, her guilt leads her to commit suicide.

He hires alcoholic press agent Tom Miller to promote Jordan, both because of his past success with the career of singer Julie London and because he never makes sexual advances towards his female clients.\nMiller sets to work by showing Jordan off around numerous night spots; his machinations arouse interest in Jordan and soon offers of contracts follow. However, Miller realizes that Jordan really just wants to be a homemaker and tries to persuade Murdock not to push Jordan into a show-business career. He thinks he's succeeded when he reveals to Murdock that Jordan's singing is so bad it shatters light bulbs, but Murdock suggests that Jordan would be perfect for a song he composed while in prison, \"Rock Around the Rock Pile\" (a parody of \"Rock Around the Clock\"). Miller reluctantly records Jordan performing the part of a prison siren in Murdock's song and heads to Chicago to promote it to Wheeler, a former mob rival of Murdock who now has a monopoly over the jukebox industry.\nSuspicious of Miller's reluctance to promote Jordan and of the obvious attraction between Miller and Jordan, Murdock has his associate Mousie wiretap a phone call between the pair. Feeling pity for them, Mousie edits out the romantic portions of their conversations and convinces Murdock that their relationship is strictly business.\n\nIn Chicago, Wheeler is impressed by the song and Jordan's voice and offers to sign both Jordan and the songwriter. However, when Miller reveals that the songwriter is Murdock, Wheeler throws him out of his office and vows never to play the song. A furious Murdock bullies bar owners into buying jukeboxes from him instead and successfully promotes his and Jordan's song. To prevent Murdock from stealing his business, Wheeler arranges to have Murdock assassinated at the rock show where Jordan will be making her debut.\nOn his way to the show, Murdock confesses to Mousie that he doesn't want to marry Jordan. Mousie confesses that he altered the tape of Jordan and Miller's phone call and encourages Murdock to let Jordan marry Miller. Backstage at the show, Jordan confesses her love to Miller and they kiss. Jordan also admits that she is a talented singer, who lied because she did not want a show business career; she goes on stage and performs a song about her love for Miller. When Murdock arrives, Miller declares to him that he and Jordan are in love; the delighted Murdock surprises Miller by shaking his hand and offering to be the best man.\nBefore Miller and Murdock can tell Jordan the good news, Wheeler's assassins shoot at Murdock. Miller fights them off and shoves Murdock on stage to perform his song, reasoning that the assassins won't shoot Murdock in front of so many witnesses. Wheeler arrives and, impressed by the audience's response to Murdock, calls off the assassination and signs Murdock instead. The film ends with Miller and Jordan kissing on their honeymoon, as Murdock and Mousie perform on a TV show in the background."

        "content": "\"Do Re Mi\", a short story by Garson Kanin that had appeared in The Atlantic magazine in March 1955, was acquired by Fox. They initially assigned producer Nunnally Johnson to develop the film, but then decided to emphasize rock 'n' roll in it and, in 1956, reassigned it to director Frank Tashlin, whose background included work with music in animation. Tashlin collaborated on a new script with Herbert Baker that played up visual humor that was virtually cartoonish. Kanin did not approve of the new take on his story and requested his name be removed from the credits. Subsequently, Tashlin came up with the new title, The Girl Can't Help It."

        "content": "The film's influence on rock music is significant. The film reached Liverpool, England, in the early summer of 1957. The cameo performances of early rock 'n' roll stars such as Little Richard, Eddie Cochran, and Gene Vincent and His Bluecaps fascinated a 16-year-old John Lennon by showing him, for the first time, his \"worshipped\" American rock 'n' roll stars as living humans and thus further inspiring him to pursue his own rock 'n' roll dream. On July 6, 1957, 15-year-old Paul McCartney was introduced to Lennon after the latter had performed at a village church garden party with his skiffle group The Quarrymen. McCartney demonstrated his musical prowess to Lennon by performing \"Twenty Flight Rock\" in a manner similar to how he had seen it played by Eddie Cochran in The Girl Can't Help It. This led to Lennon inviting McCartney to join the group. McCartney talks about the film in the documentary series The Beatles Anthology.On September 18, 1968, The Beatles interrupted recording \"Birthday\" at Abbey Road Studios so they could go back to Paul McCartney's house to watch the British TV premiere of the film.Also, some film buffs have pointed to Elvis Presley's famous performance of the song \"Jailhouse Rock\" in MGM's film of the same name (often cited as the first music video), released one year after The Girl Can't Help It, as bearing a remarkable resemblance to the theme and performance of a song called \"Rock Around the Rockpile\" from the earlier film. In that performance, Edmond O'Brien plays a character who seeks to escape an assassination attempt by jumping on stage and singing the lyrics, \"rock, rock, rock around the rockpile,\" while backed up by The Ray Anthony Band wearing striped inmate uniforms. O'Brien, then 42 years old, even awkwardly attempts some of the hip-swiveling and leg motions for which Elvis had already become famous, as he had appeared already 10 times, to cumulative audiences in excess of 180 million viewers, and on national television, before and during the filming of The Girl Can't Help It, the production of which commenced in mid-September 1956. Other film buffs point to the famous acrobatic dancer and Presley contemporary, as well as MGM star, Russ Tamblyn (Seven Brides for Seven Brothers), who visited Presley at his suite at the Knickerbocker Hotel on the night before the filming of the \"Jailhouse Rock\" scene. Presley had had trouble that day at the rehearsals in interpreting what the MGM choreographer, Alex Romero, demanded of him, and Tamblyn's advice at the suite that night helped him perform the first part of that dance sequence (which, incidentally, was witnessed by the then-MGM megastar Gene Kelly).  In fact, The Girl Can't Help It's producers had sought to enlist Presley, whose manager, Colonel Tom Parker, however, had demanded too much money. Two uncredited composers on The Girl Can't Help It, Hugo Friedhofer and Lionel Newman, had also composed music for the Elvis film Love Me Tender, in the same year, 1956."

The couple wants Pia to be admitted to a prestigious English-medium school in Delhi as they feel that this will enable her to become a part of the elite of society. They decide on Delhi Grammar School, which ranked the best in the city, but it requires that students must stay within a 3-km radius of the school. They move to a posh villa in Delhi's upscale Vasant Vihar neighbourhood and try to become more refined in their manner. A consultant, Saumya, despite her misgivings about them, tutors them in the answers to be given in the admission interview, but their limited knowledge of English means Pia's application is rejected.\nRaj and Meeta learn from an employee that his daughter has been admitted through the RTE quota, a scheme that helps children from poor families to be admitted to prestigious schools. After a scam reveals that rich parents are gaming the quota to admit their children, they move to Bharat Nagar, a slum area, for a month and pretend to be poor. They strike a friendship with Shyam Prakash and Tulsi Prakash, who are hopeful that their son Mohan Prakash gets to study at Delhi Grammar School through the RTE quota. Shyam and Tulsi teach them to live like truly poor people, and Raj joins Shyam at work. However, while Pia eventually gets admission, Mohan's application is rejected.\nRaj, Meeta & Pia return to Vasant Vihar. Raj and Meeta make a donation to the Bharat Nagar Government School, where Mohan studies, to renovate it and get new books. After watching their son become fluent in English, Shyam and Tulsi search for the identity of the anonymous donor to thank them. However, when he visits the donor's address in Vasant Vihar, Shyam finds out the truth about Raj pretending to be poor to enable Piaa's admission and leaves to tell Delhi Grammar School's principal Lodha Singhania of Raj's deceit.\nRaj and Meeta rush to Delhi Grammar School to get there before Shyam but fail. Shyam, reaching there first, tries to find the principal's office but meets Pia instead, where Shyam endures an emotional moment with her and decides not to tell the principal, but Raaj reacts with guilt for what he has done. Finally, Raj goes to the principal and asks for Piaa's admission to be revoked, while telling the truth, but the principal rejects him. Raj gatecrashes the Annual Day function, gives a speech about English in India and education rights, and leaves, with no one clapping for him, except Meeta.

The film was shot in Chandni Chowk, Anand Lok, Karol Bagh, and Sangam Vihar. The shooting was completed in October 2016. A song sequence was also filmed in Georgia.

Rowling. It is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) and the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Its story follows Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return.\nFilming took place in England and Scotland for exterior locations and Leavesden Film Studios in Watford for interior locations from February to November 2006, with a one-month break in June. Post-production on the film continued for several months afterwards to add in visual effects. The film's budget was reportedly between \u00a375 and 100 million ($150\u2013200 million).Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released in 2D cinemas and IMAX formats in the United States on 11 July 2007 and in the United Kingdom on 12 July, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was nominated for many awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design and Special Visual Effects. With a worldwide five-day opening of $333 million and a total gross of $942 million, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2007, the film was noted as a case of Hollywood accounting, as Warner Bros. claimed that it lost $167 million despite the total gross.\nA sequel, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, was released in 2009."

        "content": "While staying at the Dursleys', Harry Potter and Dudley are attacked by Dementors. Harry repels them using a Patronus spell. The Ministry of Magic detects the underaged Harry using magic and expels him from Hogwarts, though he is later exonerated.\nThe Order of the Phoenix, a secret organisation, founded by Albus Dumbledore, informs Harry that the Ministry of Magic is attempting to stonewall rumors about Lord Voldemort's return. At the Order's headquarters, Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort seeks an object he previously lacked; Harry believes it to be a weapon.\nMinister for Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed Dolores Umbridge as Hogwarts new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Umbridge's refusal to teach defensive spells causes her and Harry to clash. Harry is forced to write lines for \"lying\" about Voldemort. A magic quill etches the words into his hand as he writes. Ron and Hermione are outraged, but Harry refuses to tell Dumbledore, who has distanced himself from Harry. As Umbridge gains more control over the school, Ron and Hermione help Harry form \"Dumbledore's Army\", a secret group to teach students defensive spells. Umbridge recruits Slytherins for an Inquisitorial Squad to spy on the other students. Meanwhile, Harry and Cho Chang develop romantic feelings for each other.\nOne night, Harry envisions Arthur Weasley being attacked at the Ministry, seeing it from the attacker's perspective. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore has Severus Snape teach Harry Occlumency to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. During a lesson, Harry sees Snape's memories of how his father, James, bullied and tormented Snape in school. The connection between Harry and Voldemort further isolates Harry from his friends. Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius's deranged Death Eater cousin, escapes Azkaban prison along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore, falsely accused of forming it, escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Harry believes Cho betrayed Dumbledore's Army to Umbridge, ending their budding relationship. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress.\nHarry experiences a vision that Voldemort is torturing Sirius. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rush to Umbridge's office to alert the Order via the Floo Network. Umbridge catches them and, as she is about to severely punish Harry, Hermione claims Dumbledore has hidden a \"secret weapon\" in the Forbidden Forest. She and Harry lead Umbridge to where Hagrid's giant half-brother, Grawp is kept. The centaurs confront them and kidnap Umbridge after she insults and attacks them. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville and Ginny fly to the Ministry of Magic on Thestrals to save Sirius.\nThe six enter the Department of Mysteries and recover the object that Voldemort is after, a bottled prophecy labelled with Harry's name. Death Eaters, including Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange, ambush them. Lucius reveals that Harry's vision of Sirius being tortured was a ruse to lure him there. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, and a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters ensues. The Death Eaters overpower the students and force Harry to surrender the prophecy. When Harry hands it to Lucius, Sirius and Remus Lupin arrive with Order members Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mad-Eye Moody. As they attack the Death Eaters, Lucius drops the prophecy, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, Bellatrix kills Sirius.\nVoldemort appears, but moments before he can kill Harry, Dumbledore arrives. A violent duel erupts, destroying much of the Atrium, while Bellatrix escapes. The two wizards are evenly matched, so Voldemort possesses Harry's body, wanting Dumbledore to sacrifice him. The love Harry feels for his friends and family quickly drives out Voldemort. Ministry officials arrive before Voldemort disapparates; Fudge admits that Voldemort has returned and resigns in disgrace. Umbridge is dismissed and Dumbledore returns as Hogwarts headmaster. Dumbledore explains he had distanced himself from Harry to prevent Voldemort exploiting their connection. He also reveals the prophecy. As he grieves Sirius's death, Harry tries coming to terms with the prophecy: \"Neither can live while the other survives.\""

        "content": "At 766 pages in the British edition and 870 in the American edition, Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the Harry Potter series, however the film is the second shortest. Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg described his task to cut down the novel as searching for \"the best equivalent way to tell the story. My job was to stay true to the spirit of the book, rather than to the letter\". Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that \"she just wanted to see a great movie, and gave [them] permission to take whatever liberties [they] felt [they] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love\". Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film, Goldenberg explained, became \"clearer when [he] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry's emotional journey\". He and Yates \"looked for every opportunity to get everything [they] could in there. And where [they] couldn't, to sort of pay homage to it, to have it somewhere in the background or to feel like it could be taking place off-screen\".One cut Goldenberg had to make, which he \"hated\" to do, was the absence of Quidditch, the Wizarding sport. \"The truth is that any movie made of this book, whoever made it, that had included the Quidditch subplot would have been a lesser film\", he said. In the book, Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team. \"Ron facing challenges and coming into his own in the same way that Harry is, we tried to get that into the film in other ways, as much as possible. So, you feel like, if not the details of that story, at least the spirit of it is present in the film\". The change disappointed actor Rupert Grint who had been \"quite looking forward to the Quidditch stuff\".In a significant scene in the book, Harry sees a memory of his own father humiliating Snape in their school days, and Snape insulting his mother after she stood up for him. In the film, it is abbreviated to an \"idea\", in Goldenberg's words. \"It's an iconic moment when you realise your parents are normal, flawed human beings. ... Things get trimmed out, but I kept the meat of that in there \u2013 and that was what really gave me the coming-of-age story.\" Young Lily Potter did not appear at all, but promotional screenshots showed unknown teenager Susie Shinner in the role.The scene at St Mungo's, the hospital where Harry and friends run into classmate Neville Longbottom and learn that his parents were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange, was cut because it required the construction of a new set. The main purpose of the action of the scene was relocated to the Room of Requirement after one of Dumbledore's Army's lessons. Also, to speed up the film's climax, several events in the Ministry leading up to Harry's battle with Voldemort were removed, including the brain room. Mrs. Weasley's encounter with a boggart at Grimmauld Place, Ron, Hermione and Malfoy becoming prefects, the appearance of Mundungus Fletcher, and Firenze teaching Divination followed suit.The character of Kreacher the house-elf, who was included in the script only at Rowling's request, has a larger part in the book than the film. In the novel, he is seen saving some of the Black family's artefacts which the Order of the Phoenix throw away, including a locket that ends up being extremely important in the seventh book. \"It was kind of tricky to raise that in our story, because it's for so much later\", Yates said. \"We figured we can probably introduce it later, and that's the approach we took\". Whilst Kreacher remained, all parts involving Dobby were cut, and his important actions were given to other characters.Rita Skeeter, the journalist played by Miranda Richardson in Goblet of Fire, was also removed. In the book, Hermione blackmails her into writing an article that supports Harry as the rest of the wizarding world denies his claims. Richardson noted that \"it's never gonna be the book on film, exactly. ... They'll take certain aspects from the book and make it something that they hope is going to be commercial and that people want to see\"."

It features Nadia Lutfi in special appearance. It is the 3rd on the list of Top 100 Egyptian films. The film was produced by Roberto Rossellini for General Egyptian Cinema Organisation. Rossellini was instrumental in encouraging Abdel Salam to make the film, The Night of the Changing Years tells a story set among the grave robbers of Kurna in Upper Egypt.It remains one of the best examples of neo-realism in Egyptian cinema. Other notable examples include Youssef Chahine's Al Ard (The Earth, 1968) and Al Usfur (The Sparrow, 1972) as well as  Tewfik Saleh's Al Makhdu'un (The Dupes, 1973).\n\"Shadi Abdel Salam's The Mummy was the forerunner of what was to become the hallmark of the new realism, namely, the preoccupation with the search for identity and the relationship between heritage and character.\" The relationship between contemporary and Ancient Egypt is dealt with allegorically in the film. The static images of landscape and the rigid expressions of the main characters reflect those of the statues and reliefs found in Ancient Egypt. The use of classical Arabic, not Egyptian dialect which is normally used in Egyptian cinema, reinforces the impression of monumentalism.The unrestrained sacking of the tombs is represented as a danger, threatening moral decline by inviting greed and sex to undermine the dignity of the tribe and its traditions, replacing the order of the world with chaos.\nShadi Abdel Salam has said that his task was to remind Egyptians of their own history: \"I think that the people of my country are ignorant of our history and I feel that it is my mission to make them know some of it. I regard cinema not as a consumerist art, but as a historical document for the next generations.\" Although he went on to direct short fiction and documentaries, The Night of Counting the Years remains Abdel Salam's only full length feature film.\nThe film was selected as the Egyptian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 43rd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee."

        "content": "This film is set in 1881, when Egypt was under the failing rule of the Ottoman Khedives, themselves overseen by the Anglo-French Caisse de la Dette, and a year before the start of British colonial rule. It is based on the true story of the Abd el-Rassuls, an Upper-Egyptian clan that is stealing piecemeal a cache of mummies they have discovered at a tomb (known to modern Egyptologists as DB320) near the village of Kurna, and selling the artefacts on the black market.\nThe film begins with Wanis (Ahmed Marei) and his older brother (Ahmed Hegazy) watching the funeral of their father Selim. The brothers have become the heads of the Horabat tribe, and their uncle shows them its dark secret \u2013 the tribe has been living off the treasures of the ancient pharaohs buried in tombs within the mountain on which they live. The brothers are shocked on seeing their uncle beheading a mummy to obtain a gold necklace. They feel their life is built on a lie. The older brother complains to the family, who kill him and throw his body into the Nile. The secret thus falls solely onto the shoulders of Wanis, who struggles to reconcile his conscience with his loyalty to his people.\nThe city people (effendis), wealthy Egyptian archeologists, have come - unusually in the hot summer - to try to identify the source of unexplained artefacts which have been found on the black market, following a meeting with French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero. The trading has been led by Ayoub (Shafiq Noureddin), via Murad (Mohamed Babih), who also runs a brothel.\nWanis tells Ayoub that the tribe will not trade with him again. Murad then tells Wanis that his uncle arranged for his brother to be killed; Murad says that Ayoub has sent him to repair the relationship with Wanis and acquire the remaining treasure. Wanis refuses, and walks to the steamboat carrying the effendi leadership. A team of archaeologists and soldiers are sent to the tomb, and the tomb is emptied of all the sarcophagi, which are loaded onto the boat."

Munsey, is a sadist who manipulates prisoners to inform on one another and create trouble so he can inflict punishment. The often drunk prison doctor warns that the prison is a powder keg and will explode if they are not careful. He denounces Munsey's approach and complains that the public and government officials fail to understand the need for rehabilitation.\nJoe's attorney visits and tells Joe his wife Ruth is not willing to have an operation for cancer unless Joe can be there with her. He takes his revenge on fellow inmate Wilson, who at Munsey's instigation had planted a weapon on Joe that earned him a stay in solitary. Joe has organized a fatal attack on Wilson in the prison machine shop but provides himself with an alibi by talking with the doctor in his office while the murder occurs.\nJoe presses another inmate, Gallagher, to help him escape but Gallagher has a good job at the prison newspaper and Munsey has promised him parole soon. Munsey then instigates a prisoner's suicide, giving higher authorities the opportunity to revoke all prisoner privileges and cancel parole hearings. Gallagher feels betrayed and decides to join Joe's escape plan. Joe and Gallagher plan an assault on the guard tower where they can get access to the lever that lowers a bridge that controls access to the prison.\nWhile the escape plan is taking shape, each of the inmates in cell R17 tells their story, and in every case, their love for a woman is what landed them in trouble with the law. Munsey learns the details of the escape plan from an informer, \"Freshman\" Stack, one of the men in cell R17, and the break goes badly. The normally subdued prison yard turns into a violent and bloody riot, killing Munsey, Gallagher, and the remainder of the inmates in cell R17, including Joe.

He is in a comfortable relationship with his beautiful yet childish and pampered girlfriend Sanjana, who changes her profession every six months, rather disastrously. Her father, who dislikes Karan, always tries to keep her happy and supports her. Bhavesh wishes for an arranged marriage and keeps a diary of all the beautiful things he will do to his wife after marriage. His father Darshan Manibhai Patel is a strict autocrat, patriarch. Jeet does not believe in marriage or love and is a womaniser. He encourages married women into divorcing their spouses so that his living as a divorce lawyer is uncompromised.\nBhavesh's father treats him as young and incapable of marriage, but on his wife's insistence, he travels with his family, along with Karan and Sanjana to Gujarat to find Bhavesh a bride. In Gujarat, they stay at the palatial home of Bhavesh's father's friend, Vijay Singh Jadeja. Bhavesh meets some girls but ends up falling for Prachi, Vijay Singh's daughter, and they get married. During their wedding, Sanjana says \"yes\" to Karan's proposal as well and they get married the same night.\nThe movie then switches to the present, where both couples are at court. The judge declares the divorce between Karan and Sanjana and Bhavesh and Prachi valid. The story goes back 6 months earlier, showing what led to the divorces when they came back to Cape Town from India.\nAfter marriage, Karan and Sanjana's family life deteriorates, with Karan wanting domestic stability and Sanjana being a horrible homemaker. Karan finally loses patience with Sanjana after she accidentally burns down their apartment, and yells at her, venting his frustration at her stupidity and his dislike for her father. Shocked and heartbroken, Sanjana leaves and sends a notice of divorce to him the very next morning.\nBhavesh is happy with Prachi, but Prachi is stifled at the old-fashioned ideals and strict rules of Bhavesh's father. She, without her father-in-law's knowledge, applies for a job \u2013 the very idea of which angers him. Bhavesh, taking sides with his father, slaps her at the same time Prachi's father arrives. Bhavesh, bound by his father's old-fashioned ideas, is unable to stand by his wife. This ends with Prachi divorcing Bhavesh.\nJeet later changes his lifestyle when he meets Anjali, who turns out to be different from all the other girls he has met, since she does not give up on him and expresses a genuine desire to marry him. He decides to marry her and Karan and Bhavesh shout themselves hoarse at him, stating that since Jeet had facilitated their divorces, he has no right to get married. Jeet explains that he was wrong in taking a negative view of love and marriage and also says that wives or \"life partners\" always stood by their husbands, thus it is never worth it to break up such a relationship.\nAt Jeet's wedding, Sanjana enters the party, wearing a \"bomb\", shouting that Jeet was happily getting married when he had caused her divorce. With five minutes left for the bomb to explode, Karan and Sanjana have an argument as to why their divorce took place. Sanjana's father intervenes by saying that he had been against the relationship from the start, and he had sent the divorce papers to them without their knowledge. With only seconds left, Bhavesh's father also apologises to Prachi and the family for imposing his traditional values on them. However, the \"bomb\" turns out to be fake. When this is revealed to be a plan concocted by Jeet and Sanjana to bring everyone to admit their mistakes, everyone reconciles with each other.\nAt the end, Bhavesh's father lets go of his strict ideals and is shown interacting happily and in a modern manner with his family. Jeet becomes a marriage counsellor, now uniting the very people he separated, and Karan unsuccessfully tries to teach Sanjana how to cook."

The series follows Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed as they patrol Los Angeles in their police cruiser, assigned the call sign \"1-Adam-12\". Adam-12 stars Martin Milner and Kent McCord, with several recurring co-stars, the most frequent being William Boyett and Gary Crosby. The series ran over seven seasons from September 21, 1968, until May 20, 1975.\nLike Webb's other series, Dragnet and Emergency!, Adam-12 was produced in cooperation with the actual department it was based on, in this case, the LAPD. Adam-12 aimed to be realistic in its depiction of policing and helped familiarize the American public with police procedures and jargon. A syndicated revival by The Arthur Company aired from 1990 to 1991 for two seasons, featuring new characters and an updated setting."

        "content": "Set in the Los Angeles Police Department's Central Division, Adam-12 follows police officers Pete Malloy (Martin Milner) and Jim Reed (Kent McCord) as they patrol Los Angeles. The plots of most episodes follow Malloy and Reed as they handle the various calls for service that they are assigned to or come across, ranging from intense incidents such as pursuits, standoffs, shootouts, hostage-takings, gang violence, terrorism, and undercover assignments, to the mundane (and far more common) routine happenings like traffic stops, disputes, disturbances, narcotics crimes, DUI arrests, fights, and thefts.\nAt the start of the series, Malloy, seeking to resign after the death of his previous partner, is assigned to field train Reed, an inexperienced rookie. After Reed disobeys Malloy's orders but singlehandedly arrests a group of armed suspects during a high-risk shooting call, Malloy sees potential in Reed and decides to remain on the force to guide him through his nine-month probationary period. The first and second seasons are not chronological, with Reed's stated time in the LAPD varying in each episode. Starting with the third season, the series was organized chronologically, and Reed completed his probationary period, with him and Malloy remaining partners. Throughout the series, and especially in later seasons, Malloy and Reed began patrolling other divisions and working on different assignments (such as divisions assigned to patrol neighborhoods like Venice and Hollywood, airport detail, Metropolitan Division, Air Support Division, and even desk duty), occasionally explained as them filling in for other officers or being part of police experience programs.  Malloy sometimes fills in for Sergeant William MacDonald as the watch commander in the show's final season. At the same time, Reed finds himself partnered with probationary officers, mirroring Malloy's original role as his field training officer. In the series finale, Reed receives the Medal of Valor for saving Malloy's life and completes an examination to become a detective, while Malloy is set for a promotion to sergeant.\nThe personal lives of Malloy and Reed came up on occasion and were often tied into their duties, though they rarely extended past conversations, episode subplots, or brief scenes. Malloy is a bachelor who has at least five girlfriends (not simultaneously) over the course of the series. Reed is married to a woman named Jean (played by several actresses, including Mikki Jamison and Kristin Nelson); in the second season, they are shown to have a son, Jim Jr. (or Jimmy). Occasionally, Malloy and Reed are depicted socializing outside their work, but such scenes are rare."

        "content": "Martin Milner as Officer Pete Malloy: A veteran police officer who initially plans to resign from the LAPD, but remains on the force to guide Reed through his probationary period. He is acquainted or familiar with many officers in Central Division, as well as some citizens in Adam-12's usual patrol areas. By season 7, he is preparing for a promotion to Sergeant and spends time working as a watch commander. He is single but seeking, and the subplots of several episodes revolve around his dating life. His badge number is 744.\nKent McCord as Officer Jim Reed: A rookie police officer assigned Malloy as his field training officer. After his probationary period, he remains Malloy's partner. Malloy does not trust him to drive the cruiser, a recurring joke throughout the series. At the end of season 7, he applies to become a detective. He has a wife, Jean, and a son, Jimmy. His badge number is 2430.\nShaaron Claridge as herself: A police dispatcher and desk clerk. Working alongside an unnamed male dispatcher, Claridge appears in voice only in almost every episode. She only physically appears briefly in season 5, episode 20. Claridge was an actual LAPD dispatcher who acted as a side job until her retirement in 1990.\nWilliam Boyett as Sergeant William \"Mac\" MacDonald: The watch commander of Central Division. He is responsible for commanding and organizing the officers under him, including Malloy and Reed, who report to him and are sometimes assigned to cases by him. Mac is issued a station wagon and a Federal Riot Gun capable of firing tear gas rounds, which he and other officers are authorized to use in standoffs. When he goes into the field, his call sign is 1-L-20. He is mentioned to have a wife named Mary, a son named William \"Billy\", a daughter named Elizabeth, and a brother named Bryan.\nGary Crosby as Officer Ed Wells: A police officer and one of Malloy's friends. In his first appearance in season 1, he is depicted as very hot-headed and reckless, though this behavior is toned down in later seasons, with him mostly serving as comic relief instead. Though he acts cocky and makes jokes at the expense of other officers, he is also fairly dimwitted, and several of his jokes and actions fall flat or backfire. At least once, his cockiness landed him in the hospital with gunshot wounds, and Reed and Malloy had to come to his aid. Throughout the series, he is seen with numerous different assigned partners. He was proposed as a potential successor to Malloy for a planned eighth season that ultimately never materialized.\nWilliam Elliott as Motor Officer Gus Grant: A motorcycle officer introduced in later seasons. He is laid-back but dedicated to his work. His use of a motorcycle is a factor in several incidents, with Adam-12 usually called in to support him with their cruiser. He is one of the only African American characters in the series to have a recurring role.\nJack Hogan as Detective Sergeant Jerry Miller: A detective who handles investigations that Malloy and Reed assist with or are involved in, most prominently in the earlier seasons. Many of his appearances depict Miller in different detective divisions, such as homicide and internal affairs, similar to Joe Friday from Dragnet. Hogan also plays Lieutenant Fred Benson, an LAPD Air Support Division helicopter pilot.\nArt Gilmore as Lieutenant Moore: The commanding officer of Central Division. Dialogue in the pilot episode suggests he was Malloy's field training officer when he was a rookie. His role is greatly minimized between seasons 2 and 7, where he makes very few appearances, with Mac mostly taking up his role as the \"boss\" of Central Division. By season 7, he had been promoted to captain.\nMichael Warren as Officer Larry Carter: A rookie police officer who, at the time of his first appearance, is only two days out of the police academy. In season 4, episode 15, Carter is assigned to Malloy while Reed goes undercover in a narcotics ring. He was proposed as a potential successor to Malloy for a planned eighth season.\nMark Harmon as Officer Gus Corbin: A rookie police officer. In season 7, episode 21, Reed is assigned to field train Corbin while Malloy fills in as watch commander for Mac. Corbin is shown to be inexperienced as well as clumsy and frequently puts himself at risk. However, he is still capable of effectively handling situations himself when necessary. He was proposed as a potential successor to Malloy for a planned eighth season.\nJo Ann Pflug as Officer Dana Hall: A female police officer who, unusually for the time, is assigned to patrol duty. In season 7 episode 22, Hall is assigned to Reed while Malloy fills in as watch commander. Though Hall is initially met with derision by the other officers (especially Wells) for her gender, Reed respects her and shows she is just as capable of frontline policing as male officers. She was proposed as a potential successor to Malloy for a planned eighth season.\nSteve Franken as Officer Albert Porter: A reserve police officer and one of Reed's friends. Outside the LAPD, he works as an electrical engineer.\nMarco Lopez as Officer Sanchez: One of Wells's assigned partners. Lopez also plays other recurring officers, mostly unnamed background characters.\nFred Stromsoe as Officer Jerry Woods: A recurring police officer. He appears in the credits sequence of every episode, even those he does not appear in, for reasons unknown.\nClaude Johnson as Officer Brinkman: A recurring police officer. Johnson also plays other recurring officers, including Officer Norm Green and Officer Johnson.\nWilliam Stevens as Officer Jerry Walters: A recurring police officer. Stevens also plays Officer Lou Walters, another recurring officer.\nRobert Patten as Detective Sergeant Stone: A recurring detective. Patten also plays other detectives and officers, including Detective Fremont, Detective Sergeant Benson, Detective Speer, Sergeant Baron, and Sergeant King.\nChuck Bowman as Detective Cole Edwards: A recurring detective. Bowman also plays other characters, including Harold Thompson, Officer Rogers, Officer Miller, Lieutenant Andrews, and Sergeant McCall.\nMikki Jamison and Kristin Nelson (actor varies between seasons) as Jean Reed: Jim Reed's wife. She dislikes that Reed is a police officer due to the dangers of his work, and fears for his safety, though she is otherwise supportive of him. She has a son, Jimmy.\nJed Allan as Reno West: A cat burglar active in the Los Angeles area. He was previously caught by Malloy, but was released four years later, after which he attempted to return to burglaries; however, he was caught again by Malloy and Reed. He plays a significant role throughout season 6.\nAneta Corsaut as Judy: One of Malloy's girlfriends, first appearing in season 7."

        "content": "Universal Studios co-produced the show with Mark VII Limited. The series' first episode, \"Log 1: The Impossible Mission\", was filmed in September 1967, a year before the pilot was picked up.The production of Adam-12 involved showing all aspects of correct police procedures. Police cruisers played a central role, as \"Webb wanted the vehicle itself to be considered a character\". The show's routine use of police radio communications and jargon helped reinforce \"the sound of radio as an anti-crime technology.\" The police vehicles used in the production of the show were purchased from local dealerships and outfitted by the prop department to accurate LAPD cruiser specifications.The driving scenes were filmed on public streets using a dedicated camera platform mounted to the cruiser's hood, which was towed by a station wagon. The platform held three cameras: the center camera would film both Milner and McCord in one shot, while the left and right cameras would film Milner and McCord, respectively, on a cross-angle. All three cameras were remote-controlled and would roll simultaneously. For the pilot, Webb did not like the reflections of the sky on the windshield (which made Milner and McCord difficult to see), so the windshield of the vehicle was removed; however, this made the actors' hair blow and caused issues with the audio recording equipment. The prop department's solution was to reinstall the windshield and build an overhead shield that extended over the hood and windshield of the car to block the reflections. Sides were added to create a large \"black box\" over the front of the vehicle with both ends \"open\", which allowed for more controlled filming circumstances. During filming, the script supervisor would lie on the floor in the back of the car to read script dialogue for the voices coming from the police radio, which Milner and McCord would respond to. The director and the sound man would sit in a rear-facing seat in the back of the station wagon towing the police car.\nMost scenes in the older seasons were filmed at the Universal Studios Lot, mostly in Courthouse Square and Colonial Street. Starting with the third and fourth seasons, the series gradually shifted to filming in actual locations in Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. The garage used tow trucks from the LAPD's North Hollywood Division that was located near Universal Studios.\nThe police station used in the series was the Rampart Police Station, located at 2710 West Temple Street. The station was built in 1966, two years before the series began, and could thus be considered \"state of the art\" for most of the series' run. Rampart Police Station was closed in 2008, and Rampart Division moved to the newer and larger Rampart Community Police Station. The old station was renovated to serve as the headquarters for the LAPD Metropolitan Division. The renovated building, now known as the LAPD Metropolitan Division Facility, opened in 2016.In 1974, during the production of the seventh season, Martin Milner signed to play Karl Robinson on the short-lived television series The Swiss Family Robinson, taking him off Adam-12. Several options were tested during this season, which would allow the series to continue should the production of a proposed eighth season move forward. Jo Ann Pflug, Mark Harmon, and Michael Warren were tested for their potential to replace Milner in episodes where McCord served as their training officer or partner. Another idea proposed that the series be continued with Officer Ed Wells, played by Gary Crosby, replacing Malloy, who would be written off with a promotion to Sergeant at another division. However, the birth of Kent McCord's son three days before the seventh season's finale aired took McCord off the show as well, forcing the series to end with the seventh season."

It was one of the shows that portrayed \"the professionalism of the officers and police departments\".

Douglas Rushkoff noted, \"Adam-12 also marked [the] last gasp of the righteous style of cop TV.\" Their set was not a squad room or an office, but the actors \"watched the changes in American culture through the windshield of their squad car\". \"12\", a slang nickname for police, likely originated from Adam-12, in a manner comparable to the similar nickname \"five-O\", which originated from Hawaii Five-O.In 2003, the Los Angeles Police Department activated an actual unit with the 1-Adam-12 call sign, in service with the Central Division. The unit was not a standard patrol unit and was only assigned to officers who demonstrated \"outstanding duty performance\". It is unknown if the unit is still active as of 2023."

It is based on the 2004 novel of the same name by Tom Perrotta, who co-wrote the screenplay with Field. It follows Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet), an unhappy housewife who has an affair with a married neighbor (Patrick Wilson). Also starring are Jennifer Connelly, Jackie Earle Haley, Noah Emmerich, Gregg Edelman, Phyllis Somerville and Will Lyman.\nLittle Children premiered at the 44th New York Film Festival, and was released October 6, 2006, on 5 screens, earning $145,946, with a $29,189 per-screen average. However, during its 64 weeks in theaters, 32 screens were the most on which New Line Cinema ever exhibited the film, only briefly increasing that count to 109 in the few weeks leading up to the 79th Academy Awards. Consequently, few cinema-goers had access to it, significantly limiting its earnings. Despite this, it won numerous critics' group prizes and received Oscar nominations for Best Actress for Winslet, Best Supporting Actor for Haley, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Field and Perrotta."

One day, she meets Brad Adamson, a married law student who brings his 4-year-old son, Aaron, to the park. Brad and Sarah become friendly and, on a dare, kiss in the park, but resolve not to act on their mutual attraction.\nOne day, several parents panic when they see recently paroled sex offender Ronnie J. McGorvey swimming in the pool with the children. After he is escorted away by the police, Sarah and Brad take Lucy and Aaron back to her house and put the kids to bed. While Sarah is drying towels in her basement, Brad comes down and they have sex.\nRonnie lives with his mother, May, who believes that Ronnie's pedophilia would be cured if he met a woman his own age. Ronnie reluctantly agrees to go on a date May has arranged for him with a woman named Sheila, which ends badly when he masturbates next to her in her car by a children's playground.\nWhen Brad skips taking the bar exam again, his wife Kathy grows suspicious and tells him to invite Sarah, Richard, and Lucy over for dinner. The intimacy evident between Brad and Sarah confirms her suspicions, and Kathy arranges for her mother to come for an extended visit. When Brad's football team plays its final game, Sarah attends and cheers as Brad scores the winning touchdown. Afterwards, they make out on the field, with Brad convincing her to run away with him.\nBrad's friend Larry Hedges, a former police officer who went on disability after accidentally killing a little boy, spends much of his time harassing Ronnie. One night, he enters Ronnie's neighborhood with a megaphone. May comes out to confront him, suffering a heart attack in the process when Larry pushes her to the ground, causing him to be arrested. May is taken to a hospital, where she dies. When Ronnie returns home from the hospital, he finds a letter written by May saying: \"Please be a good boy.\" Distraught, Ronnie destroys much of his mother's collection of Hummel figurines before grabbing a knife.\nThat same night, Sarah and Brad agree to meet in the park. As he heads to the park, he is distracted by skateboarding teenagers. Attempting to try a jump himself, he knocks himself out. When he regains consciousness, he asks the paramedics to call his wife to meet him at the hospital.\nWhen Sarah takes Lucy to the park, she sees Ronnie stagger onto one of the swings, revealing to her that his mother died. When Lucy disappears, Sarah panics and rushes to find her, forgetting about Brad. She finds her staring at a street lamp and places her back into her car. Larry arrives to apologize to Ronnie about May, but when he discovers that Ronnie has castrated himself and is bleeding to death, he races him to the hospital, the same time as Kathy meets Brad there."

Firmly rooted in the present and in our current frame of mind\u2014a time and frame of mind that few artists have shown interest in really exploring\u2014the movie is one of the few films I can think of that examines the baffling combination of smugness, self-abnegation, ceremonial deference and status anxiety that characterizes middle-class Gen X parenting, and find sheer, white-knuckled terror at its core."

Shortly after arriving for shooting in Miami, Dafoe quit due to script changes which required him to perform slapstick comedy which did not suit him. Six days later, the decision was taken to cancel production as no satisfactory replacement could be found for Dafoe and write off the $7 million cost.

The role of Stacey Hanson (Anne Randall) was divided into two new characters: private detective protagonist Cody Abilene (Darby Hinton) and his girlfriend June Khnockers (Lynda Wiesmeier).The openings of both films depict their respective female race car drivers in the finish of a practice race. Both films then have them getting out of uniform. Stacey is the protagonist, though, while June serves mostly as the source of a recurring joke in her film: \"Knockers with an \"h\"?\". June can still reliably drive a high-performance race car, but Cody performs most of Stacey's functions in the film.The discreet homosexual nephew John (John Alderman) turns into Stuart (Michael A. Anderson), a drag queen, in the second film. In both films, the detective follows the character into a gay bar. The difference is that in the first film, John wears regular clothes, while in the second, Stuart is in full drag. Cody laughs while dictating notes into a recorder, but still admits that Stuart has great legs. Stuart is more of a cartoonish gay stereotype than John.The youthful niece Pamela (Cristina Raines) turns into the bit older niece Liza (Lorraine Michaels) in the second film. Liza has her own sex scene with the houseboy Shane (Brett Clark). The difference in age was probably decided to allow this sex scene and more nudity than would be acceptable from a teenager.The second film adds a character with no counterpart in the original: Contessa Luciana (Sybil Danning). Contessa has a romantic night with Cody, before he moves into his next assignment. The relationship to the family is unspecified, but she turns out to have murdered Shane. She is beyond the reach of the law and suffers no ill consequences for her murder."

The ship crashes and fear grips the revelers. Mary, now disgusted with the group and all it represents, mends her manner of living and plans a future with the man who has always sincerely loved her."

Those portions were directed by her husband and depicted a scavenger hunt, so that the production could visit many famous and recognizable London locations . A car was purchased specifically for the film and was shipped back to the states so that the film could be completed at the studio. Colleen had to acquire a special permit to drive. \nThe film was intended to be an English look at the flapper, and the story shared many of the same elements of Colleen's star-making Flaming Youth. As in Flaming Youth, Colleen's brother Cleeve had a part in this film as well. He played the brother of Colleen's character."

Unlike his self-titled debut solo album, which featured a variety of singers including Chris Cornell, Ozzy Osbourne, M. Shadows, and Kid Rock, he said his second album would feature Alter Bridge vocalist Myles Kennedy as the sole singer. Kennedy had previously appeared on two songs from Slash's first album, and was later the vocalist of Slash's band on tour. Slash later said that his second album would be more of a collaboration album with Kennedy, and said he was unsure whether it would be released under his own name or a new name entirely.Slash began working on his second solo album in June 2011, and that December, three songs\u2014\"Halo\", \"Standing in the Sun\" and \"Bad Rain\"\u2014had been recorded. Slash described the new material as \"very heavy\". The album was finished in February 2012 and was given a May 22, 2012, release date. The first single, \"You're a Lie\", was released to rock radio on February 27, 2012; a 30-second preview of the song was released online with this announcement. Slash released the track listing for the album on March 5, 2012. Kennedy, who wrote the lyrics, has said that some of the lyrics on the album are about his past negative experiences with drugs.On March 26, 30 second samples from \"Apocalyptic Love\" were made available on Amazon.com. It is an \"internet rumor\" according to Slash that the lead intro riff for \"Anastasia\" takes inspiration from Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, which Slash interpolates live in his version of \"Speak Softly Love\"."

The number one album for the week was John Mayer's Born and Raised, with 17,800 copies.The album received mixed reviews from critics. On Metacritic, it has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 13 reviews. Writing for Artistdirect, Rick Florino gave an enthusiastic review, awarding the album 5 out of 5 stars and stating that it \"embodies every side of Slash\", featuring \"some of the man's most incendiary and infectious playing yet\". He also praises Myles Kennedy's vocals and cites \"Anastastia\" and \"Far and Away\" as standout tracks, praising their orchestral and cinematic elements.Brandon Geist of Revolver also gave a positive review of the album, giving it a 4 out of 5 rating. Geist compares the album to Slash's solo d\u00e9but, which he criticised for sometimes seeming \"strained under the weight of its creator\u2019s own grand ambition\", whereas on Apocalyptic Love, Slash's band \"let the riffs and hooks fly freely\". He concludes that the album is \"a collection of lean, high-octane rock-and-roll tunes\".Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a more mixed opinion of the album in his review for AllMusic, awarding it 3 out of 5 stars. He observes that performing with Kennedy \"clearly is easier on Slash's soul\" compared to the vocalists in Slash's previous bands, and that the music on the album \"reflects this ease\". He criticises the album for containing \"absolutely no surprises\" but adds that it \"never tries too hard, so it winds up satisfying on its own limited scale.\"Another 3/5 rating came from Johan Wippsson, writing for Melodic.net, who wrote that the album \"is far better\" than Slash's debut, praising the decision to have Kennedy perform on all tracks, though admitting that he \"had expected better songs\"."

A distressed Emily swears off taking in any more tramps, to the delight of the rest of the family. However, later in the morning, Wade Rawlins (Brian Aherne) appears at the Kilbournes' doorstep. His ramshackle car had broken down; when he got out, it rolled off a cliff. He wants to use the telephone, but is instead immediately adopted by Emily Kilbourne and appointed as the replacement chauffeur, despite the rude efforts of Grosvenor and Emily's daughters Geraldine \"Jerry\" (Constance Bennett) and Marion (Bonita Granville). Further attempts to convince Mrs. Kilbourne to get rid of this latest tramp are blissfully ignored.\nRawlins, as the new chauffeur, is housed in the servant's quarters. He is overheard talking to himself while cleaning up by Grosvenor and suspected to be crazy. Jerry and Marion see the spruced up tramp looking the perfect gentleman and Jerry approves when Rawlins later brushes off Jerry's arrogant would-be suitor, Herbert Wheeler (Phillip Reed). They now have second thoughts when their father, Henry Kilbourne (Clarence Kolb), who has returned from work, tells Emily that he is putting his foot down and orders that they get rid of her latest tramp the next day.\nA comedy of errors, nighttime interludes with drunken family behavior, the arrogant Herbert making a move on Jerry, follows with the rescue of the damsel in distress who has also somehow misplaced her keys where some delightful flirting ensues, resulting in Jerry falling in love with Wade. Marion also expresses a crush on Wade. The next day, Emily Kilbourne, despite orders to get rid of Wade, trains him to be a footman at the important dinner party that evening for Senator Harlan (Paul Everton). That evening, through a contrived prank by Marion, Rawlins is accidentally invited to the important dinner party for Senator Harlan, who takes quite a liking to him, as does his daughter Minerva (Ann Dvorak).\nThe next morning, the family finds Rawlins occupying the guest room. It is impossible to throw him out, as it is discovered that he is now a confidant of Senator Harlan and his daughter's target of affection. Jerry is consumed with jealousy, as she sees Minerva flirting with Rawlins at golf later that morning. After a fudge-making spat with Jerry, Rawlins takes the rest of the day off on an errand. The car he wrecked turns out to be a loan. He goes to pay for it, but the car has been found and the police inform the car's owner that Rawlins is assumed to be dead. The man leaves to identify his car. Thus, when Rawlins arrives, the owner's assistant George (Willie Best) thinks he is a ghost. The Kilbournes believe Rawlins has left for good, much to Jerry's dismay after waiting up to reconcile with him.\nThe next morning at breakfast, the newspaper reports the death of E. Wade Rawlins, the \"noted novelist\", from a car crash, much to the shock and dismay of the family, the cook and the maid. When Rawlins reappears, very much alive, utter pandemonium ensues as much of the family assume they are seeing a ghost. Once the confusion dies down the truth becomes clear & Jerry is immensely relieved."

The writers, Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, had worked on it for 13 months.Film rights were sold almost immediately, to Universal, for a reported $100,000 against a sliding percentage of the gross to reach a maximum of 15% at $2.5 million. A clause was added that if a film was not released by June 30, 1950, the rights would revert to the authors and they would keep the $100,000. Diana Wynyard appeared in the London production and her husband Carol Reed was going to direct the film version. However, he disagreed with Universal about how best to adapt it. Another director, Michael Gordon, encountered similar difficulties. In 1948, Goff approached Universal to buy the project back but balked at the studio's demand for $316,000. When the June 30, 1950 deadline passed, the project reverted to the authors. They tried finance the film with Michael Gordon and Joan Crawford."

It also draws on traditional R&B influences, of which The Source writes, \"The album is a modern variation on the Stax/Muscle Shoals convocations of yore, where the feel of the record set a mood that extended long after the final chords evaporated\". Austin's production on the album is characterized by low-end definition and various aural details. Other elements in the music include slow jams, a cappella tracks, acid jazz, hip hop, layers of drums, and sirens. Songs such as \"Freedom\" and \"Sunshine & the Rain\" exhibit hip hop-influenced production. Martin Johnson of the Chicago Reader comments that the album's \"ingeniously gritty sound\" evokes older R&B songs such as Aretha Franklin's \"Day Dreaming\", Curtis Mayfield's \"Future Shock\", and Sly and the Family Stone's \"Family Affair\". The a capella opening track \"Stand\" has rootsy, spiritual harmonies. It segues into \"Freedom\", a rock-inflected soul song with wailing vocals, electronically distorted sonics, resounding rhythm, and a gospel chorus. \"Sunshine & the Rain\" is a bass-heavy song. \"Memories\" is a jazzy, saccharine soul ballad. \"Fatal Lovesick Journey\" has an intimate, smooth R&B style. \"If We Weren't Who We Were\" has a low humming sound.The album has themes of enlightenment, personal freedom, intimate relationships, and womanism. The lyrics celebrate Joi's strength and individuality, and her whimsical, amorous persona exhibits riot grrrl characteristics. Songs such as \"Sunshine & the Rain\" and \"Find Me\" are sung from a black feminist perspective. Joi sings in high alto on the album, and her vocals are varied and impassioned. They are also characterized by dramatic accents and, at times, flat and sharp pitches. \"I've Found My Niche\" has lyrics promoting self-expression. \"Find Me\" is an ode to self-knowledge, with Joi forcefully singing, \"I'll learn from my mistakes and I'll be strong / So I can find me\". \"Adoramus te Christe\" has Latin lyrics and is adapted from Quirino Gasparini's 18th century motet of the same name. The slow, lustful \"Narcissa Cutie Pie\" has erotic subject matter and was inspired by a sexual experience Joi had with another woman. She recalled the experience and addressed her sexuality in an interview, saying that \"I'm not a lesbian [...] But I met a girl who made me question myself\". The song also features the album's recurring theme of independence, with Joi declaring \"I can do whatever I want to do\". \"I Don't Mind\" features a raga rock style and themes of resignation and acceptance. The a capella \"If We Weren't Who We Were\" has spiritual overtones and a theme of lovelessness. The closing track is a reprise of \"Freedom\"."

David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called Joi \"as enigmatic and ear-grabbing as her music\" and stated, \"Joi's sweet, elastic voice wraps itself up and around spacey pop that exists in a universe all its own\". Browne remarked on her eccentric personality and concluded in his review, \"Joi leaves you scratching your head, but she fills it with beatific sounds along the way.\" Rolling Stone called the album \"an alluring, shifting cybersexual listening experience\" and complimented Joi's \"dynamic range\". Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, cited \"Freedom\" and \"Narcissa Cutie\" as highlights and wrote in summary of the album, \"freedom as manumission, freedom as swinging both ways\".In a retrospective review, Allmusic editor Stanton Swihart commended Joi's \"versatility\" and commented that the album \"has a whole lot to offer listeners across a wide spectrum of pop music.\" Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! called the album \"ahead of its time\".

Martin Johnson of the Chicago Reader wrote of their collective legacy in a 1994 article, \"[they are] likely to fall through the cracks. Iconoclastic women rockers\u2014such as PJ Harvey, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, and Tori Amos\u2014have gained a small foothold, but like-minded women in R & B often have nowhere to go. Too radical for urban radio, they're left to rely on word of mouth\". The Pendulum Vibe garnered the attention of recording artist Madonna, who sought out Joi and developed a friendship with her. She also enlisted Austin to produce songs for her 1994 album Bedtime Stories. Joi attempted to follow up The Pendulum Vibe with Amoeba Cleansing Syndrome in 1997, but the album was shelved after her label folded, and she went on an extended hiatus. She became a long-time collaborator of the Dungeon Family collective and appeared on albums by OutKast, Goodie Mob, and Society of Soul.Since its initial reception, The Pendulum Vibe has attained a cult following among listeners of eclectic R&B music. Allmusic's Stanton Swihart cites the album as \"an integral influence on the neo-soul movement\" and \"a predecessor to and trailblazer for artists like Dionne Farris and Erykah Badu\". Jacinta Howard of Creative Loafing writes that Joi was \"arguably the most pivotal - if not the first - artist to arrive on the alternative soul scene, directly influencing acts ranging from Erykah Badu to OutKast to Janelle Mon\u00e1e.\" James Hannaham of Spin views that Joi \"rewrote the rule book for urban contemporary R&B\" with the album, adding that neo soul artists Maxwell and Erykah Badu \"then memorized it.\" Rolling Stone journalist Jon Caramanica writes in The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), \"Joi entered the R&B world as a sort of avant-bohemian, doing so-called neosoul music years before Philadelphians like Jill Scott, James Poyser, and Musiq forged a scene to merit the moniker.\" Miles Marshall Lewis cites The Pendulum Vibe, along with De La Soul's Buhloone Mindstate, the Beastie Boys' Check Your Head, Me'shell Ndeg\u00e9ocello's Plantation Lullabies, D'Angelo's Brown Sugar, as one of the albums that \"proved that the aesthetic sentiments of B-boys and bohos were never as divergent as many believed.\"In 1998, Stereophile included the album on its list of Records to Die For, with editor Chip Stern calling it \"unheralded\" and \"as visionary an R&B record as I've heard in the past 25 years.\""

A statement from the band's management regarding the upcoming collection reads as follows:\n\nAfter the production period of the album, there were many songs which did not find a place on 'Reise, Reise' due to dramaturgical reason but are now completed. This is not unusual. As 'Ohne Dich' derived from the production of 'Mutter', many songs have been sitting to be completed for a year and shall now come to light. Which songs remains to be seen and is up to the band only.\nThe record company stated: \"When we were introduced to the tracks of \"Reise, Reise\", many fascinating songs were among them, which were suddenly missing on the album. Among others I remember one song, which we all believed to be the first single of the album. The song was \"Rosenrot\", and when we had to realize that the band changed their minds and it did not even make it on to the album, we were speechless. The album was perfect nevertheless, but their enormous self-confidence surprised us.\"\nThe mixing sessions for the album took place in April and May 2004 at Toytown Studio in Stockholm, Sweden.

        "content": "Symphony Hour is a 1942 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The cartoon depicts Mickey Mouse conducting a symphony orchestra sponsored by Pete. The film was directed by Riley Thomson and features music adapted from the \"Light Cavalry Overture\" by Franz von Supp\u00e9. The voice cast includes Walt Disney as Mickey, Billy Bletcher as Pete (as Sylvester Macaroni), and John McLeish as a radio announcer. It was the 117th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the second for that year.The film marked the last theatrical appearance of Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, and Clara Cluck for over 40 years, finally reappearing in Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983). Symphony Hour is also the last time that Mickey appeared with either Donald Duck or Goofy in a theatrical film for the same length of time.Symphony Hour bears similarities with the 1935 film The Band Concert. Leonard Maltin called this short a \"Spike Jones version of The Band Concert\".The soundtrack for the \"ruined\" version of the Light Cavalry Overture was used in the October 22, 1956 episode of The Mickey Mouse Club."

The sponsor (Pete, under the name Sylvester Macaroni) loves the rehearsal and agrees to have it shown in concert. On the night of the performance, everyone is soon ready, except, of course, for Goofy, who accidentally drops all the instruments under an elevator, severely damaging them and thus rendering them unable to make proper musical sounds.\nMickey is left unaware of the unfortunate mishap until the time to go on the air and the musicians start to \"play\" the damaged instruments. Throughout the outrageous concert, Mickey struggles with anxiety while Macaroni throws a tantrum inside his private viewing room. Macaroni is reduced to tears when the concert ends, believing his reputation to be ruined, but lightens up when he hears the thunderous applause from the audience. He immediately runs to the orchestra room and carries Mickey Mouse in extreme approval, with the latter not knowing anything that happened.\nBesides Goofy, other members of the orchestra include Donald Duck, Clara Cluck, Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. At one point, Donald is so fed up with the chaos caused by the damaged instruments that he packs his things and leaves. However, Mickey, who is determined to carry on come what may, points a gun at Donald's head to prevent him from leaving. The shot of the gun was cut in some television prints."

        "content": "After being impaled by a pipe and plunged into a body of water, the now-undead \"Maniac Cop\" Matthew Cordell acquires a junked police cruiser and restarts his killing spree through New York City. Finding a convenience store in the middle of a robbery, he kills the clerk; the thief is subsequently killed in a shootout with police. As Cordell stalks the streets, his enemies Officers Jack Forrest and Theresa Mallory are put back on duty by Deputy Commissioner Edward Doyle, who has the two undergo a psychiatric evaluation under Officer Susan Riley. While Jack is content that Cordell is dead, Theresa is convinced that Cordell is still alive and plotting his revenge.\nAt a newsstand, Jack is fatally stabbed by Cordell. In order to protect the memory of Commissioner Pike, the corrupt official who originally framed Cordell, the police refuse to inform the public of the nature of recent events. This, along with her belief that Cordell is alive and killing, prompts Theresa to appear on a talk show to inform the public about Cordell. A traffic cop is murdered by Cordell later while attempting to tow a man's car. The man who was having his car towed is arrested on suspicion of the cop's murder. While en route to a hotel in a taxi, Theresa is joined by Susan, and the two are attacked by Cordell, who kills the cabbie and forces Susan and Theresa off the road. After handcuffing Susan to the steering wheel of a car and sending her into the busy streets, Cordell kills Theresa by snapping her neck. Gaining control of the car, Susan crashes and is found by authorities.\nElsewhere, a stripper named Cheryl is attacked in her apartment by Steven Turkell, who has strangled at least six other exotic dancers. Cordell arrives, murders two officers whom Cheryl called for, and helps Turkell escape. Turkell befriends Cordell and takes him back to his apartment, where Cordell stays for a short while. After Cordell leaves, Turkell visits a strip club, where he is identified by Cheryl to Susan and Detective Lieutenant Sean McKinney. He is arrested and placed in a holding cell.\nCordell breaks into the police station, murders nineteen police officers, and frees Turkell and several unnamed convicts. Using Susan as a hostage, Turkell, Cordell, and another criminal named Joseph Blum hijack a prison bus and head to Sing Sing, where Turkell believes Cordell wants to free all inmates and create an army of criminals. McKinney and Doyle follow, and McKinney convinces Doyle to reopen Cordell's case and rebury his casket with full honors on the assumption that this will appease Cordell.\nCordell gains entry into the prison using Blum's paperwork, and kills a guard for his keys. Shortly after entering death row, Cordell is contacted over the prison PA system by Doyle, who admits to Cordell that he was set up and states that his case has been reopened. After hearing Doyle's announcement, Cordell abandons Turkell, Blum, and Susan and heads deeper into the prison, where he is attacked with a Molotov cocktail by the three inmates who originally mutilated and killed him. While on fire, Cordell kills the three convicts who mutilated him, only to be attacked by Turkell. As Cordell and Turkell fight, the two crash through a wall, fall onto the bus below, and seemingly die when the vehicle explodes.\nSome time later, Cordell is buried with full honors alongside 19 other deceased officers he murdered; Susan and McKinney attend his funeral. As Cordell's casket is lowered, McKinney throws Cordell's badge into the grave, leaves with Susan, and monologues about how justice and pressure are the only differences between a cop and a \"Maniac Cop\". Then the camera slowly and eerily zooms in on Cordell's gravesite. After a few seconds, Cordell's hand unexpectedly bursts through the lid of his casket (in a jump scare) and quickly grabs his badge as the screen cuts to black and the credits roll."

The production remains upbeat and steady the entire time, thanks to work from Max Martin, Oscar Holter, DaHeala, and The Weeknd himself, combining the best of his old content and some newer, more mainstream-driven sounds\". Craig Jenkins of Vulture raved, \"The Weeknd perfects the kitschy '80s genre experiment with 'Save Your Tears', a gutting breakup tune gorgeous and simple enough to stand alongside peak '80s pop like the Cars' 'You Might Think' (and slick enough to swipe a bit of melody from Wham!'s 'Everything She Wants' in the chorus). The piece concocts sound informed by both trap and dance music, encased in dense atmospherics, and heavy on crisp, bright keys\". \"'Save Your Tears' has both tonal echoes of Depeche Mode's melancholy and a nod to 'Everything She Wants' by Wham!, exhibiting shimmery mid-80s luxuriance\", praised The New York Times editor Jon Caramanica.Slant columnist Seth Wilson observed, \"'Save Your Tears' revels in spite, flaunting how over-it Tesfaye is in front of his ex while teasing the possibility of reconciliation. Tesfaye's distinct brand of R&B consistently draws from other genres, but hearing him embrace a straight-up synth-rock sound here is an exciting change of pace\". \"He draws on synth-pop nostalgia to mirror the tragic glitz of '80s Hollywood: the plinking synths and slick hand-claps of 'Save Your Tears' evokes a long-lost Wham! track. His bleeding-heart melodies and unforgettable hooks remind us why we keep listening to the '80s first place\", exclaimed Pitchfork writer Isabella Herrera. Jem Aswad of Variety commented, \"'Save Your Tears', which could have been an MTV staple in the early '80s, is begging for period-appropriate videos. The record has thwacking electronic percussion and the vocoder hearkening back to Electric Light Orchestra's 'Mr. Blue Sky'\".Mark Richardson from The Wall Street Journal asserted that \"'Save Your Tears' includes soaring melodies that provide ample opportunity for Mr. Tesfaye to show off his vocal range, being used on television singing competitions. By design, it is big and broad, less specific lyrically and further from the shadowy persona at the heart of the Weeknd\u2014Mr. Tesfaye often seems downright affable here. Mr. Martin and the Weeknd show the influence of 1980s synth pop. The piece sounds like something from a John Hughes soundtrack\". Michael Cragg from Vogue UK praised the record as \"the sort of synth experimentation last heard in 1984 on The NeverEnding Story soundtrack\". GQ's Zak Maoui applauded \"Save Your Tears\" as one of the Weeknd's \"best musical offerings to date\". Apple Music applauded the composition, \"Few things about 'Save Your Tears' mark it as a breakup song: For one, the production is drenched in bright, '80s-style synths that sound more glamorous than forlorn. Yet the Weeknd manages to imbue the single with a sense of heartbroken remorse, a rare emotion in his arsenal. Many came to love him through his more shadowy offerings, but there's no denying the power he brings to the nostalgic, splashy pop style he exhibits here\". IFPI Chief Executive, Frances Moore has stated, \"It has been another brilliant year for 'The Weeknd' and 'Save Your Tears' has unquestionably been one of the world's most loved songs.\""

No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there.

        "content": "Lucy in London came about as part of Lucille Ball's 1966-1967 contract renewal with CBS. At the time, she was producing and starring in The Lucy Show for the network. The agreement gave her the option to star in three specials that would be produced independent of her weekly program.  Ball originally planned a production where she would co-star with Mitzi Gaynor as two nuns touring Europe, followed by a French-based production called Lucy in Paris and a Middle Eastern comedy called Lucy in Arabia.  None of those projects gained footing, and instead Ball, through her company Desilu Productions and ITV franchisee ABC Weekend TV, opted to shoot Lucy in London. Impressed by his work, Ball hired Steve Binder to direct the special.\nThe concept for Lucy in London was set up in an episode of The Lucy Show called \"Lucy Flies to London\". Much of that episode, which involved Lucy\u2019s unfamiliarity with air travel, was based on an unsold pilot written and shot in 1960.However Lucy In London was not explicit in its connection to The Lucy Show.  This would accommodate viewers who may not have seen The Lucy Show prior to the standalone special. \nLaurence Olivier was signed to appear in Lucy in London, but withdrew from the production prior to shooting.Ball went through 15 different wigs during the production.  Cleo Smith, Ball's cousin and the executive in charge of this production, later recalled that problems arose in photographing the star on the London locations, where the use of heavy stage make-up and filtered lighting that was employed for her studio-based program could not be repeated.  Ball's biographer Geoffrey Mark Fidelman would later remark that the actress \"looked old\" throughout the show due to difficulties in establishing flattering lighting for the outdoor sequences.Lucy in London was broadcast on October 24, 1966, replacing both The Lucy Show and The Andy Griffith Show for that evening. Viewership was high for the special (finishing as the most-watched telecast of the week) but critical responses were very poor, with Variety complaining: \"What had promised to be one of the season's major specials turned out to be a major disappointment.\"  Ball opted not to pursue the creation of the remaining two specials in her contract and severed ties with director Steve Binder.  (Ball did co-star in one other special earlier in 1966, Carol + 2, which starred Carol Burnett, had a much better reception and would be re-aired in 1967 to fill one of the spots of the two unproduced specials.)\nAdditionally, Ball had starred in a special in 1965, The Lucille Ball Comedy Hour with Bob Hope (that is not to be confused with her similarly-titled series of television specials with the cast of her prior show), although that special was not part of the contract that gave way to this production.\nLucy in London is included on the DVD release of The Lucy Show - The Official 5th Season."

Her father, Nurullah, is a former school teacher who became a hawker after losing his left leg in the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. One day, during supper, he is unjustly arrested after a volatile young Taliban thug, Idrees, thinks he insulted him earlier while the two were selling goods in the market. Because the Taliban forbids women from going out without a male relative, Parvana's family is left without the means to support themselves, as her elder brother Sulayman died years ago, leaving her, her mother Fattema, her elder sister Soraya, and her youngest infant brother Zaki. When Parvana and her mother try to go to the prison to appeal Nurullah's arrest, a thug beats Fattema and threatens to arrest them if they go outside again. Parvana comforts Zaki by telling the story of a boy on a quest to retrieve his village's seeds from the evil Elephant King.\nLater, Parvana tries to buy food for her family, but the hawkers cannot sell her any due to fear of the Taliban. To support her family, she decides to cut her hair and dress as a boy, \"Aatish\", claiming to be Nurullah's nephew. The plot works, and Parvana is able to get both food and money. On the advice of Shauzia, another young girl disguised as a boy, Parvana tries to bribe a prison guard so she can see her father. However, the guard sends her away. She works to save up more money for a larger bribe, taking on hard labor jobs with Shauzia, who is trying to save enough money to escape her abusive father. Meanwhile, Fattema is forced to write to a relative in Mazar, arranging marriage for Soraya in exchange for shelter and protection. Parvana also meets Razaq, the former patrol partner of Idrees; the illiterate Razaq pays her to read him a letter informing him that his wife was killed by a land mine. He befriends her and continues to meet with her so that she can teach him how to read and write.\nParvana and Shauzia take a hard labor job where Idrees was also present. He recognises her, and, after being hit abruptly by Parvana with a brick, tries to kill her as she flees with Shauzia. Parvana and Shauzia manage to hide, and Idrees is abruptly called away to fight in the United States invasion of Afghanistan, never to be seen again. When Parvana returns home, Fattema pleads with her to stop the dangerous plot, telling her that her relatives accepted Soraya and that they will be collected the day after next. Parvana agrees on the condition that she gets to visit Nurullah in prison to tell him where they are going, as Razaq has a cousin who works there that will let her in. She tearfully bids farewell to Shauzia, promising that they will meet 20 years from then. However, as Parvana travels to the prison, Fattema's cousin arrives early and forces them to come with him without Parvana, as the war is starting and the roads will soon be blocked. Fattema eventually stands up to her cousin in a furious manner, refusing to let him take them further, and he leaves the family stranded on the road.\nParvana arrives at the prison, where she finds Razaq. After Parvana reveals that she is Nurullah's daughter, Razaq informs her that his cousin has left to fight, but he will retrieve Nurullah. As the prison is being cleared out of weak prisoners who are unable to fight, Parvana witnesses their execution. Terrified, she gathers her courage to stay by finishing the tale of the boy, who she turns into Sulayman, revealing that he died after picking up a \"toy\" on the street, which was actually a land mine that exploded. Razaq is shot on the shoulder while rescuing the weak Nurullah, but the wound was not fatal and he reunites the father and daughter. Parvana takes her father away, where they will soon reunite with the rest of the family and escape from Afghanistan together, as the two continue the story they were telling each other at the start of the film."

The Breadwinner was a co-production between Aircraft Pictures in Canada, Melusine Productions in Luxembourg, and Cartoon Saloon in Ireland.\nThe Breadwinner was executive produced by Angelina Jolie who worked with director Nora Twomey to bring the novel to the screen. Twomey is an Irish animator, director, screenwriter, producer and voice actress. She is also a founding partner in Cartoon Saloon, an Irish animation studio based in Kilkenny that did the key animation for The Breadwinner. Twomey commented on the serious theme in her animation film, saying \"I think that animation is very broad... so I don't see why it needs to be thought of as just a babysitting device... I wanted to go for the same audience that Deborah had gone for \u2014 young adults and adults as well. The film doesn't really talk down to anyone.\"In a 2018 interview with Twomey, she revealed that Angelina Jolie was involved in the casting of the voice actors, in particular the Canadian talent Saara Chaudry who voices Parvana, as Twomey recalls \"She [Chaudry] has such empathy, intellect and emotional depth, a unique talent for an 11 year old actor.\" Choudry's personality also played a role in shaping Parvana's mannerisms, as Twomey explains in another interview, \u201cSeeing what Saara was able to comprehend as an actor, as an artist, and as a child gave me an understanding of how to craft our film [in a way] that doesn't take for granted what children are afraid of or not afraid of.\u201dTwomey also explained that Jolie's insight as UN Goodwill ambassador at Afghan girls' schools was helpful in making the film, as she reportedly offered advice on the intricacies of Afghan behavior codes and the cultural atmosphere of Afghanistan. Mimi Polk Gitlin, producer of the feminist classic Thelma and Louise, was also involved as an executive producer.Twomey also explained that she was careful to cast voice actors of Afghan heritage and to work with an Afghan dialect coach. She says, \u201cthere was so much input from people there at the time, to make sure it was not judgemental but also empathetic\u201d. The Kabul-born dialect coach, Kawa Abu, also voices the character of Razaq. According to Twomey, the story-within-a-story about the mythical Elephant king was inspired by Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth.  The texture and depth of the vivid fairy-tale fable and distinctive cut-out look was created using Nuke compositing software, from the Toronto-based Guru Studio.During the development of the screenplay, screenwriter Anita Doron worked together with the American-Afghan artist Aman Mojadidi, to balance an Afghan perspective with a global perspective to capture the universal tone of the film. The first draft of the screenplay also saw contributions from the Afghan Women's Organization, as various Afghan refugees from different regions and tribes offered their perspectives and deepened the film's understanding of the Afghan culture.School children along with their parents were invited for an early screening of the film, as Twomey noted that parents became emotional and teary whereas children, taking note from Parvana, were cheerful and chatty."

A jealous Donald Duck starts heckling Mickey's act. Mickey creates red soap bubbles out of his hands, but Donald pops one of them with a slingshot. When he pops the other, it turns into a lobster which attacks him. Donald throws the lobster at Mickey, but he catches it and turns it into a bubble which he then pops. \nAs Mickey does tricks with playing cards, Donald blows them away with a pair of bellows. However, Mickey turns them into birds and puts them into a birdcage. Mickey fans out cards in his hand, then makes them disappear and points his wand at Donald. This causes Donald to ramble furiously, with cards flying out of his beak (this becomes a recurring gag in the cartoon). \nAfter further misadventures, Donald rushes to Mickey on the stage. He takes Mickey's wand and points it at Mickey, but nothing happens. He furiously shakes the wand and hits it against the floor and then his hand, where it creates an ice cream cone, which spurts ice cream in his face. \nDonald then jumps after Mickey, but Mickey catches Donald in his hands and folds him out like a fan and joined paper dolls. He then puts Donald into a pistol and fires him at the table, where he is put into an egg. Mickey throws the egg in his hat, then pours the yolk out which turns into Donald. \nDonald then takes Mickey's wand, breaks it in two, and throws it on the floor, but it turns into a cactus-like plant with multiple boxing gloves. It punches Donald off the stage and turns into a hand pointing to a black X mark where Donald stood previously. Donald hits a case containing an axe. He dodges it and several falling objects, and is then hit by a string of light bulbs when he picks up the axe. \nAfter another angry ramble, Donald runs toward Mickey on the stage, but Mickey uses a hoop to turn Donald into a kangaroo and then a walrus. Donald dives into the hoop and emerges from it wearing a swimsuit. He makes a fighting gesture, but the hoop turns him into a chimpanzee. Donald runs up to Mickey and shoots fireworks from Mickey's gun, which lifts Mickey up into the top of the stage and causes Goofy to get tangled up. A final firework rocket causes the stage to collapse in on the three. Mickey and Goofy pop up, unharmed, but Donald is burned from the fireworks and does one more angry ramble, with cards flooding the screen."

With the title's track being displayed on a paper during the end of the clip, it additionally made an appearance in the music video for \"Judas\" (2011). Subsequently, Gaga revealed on Twitter that the song was written in Australia and finished on her tour bus in Europe. Describing the recording's lyrical themes as delving on \"needing to feel safe to find love\", it was theorized by a writer from Take 40 Australia to be inspired by the singer's 2009 live performance on Australia's The Chapel arena. Like the opening track of Born This Way\u2014\"Marry the Night\"\u2014the song made its debut on a special edition of social network game FarmVille, called GagaVille and released on May 18, 2011.\n\"Electric Chapel\" has been compared to the work of Madonna, with NME's Dan Martin saying that \"if you'd ever wondered what that Madonna doing the soundtrack to Blade Runner might have sounded like... then wonder no more.\" Genre-wise, Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone referred \"Electric Chapel\" to as an electro rock recording, while Robbie Daw of Idolator dubbed the song as being of the pop metal genre, attesting that unlike fellow song from Born This Way, \"Heavy Metal Lover\", \"Electric Chapel\" possesses an actual metal-edge. Gaga recorded the chorus a number of times, channeling the vocals of bands like Duran Duran, and singers Cher and Billy Idol. Inspired by 1980s music, the track incorporates a spoken word section, which Gaga wanted to sound like The B-52's song \"Rock Lobster\" (1978). She explained to Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone that when she \"say[s] 'electric chapel,' something needs to occur... It needs to be more fantasy. You should see the empress of the Vatican unicorn planet appear and soar across the nightclub.\"Writing for music website Beats Per Minute, Brent Koepp described the song as \"Iron Maiden meets 80s pop\". According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, \"Electric Chapel\" has a time signature of common time, and a pop-rock tempo of 128 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of A minor with Gaga's vocals ranging from E3 to C5. It also has a basic sequence of Am\u2013Dm\u2013Am\u2013Dm\u2013F serving as its chord progression. \"Electric Chapel\" was later remixed by Irish indie rock band Two Door Cinema Club; this version was included on the singer's second remix album titled Born This Way: The Remix (2011). Gaga unveiled the remix during a cover shoot for Elle magazine. A reviewer from BBC Music complimented the remix, saying that \"Two Door Cinema Club almost make 'Electric Chapel' sound like a collaboration between Gaga and Hot Chip\"."

Vocally, he found Gaga was channeling Lita Ford and dubbed the track as one of the album's strongest compositions. Caryn Ganz of Spin wrote that \"Electric Chapel\" \"pairs divine diva thump with a Van Halen guitar solo.\" NME writer Dan Martin published a review on the song, confessing that \"perhaps ['Electric Chapel'] nails the record's blood-and-chrome aesthetics most effectively of all.\" In another review, Martin compared its opening riffs to Opus III's 1983 song \"It's a Fine Day\", with him further likening the recording to science fiction music. Kerri Mason from Billboard described the track as a \"technicolor wedding\" with a \"fat guitar riff\". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse praised the cut, feeling that \"Gaga takes Born This Way to new levels of pop-dom on cuts like the jagged 'Electric Chapel' and 'Heavy Metal Lover'\".Ann Powers from NPR noticed the influence of Duran Duran in the track, while believing Gaga to imagine \"Electric Chapel\" as an output from \"an electric guitar-wielding girl group\". Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone did reviewed Born This Way track-wise, observing that in \"Electric Chapel\" Gaga wrote about hoping for a monogamous relationship, with heavy guitar riffs and metal solo being characteristics of the record. In an article in GQ about 10 detrimental things on Born This Way, a writer from the magazine listed the track's lyrics as \"reek[ing] of a lack of ideas, not a distortion of form. Sing words. It's easy\".\"Electric Chapel\" debuted and peaked at number 23 on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Digital Songs chart on the issue dated June 11, 2011, spending one week on the chart.

It released on March 19, 2002, as the second international single from the album, while in North America it was released as the lead single, by Warner Bros.

The accompanying music video for \"Song for the Lonely\" was recorded in New York City under the direction of Stu Maschwitz, and depicts Cher walking through the streets of the city since the 18th century until the modern days, while she is joined by several people from those times. To promote the song, Cher performed it on the American Music Awards of 2002, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and later included it on the setlists of her Living Proof: The Farewell Tour (2002\u201305) and her concert residency Cher (2008\u201311)."

        "content": "Cher recorded \"Song for the Lonely\" in the summer of 2001 in London and intended to include it on her twenty-fourth studio album Living Proof (2001), and it immediately became her favorite song from the album. However, after the September 11 attacks, she began thinking of it in a different way. In an interview with Larry King Live she said that after the attacks, she was listening to the album and when the track began, all of a sudden it took on a completely different meaning for her, especially because of the \"when heroes fall in love and war, they live forever\" lyric. Cher commented that \"Song for the Lonely\" was one of the best tracks she has ever had the opportunity to sing, because according to her, \"we still lived in a world of innocence\" before the attacks. According to the album liner notes, \"Song for the Lonely\" is \"dedicated to the courageous people of New York especially the fire fighters, the police, Mayor Giuliani, Governor Pataki and my friend Liz\".Since its release, the public's reaction to \"Song for the Lonely\" had been positive. James Lonten, manager of a Borders Books & Music store in New York City, which had been stocking Living Proof since its European release, commented, \"That goes without saying. We play the track in-store, and it literally stops people dead in their tracks. It's an instantly affecting, highly emotional song\". John Boulos, senior vice-president of promotion at Warner Bros. Records, commented that they were not exploiting the September 11 attacks as a selling point to the single, but it had drawn the interest of people. \"We simply feel that we have an incredible song by a truly legendary artist. That's a pretty potent combination to take it to the street\", he said. \"Song for the Lonely\" served as the lead American single from Living Proof, being released on March 19, 2002. In the European and international editions of Living Proof, it is listed as \"(This Is) A Song for the Lonely\"."

The music commentator also noted that the lack of vocoder, which had become a signature on Cher's songs, allowed Cher to \"foster a grin\" with opening notes, until the song reaches the chorus \u2013 which Taylor said it was one of the cathiest since Hanson's \"MMMBop\" (1997) \u2013 and \"explodes into a rhythmic tantrum\". When Cher recorded the track, she thought of it as a love song, but after the September 11 attacks, the singer felt the song was right for the occasion. \"Since the world has changed so dramatically, the lyrics have a different weight. They're heavier, yet they're comforting at the same time. Over the past month or so, I've had a number of people tell me that the song has helped them cope.

A first-time director and an architecture enthusiast, Maschwitz sent Warner Bros. Records an idea for the video, featuring a Cher-guided tour through New York City's history, exemplified by a multiple reverse-timelapses of some of the great buildings of the city rising up before the viewer's eyes. After receiving news that he got the job following the singer's personal liking for the project, they would start filming the following weeks. The crew received special permission from Mayor Rudy Giuliani's office for live audio playback in the streets of Manhattan, a practice that had recently been outlawed.Cher had done her own makeup, as her makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin was nowhere to be found due to his struggling with a terminal illness. At one point of the shooting, they needed to cover some parts of the streets with big, loud smoke machines. As the attacks were still a fresh and painful memory for the citizens, complaints about the smoke started coming in. The police officer manning the intersection gave word that they would have to shut down their atmospheric effects, but they still had one more shot. The director solved this by taking Cher and the script supervisor's camera, and autographing a polaroid to the cop, to continue the last smoked-up shooting.The video starts in sepia tone, featuring Cher walking around the streets of New York City. While the setting for the start of the video is in the 18th century, the singer is dressed in modern-day clothes. The video progresses to black and white, and then to color, as the times for the setting of the video change to the 19th century through various eras to the 20th century. As the timeline changes, buildings around New York are shown being constructed. The video is intercept with shots of Cher dressed in white, which is overlaid in some shots, as well as shots of New York City from the air. People from each stage of the development of the city join Cher as she walks the streets until at the end, there is a large crowd of people from all eras. In 2002, the video was released on VHS to serve as promotion in the United States. An alternative version for the video for \"Song for the Lonely\" was included on the DVD The Very Best of Cher: The Video Hits Collection (2004)."

The producer, Jeremy Thomas, later remembered his experience making the film,\n\nBecause I had a great director, and a quality piece of literature, I managed to get a wonderful cast such as John Hurt and Alan Bates. Skolimowski had a sense of shooting style then, this was the second director who I had worked closely with, and it was fascinating watching Skolimowski work. He came from a Polish tradition, the Wajda Film School, he had a different background to other directors I had been working with in the cutting rooms or elsewhere. And it made the film much more creative to me. I saw it more as an artistic endeavour by him.\nThe film went to Cannes and won the Grand Prix de Jury. We were incredibly lucky and the film was appreciated by the jury. It was a very small festival then, nothing like the Cannes Film Festival of today, it was a small event in a cinema of 800 people or so.\nThe soundtrack is by Michael Rutherford and Tony Banks of the rock band Genesis.

It was the name of a song which didn't make it onto the record which is about someone called Sandy ... I like titles like those, they're just a law unto themselves and they have a feeling unto themselves.\n\n'Born Sandy Devotional' is the culmination of our efforts trying to capture our more considered lyrical approach with a physical intensity ... well not really, but that will have to do.

They've evidently taken their time, but unleash their true masterpiece when their nearest rivals clog their own arteries with pomp and frigid pretentiousness.\"Adam Sweeting of Melody Maker said that \"At last somebody's released Born Sandy Devotional, which was finished nearly a year ago but has been bouncing around between dithering record companies ever since. God knows why because it's a classic, 10 songs of love and life in a hostile sub-tropical landscape. David McComb wrote the lot and it's a substantial achievement. His lyrics display real writer's insight, and mould imperceptibly to his unhurried melodies....In The Seabirds, he explores a drowning love affair in a song so vivid it resembles a short story with pictures.\""

The band went on hiatus following the release of Cardiology (2010), with the members shifting focus to their families. During this downtime, Benji and Joel Madden did production work; after working with All Time Low and 5 Seconds of Summer, the brothers, and subsequently the rest of the band, wanted to make a new album. The writing and recording process consisted of the brothers creating a song, showing it to the other members, practice and record it. Working with collaborator John Feldmann, who produced the album, sessions concluded mid-2015. After announcing the end of their hiatus in early November 2015, \"Makeshift Love\" was released as a single.\nIn early 2016, the band supported All Time Low on the UK arena tour, leading into the single release of \"40 oz. Dream\" in May. Preceded by the single release of \"Life Can't Get Much Better\" in June, Youth Authority was released in July through the Madden brothers' own label MDDN. It was promoted with performances on Warped Tour for the remainder of the month, and a handful of UK shows surrounding the band's appearance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. A music video for \"Life Changes\" followed in September, as did a headlining US tour in October and November. A second headlining US tour followed in May 2017; alongside two festival appearances, a music video was released for \"Keep Swingin'\" in June. A few months later, a music video was released for \"War\"; the band closed the year with a headlining UK tour in November and December.\nYouth Authority received a generally favorable reception, with the album's pop punk sound dividing critics. It charted at number 23 on the US Billboard 200, and peaked within the top 20 on five additional Billboard charts. \"Makeshift Love\" and \"Life Can't Get Much Better\" charted within the top 20 on various Billboard sales charts, with \"Life Changes\" charting just outside this frame. The album reached number one in Australia, where \"Makeshift Love\" and \"Life Can't Get Much Better\" peaked outside of the top 100 and top 50, respectively. Outside of these territories, the record charted within the top 20 in Switzerland, the UK, Austria, New Zealand, Germany and Canada."

Vocalist Joel Madden said they took their website offline, sold off all of their merchandise because they wanted to \"go out with a clean slate.\" Benji and Joel Madden hosted The Voice in Australia, before forming The Madden Brothers project. They used this project to move away from Good Charlotte's pop punk sound to explore pop music. After releasing a mixtape, they began working on an album in 2012, which was eventually released as Greetings from California in 2014.The brothers did production and song writing work for 5 Seconds of Summer, All Time Low, Three 6 Mafia, among others.

Discussing the album title, Madden said Youth Authority was the concept that \"there\u2019s a kid out there right now who has a guitar, or a microphone, or a laptop, with a dream that is going to beat the odds.\" He said the album felt like the \"GC of the past\" with \"a new energy to it.\" He mentioned \"Life Changes\" as encapsulating \"the GC spirit\", while having an arena rock chorus in the vein of Bon Jovi. \"Makeshift Love\" incorporates the sound of an iPhone, and is about being misunderstood by your significant other. \"40 oz. Dream\" bears resemblance to Bowling for Soup's version of \"1985\", and is a satirical view of the music industry.\"Keep Swingin'\" was written while the Madden brothers were working with Quinn, starting off as a riff and quickly evolved into a complete song within a day. Joel Madden listened back to it the following week and was highly impressed by it, subsequently asking Quinn if they could include it on Youth Authority. The Madden brothers were in Los Angeles and hung out with Neil, who was there to write songs. Neil suggested the three of them write together, resulting in \"Reason to Stay\", in which he sings the first verse. The pop rock ballad features vocal effects akin to those used by Imogen Heap. Benji Madden was hesitant to include \"The Outfield\" on the album as it featured lyrics about his and brother's upbringing. \"War\", the heaviest track the group has written, recalls the mood of The Chronicles of Life and Death (2004). An earlier version of the track appeared on the iTunes deluxe edition of Greatest Remixes (2008). \"Moving On\" channels the electro-dance vibe of Good Morning Revival (2007)"

She is released on probation but warned that if she breaks parole she will be immediately sent back to prison, as well as be forced to pay the remainder of her fortune, some eight million pounds, to all the dog shelters in Westminster. Cruella, therefore, mends her working relationship with her much-abused valet Alonzo and buys the Second Chance Dog shelter, owned by Kevin Shepherd, to save it from insolvency. Cruella's probation officer, Chloe Simon, is the owner of Dipstick (one of the original 101 Dalmatians Cruella had stolen); she suspects Cruella will strike again despite her growing popularity as an animal person.\nDipstick's mate, Dottie, gives birth to three puppies: Domino, Little Dipper, and Oddball, who appears to be an albino, and begins to feel self-conscious about her lack of spots as she grows up. Meanwhile, Dr. Pavlov discovers that when his therapy patients are subjected to loud noises, they revert to their former personalities, but he conceals these findings from the public. Inevitably, when Big Ben rings in her presence, Cruella reverts to her former personality. After recognizing Dipstick and remembering her failed attempt of making a dalmatian fur coat, she enlists the help of French furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt. Together, they design a new fur coat, with the intention of using Dipstick's children for a hood as a part of Cruella's revenge. \nChloe and Kevin go out on a date while Dipsticks and other dogs watch Lady and the Tramp, where Kevin tells Chloe that, if Cruella violates her parole, her entire fortune will go to him, since his dog shelter is the only one currently operating in Westminster. Knowing this, Cruella has Kevin framed for the theft of the first 99 dalmatian puppies LePelt takes, also exploiting the fact that Kevin has a prior record of dog-napping. She invites Chloe and Dipstick to her house for a dinner party to decoy them away while LePelt steals Dottie and her three puppies. Dipstick quickly returns to the apartment but is later captured. Chloe rushes home to save her pets but arrives too late. She is joined by Kevin, who has escaped from prison with the help of his talking macaw, Waddlesworth. Kevin explains that his earlier conviction was for breaking animals out of a lab, where they were being used for experiments.\nUpon finding LePelt's lost ticket for the Venice-Simplon Orient Express to Paris, Kevin and Chloe attempt but fail to stop Cruella and LePelt before their train departs. Oddball, who managed to escape, secretly follows them to LePelt's factory in Paris. Kevin and Chloe get there as well but they are discovered by Cruella, who locks them in a cellar. Despite this, they free the puppies through a hole in the ceiling. Cruella goes after the puppies alone, while Alonzo, having been mistreated beyond his patience, defeats LePelt and frees Kevin and Chloe. They pursue Cruella to a bakery and find that the puppies, led by Oddball, have tricked Cruella into being baked in an enormous cake. Cruella survives, then she and LePelt are both arrested.\nChloe and Kevin, exonerated from the theft accusation, return to London and are personally awarded the remnants of Cruella's fortune by Alonzo himself. Oddball's coat finally develops a few small spots, much to everyone's surprise."

The film was set to be released on June 30, 2000, but was pushed back to November 22. The film's teaser was released on the same month the film came out in 1999, and shows stock footage from The Shawshank Redemption. Oxford Prison was used for the scene as Cruella walked out of prison. The teaser appeared in theaters before Toy Story 2 and Stuart Little as well as the home video release of Music of the Heart. 102 Dalmatians was filmed partially in Paris. On November 7, Disney released the soundtrack to the movie, including pre-eminently, a cover of Paul Anka's \"Puppy Love\" (sung by Myra) and original songs:  Mike Himelstein's \"What Can a Bird Do?\" (voiced by Jeff Bennett), \"My Spot in the World\" (sung by Lauren Christy) and \"Cruella De Vil 2000\" (better known as \"Cruella De Vil (102 Dalmatians)\", sung by Camara Kambon and Mark Campbell of Jack Mack and the Heart Attack, a derivation of \"Cruella de Vil\").\nThe film is dedicated in memory of cameraman Mike Roberts, who died before it was released."

On May 27, 2012, Smith said in response to a tweet that, at some point in the next six months, the band would be releasing 10 unreleased songs on 7-inch and as digital downloads. Flea followed up Smith's announcement a few days later on May 29, 2012, by stating that 18 unreleased songs from the I'm with You sessions would be released over the next six months. He also confirmed that the band has been writing new music while touring.Josh Klinghoffer commented on the unreleased songs by saying \"Finding songs that seem to want to join hands with others is a special task that require the right people...and the right songs! Some songs seem to have a lot more of an agenda than others. Some songs play well with others and some songs need more attention and a little extra care. Here are some songs that seemed to want to pair up and take a later train. Keep your eye on them, they're up to something...\"\nSmith said in July 2012 of the unreleased songs that \"We just wanted them to come out because we just really like them. We didn't want them to get lost, so we're gonna put them out, mainly for our fans. They would've waited for the Warner Bros. box set in, like, 2020, if there's even a record company around then. I'm glad they're going to see the light of day because it's an important part of the band and what we were doing at the time.\" On the sound of the songs, Smith says he finds it \"hard to explain\" what the first two songs to be released sound like but describes \"Long Progression\" as \"kind of a flowing, kind of midtempo funk\". He also stated the band is currently working on new music. \"Those are just waiting,\" Smith said. \"We'll go back to those when we start writing again, I'm sure \u2013 or not. We're just always trying to come up with new stuff; usually the latest and greatest is what we use, but you never know.\""

I\u2019m sure everyone in the band can tell you the same.\u201d\nIn an interview, Klinghoffer said the band spent time in 2012 and 2013 doing post-session work for some of the B-sides.Klinghoffer also said they recorded 48 songs during the album's sessions and some could eventually see the light of day. \u201cIt's possible,\u201d Klinghoffer said. \u201cWe just had so much material back then that certain things just straight-up didn\u2019t get enough attention.

The song begins with a diary entry written by Furtado to introduce the song, featuring harp, bagpipes, sounds of waves and sea gulls. In the chorus she sings: \"Day and night / Day and night / You blow my mind / Blow my mind.\" The songs ends with her father, Antonio Jose Furtado, saying, \"Oh, man, that's so rock'n'roll\". According to Furtado, it was inspired by a diary she kept as a smitten sixteen-year-old on a summer vacation in S\u00e3o Miguel Island, Portugal, her parents' birthplace.Furtado commented about working with \"Darkchild\" on the album, stating:\n\nRodney \"Darkchild\" did eight tracks on my album and we hit it off really big, like it was a real epic moment meeting him, for me. And we were like kids just hanging out in the playground, you know?

The song was produced by West, Francis and the Lights, and Benny Blanco, with additional production from Mike Dean, Andy C and Aaron Lammer. The production is driven by repetitive a cappella intonations, which play in the background. The lyrical content of the song centers around West's thoughts of suicide and homicide, delivered in both rapping and spoken word. West imparted that he has had suicidal thoughts in an interview with The New York Times.\n\"I Thought About Killing You\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, with some directing praise towards its lyrical content and the beat switch, though other critics expressed negative feelings of such content. The original version of the song contained an unlicensed sample of \"Fr3sh\" by Kareem Lofty. The sample was removed in November 2018 after legal action was threatened by Lofty's record label, PAN. Though not released as a single, the song peaked at number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100, while it reached top 40 positions on the Canadian Hot 100 and Irish Singles Chart."

In addition to \"I Thought About Killing You\", Francis and the Lights helped produce Ye tracks \"All Mine\" and \"Ghost Town\". The project produced the song with West and Benny Blanco, while additional production was handled by Mike Dean, Andy C and Aaron Lammer. British grime rapper Wiley commented on West's TMZ interview in which he suggested slavery was a choice via Twitter on May 3, 2018, claiming in one of his tweets that \"Slavery was not a choice it was forced upon us. We were born into it.\" Despite tweeting out against his remarks, Wiley described West as \"very smart.\" The contributions of Wiley and fellow British rapper Skepta weren't revealed until the credits of Ye were updated on June 14, 2018 to show them as co-writers on \"I Thought About Killing You\". It stands along with \"Yikes\" as one of only two tracks on the album where the vocals are solely by West.West explained that he has had contemplations of suicide during an interview with The New York Times on June 25, 2018; the album was recorded that same year. When asked to what degree song's title was literal and metaphoric, West replied, \"Oh yeah, I've thought about killing myself all the time. It's always an option and [expletive]. Like Louis C.K. said, I flip through the manual. I weigh all the options. I'm just having this epiphany now because I didn't do it, but I did think it all the way through. But if I didn't think it all the way through, then it's actually maybe more of a chance of it happening.\" On June 14, 2018, West posted a tweet that indicated his thoughts linked to the song were about killing his ego, and West revealed that without his ego he is \"Just Ye,\" giving potential context into why West titled his album as such. West's wife Kim Kardashian posted a photo to her Instagram with the caption \"I thought about killing you\" on August 15, though did not directly reference him.The original version of the song contains an uncredited sample from \"Fr3sh\", as performed by Kareem Lotfy. Bill Kouligas, head of Lotfy's label PAN, criticized West for the unlicensed sample and indicated intent to pursue legal action, saying \"It's sadly another case of an artist who capitalizes on culture without any original ideas\" and calling West \"the ultimate narcissist.\" Francis and the Lights, who produced the track with West, took responsibility for the sampling and apologized, saying that he would be \"reaching out\" to rectify the issue and that the sample was added \"at the last minute.\" On November 7, 2018, an alternative version of the album on streaming services revealed the song with its sample removed and the beat revised.On the night of the album's premiere, West said that specific lyrics had been cut from it after his controversial interview with TMZ in which he made comments about slavery. On June 7, 2018, six days after the release of Ye, the clean version of \"I Thought About Killing You\" had the lyric \"Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave\" added at approximately three minutes and 30 seconds into the song in reference to those comments. The line has not been added to the explicit version of the song."

In a highly positive review, Christopher Hooton from The Independent analysed the song as something that \"has shades of the Kanye genius of yore, showing the instinctive command of melody of a musical aesthete who builds momentum in a song like no other\" and Hooton also praised the beat switch, noting it as being addictive. Douglas Greenwood of NME described the song's position on the album as being \"a bold opener lyrically\" and what is \"made even darker by the fact he seems to abandons the song's style two thirds of the way through,\" with Greenwood viewing it as becoming a totally new track after the style is abandoned by West. Reviewing Ye for Exclaim!, Kyle Mullin viewed the song's vocal effects employed by West \"that help him evoke the myriad voices that ring in a deranged mind\" as being one of the \"moments devoted to mental health\" that truly give the album a purpose. In response to West's performance, Zachary Hoskins from Slant Magazine wrote \"'Sometimes I think really bad things,' he confesses on the stark, harrowing opener 'I Thought About Killing You,' his voice dipping into an artificial chopped-and-screwed baritone. 'Really, really, really bad things.'\" Courtney E. Smith of Refinery29 viewed the song as \"a track punctuated by screams that deals with heavy themes of death and violence\" and described it as feeling \"eerie to listen to these dark thoughts next to that dark production from Mike Dean,\" looking at Dean's production as combining synths and dirty bass, while claiming that the gloom should be attributed \"to West (think of Bey's 'Partition' verses West's 'Monster,' which encapsulate the different directions in which an artist can push Dean's signature sound).\"Alexis Petridis was more mixed in The Guardian, claiming that despite there being \"something audacious about the way 'I Thought About Killing You' suddenly turns into a completely different track three-quarters of the way through, neither of its two contrasting parts are anything to write home about.\" The staff of XXL noted West's \"series of spoken word phrases\" within the track for being repetitive, while claiming that the phrases are succeeded by him \"launching into a completely unrelated rap that offers no real payoff\" and cited the track as an example of \"waiting for moments of enlightenment or engagement that ultimately never arrive\" on Ye. In reference to the lyrics \"Sometimes I think bad things... Really, really, really bad things,\" Andrew Barker of Variety criticized the album's \"emotional trajectory\" for being \"fairly obvious, beginning with West at his lowest\" and slammed the song as \"his pitch shifting ever downward to a woozy, demonic register.\" In Consequence of Sound, Wren Graves claimed that \"some of that Life of Pablo rambling starts to creep in\" when the first two minutes of the track \"feel repetitive after just a few listens.\" Ross Horton from The Line of Best Fit characterized the track as \"comically bad\" and being \"an interesting, sinister concept that is executed in so poorly that you begin to question where the record is going.\""

        "content": "Attention-craving Mysto the Magician rudely interrupts a world-famous opera singer, the great Poochini (a pun on opera composer Giacomo Puccini), in the midst of his rehearsal to let him perform an opening act at the show that night. Mysto's tricks primarily come from his magic wand, which can summon flowers and rabbits. After Mysto performs a poorly executed dance and asks him if he gets the job, an annoyed and the unimpressed Poochini emphatically says \"NO!\" as he kicks Mysto out the door into the alley.\nWhile on the ground, the self-pitying Mysto plays with his magic wand, but soon realizes he can pass it off as a conductor's baton; being further inspired by seeing himself in place of the conductor in a promotional poster outside the door and plans to get revenge on Poochini. Later, as the performance is starting he freezes the conductor, steals his tuxedo, nose and hair; then takes his place in front of the orchestra to conduct the Poochini, who is unaware of the imposter in front of him.\nDuring the performance, in which Poochini (performed by the Colombian baritone Carlos Julio Ram\u00edrez) sings Largo al factotum from Gioacchino Rossini's 1816 opera The Barber of Seville, Mysto unleashes a variety of tricks with his wand. He begins tamely by summoning rabbits and flowers, then turning Poochini into a ballet dancer, an Indian, a tennis player, a prisoner rock-breaker, and a football player. Mysto's revenge gets more brutal as he throws a cymbal on Poochini's head, turning him Chinese and making him sing the Oriental riff; and next transforming him into a country singer and sings \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\". After levitating Poochini to the ceiling and slamming him down to the stage, Mysto turns him into a square dance caller. Poochini actually continues his performance for a good 20 seconds after this without interruption, except for the \"hair gag\" where he removes a hair from the film gate and tosses it away.\nPoochini is then transformed into a Shirley Temple-esque child (who sings \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\" before the balloon blows up and pops), then a Carmen Miranda-type singer, singing \"Mam\u00e3e Eu Quero\" (with two rabbits accompanying him on guitar) after an irritated audience member hurls an armload of fruit onto Poochini's head where it piles up like Miranda's headdress. The same man later sprays black ink on Poochini from a fountain pen, turning him into Bill Kenny from the Ink Spots, then drops an anvil on top of him, crushing him into a shorter height and deepening his voice to that of the Ink Spots' bass, \"Hoppy\" Jones (parodying the Ink Spots' famous \"Top & Bottom\" format).  After a rabbit washes the ink off Poochini's face with a fire hose and another rabbit works his arm like an automobile jack to get him back up to full height, the fun continues as he is transformed into a Hawaiian singer with two rabbits for harmony.\nReaching the end of the number, Mysto's plan is finally revealed to Poochini as his wig falls off. Mysto quickly puts the wig back on, but it's too late. Now set for revenge of his own, Poochini furiously grabs the hairpiece and puts it on while a now defeated and exposed Mysto cowardly tries to flee; but Poochini, having also grabbed the magic wand, stops the magician by using the wand on him as placing Mysto to the stage and unleashes the same gimmicks on the hapless magician at high speed. A red curtain with the words \"The End\" then falls on the magician and the rabbits (at the end of the Hawaiian singer shtick) thus ending the cartoon."

He lowers his arms behind his back and when he raises them again, he now has an additional dozen baby rabbits on them, six on each arm.\nThis cartoon features a gimmick only seen in Tex Avery films, the \"hair gag\". Because cartoons were shown originally in movie theatres, the film strip, if loaded incorrectly, would rub against the gate mechanism, shaving off tiny \"hairs\" of celluloid. These hairs would get caught in the \"gate\" of the projector. Sometimes it would skitter across the projection light, resulting in a gigantic hair appearing on the movie screen. In this cartoon, the opera singer pauses mid-song to pluck the offending hair from the film and tosses it aside, one of Avery's many ways of his characters breaking the fourth wall. It wasn't the first time Avery used this gag: it was also used in Aviation Vacation (1941).\nThe role of Poochini is portrayed by Butch the Irish dog, a frequent star of Avery's cartoons of that era (often alongside Droopy)."

        "content": "Captains of the Clouds (a.k.a. Shadows of Their Wings) is a 1942 American war film in Technicolor,  directed by Michael Curtiz and starring James Cagney. It was produced by William Cagney (Cagney's brother), with Hal B. Wallis as executive producer. The screenplay was written by Arthur T. Horman, Richard Macaulay, and Norman Reilly Raine, based on a story by Horman and Roland Gillett. The cinematography was by Wilfred M. Cline and Sol Polito and was notable in that it was the first feature-length Hollywood production filmed entirely in Canada.The film stars James Cagney and Dennis Morgan as Canadian pilots who do their part in the Second World War, and features Brenda Marshall, Alan Hale Sr., George Tobias, Reginald Gardiner, and Reginald Denny in supporting roles. The title of the film came from a phrase used by Billy Bishop, the First World War fighter ace, who played himself in the film. The same words are also echoed in the narration of The Lion Has Wings documentary (1939).\nA film on the ongoing Canadian involvement made sense for the American war effort. The film ends with an epilogue chronicling the contributions of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) to the making of the film."

        "content": "Brian MacLean irritates fellow bush pilots Johnny Dutton, Tiny Murphy, Blimp Lebec, and British expatriate Scrounger Harris by outcompeting them for business in rugged Northern Ontario, Canada. In 1939, as the Second World War is beginning. Dutton, whose ambition is to start his own airline, flies by the book, but MacLean is a seat-of-the-pants kind of pilot, mirroring the differences in their personalities.\nMacLean nearly dies after he falls off one of his plane\u2019s pontoons and strikes his head as he attempts to tie his plane to the dock.  Dutton flies a doctor in to perform emergency surgery and makes a difficult night landing in heavy cloud cover. MacLean is grateful and joins Dutton in a temporary partnership to help Dutton earn the seed fund for his airline. When Dutton rejects MacLean's warning about his girlfriend Emily Foster, MacLean marries her in order to save Dutton from wrecking his life. Dutton, however, does not know this and abruptly ends their friendship. Dutton impulsively gives his savings to charity and enlists in the Royal Canadian Air Force.\n\nLater, after hearing Winston Churchill's \"We shall fight on the beaches\" speech on the radio, MacLean and the other bush pilots enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force, only to discover that they are considered too old for combat. They reluctantly agree to train as flight instructors for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Their commanding officer is none other than Dutton. MacLean, with his brash and fiercely independent nature, clashes with the military way of doing things, and he is court-martialed and dismissed from the service for flying too low, resulting in a cadet being severely injured. For revenge, he and \"Tiny\" buzz the airfield when renowned Canadian First World War ace Air Marshal William \"Billy\" Bishop (playing himself) is speaking during the group's graduation ceremony. \"Tiny\" blacks out while pulling out of a dive, and his plane plummets into the ground, killing him. MacLean loses his pilot's license as a result.\nLater, when two transport aircraft crash, killing all 44 ferry pilots aboard, there is an urgent need for pilots to ferry a group of unarmed Lockheed Hudson bombers from Gander to Britain. The flight instructors are assigned the task, but their numbers have to be supplemented with civilian pilots. MacLean uses \"Tiny\" Murphy's papers to participate. Dutton recognizes him, but as Emily has told him why MacLean married (and abandoned) her, they reconcile and Dutton permits him to fly.\nDutton commands a flight of five. Nearing the coast of the British Isles, they are attacked by a German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter. First, Blimp Lebec is shot down. Then after Scrounger, MacLean's navigator, is killed, MacLean uses his flying skills to crash his unwieldy bomber into the nimble fighter, sacrificing himself to save the others."

        "content": "During pre-production, Joseph W. G. Clark, the public relations director of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, was heavily involved in promoting a film project that was initially identified as \"Bush Pilots\" based on a script submitted by Canadian screenwriters. With RCAF backing, Hal Wallis and Jack Warner were approached in Hollywood to undertake a \"patriotic film.\" Warner was enthusiastic, and began the task of casting a major star to front the project. After considering Raymond Massey, Errol Flynn, and Clark Gable, the decision was made to cast George Brent, but Warner Bros. was unsure whether he could carry the film.Numerous attempts to rewrite the script into a more acceptable form resulted in a final screenplay now titled \"Captains of the Clouds\". The name was borrowed from a Victory Loans speech given by Billy Bishop. The only holdup was casting, which was resolved when Warner persuaded its resident \"cocky guy\" (as producer Jerry Wald had dubbed him), 42-year-old James Cagney, to take on the lead male role.This film was Cagney's first in Technicolor. His participation in the production has been characterized as reluctant, and he accepted only after his brother was taken on as an associate producer. He quipped, \"I didn't like this story the last four times I did it and I don't like it now!\" and feared that he was immersed in one of his trademark Warner Bros. \"potboilers\", playing a role he had reprised numerous times. However, in certain scenes, Cagney improvised. His loose interpretation is evident in a cabin scene when he is playing against his cronies. Cagney veers off the script, reverting to the cocky persona he had cultivated in countless earlier features.Captains of the Clouds was produced with the full cooperation of the Royal Canadian Air Force to promote enlistment in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. (It was also intended as a rousing \"war preparedness\" film for American audiences, but by the time it was released, the U.S. was already at war; nevertheless it did serve as a showcase of the Canadian war effort.) The Warner Bros. principal cast and production crew of over 80 technicians, along with \"half a million dollars of colour cinematography equipment,\" came from Hollywood, crossing into Canada on July 12, 1941. The film was shot from mid-July to mid-October 1941. Scenes filmed in Ottawa include several views of the historic Chateau Laurier hotel, Parliament, the former Ottawa Union Station and the Cenotaph area.Much of the early footage involved a number of bush planes at the Woodcliff Camp on Trout Lake in North Bay, Ontario, and nearby Camp Caribou on Jumping Cariboo Lake in Marten River, Ontario. The aerial sequences were under the direction of Paul Mantz, a long-time Hollywood stunt pilot, who used a Stinson Model A trimotor camera ship. MacLean's aircraft, CF-HGO on-screen, was a Noorduyn Norseman flown by veteran stunt pilot Frank Clarke (who doubled for James Cagney in flying scenes), Johnny Dutton's silver CF-NBP was an actual Fairchild 71C bush plane,  while Laurentian Air Service's Waco EGC-7 and AGC-8 cabin aircraft provided the other float planes. In addition, there was a Waco CJC, registered as CF-AVW (transformed into CF-JPY in the movie), which belonged to Albert Racicot, a Montreal-based plane dealer and aviation mechanics who, at the time, was also one of the several instructors hired by the Canadian government to train military pilots involved in World War II.\nPrincipal photography did not go well; a number of incidents slowed production. One of the huskies that was key to a scene bit Morgan, opening up a gash on his hand. Cagney, in an uncharacteristic move, decided to forgo a stunt double and play the scene himself in which his character is struck by a whirling propeller. At first things proceeded smoothly, but when it came time for him to fall into the lake, he overdid it and suffered a real concussion, putting the 10-day shoot at North Bay, Ontario farther behind schedule. Weather was a constant challenge, and with the need to ensure continuity, small scenes became unnecessarily complex; as a result, a typical shooting day lasted almost into the night. One 30-second scene with all the principals running along the dock took an entire day to complete, with Cagney, Hale, and Tobias barely able to stand at the end of filming. With a Hollywood production in their midst, North Bay residents became such a persistent nuisance that the crew reverted to sending messages out of the location site by homing pigeons. The military background sequences were shot at RCAF Air Stations at Uplands, Trenton, Dartmouth, Jarvis, and Mountain View. The \"Wings Parade\" (officially the \"Presentation of Wings Ceremony\") filmed at the No. 2 Service Training School at RCAF Uplands was an actual graduation service for 110 RCAF cadets. It proved to be the most complex scene of the film. Over 100 Harvard training aircraft flew overhead in a salute to the graduates.The climactic ferry mission was staged out over the Atlantic from RCAF Station Dartmouth using the base's operational Lockheed Hudson bombers, along with a repainted Hawker Hurricane that posed as the German Bf 109. Due to the prominent Luftwaffe markings on the RCAF fighter, special alerts had to be posted in order to prevent \"trigger-happy\" home defence gunners from firing at it."

        "content": "Released in an era of patriotic films with overt propaganda themes, Captains of the Clouds received an enthusiastic public acceptance. Although it was a \"Hollywood\" production, the film premiered simultaneously on February 21, 1942 in New York, London, Ottawa, Cairo, Melbourne, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver, with RCAF pilots transporting film copies to all these cities. The public reaction can be partly attributed to the plot line that revolved around the unique Canadian wilderness and the bush pilot mystique. \"So Full of Spectacle and Glory it Had to be Made in Technicolor!\" was the ad copy that was used. The vivid aerial scenes filmed in Technicolor were another aspect of the expensive production that garnered critical attention. Reviews were mixed; while some critics felt the film suffered from a stagey plot and a forced romantic story line, the aerial scenes were considered the film's redeeming feature.According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $2,116,000 domestically and $1,312,000 in foreign markets."

Shy by nature, Mudit tries all possible ways to talk to Sugandha but fails. Finally, he decides to send her an online marriage proposal. When the two finally meet, they feel the sparks and decide to take it to the next level. Sugandha takes her time deciding whether to accept the proposal and later calls it her first major decision for her own life. A formal marriage proposal is exchanged between their families.\nWhen Sugandha's parents are out of town, Mudit and Sugandha try getting intimate and when they finally reach the bed, a visibly uncomfortable Mudit declares that he needs to use the washroom. But when he returns, he gets dressed and makes for the main door. When a concerned Sugandha asks him about this sudden change of plans, he simply hints at his problem with the help of a biscuit, getting Sugandha to realize that he is facing a bout of erectile dysfunction.\nMudit and Sugandha try different ways to solve the problem but fail, and when Mudit comes face to face with the reality of his impending marriage, he decides to cancel it. They argue. Now deeply in love, Sugandha refuses to cancel the wedding and says she will expect him and his baaraat (wedding procession) at the venue.\nEventually, accompanied by a posse of assorted relatives, Mudit leaves for Haridwar where the marriage is scheduled to take place. During the journey, Mudit constantly receives calls from someone stating that he is a well-wisher and knows about his problem. When he reaches Haridwar and the calls continue, Sugandha takes the call and showers abuses on the unknown person before suddenly realizing that the well-wisher is none other than Sugandha's father.\nMudit's future father-in-law takes him to consult with a veterinarian who suggests that the cause is stress. A day prior to the wedding, Sugandha and Mudit try getting intimate one more time, egged on by relatives from both sides of the family. When they exit the room sometime later, they find every family member waiting expectantly about Mudit having done 'it'. Mudit says that he managed to perform but Sugandha disagrees. The families are now deeply worried.\nAs the hour of the wedding approaches and troubles and disagreements pile on, Mudit stands up for Sugandha and their relationship against family/societal expectations. He even risks his life to stand up for the love of his life, Sugandha. He rejects toxic masculinity and they together define their marriage as a team of equal players. The wedding takes place.\nIn the closing narration, Sugandha says that nothing happened (i.e. Mudit still presumably had erectile dysfunction) on the first night or their honeymoon and then, they simply got busy with their lives. And one fine day, it simply happened, even as the whole family was busy in a pooja (prayer ceremony)."

It was remade from the company's own Telugu production Shavukaru (1950), and co-producer Chakrapani doubled as screenwriter, making the film more modern than the Telugu original. Cinematography was handled by Marcus Bartley, editing by C. P. Jambulingam, and art direction by S. Krishna Rao and Kaladhar. S. V. Ranga Rao, originally part of the cast, criticised the casting of Nirmala as the female lead, feeling she looked \"too frail\" to play her character, and ordered the producers to replace her. Reddi cancelled shooting for the day. The next day, Nirmala was called back to the studio, and realised that Ranga Rao was replaced by S. V. Subbaiah. The final length of the film was 4,873 metres (15,988 ft)."

On February 24, Limp Bizkit signed with Cash Money Records, and revealed plans to release a new single, \"Ready to Go\", a full-length album and a sequel to their 2005 EP, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1). Cash Money co-founder Birdman said, \"If we find some great talent, we're gonna embrace it. Limp Bizkit, to me, is just a perfect match for us\u2026 It was something that Fred Durst was interested in doing, and I was already a fan, and I was like, 'Let's do it.' It's good for the brand, it will bring a different look for us, and we're definitely trying to expand on that side of music.\"\nHowever, after a dispute between frontman Fred Durst over his and John Otto's \"partying habits\" and drug abuse, DJ Lethal was fired from the band in March 2012.Guitarist Wes Borland released a second studio album with his side project Black Light Burns in mid 2012 and toured in support of the album throughout 2012. It was only in December that the band's first offering for Cash Money was seen. A song called \"Lightz (City of Angels)\" was prematurely leaked via YouTube. In October 2012, DJ Lethal posted an apology using his Twitter account and was accepted back by the band, but he was dismissed again and left out of their upcoming 2013 tour of the US, replaced by touring turntablist DJ Skeletor.In December 2015, Durst was rumored to possibly be holding back the release because he was not happy with the recordings. In February 2016, Metal Injection reported that the band was still in the studio recording the new album. Lethal returned to the band in 2018.\nBorland provided an album update in June 2021, detailing the struggles with the album: We've probably, in the last 10 years, been in the studio to try and complete the record, I wanna say, seven times, to different studios. And we've been working on stuff, working on stuff, working on stuff. And Fred [Durst] has been consistently kind of unsatisfied with where vision is, I guess...We probably have 35 songs recorded instrumentally, and he's done vocals on them and then thrown the vocals away \u2014 done vocals and then [gone], 'Fuck this,' [and] thrown it away. So I think he's finally at the point now where he's gonna pick a set of these songs that he's finally cool with and finish 'em and we're gonna finish the record. So, fingers crossed.\"\nAt Lollapalooza in Chicago, IL in July 2021, the band ended their set with a song called \"Dad Vibes,\" which Durst said is from the upcoming record. As well as this, a hip-hop track called \"Turn It Up, Bitch!\" according to DJ Lethal, has been used as the outro for shows in Chicago and Wallingford, with it being announced at the latter to be the fourth track from the new album."

Durst had then told Billboard that he was putting the finishing touches on the track in March 2013.In their positive review of the single, Artistdirect wrote, \"\"Ready to Go\" feels like a band reawakened in many ways. At the same time, it's the Bizkit the world knows and loves from Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\".In May 2013, amidst their tour of the United States, Borland told Billboard, \"We're really trying to get it hammered out here. We're done with most of the music, pretty much all the music. I've mixed two songs and have a lot more mixing to do. The lyrics and vocals are probably 30 percent done, and Fred is working as we speak, on tour.\" Describing the album's sound, he said, \"[It's] a little more pressure-free and a little more fun. I think it's a little bit more sort of playful, taking chances, a little less pop structured type of stuff. I don't want to say it (sounds) younger, but maybe a little more carefree, musically, to where we don't over-think what we're doing. We're leaving mistakes in and going, 'Oh, that sounds great, leave that in.' That's sort of the thinking instead of polishing too much or trying to stay within the parameters of a formula.\" He also said that producer Ross Robinson (who previously produced the band's debut album and The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)) has worked on \"a little bit\" of the album, along with the label's producer Detail, although it was primarily \"a do-it-yourself affair.\" He further explained the album title, saying, \"[It's] just from being stupid. I think we saw a disco ball elephant in the window of a shop somewhere. We were like, 'Look, it's a disco elephant. We should call our record Stampede of the Disco Elephants.' It's just a 10-second conversation that snowballed.\"In an October 2018 BBC interview with Bring Me the Horizon frontman Oliver Sykes, it was revealed that he and Jordan Fish (the band's keyboardist as well as producer alongside Sykes) originally went to Los Angeles to help write the album with the band the year prior, however work on it would later be abandoned and the duo decided to move their attention towards work for the band's 2019 album Amo. According to Sykes, Durst \"didn't show up most of the time\" and would later say that he felt Durst wasn't ready to record the album yet. One of the riffs written from those sessions is used for the Bring Me the Horizon song \"Wonderful Life\" which appears on the Amo album."

Borland elaborated that Durst had been working on vocals \"on and off\" for the album but had not been satisfied with the outcome. Whereas Borland would prefer to \"do whatever and just put it out\" to capture the moment, Durst's method is to \"keep working on something till he\u2019s happy with it, even if it takes years and years\", and expressed uncertainty of when the album would be released, if ever.Guitarist Wes Borland had already completed writing and performing guitars for the record, but stated in late 2017 that frontman Fred Durst was still working on his parts.On July 21, 2017, Durst claimed on Instagram that the album had already been available online for a year and a half on Soulseek and that \"it's [the fans'] job to find it\"., but Borland refuted this saying he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what [Durst] is talking about.\u201dBorland said in October 2017 that he was unaware of the status of the album, simply that he had recorded \"28 or 29 songs\" that Durst was working on away from the other members, before Borland was to mix the final product.

On August 20, 2013, Limp Bizkit posted on their Facebook page that a second single is to be expected soon. It was soon confirmed to be set for release on November 1, 2013. The second single turned out to be \"Thieves\"; a cover of the song by Ministry that they performed live at Woodstock in 1999 and throughout many of their live sets since 1997, but hadn't released a studio version until 2013. A month later, on December 11, the previously leaked track, \"Lightz\" was officially released as a promotional single, along with an accompanying music video. The band labelled it as \"gift\" for their fans.\nVia an official Facebook post on May 30, 2014, the next single, \"Endless Slaughter\" was confirmed. Referring to it as the first \"experience\" off their upcoming album, the track is set to be released on cassette only during concerts, with the band encouraging potential listeners to invest in a \"BOOM BOX for your analogue listening pleasure\". The single has since been released as a free download on their website and has since been given its own music video. Limp Bizkit would embark upon a European tour from June 24 to July 4, 2014, followed by 2 dates in the US and finally culminating on November 16 at the second annual Knotfest in Makuhari Messe, Tokyo, where Limp Bizkit would perform along with festival founders Slipknot, longtime friends Korn, and other heavy metal acts such as Lamb of God, Five Finger Death Punch, Trivium and In Flames.On July 6, 2019, the band debuted the new song \"Out Of Style\" (then tentatively titled \"Wasteoid\") live in Paris, France. The band played a studio recording of a new song titled \"Dad Vibes\" at the end of their performance at Lollapalooza on August 2, 2021, with Durst stating that it was \"off [their] new album\", and they released it as a single on September 30, 2021, marking their first brand-new material to be released for 7 years.\nOn October 19, 2021, Durst posted a poll to his Instagram story, asking his followers if he should release one new song at a time or just release the entire album (12 songs) at once. The result of the poll skewed heavily in favor of the latter choice. On October 24, Fred teased a partial view of a new album cover on his Instagram story and suggested that the album would be released on Halloween \u2014 October 31, 2021, which would ultimately come true.Unlike previous albums, Still Sucks was initially released on digital platforms only (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.). 18 months later (May 19, 2023), a physical release was made available through Suretone Records\u2019 website."

The film parallels the true story of a Chicago reporter who proved that a man jailed for murder was wrongly convicted 11 years before. James Stewart stars as the persistent journalist and Richard Conte plays the imprisoned Frank Wiecek. Wiecek is based on Joseph Majczek, who was wrongly convicted of the murder of a Chicago policeman in 1932, one of the worst years of organized crime during Prohibition."

Frank Wiecek and another man are quickly arrested, and, in November 1933, are each convicted and sentenced to serve 99 years imprisonment for the killing.\nEleven years later, Wiecek's mother puts a classified ad in the Chicago Times offering a $5,000 reward for information about the true killers of the police officer. This leads the paper's city editor, Brian Kelly, to assign reporter P. J. McNeal to look more closely into the case. McNeal is skeptical at first, believing Wiecek to be guilty. But he starts to change his mind, and meets increased resistance from the police and the state's attorney's office, who are unwilling to be proved wrong. This is quickly followed by political pressure from the state capital, where politicians are anxious to end a story that might prove embarrassing to the administration.\nEventually, Wiecek is proved innocent by, among other things, the enlarging of a photograph showing the date on a newspaper that proves that a key witness statement was false. (In actuality, innocence was determined not as claimed in the film but when it was found out that the prosecution had suppressed the fact that the main witness had initially declared that she could not identify the two men involved in the police shooting.)"

Fox had obtained the necessary legal clearances from the persons involved in the story and had dispatched Otto Lang, producer, and Leonard Hoffman, writer, to Chicago to gather material for the film. Eventually, Quentin Reynolds and Jay Dratler joined Hoffman in writing the script.\nCasting the film proved complex. According to a March 7 report in The New York Times, Twentieth Century-Fox had named Henry Fonda to play the newspaper reporter in Call Northside 777, which would precede Chicken Every Sunday and Lone Star Preacher on Fonda's schedule. However, after a month, another report pointed out that Fox had named Fonda for a leading role in the screen adaptation of Elizabeth Janeway's novel, Daisy Kenyon, which necessitated Fonda's replacement in Call Northside 777. Two months later, another report said that Twentieth Century-Fox was \"negotiating for the services of James Stewart for the leading role in Call Northside 777.\" Lloyd Nolan was originally named to play the role of Brian Kelly, but Lee J. Cobb replaced him in the end. Leopoldine Konstantin was originally scheduled to play the wrongly convicted man's mother, but in the end the role went to Kasia Orzazewski.\nThis was the first Hollywood feature film to be shot on location in Chicago. Views of the Merchandise Mart as well as Holy Trinity Polish Mission can be seen throughout the film. A scene filmed at the Stateville Penitentiary shows the interior of the so-called \"Roundhouse,\" a \"panopticon\" cell block built according to a design originated by English philosopher Jeremy Bentham."

Shortly before they are to embark for a trip to Rio de Janeiro, Karen says she is going on vacation to Bahia by herself to \"think about everything.\" Matthew and Victor agree to go to Rio with their daughters. Jennifer and Nikki share a room, where she says to Nikki \"Your father is so sweet...I used to have a crush on him\", to which Nikki replies \"Me, too\". At the beach, Victor and Matthew see a lot of musicians and walk by numerous young girls and women walking around topless. The fathers spot their daughters in their bikinis in the distance, but the girls turn around to reveal that they are topless as well.\nAfter dropping the girls off at a wedding, the men visit a pub. After Victor goes with a local divorc\u00e9e, Matthew goes to the wedding, where he runs into Jennifer. Suddenly, all attendees of the wedding strip to their briefs and panties and take a dip in the cold ocean. Jennifer insists on having Matthew join them and takes off her top. As soon as Matthew says that the water is warmer than he anticipated, Jennifer passionately kisses him, which Nikki witnesses, and the two proceed to have sex on the beach. The next morning, Matthew stresses it can never happen again but to no avail, Jennifer seduces Matthew in various inappropriate situations. At one point, while Victor and Nikki are having breakfast in the garden, Jennifer kisses Matthew while he is shaving and transfers some shaving foam to her cheek. At another point, she touches his crotch bulge from under the table while having dinner, and eventually the two make love again.\nJennifer tearfully tells her father that she had an affair with an \"older man\". Victor becomes furious and sets out to hunt down the mystery man, expecting Matthew to help. While Matthew tries to talk Jennifer into ending their relationship, she is determined never to give him up and takes a naked photo of herself and gives it to Matthew in public while riding Sugarloaf Cable Car. Matthew ultimately discloses to his friend that Jennifer had the affair with him. Victor is not as irritated as Matthew expects because Victor is revealed to have been having an affair with Karen.\nJennifer attempts to commit suicide with an overdose of birth control pills, but survives and the incident brings all of the friends closer together, but the men constantly object about each other's sexual misconduct.

A disturbed girl is using sex to play mind games with a middle-aged man, and the movie get its yuks with slapstick scenes...What's shocking is how many first-rate talents are associated with this sleaze.\"Rotten Tomatoes gave Blame It on Rio a rating of 7%, based on reviews from 27 critics.

        "content": "\"Love Takes Time\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey for her eponymous debut studio album (1990). Written by Carey and Ben Margulies, while produced by Walter Afanasieff, the song was released as the second single from the album on August 22, 1990, by Columbia Records. An adult contemporary-influenced ballad, the song follows its protagonist lamenting the loss of a lover and confesses that \"love takes time\" to heal and that her feelings for her ex-lover remain.\nCarey quickly recorded \"Love Takes Time\" at the last minute when the album was already considered complete and being processed for release. She played the song's demo to former Columbia CEO Don Ienner while on an airplane. Ienner and other officials immediately insisted the song be included on her upcoming album, even though the album was already going through final stages of completion and Carey wanted to save it for her sophomore effort. Eventually the song made it on to the album as the closing track, however, due to its late addition, it was not listed as such on early pressings of the album. Subsequent pressings of the album corrected this error.\n\"Love Takes Time\" was well received by music critics and went to become another success from the album in North America. It became Carey's second number-one single in the United States, attaining the position for three weeks. However, the song did not replicate the success of its predecessor globally. A music video was provided for the song, filmed in black and white at a beach. \"Love Takes Time\" has been included on Carey's compilation album Greatest Hits (2001), as well as #1 to Infinity (2015), among others. \"Love Takes Time\" was heavily promoted in the US, being performed live on shows such as The Arsenio Hall Show, Mariah's Thanksgiving NBC Special and The Des O'Connor Show. Since its release, the song has been included on set lists of Carey's numerous concert tours and residencies."

        "content": "In 1988, a 19-year-old Carey moved out from her mother's house on Long Island into an apartment in Manhattan. She had composed a four-track demo tape with her writing partner Ben Margulies while she was attending high school. As 1988 progressed, Carey struggled to impress record executives with the tape and had failed in securing a record deal. She worked several jobs, including as a waitress and coat-checker, in order to pay for studio sessions with Margulies to make changes to the demo. After several months, Carey befriended singer Brenda K. Starr, and soon became one of her back-up vocalists. During recording sessions and rehearsals, Starr began to notice \"glimpses\" of Carey's \"gifted\" vocals. She thought that Carey was capable of achieving mainstream success and that she needed some guidance to break into the industry.One evening, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala with hope of convincing a record executive to listen to Carey's demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, the president of Atlantic Records was interested in Carey, but as she handed him the tape, Tommy Mottola grabbed it, and said that he would tend to \"the project\". Mottola left the event later that evening, and got into his limousine and listened to the tape. He quickly realized that he had found a talented vocalist, turned the car around and returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. After a week of tracking her down through Starr's management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and brought her over to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said: \"When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom.\" After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988."

        "content": "Carey's debut album was completed and being mastered when she wrote the song with Ben Margulies. Margulies said: \"It was sort of a gospelish thing I was improvising, then we began working on it. It was on a work tape that we had...and we recorded a very quick demo. It was just a piano vocal demo - I played live piano, and she sang it.\"\nCarey was on a mini-tour of ten states, playing acoustically with a piano player and three back-up singers. While on a company plane, she played the demo of \"Love Takes Time\" for Columbia Records president Don Ienner. \"All the important guys were on the plane,\" Margulies said. \"Tommy Mottola, Ienner, and Bobby Colomby.\" Carey was told the song was a \"career-maker\" and that it had to go on the first album. She protested, as her album was already being mastered and she intended the ballad for her next release.\nThe demo was sent to producer Walter Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. Afanasieff recalled: \"I guess to see if he made the right choice, [Mottola] called me up one day. He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can to put it on the album.' I said, 'What do you want me to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time.\"\nThe demo was very close to what Mottola wanted the finished product to be, according to Afanasieff: \"We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York [and] did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then [engineer] Dana Jon Chappelle and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: a day and a half for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing.\"\nAfanasieff heard from Columbia executives as soon as they received the mix. They wanted Carey's vocal a little louder, so a remix was quickly completed. The producer asked if the song would still make the debut album, and was told: \"We're going to do our best.\"\nWhen the album was released, \"Love Takes Time\" was not listed on neither cassette nor CD pressings. Margulies said: \"And so the song's on there, but it doesn't say that it's on there. It was a song that actually was strong enough to stop the pressing...I don't know if they had to throw away a few hundred copies.\""

Carey keeps things simmering at a low heat, slowly unveiling the power and beauty of her voice. Should be firmly lodged in the #1 slot very soon.\" Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"With just the softest synthesizer tinkle, a touch of percussion, and what may well have been a borrowed pair of back-porch wind chimes, she made every last listener feel the utter despair of a breakup: \"Losing my mind/From this hollow in my heart/Suddenly I\u2019m so incomplete.\"\" In 2015, Est 1997 writer Mario stated that it was an \u2033Adult Contemporary ballad\u2033 and that it was \"arguably some of the strongest melodies and bridge in Mariah\u2019s catalog.\" He continued by saying that \u2033Her vocals are so pure and passionate that every emotion filters through the music and just reaches and warms the heart. It\u2019s the realisation of a universal truth by a young woman who\u2019s still learning to deal with feelings. There\u2019s almost a sense of naivety in the lyrics but, at the same time, the song sounds mature and it\u2019s relatable. That\u2019s a constant in Mariah\u2019s catalog, something that has marked her strength and endurance as a writer.\"During a review of her 2001 Greatest Hits album in May 2002, Devon Powers of PopMatters praised the song along with \"I Don't Wanna Cry\", calling it \"stupendous\" and said that \u2033Her lyrics were exactly what you wanted them to be: simple, memorable, and absolutely true.\" Stephen Filippelli from Review Stream called the song decent, but mainly criticized the music video for the song. Amanda Dobbins and Lindsay Weber of Vulture listed \"Love Takes Time\" at number-nineteen on their list of \"Mariah Carey\u2019s 25 Best Singles\". OO Cities called the song a \"beautiful ballad\"."

Following the duo's soundtrack for The Graduate, Art Garfunkel took an acting role in the film Catch-22, while Paul Simon worked on the songs, writing all tracks except Felice and Boudleaux Bryant's \"Bye Bye Love\" (previously a hit for the Everly Brothers).\nWith the help of producer Roy Halee, the album followed a similar musical pattern as their previous album Bookends (1968), partly abandoning their traditional style to incorporate elements of rock, R&B, gospel, jazz, world music, pop and other genres. It was described as their \"most effortless record and their most ambitious\". After Bridge Over Troubled Water was released, several re-releases followed. The album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. Columbia Records released a 40th Anniversary Edition on March 8, 2011, which includes two DVDs, including the politically themed TV special Songs of America (1969), the documentary The Harmony Game, additional liner notes and a booklet. Other reissues contain bonus tracks, such as the 2001 version, which covers the demo tapes of \"Feuilles-O\" and \"Bridge over Troubled Water\". Contemporary critical reception to Bridge was initially mixed, but retrospective reviews of the album have been laudatory, and it is considered by many to be the duo's best album.Bridge Over Troubled Water topped the charts in over ten countries and received six Grammy Awards at the 1971 Grammy Awards, including the Album of the Year. The album has sold over 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and at the time of its release, the best-selling album ever. It has been ranked on several \"greatest\" lists, including number 172 on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" list in 2020. Despite the accolades, the duo decided to split up, and parted company later in 1970; Garfunkel continued his film career, while Simon worked intensely with music. Both artists released solo albums in the following years. Bridge includes two of the duo's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful songs, \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" and \"The Boxer\", which were listed on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list."

Art Garfunkel took the role of Captain Nately in another Nichols film, Catch-22, based on the novel of the same name. Initially Paul Simon was to play the character of Dunbar, but screenwriter Buck Henry felt the film was already crowded with characters and subsequently wrote Simon's part out. The unexpectedly long film production endangered the relationship between the duo; Garfunkel later stated in a 1990 interview with Paul Zollo in SongTalk magazine: \"Our way of working was for Paul to write while we recorded. So we'd be in the studio for the better part of two months working on the three or four songs that Paul had written, recording them, and when they were done, we'd knock off for a couple of months while Paul was working on the next group of three or four songs. Then we'd book time and be in the studio again for three or four months, recording those . . . . Rather than wait for Paul to write the next bunch of songs, I went off and did this movie.\""

Furthermore, it received 8\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and 4\u00d7 Platinum in Canada. Bridge over Troubled Water has since sold 3,163,789 copies in the UK, and over 25 million copies worldwide.The songs \"Cuba Si, Nixon No\", \"Groundhog\", and the demo \"Feuilles-O\" were recorded during sessions but not released on the album. \"Cuba Si, Nixon No\" was later released on a bootleg recording of a concert of November 11, 1969, by Simon and Garfunkel at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, while the demo recording of \"Feuilles-O\" was later released on the Old Friends and The Columbia Studio Recordings (1964\u20131970) box sets. A remastered and expanded version of the album was released on compact disc in 2001, containing the demo versions of \"Feuilles-O\" and \"Bridge over Troubled Water.\" It was remastered by Vic Anesini. Garfunkel later recorded \"Feuilles-Oh/Do Space Men Pass Dead Souls on Their Way to the Moon?\" on his debut solo album Angel Clare, and as the flip-side to his single, \"I Shall Sing\", from the same album.Columbia Records released a 40th Anniversary Edition on March 8, 2011, comprising three discs. The first disc features the original album and the second disc contains the entirety of Live 1969, which had been released three years earlier as an exclusive at Starbucks. The third disc, a DVD, consisted of the television special Songs of America, which originally aired in 1969 on CBS and unavailable since its original broadcast, and a new documentary The Harmony Game about the making of the album. Songs of America comprised footage of the 1969 tour, intimate backstage conversations, and historic news clips; it had elicited controversy owing to the duo's political comments regarding the Vietnam War and the direction of American society at the time. The Harmony Game featured new 2010 interviews with Simon, Garfunkel, producer Roy Halee, and more principals involved with the making of the album. The 1969 special runs for approximately 52 minutes 37 seconds, while the 2010 documentary runs for approximately 70 minutes 54 seconds. A booklet of liner notes, photos, and essays by critics Michael Hill and Anthony DeCurtis was also included.The album is also included in its entirety as part of the Simon & Garfunkel box sets Collected Works, The Columbia Studio Recordings (1964\u20131970) and Simon & Garfunkel: The Complete Albums Collection."

        "content": "Bridge over Troubled Water was originally released to a mixed critical response. Writing in Melody Maker in February 1970, Richard Williams identified \"a few dull moments\" on the album, while adding that \"they're worth enduring for the jewels they surround\". Williams concluded: \"Not, perhaps, another classic like Bookends, but still worth hearing for Simon's constantly surprising timing, and for the way he can make his guitar sound like a small orchestra and the orchestra sound like a big guitar ...\" Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was lukewarm about the album in 1970, giving it a \"B\" grade in his \"Consumer Guide\" column and notoriously reviewing it with one word: \"Melodic\". He later expounded on the problematic nature of the record's \"smooth, well made\" music, writing in Newsday that the album is \"often funny and honest. It breathes life. Yet I suspect that its flawless, rather languid loveliness is ultimately soporific\". According to Steve Horowitz of PopMatters, contemporary critics compared the album to the Beatles' White Album \"in that one can hear the incipient break up of the band in the way they separately perform the material\".Among retrospective reviews, Bruce Eder of AllMusic said that Bridge over Troubled Water was \"perhaps the most delicately textured album to close out the 1960s from any major rock act\", especially in a time of troubles in the United States. Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone assessed the album as \"a casually ambitious look back\" at both the decade and the duo's musical partnership, which concluded the latter \"on an exhilarating note\". Author and critic David Browne noted the album's \"sonic warmth and richness\". Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork praised its unique sound, writing that \"Bridge sounds like a unified statement enlivened by styles and rhythms not often heard on pop radio at the juncture of [the 1960s and 1970s].\"In a 2001 review for Uncut, Ian MacDonald found the album \"overproduced and underwritten\", adding: \"Where Bookends is succinct, dry, and disciplined, Bridge ... is self-satisfied, sentimental, mediocre, and overblown. Even its best song, 'The Boxer', is needlessly inflated and protracted.\" Writing for MusicHound, Leland Rucker acknowledged that Bridge over Troubled Water \"is considered their masterpiece\", while noting that he found that \"it sounds top-heavy, overproduced, and too precious for its own good.\" Conversely, Q magazine deemed the album to be Simon & Garfunkel's best and most consistent work, \"notable for the strength of its melodies, the force of its lyrics and the Abbey Road-style sophistication of its production\". In his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin admires the album as a \"celebrated\" work that includes a \"classic single\" (\"The Boxer\") and a title song that \"became a standard with Garfunkel's angelic vocal set perfectly matched to the lush, orchestral arrangement and contrasting tempo\". Joe Nolan of American Songwriter notes that \"the pair were never more popular or commercially successful than they were with the release of Bridge over Troubled Water\".Bridge over Troubled Water won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, as well as for Best Engineered Recording, while its title track won the Grammys for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Contemporary Song and Best Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) in 1971. Bridge over Troubled Water was nominated at the first Brit Awards for Best International Album and its title track for Best International Single in 1977. In 2000 it was voted number 66 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, it was ranked at No.\u200951 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list; in a 2020 revision, the album was ranked at No. 172. In December 1993, The Times ranked the album at number 20 on its \"The Vultures 100 Best Albums of all Time\".  The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.Chris Charlesworth, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Paul Simon and Simon & Garfunkel, gave a mixed reception, noting that seven songs (\"Bridge over Troubled Water\", \"El Condor Pasa\", \"So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright\", \"The Boxer\", \"The Only Living Boy in New York\", \"Bye Bye Love\" and \"Song for the Asking\") were outstanding or good, while the rest, mainly uptempo ones, were for him \"throwaway\" recordings. He was surprised at its success."

It is the third installment in the Jackass film series, and the sequel to Jackass Number Two (2006). The film stars the regular Jackass cast of  Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, \"Danger Ehren\" McGhehey, Dave England, Preston Lacy, Wee Man, and Chris Pontius. This is the last Jackass film to feature Dunn before his death in 2011 and Margera as a primary cast member before his departure in 2020 (Margera is briefly in Jackass Forever). This is also the last Jackass film to feature a guest appearance by Rip Taylor, who died in October 2019.\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States in the 3D format on October 15, 2010, by Paramount Pictures, marking the tenth anniversary of the Jackass television series. It received generally positive reviews from critics. The film grossed $171.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $20 million. A sequel, titled Jackass Forever, was released on February 4, 2022 to positive reviews.Leftover film footage scenes was incorporated as a extended length feature released as Jackass 3.5, on DVD and Blu-ray on June 14, 2011."

        "content": "Beavis and Butt-Head open the film with a special cameo, and an explanation of 3D technology. In a matter typical for the characters, they start arguing and quickly get into a slap-fight, with several of the moves especially animated to come out of the screen in a 3D setting. The opening sequence features each of the cast members lining up, standing in each color of the rainbow, while an operatic version of the Jackass theme song \"Corona\" plays. Once Johnny Knoxville introduces the film, each cast member does small stunts by various objects in slow-motion to the tune of \"The Kids Are Back\" by Twisted Sister. The opening sequence, as well as many of the stunts, were filmed with Phantom high speed cameras, which shoot at 1,000 frames per second.\nThe most notable stunts and pranks include: Johnny Knoxville being camouflage-painted as a bull charges at him; Bam Margera falling into a pit filled with snakes while attempting to prank Jeff Tremaine; Ryan Dunn and Steve-O playing instruments while a male sheep rams them; Steve-O drinking Preston Lacy's sweat after riding an elliptical machine; Bam gluing his hands to Preston Lacy and Phil Margera's chest with super glue; Ehren McGhehey getting his crooked tooth pulled by Bam's Lamborghini; Dave England playing tetherball with a beehive against Steve-O; Preston Lacy getting a football kicked into his face by a professional NFL kicker; Wee Man participating in a bar brawl with other little people; and Chris Pontius flying an RC helicopter while it is tied to his penis.\nThe final stunt involves Steve-O being launched high into the air while inside a full port-a-potty connected to bungee cords. The following closing skit is done in a similar fashion as the introduction, as Knoxville announces he's about to \"end the movie\", then triggers an old-fashioned dynamite plunger; after the rest of the crew is disappointed by the initial explosion being a mere puff of air out of a nearby pi\u00f1ata, everything in the room is destroyed in a series of large explosions, as the blown-up objects are thrown at the cast (like the opening, all shown in slow-motion) to the tune of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. After the explosions are finished, the cast members are flushed away by a wave pool. As in the past two Jackass films, comedian Rip Taylor makes an appearance before the credits roll, celebrating the end of the film in overly dramatic fashion."

        "content": "In December 2009, director and producer Jeff Tremaine began doing camera tests with the 3D equipment. In that same month, Johnny Knoxville announced the return of the entire cast of the previous two movies. According to Deadline Hollywood, a stunt called \"The Heli-cockter\" was filmed and shown to Paramount executives in its 3D format to greenlight the project. Chris Pontius tethered a remote control-operated helicopter to his penis, and grinned while he swung it around.\nFilming of the stunts began on January 25, 2010, Tremaine filmed the crew on private property unlike the traditional Jackass fashion of filming in the streets (although in the film, several skits/pranks were shot in public), and it includes \"occasional forays to foreign countries.\" In April 2010, Bam Margera told the Artisan News Service that the movie was 70% done and half the crew had been to the hospital with Margera having \"three broken ribs and a broken shoulder and a twisted ankle as we speak.\" During filming, recurring guest cast member Loomis Fall suffered a compound fracture of his clavicle after an improper landing during a stunt involving an umbrella and a jet engine.\nOn the subject of the stunts, director Jeff Tremaine said he was aiming to revamp most of the old stunts from the original show into the movie. For example, the \"Poo Cocktail Supreme\" is an homage to, and an extension of, the stunt originally done by Knoxville on the original television show. The stunt, \"Lamborghini Tooth Pull\" was originally shot for Jackass Number Two with Margera's uncle, Vincent Margera (also known as Don Vito) but after Margera's arrest back in 2006, the stunt was pulled from the final cut of the movie and was not shown in Jackass 2.5, so it was re-shot with Ehren McGhehey for this film, and the elder Margera was declared persona non grata among the cast and crew for  some time.\nIn April 2010, JackassWorld.com was officially shut down, leaving a posting that said \"gone filmin',\" and \"Thanks for the support the past two years. To keep abreast and adick of all things related to the world of jackass and Dickhouse (including the currently in production flick jackass 3D), follow us on Facebook and Twitter.\" In an interview with cameraman Rick Kosick, he revealed that JackassWorld.com will no longer be a website after the movie releases. Despite this claim, it was eventually relaunched as the main website for Dickhouse Productions.\nCameraman Lance Bangs explained the transition from television to cinema screen: \"It's utterly crazy. Everything in 3-D looks as brightly colored as candy. I'm a cameraman on it, and it's amazing to watch the footage being turned 3-D, like watching everything through a viewfinder.\" He later went on to say, \"I thought I was above peer pressure, but there's such camaraderie. I took part in a few stunts and ended up humiliated and hurt \u2014 me, the poetic film-maker friend of Spike Jonze.\"In late May 2010, Knoxville stated that Steve-O's sobriety was at its best and, \"there is no beer on set this time around even if some of us wish there was.\" He also said, \"To be honest, it's going great. Everyone has had different injuries throughout, which is a good sign, and Steve-O is probably getting the best footage out of everybody. He is really going for it. He wants to prove to everyone he can do these stunts sober. It's been two years since he had a drink now. Everyone has been real supportive of him.\"At the 2010 MTV Movie Awards, Tremaine said filming was nearly finished but they had not shot internationally yet but intended to shoot \"a couple of bits\".An injury to cast member Bam Margera forced a rewrite for the beginning of the movie. On June 12, 2010, Margera was beaten on the head with a bat by a 59-year-old African-American woman outside of his bar, The Note. The woman alleged Bam called her a racial slur and that she was offended, but did not hit him. When Margera was approached by TMZ two days after the incident, he told them he \"never used the n-word\" and that \"[the lady] attacked me times before\". He explained:\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                              I was internally bleeding in the brain for two days and they wouldn't let me leave the hospital. I was like, 'I need to go to Los Angeles in six hours to go finish Jackass.' We start tomorrow and I'm supposed to get hit in the head and now I can't because of her.\nMargera added in the same interview that the opening sequence is being shot with Phantom high speed cameras, which record at 1,000 frames per second to produce hyper-slow motion, similar to the opening sequence of Zombieland. Appropriately, make-up effects designer Tony Gardner, creator of the zombie hordes for Zombieland, was a designer for all of the Jackass films.\nDeleted scenes that were filmed, but got cut out of both Jackass 3D and Jackass 3.5 include: \"BB Gun Nipple Piercing\", where Wee Man shoots Steve-O in the nipple with a BB gun; \"Bed Sled\", where Chris Pontius and Dave England slide down a snowy mountain on an inflatable bed; \"Super Mighty Glue Goatee\", where Johnny Knoxville puts super mighty glue on his chin and sticks it to Phil Margera's hairy chest; \"Banana Gauntlet\", where Wee Man, Dave, and Bam Margera slide on a lubed up table with banana peels while they're dressed up as gorillas, and trying to avoid the bananas that are swinging in their way; and \"Piss Drink\", where Steve-O uses Knoxville's catheter for Knoxville's torn urethra as a straw to drink his piss. Some of these deleted scenes are briefly shown in the credits of Jackass 3D or Jackass 3.5. Steve-O uploaded the full \"BB Gun Nipple Piercing\" to his YouTube channel."

        "content": "Gone with the Wind is a 1939 American epic historical romance film adapted from the 1936 novel by Margaret Mitchell. The film was produced by David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures and directed by Victor Fleming. Set in the American South against the backdrop of the Civil War and the Reconstruction era, the film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, following her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland), and her subsequent marriage to Rhett Butler (Clark Gable).\nThe film had a troubled production. The start of filming was delayed for two years until January 1939 because Selznick was determined to secure Gable for the role of Rhett, and concluded in July. The role of Scarlett was challenging to cast, and 1,400 unknown women were interviewed for the part. Sidney Howard's original screenplay underwent many revisions by several writers to reduce it to a suitable length. The original director, George Cukor, was fired shortly after filming began and was replaced by Fleming, who in turn was briefly replaced by Sam Wood while taking some time off due to exhaustion. Post-production concluded in November 1939, just a month before its premiere.\nIt received generally positive reviews upon its release on December 15, 1939. While the casting was widely praised, the long-running time received criticism. At the 12th Academy Awards, Gone with the Wind received ten Academy Awards (eight competitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for Best Picture, Best Director (Fleming), Best Adapted Screenplay (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), Best Actress (Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award). It set records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time.\nGone with the Wind was immensely popular when first released. It became the highest-earning film made up to that point and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When adjusted for monetary inflation, it is still the highest-grossing film in history. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. Although the film has been criticized as historical negationism, glorifying slavery and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy myth, it has been credited with triggering changes in the way in which African Americans were depicted cinematically. Gone with the Wind is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, and in 1989, became one of the twenty-five inaugural films selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry."

        "content": "In 1861, on the eve of the American Civil War, Scarlett O'Hara lives at Tara, her family's cotton plantation in Georgia, with her parents, two sisters, and their many black slaves. Scarlett is deeply attracted to Ashley Wilkes and learns he is to be married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton. At an engagement party the next day at Ashley's home, Twelve Oaks, a nearby plantation, Scarlett makes an advance on Ashley but is rebuffed; however, she catches the attention of another guest, Rhett Butler. The party is disrupted by news of President Lincoln's call for volunteers to fight the South, and the Southern men rush to enlist. Scarlett marries Melanie's younger brother, Charles, to arouse jealousy in Ashley before he leaves to fight. Following Charles's death while serving in the Confederate States Army, Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in Atlanta. She creates a scene by attending a charity bazaar in mourning attire and waltzing with Rhett, now a blockade runner for the Confederacy.\nThe tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the Battle of Gettysburg. Many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Eight months later, as the Union Army besieges the city in the Atlanta campaign, Melanie gives birth with Scarlett's aid, and Rhett helps them flee the city. Rhett chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett to make her own way back to Tara. She finds Tara deserted, except for her father, sisters, and former slaves, Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of typhoid fever, and her father has lost his mind. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows to ensure her and her family's survival.\nWith the defeat of the Confederacy, the O'Haras toil in the cotton fields. Ashley returns but finds he is of little help to Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately but says he cannot leave Melanie. Scarlett's father attempts to chase away a carpetbagger from his land but is thrown from his horse and killed.  Unable to pay the Reconstructionist taxes imposed on Tara, Scarlett unsuccessfully appeals to Rhett, then dupes her younger sister Suellen's fianc\u00e9, the middle-aged and wealthy general store owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her. Frank, Ashley, Rhett, and several other accomplices make a night raid on a shanty town after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. Shortly after Frank's funeral, Rhett proposes to Scarlett, and she accepts.\nRhett and Scarlett have a daughter whom Rhett nicknames Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett still pines for Ashley and, chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, refuses to have any more children or share a bed with Rhett. One day at Frank's mill, Ashley's sister, India, sees Scarlett and Ashley embracing. Harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett, India eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend Ashley's birthday party. Melanie, however, stands by Scarlett. After returning home, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom.\nThe next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, England, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues, resulting in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a miscarriage. While recovering, tragedy strikes again when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony. Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was Rhett, and not Ashley, whom she truly loved all along, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but he rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog. A distraught Scarlett resolves to return home to Tara, vowing to one day win Rhett back."

        "content": "The Big Lebowski () is a 1998 independent crime comedy film directed and co-written by Joel Coen, with producer brother Ethan Coen serving as co-writer. It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire, also named Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston), was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is supposedly kidnapped, and millionaire Lebowski commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release. The plan goes awry when the Dude's friend, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), schemes to keep the ransom money for the Dude and himself. Sam Elliott, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Peter Stormare, Jon Polito, and Ben Gazzara also appear in supporting roles.\nThe film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, \"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story \u2013 how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant\". The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.\nThe Big Lebowski received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Reviews have since become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

One enforcer urinates on the Dude's rug before the two realize that they have the wrong man and leave.\nConsulting his bowling partners, Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak and fall guy Donny Kerabatsos, the Dude visits wealthy philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski (\"the big Lebowski\"), requesting compensation for the rug. Lebowski refuses, but the Dude tricks his assistant Brandt into letting him take a similar rug from the mansion. Outside, he meets Bunny, Lebowski's trophy wife, and her German nihilist friend Uli. Soon afterwards, Bunny is apparently kidnapped, and Lebowski hires The Dude to deliver a ransom. That night, another group of thugs ambush the Dude, taking his replacement rug on behalf of Lebowski's daughter Maude, who has a sentimental attachment to it.\nConvinced the kidnap was a ruse by Bunny, Walter fakes the ransom drop. He and the Dude return to the bowling alley, leaving the briefcase of money in the car trunk. While they bowl, the car is stolen. The Dude is confronted by Lebowski, who has an envelope from the kidnappers containing a severed toe, supposedly Bunny's. Maude asks the Dude to help recover the money, which her father illegally withdrew from the family's charity foundation.\nThe police recover the Dude's car. The briefcase is missing but the Dude finds a clue: a sheet of homework signed by Larry Sellers. He and Walter visit the teenage Larry but get no information from him. Walter assumes a sports car in front of Larry's house was purchased with the ransom, and smashes it. The car actually belongs to a neighbor, who smashes the Dude's car in return.\nJackie Treehorn's thugs abduct the Dude and bring him to the porn kingpin, who demands to know where Bunny is and what happened to his money. The Dude says Bunny faked her kidnapping and Larry has the money, then passes out from a spiked drink Treehorn gave him. He is arrested while wandering deliriously in Malibu and evicted by the police chief. On his way home Bunny (whose toes are intact) drives by, unnoticed by the Dude.\nMaude is waiting for the Dude at his home and has sex with him, wishing to become pregnant by a father with whom she will not have to interact. She tells the Dude her father has no money of his own; his wealth came from her late mother.\nThe Dude and Walter confront Lebowski and find Bunny has returned, having gone out of town without telling anyone. Bunny's nihilist friends took the opportunity to blackmail Lebowski, who, in turn, had tried to embezzle money from the family charity, blaming its disappearance on the blackmailers. The Dude believes the briefcase never contained any money. An enraged Walter suspects Lebowski is faking his paralysis and lifts him out of his wheelchair, but his condition is real.\nWalter and the Dude are bowling when a rival bowler, Jesus Quintana, interrupts them. Walter had previously stated that he could not bowl on Saturdays since he is shomer Shabbos. In a tirade, Quintana implies he does not believe Walter's excuse for not bowling on Saturday, threatens Walter and the Dude and storms out. Outside the bowling alley, the nihilists set fire to the Dude's car, and demand the ransom money. Walter fights them off, but Donny dies from a heart attack. Walter scatters Donny's ashes from a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, but they are blown back onto him and the Dude by an updraft. The Dude loses his temper and yells at Walter, who consoles him, and the two go bowling.\nAt the bowling alley, the Dude encounters the Stranger, the movie's narrator, who sums up everything that happened in the film and states that while he \"didn't like seeing Donny go\", he remains inspired by the Dude and that Maude is pregnant with a \"little Lebowski on the way.\""

        "content": "The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a veteran of all the Coen Brothers' films. While the Coens were writing the screenplay they had Kenny Rogers' \"Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was in)\", the Gipsy Kings' cover of \"Hotel California\", and several Creedence Clearwater Revival songs in mind. They asked T-Bone Burnett (who would later work with the Coens on O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Inside Llewyn Davis) to pick songs for the soundtrack of the film. They knew that they wanted different genres of music from different times but, as Joel remembers, \"T-Bone even came up with some far-out Henry Mancini and Yma Sumac.\" Burnett was able to secure songs by Kenny Rogers and the Gipsy Kings and also added tracks by Captain Beefheart, Moondog and Bob Dylan's \"The Man in Me\". However, he had a tough time securing the rights to Townes Van Zandt's cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Dead Flowers\", which plays over the film's closing credits. Former Stones manager Allen Klein owned the rights to the song and wanted $150,000 for it. Burnett convinced Klein to watch an early cut of the film and remembers, \"It got to the part where the Dude says, 'I hate the fuckin' Eagles, man!' Klein stands up and says, 'That's it, you can have the song!' That was beautiful.\" Burnett was going to be credited on the film as \"Music Supervisor\", but asked his credit to be \"Music Archivist\" because he \"hated the notion of being a supervisor; I wouldn't want anyone to think of me as management\".For Joel, \"the original music, as with other elements of the movie, had to echo the retro sounds of the Sixties and early Seventies\".:\u200a156\u200a Music defines each character. For example, \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" by Bob Nolan was chosen for the Stranger at the time the Coens wrote the screenplay, as was \"Lujon\" by Henry Mancini for Jackie Treehorn. \"The German nihilists are accompanied by techno-pop and Jeff Bridges by Creedence. So there's a musical signature for each of them\", remarked Ethan in an interview.:\u200a156\u200a\nThe character Uli Kunkel was in the German electronic band Autobahn, an homage to the band Kraftwerk. The album cover of their record Nagelbett (bed of nails) is a parody of the Kraftwerk album cover for The Man-Machine and the group name Autobahn shares the name of a Kraftwerk song and album. In the lyrics the phrase \"We believe in nothing\" is repeated with electronic distortion. This is a reference to Autobahn's nihilism in the film."

The theater held the film over for six weeks, which had never happened before.:\u200a130\u200a\nAn annual festival, Lebowski Fest, began in Louisville, Kentucky, United States, in 2002 with 150 fans showing up, and has since expanded to several other cities. The festival's main event each year is a night of unlimited bowling with various contests including costume, trivia, hardest- and farthest-traveled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands the night before the bowling event as well as a day-long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths and games. Various celebrities from the film have attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges who attended the Los Angeles event. The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as The Dude Abides and is held in London.Dudeism, a religion devoted largely to spreading the philosophy and lifestyle of the film's main character, was founded in 2005.

In addition, the magazine also ranked The Dude No. 14 in their \"The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\" poll. The film was also nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association. The Big Lebowski was voted as the 10th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: \"The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list.\" Empire magazine ranked Walter Sobchak No. 49 and the Dude No. 7 in their \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" poll.

The film tells the story of two victims of traumatic childhoods who become lovers and mass murderers, and are irresponsibly glorified by the mass media.\nThe film is based on an original screenplay by Quentin Tarantino that was heavily revised by Stone, writer David Veloz, and associate producer Richard Rutowski. Tarantino received a story credit though he subsequently disowned the film. Jane Hamsher, Don Murphy, and Clayton Townsend produced the film, with Arnon Milchan, Thom Mount, and Stone as executive producers.\nNatural Born Killers was released on August 26, 1994 in the United States, and screened at the Venice Film Festival on August 29, 1994. It was a box office success, grossing $110 million against a production budget of $34 million, but received polarized reviews. Some critics praised the plot, acting, humor, and combination of action and romance, while others found the film overly violent and graphic. Notorious for its violent content and inspiring \"copycat\" crimes, the film was named the eighth most controversial film in history by Entertainment Weekly in 2006."

She initially encourages it before beating one of the men viciously. Mickey joins her, and the couple murder everyone in the diner, save one customer, to whom they proudly declare their names before leaving. The couple camp in the desert, and Mallory reminisces about how she met Mickey, a meat deliveryman who serviced her family's household. After a whirlwind romance, Mickey is arrested for grand theft auto and sent to prison; he escapes and returns to Mallory's home. The couple murders Mallory's sexually abusive father and neglectful mother, but spare the life of Mallory's little brother, Kevin. The couple then have an unofficial marriage ceremony on a bridge.\nLater, Mickey and Mallory hold a woman hostage in their hotel room. Angered by Mickey's desire for a threesome, Mallory leaves, and Mickey rapes the hostage. Mallory drives to a nearby gas station, where she flirts with a mechanic. They begin to have sex on the hood of a car, but after Mallory suffers a flashback of being raped by her father, and the mechanic recognizes her as a wanted murderer, Mallory kills him. The pair continue their killing spree, ultimately claiming 52 victims in New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada. Pursuing them is detective Jack Scagnetti, who became obsessed with mass murderers at the age of eight after having witnessed the murder of his mother at the hand of Charles Whitman. Beneath his heroic fa\u00e7ade, he is also a violent psychopath and has murdered prostitutes in his past. Following the pair's murder spree is self-serving tabloid journalist Wayne Gale, who profiles them on his show American Maniacs, soon elevating them to cult-hero status.\nMickey and Mallory become lost in the desert after taking psychedelic mushrooms, and they stumble upon a ranch owned by Warren Red Cloud, a Navajo man who provides them food and shelter. As Mickey and Mallory sleep, Warren, sensing evil in the couple, attempts to exorcise the demon that he perceives in Mickey, chanting over him as he sleeps. Mickey, who has nightmares of his abusive parents, awakens during the exorcism and shoots Warren to death. As the couple flee, they feel inexplicably guilty and come across a giant field of rattlesnakes, where they are badly bitten. They reach a drugstore to purchase snakebite antidote, but the store is sold out. A pharmacist recognizes the couple and triggers an alarm before Mickey kills him. Police arrive shortly after and accost the couple and a shootout ensues. The police end the showdown by beating the couple while a news crew films the action.\nOne year later, the imprisoned Mickey and Mallory are thought to be criminally insane and are scheduled to be transferred to psychiatric hospitals, with Scagnetti overseeing their transfer. Warden Dwight McClusky tells the detective that he should kill the Knoxes during their transfer and claim they had tried to escape. \nMeanwhile, Gale has persuaded Mickey to submit to a live interview that will air after the Super Bowl. During the interview, Mickey declares himself a \"natural born killer\", inspiring the other inmates to start a prison riot. After McClusky terminates the interview, Mickey is left alone with Gale, the film crew and several guards. He manages to overpower a guard and kill most of the people in the room, taking Gale and several others hostage. Gale and his crew give a live television report that profiles the riot. Meanwhile, when Scagnetti attempts to seduce Mallory in her cell, she beats him viciously before another guard subdues her with tear gas. Mickey and Gale reach Mallory's cell, where Mickey kills the guards and engages in a Mexican standoff with Scagnetti before Mallory kills him.\nGale's entire television crew is killed trying to escape the riot, while Gale himself begins indulging in violence, shooting at prison guards. Mickey and Mallory steal a van and escape into the woods with Gale, to whom they give a final interview before declaring that he must die. He attempts various arguments to change their minds, appealing to their trademark practice of leaving one survivor. Mickey informs him that they are leaving a witness to tell the tale: his camera. Gale accepts his fate and is shot to death. Unbeknownst to the three, the entire exchange is transmitted to a horrified news anchor through Gale's in-ear microphone.\nSeveral years later, Mickey and Mallory, still fugitives, travel in an RV, as a pregnant Mallory watches their two children play."

This thematic preoccupation was declared in the film's promotional materials, with its theatrical poster advertising it as a \"bold new film that takes a look at a country seduced by fame, obsessed by crime, and consumed by the media.\"The character of Wayne Gale, the television host of American Maniacs, functions in the film as a figurehead of lurid true crime television documentaries, which recycle real-life incidents of violence and criminal activity into entertainment for the general public. On several occasions, expressionistic jump cuts featuring Gale as a blood-soaked Satan are interspersed into the film, which Muir suggests emphasizes the film's assertion that mass media and crime mutually reinforce one another.Media representation of the nuclear family has been identified as another theme in the film, particularly with the depiction of Mallory's dysfunctional family life, which includes a neglectful mother and a sexually abusive father. Muir notes that the sequence depicting Mallory's home life\u2014presented as a television sitcom with the title I Love Mallory (a parody of I Love Lucy)\u2014charts \"the colossal gulf between the imagery sold to America regarding family life and the truth, for many Americans, of such family life in the 1990s.\" The \"sitcom\" representation of Mallory's household results in a visual dichotomy between her \"life as she imagined it should be (replete with an oppressive laugh track eradicating any scary sense of ambiguity)\" and the \"grim truth of it.\"Ian Cooper wrote that Mickey Knox's prison interview \"parodies Geraldo Rivera's jailhouse interview with [Charles] Manson.\""

        "content": "Evil Dead II (also known in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi, who co-wrote it with Scott Spiegel. The second installment in the Evil Dead film series, it is considered both a remake and sequel (or \"re-quel\") to The Evil Dead (1981). It stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who vacations with his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods. He discovers an audio tape of recitations from a book of ancient texts, and when the recording is played, it unleashes a number of demons which possess and torment him.\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of Crimewave (1985), Raimi, producer Robert Tapert, and Campbell began work on a sequel to The Evil Dead at the insistence of their publicist Irvin Shapiro. Having endorsed the original film, author Stephen King brought the project to the attention of producer Dino De Laurentiis, with whom he had been making his directorial debut Maximum Overdrive (1986). De Laurentiis agreed to provide financial backing, and assigned the filmmakers a considerably larger budget than they had worked with on the original film. Although Raimi had devised a premise set in the Middle Ages and involving time travel, De Laurentiis requested that the film be similar to its predecessor.\nEvil Dead II was shot in Wadesboro, North Carolina and Detroit, Michigan in 1986, and featured extensive stop-motion animation and prosthetic makeup effects created by a team of artists that included Mark Shostrom, Greg Nicotero, Robert Kurtzman and Tom Sullivan, the latter of whom returned from the original film. The finished film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987; due to its high level of violence, it was released through a pseudonymous distributor to curb an anticipated X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Much like The Evil Dead, it was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its humor, Raimi's direction, and Campbell's performance; many have considered it superior to its predecessor and similarly as \none of the greatest horror films ever made. Despite being given a somewhat limited release, it was a minor box office success, grossing just under $6 million.\nAs with the first film, Evil Dead II has accumulated a large, international cult following. In 1992, it was followed by the direct sequel Army of Darkness, which utilized Raimi's original premise; in 2013, it was followed by the soft reboot and continuation Evil Dead; and in 2015, it was followed by the television series Ash vs Evil Dead. A fifth film in the series, Evil Dead Rise, was released on April 21, 2023."

While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of archaeologist Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the \"Book of the Dead\", Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force (also known as the Kandarian Demon) that kills and later possesses Linda, turning her into a \"deadite\". Ash is then forced to decapitate her with a shovel and bury her in a shallow grave near the cabin. At dawn, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. He briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but when day breaks, he is inexplicably returned to normal.\nHe attempts to flee the area but finds that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. The spirit chases him back to the cabin, where Linda's revived head attacks him and bites his hand. He runs to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw, but he overpowers and slashes the deadite Linda to death. His right hand becomes possessed and tries to kill him, and he severs it with the chainsaw before attempting to shoot it with a shotgun, but the hand mocks him and ultimately escapes. Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the Necronomicon, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist repairman Jake and his girlfriend Bobby Joe to show them another route to the cabin, where they find an embattled Ash covered in blood. Thinking that he murdered Annie's parents, Annie and the others lock him in the cellar.\nThe four new arrivals listen to the rest of Knowby's recording, detailing how his wife Henrietta was possessed by the Kandarian Demon, and that he killed her and buried her in the cellar. Henrietta, now a deadite, possesses Ed; Ash dismembers him with an axe. Bobby Joe tries to escape, but demonically possessed trees attack and drag her to her death. Annie translates two of the Necronomicon's pages before Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, forcing them at gunpoint to find Bobby Joe. Ash becomes possessed once again and attacks Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake (mistaking him for the possessed Ash) before Henrietta kills him. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self upon seeing Linda's necklace.\nWith Annie's help, Ash modifies the chainsaw, attaches it to the stump of his right arm, and cuts the shotgun's barrel. After finding the missing pages of the Necronomicon in the cellar, Ash kills Henrietta. The trees outside begin to destroy the cabin. Annie reveals that she has only read the first half of the incantation and attempts to finish the second half. As she reads it, Ash's severed hand uses a Kandarian dagger to stab her in the back. She manages to complete the incantation before succumbing to her wound. The incantation opens up a whirling temporal vortex which not only draws in the demon, but also Ash and his Oldsmobile Delta 88.\nAsh and his Oldsmobile land in the Middle Ages. A group of knights confront him and initially mistake him for a deadite, but are quickly distracted when a real harpy-like deadite appears. Ash blasts it with his shotgun and they hail him as a hero who has come to save them, causing him to break down and scream in anguish."

It was initially met with a lukewarm critical and commercial response in the United States, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Top LPs chart. In the United Kingdom, the album was lauded by critics and reached number 2 on the Record Retailer chart, remaining in the top ten for six months. Promoted there as \"the most progressive pop album ever\", Pet Sounds was recognized for its ambitious production, sophisticated music, and emotional lyrics. It is now considered to be among the greatest and most influential albums in music history.The album was produced, arranged, and almost entirely composed by Brian Wilson with guest lyricist Tony Asher. It was recorded largely between January and April 1966, a year after Wilson had quit touring with his bandmates and debuted a more progressive sound with The Beach Boys Today! Wilson viewed Pet Sounds as effectively a solo album and credited part of its inspiration to marijuana and a newfound spiritual enlightenment. Galvanized by the work of his idol Phil Spector and rival group the Beatles, his goal was to create \"the greatest rock album ever made\", one without filler. An early concept album, it consists mainly of introspective and semi-autobiographical songs like \"You Still Believe in Me\", about a lover's unwavering loyalty; \"I Know There's an Answer\", a critique of LSD users; and \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\", about social alienation.\nIncorporating elements of pop, jazz, exotica, classical, and the avant-garde, Wilson's Wall of Sound\u2013based orchestrations mixed conventional rock set-ups with elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, found sounds, and instruments rarely if ever associated with rock, such as bicycle bells, French horn, flutes, Electro-Theremin, string sections, and soda cans. It marked the most complex instrumental and vocal parts of any Beach Boys album, and the first in which studio musicians (such as the Wrecking Crew) replaced the band on most of the instrumental tracks. The album could not be reproduced live and was the first time that any group departed from their usual small-ensemble pop/rock band format for a whole LP. Its unprecedented total production cost exceeded $70,000 (equivalent to $660,000 in 2023). Lead single \"Caroline, No\" was issued as Wilson's official solo debut. It was followed by two singles credited to the group: \"Sloop John B\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" (backed with \"God Only Knows\").  A planned successor album, Smile, was never finished.\nPet Sounds revolutionized music production and the role of professional record producers, especially through Wilson's pioneering studio-as-instrument praxis. The record contributed to the cultural legitimization of popular music, a greater public appreciation for albums, the popularity of synthesizers, and the development of psychedelic music and progressive/art rock. It also introduced novel approaches to orchestration, chord voicings, and structural harmonies; for example, most of the compositions feature a weak tonal center, rendering their key signatures ambiguous. Although it had been widely revered by industry insiders, the album was obscure to mass audiences before being reissued in the 1990s, after which it topped several critics' and musicians' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by NME, Mojo, Uncut, and The Times. The album has also been consistently ranked number 2 in all editions of Rolling Stone's \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". As a solo artist, Wilson embarked on a string of Pet Sounds concert tours in the early 2000s and late 2010s. In 2004, the album was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Pet Sounds is certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), indicating over one million units sold in the United States. An expanded reissue, The Pet Sounds Sessions, was released in 1997 with isolated vocals and instrumental versions, session highlights, and the album's first true stereo mix."

        "content": "The July 1964 release of the Beach Boys' sixth album All Summer Long marked an end to the group's beach-themed period. From then, their recorded material took a significantly different stylistic and lyrical path. In January 1965, to focus his efforts on writing and recording, 22-year-old Brian Wilson declared to his bandmates that he would not accompany them on concert tours. The rest of the group \u2013 Brian's brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine \u2013 continued to tour without Wilson, who was replaced on the road first by session player Glen Campbell and later by Bruce Johnston of Bruce & Terry and the Rip Chords.Wilson immediately showcased great advances in his musical development with the 1965 albums The Beach Boys Today! and Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!). Released in March, Today! signaled a departure from the Beach Boys' previous records with its orchestral approach, intimate subject matter, and abandonment of themes related to surfing, cars, or superficial expressions of love. Wilson also directed his new lyrical approach toward the autobiographical, with his songs written from the perspective of vulnerable, neurotic, and insecure narrators. Summer Days followed three months later and represented a bridge between Wilson's progressive musical conceptions and the group's traditional pre-1965 approach.On July 12, Wilson recorded a backing track for \"Sloop John B\", but after laying down a rough lead vocal, he set the song aside for some time, concentrating on the recording of what became their next LP, the informal studio jam Beach Boys' Party!, in response to their record company Capitol's request for a Beach Boys album for the Christmas 1965 market. In October, Wilson and his wife, 17-year-old singer Marilyn Rovell, moved from a rented apartment in West Hollywood to a home on Laurel Way in Beverly Hills, where he said he spent the subsequent months contemplating \"the new direction of the group\".Wilson devoted the last three months of 1965 to polishing the vocals of \"Sloop John B\" and recording six new original compositions. \"The Little Girl I Once Knew\", released as a standalone single in November, was the last original Beach Boys song issued before any Pet Sounds tracks. In December, Capitol issued the Party! track \"Barbara Ann\" as a single without the group's knowledge or approval. Brian expressed to reporters that the song was not a \"produced\" record and should not be considered indicative of the group's upcoming music. From January 7 to 29, the rest of the band went away on a concert tour of Japan and Hawaii."

        "content": "While at a recording studio in Los Angeles in 1965, Wilson met Tony Asher, a 26-year-old lyricist and copywriter working in jingles for an advertising agency. The two exchanged ideas for songs, and soon after, Wilson heard of Asher's writing abilities from mutual friend Loren Schwartz. In December, Wilson contacted Asher about a possible lyric collaboration, wanting to do something \"completely different\" with someone he had never written with before. Asher accepted the offer, and within ten days, they were writing together, starting with \"You Still Believe in Me\".Wilson and Asher wrote together over a two-to-three week period at Wilson's home, likely between January and February 1966. A typical writing session started either with Wilson playing a melody or chord patterns that he was working on, by discussing a recent record that Wilson liked the feel of, or by discussing a subject that Wilson had always wanted to write a song about. They referred to their rough musical sketches as \"feels\", per the vernacular of the time. To inspire creativity, they sometimes smoked marijuana together. The lyrics to their songs were finished before the recording of any backing tracks (except for \"You Still Believe in Me\") and recording started virtually as soon as the compositions were written.\n\nAsher maintained that he served mainly as a source of second opinion for Wilson as he worked out possible melodies and chord progressions, although the two did trade ideas as the songs evolved. On his role as co-lyricist, he said, \"The general tenor of the lyrics was always his [...] and the actual choice of words was usually mine. I was really just his interpreter.\" Asher later stated that he made some significant musical contributions to \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\", \"Caroline, No\", and \"That's Not Me\".In Marilyn's recollection, Brian worked on Pet Sounds virtually nonstop, and that when he was home, \"he was either at the piano, arranging, or eating.\" Asher differed, \"I wish I could say Brian was totally committed [to writing the songs]. Let's say he was ... um, very concerned.\" After their songs were completed, Asher visited a few of the recording sessions, most of which were string overdub dates.Wilson wrote two more songs with other collaborators. \"I Know There's an Answer\", which predated the collaboration with Asher, was co-written by Wilson with the Beach Boys' road manager Terry Sachen. In 1994, Mike Love was awarded co-writing credits on \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"I Know There's an Answer\", but with the exception of his co-credit on \"I'm Waiting for the Day\", his songwriting contributions are thought to have been minimal."

        "content": "Pet Sounds is sometimes considered a Brian Wilson solo album, including by Wilson himself, who later referred to it as his \"first solo album\" and \"a chance to step outside the group and shine\". With the exception of Love, who had been previewed tracks over the phone by Wilson, the other members were not consulted on any aspect of the record. When they returned to the studio on February 9, they were presented with a substantial portion of the album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style.According to various reports, the group fought over the new direction. However, Dennis denied that anyone in the group had disliked Pet Sounds, calling the rumors \"interesting\". He said that there was \"not one person in the group that could come close to Brian's talent\" and \"couldn't imagine who\" would have resisted Brian's leadership. Carl supported that such accusations were \"bullshit\" before adding, \"We loved that record. Everybody loved that record, it was a joy to make.\" Jardine differed in his recollection, \"I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change [in music style], but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before.\" He explained that \"it took us quite a while to adjust to [the new material] because it wasn't music you could necessarily dance to\u2014it was more like music you could make love to.\"\nWhatever objections the band members may have had were mostly reserved for the lyrics, not the music itself. Musically, they were concerned about how they would reproduce the songs in concert. Love said that his only disagreement pertained to the original lyrics of \"I Know There's an Answer\", although Jardine remembered that Love was generally \"very confused\" about the album: \"Mike's a formula hound \u2013 if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.\" In defense of Love, Asher said that \"[Mike] never was critical about what [the album] was, he was just saying it wasn't right for the Beach Boys.\" Asher said that Jardine had shared this viewpoint.Brian recalled that the group \"liked [the new music] but they said it was too arty. I said, 'No, it is not!\" Marilyn said that his bandmates struggled \"to understand what he was going through emotionally and what he wanted to create. [...] they didn't feel what he was going through and what direction he was trying to go in.\" Asher remembered, \"All those guys in the band, certainly Al, Dennis, and Mike, were constantly saying, 'What the fuck do these words mean?' or 'This isn't our kind of shit!' Brian had comebacks, though. He'd say, 'Oh, you guys can't hack this.' [...] But I remember thinking that those were tense sessions.\" Notwithstanding such remarks, Asher said that Brian's bandmates never \"really challenged Brian\" on his direction for the group because they had felt \"they weren't talented enough\" to make such judgments.Another concern among his bandmates, according to Brian, was whether he would leave the group and pursue a solo career. Brian said, \"it was generally considered that the Beach Boys were the main thing [...] with Pet Sounds, there was a resistance in that I was doing most of the artistic work on it vocally\". Love wrote in his memoir that he \"would have liked to have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with.\" Brian acknowledged that he had taken up most of the vocals \"because I thought, in a way, I wanted people to know it was more of a Brian Wilson album than a Beach Boys album.\" He said the conflicts were resolved when his bandmates \"figured that it was a showcase for Brian Wilson, but it's still the Beach Boys. In other words, they gave in. They let me have my little stint.\""

A green band header announces the titles of the artist, album, and each track on the LP, partly written in the Cooper Black typeface. Bruce Johnston, who joined the band as an unofficial member one year earlier, does not appear on the front cover due to contractual restraints from Columbia Records. On the reverse side, the sleeve contained a montage of monochrome photos depicting the touring band on-stage and posing in samurai outfits during their tour of Japan, as well as two photos of Brian.Jardine expressed disappointment with the zoo photo and said he had \"wanted a more sensitive and enlightening cover.\" Johnston referred to it as the \"worst cover in the history of the record business\", while author and biographer Peter Ames Carlin opined that the backside of the LP was \"perhaps an even worse design idea than the goat shot\". Author Peter Doggett writes that the design was at odds with the increasingly sophisticated cover portraits used on releases by artists such as the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones over 1965\u201367. He highlights it as \"a warning of what could happen when music and image parted company: songs of high romanticism, an album cover of stark banality.\""

        "content": "Writing in his memoir, Love said that Capitol planned the cover shoot after the company had conceived the would-be album title Our Freaky Friends, with the animals representing the group's \"freaky friends\". When questioned about the cover in 2016, Wilson could not recall who thought of going to the zoo.  Jardine remembered that the Pet Sounds title had already been decided, and that until arriving to the photo shoot, he thought that \"pet\" referred to slang for making out (\"petting\"). He credited Capitol's art department with the idea. Some sources claim that Remember the Zoo was another working title, but the name was actually part of a hoax that had originated from a Beach Boys fanzine in the 1990s.\nThe cover photo was taken on February 10, 1966, by photographer George Jerman. Local reporters from KFMB-TV filmed the shoot. According to a contemporary report by the San Diego Union, the group \"came down from Hollywood to take a cover picture for their forthcoming album Our Freaky Friends. [...] Zoo officials were not keen about having their beloved beasts connected with the title of the album, but gave in when the Beach Boys explained that animals are an 'in' thing with teenagers. And that the Beach Boys were rushing to beat the rock and roll group called The Animals.\" The group was subsequently banned from the zoo, as the staff had accused them of mishandling the animals. Johnston said, \"The goats were horrible! [...] The zoo said we were torturing the animals but they should have seen what we had to go through. We were doing all the suffering.\"A taped conversation from the March 1966 dog barking session for \"Caroline, No\" reveals that Brian considered photographing a horse belonging to Carl in Western Studio 3 for the album cover. Wilson told biographer Byron Preiss that the album was named \"after the dogs [...] That was the whole idea\". Love credited himself with titling the album Pet Sounds, a claim supported by Wilson and Jardine in a 2016 interview. In 1996, Love recalled that he came up with the name while he and his bandmates were standing in the hallway of Western or Columbia studio. He said, \"we didn't have a title. [...] We had taken pictures at the zoo and [...] there were animal sounds on the record, and we were thinking, well, it's our favorite music of that time, so I said, 'Why don't we call it Pet Sounds?'\" Wilson subsequently consulted Asher, who did not have a favorable reaction to the album's title, thinking that the name had \"trivialized what we had accomplished\".In the 1990s, Brian credited Carl with the title. Carl said with uncertainty that the name might have come from Brian: \"The idea he [Brian] had was that everybody has these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.\" Brian commented that the title was a \"tribute\" to Spector by matching his initials (PS). Wilson's 1991 memoir, Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story, writes that the title was inspired by Love asking \"Who's gonna hear this shit? The ears of a dog?\" Asked about this quote in a 2016 interview, Love denied having said it."

Billboard's terse review, published uncharacteristically late, called it an \"exciting, well-produced LP\" with \"two superb instrumental cuts\" and highlighted the \"strong single potential\" of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\". Biographer David Leaf wrote in 1978 that the album received \"scattered\" instances of praise from American reviewers; the group's fans initially considered Pet Sounds too challenging and \"quickly passed the word to 'stay away from the new Beach Boys album, it's weird.'\"By contrast, the reception from music journalists in the UK was highly favorable due in part to the promotional efforts of Taylor, Johnston, and Fowley. Rolling Stone founding editor Jann Wenner later recalled that fans in the UK identified the Beach Boys as being \"years ahead\" of the Beatles and declared Wilson a \"genius\" Penny Valentine of Disc and Music Echo admired Pet Sounds as \"Thirteen tracks of Brian Wilson genius ... The whole LP is far more romantic than the usual Beach Boys jollity: sad little wistful songs about lost love and found love and all-around love.\" Writing in Record Mirror, Norman Jopling reported that the LP had been \"widely praised\" and subjected to \"no criticism\". He prefaced his review as \"unbiased\" and wrote that his only \"real complaint\" with the album was the \"terribly complicated and cluttered\" arrangements. Jopling predicted: \"It will probably make their present fans like them even more, but it's doubtful whether it will make them any new ones.\" A reviewer in Disc and Music Echo disagreed: \"this should gain them thousands of new fans. Instrumentally ambitious, if vocally over-pretty, Pet Sounds has brilliantly tapped the pulse of the musical times. ... A superb, important and really exciting collection from the group whose recording career so far has been a bit of a hotchpotch.\"Melody Maker ran a feature in which many pop musicians were asked whether they believed that the album was truly revolutionary and progressive or \"as sickly as peanut butter\". The author concluded that \"the record's impact on artists and the men behind the artists has been considerable.\" Among the musicians contributing to the 1966 Melody Maker survey: Spencer Davis of the Spencer Davis Group said: \"Brian Wilson is a great record producer. I haven't spent much time listening to the Beach Boys before, but I'm a fan now and I just want to listen to this LP again and again.\" Then a member of Cream, Eric Clapton reported that everyone in his band loved the album, adding that Wilson was \"without doubt a pop genius\". Andrew Loog Oldham told the magazine: \"I think that Pet Sounds is the most progressive album of the year in as much as Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade was. It's the pop equivalent of that, a complete exercise in pop music.\"Three of the nine people who are quoted in the Melody Maker survey (Keith Moon, Manfred Mann's Mike d'Abo, and the Walker Brothers' Scott Walker) did not agree that the album was revolutionary. D'Abo and Walker favored the Beach Boys' earlier work, as did journalist and television presenter Barry Fantoni, who expressed a preference for Beach Boys' Today! and stated that Pet Sounds was \"probably revolutionary, but I'm not sure that everything that's revolutionary is necessarily good\". Pete Townshend of the Who opined that \"the Beach Boys new material is too remote and way out. It's written for a feminine audience.\"In other issues of Melody Maker, Rolling Stones member Mick Jagger stated that he disliked the songs but enjoyed the record and its harmonies, while John Lennon said that Wilson was \"doing some very great things\". At the end of 1966, the magazine crowned Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Revolver as the joint \"Pop Album of the Year\". The paper's spokesman wrote, \"We argued, argued and argued and still the MM pop panel couldn't agree which was the Pop Album of the Year. The voting was evenly divided [...] Cups of coffee were drunk and sheets of paper were torn up before we finally agreed to compromise and vote for both The Beatles and Beach Boys on top.\""

        "content": "Wilson later said that despite the positive reception afforded to the album in Britain, he felt deeply hurt when Pet Sounds did not sell as highly as he expected and interpreted the poor sales as the public's rejection of his artistry. Marilyn supported that the lackluster response \"really destroyed Brian\" before adding: \"He just lost a lot of faith in people and music. [...] then when people would talk about it later, tell him how great it was, even if it was just a year later, he didn't want to hear about it. It reminded him of failing. And then he was more tortured.\" Carl remembered Brian's disappointment and said that the album was \"so much more than a record [...] it was like going to church and a labor of love.\"Asher had a different recollection, saying that neither he nor Brian had valued Pet Sounds as a \"masterpiece\" at the time. He explained, \"I was more impressed by the production really. To me it was just a great album, and [...] a chance to show some people like my parents, and the guys at the advertising company, that rock music could be [...] a mature medium.\" Taylor recalled in 1975 that Wilson was unperturbed by the album's poor sales and had been more preoccupied with besting his rivals \u2013 namely, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones \u2013 on an artistic front.\nIn mid-1966, Brian began writing songs with lyricist Van Dyke Parks for a new album, Smile, that was never finished but would have included \"Good Vibrations\". Wilson touted the album as a \"teenage symphony to God\" that would have surpassed Pet Sounds. During the project's sessions, Wilson revisited the idea of a psychedelic comedy album, previously explored with the \"Dick\" and \"Fuzz\" outtakes from Pet Sounds. In October, \"Good Vibrations\" was issued as a single and became an immediate worldwide hit.As Wilson's mental health deteriorated, his involvement with the Beach Boys reduced, and the group instead released follow-up records that were less ambitious and largely ignored by critics. Wilson referred to the band's 1968 release Friends as his second \"solo album\", following Pet Sounds. It was a commercial failure and, in the words of a Mojo writer, caused the band's fanbase to lose \"any hope that Brian Wilson would deliver a true successor to [Pet Sounds]\".The 1977 album The Beach Boys Love You saw Wilson's brief reemergence as the group's principal songwriter and singer. Wilson regarded Love You as a spiritual successor to Pet Sounds, namely because of the autobiographical lyrics. In 1988, Wilson released his first solo album, Brian Wilson, which was an attempt to recapture the sensibilities of Pet Sounds, such that co-producer Russ Titelman touted the album as Pet Sounds '88. It included \"Baby Let Your Hair Grow Long\", a sequel to \"Caroline, No\".The Beach Boys, accompanied by Timothy B. Schmit, re-recorded \"Caroline, No\" with a new multi-part vocal arrangement for the 1996 album Stars and Stripes Vol. 1. Shortly after that album, there were tentative plans for what biographer Mark Dillon nicknamed \"Pet Sounds, Vol. 2\", an album that would have involved the band teaming with Sean O'Hagan, leader of the avant-pop band the High Llamas. Although many record companies expressed interest in the project, it never progressed past the planning stages. In the late 1990s, Wilson and Asher rekindled their writing partnership and wrote at least four songs together. Only two were released: \"This Isn't Love\" and \"Everything I Need\"."

Other songs were performed, albeit sporadically and infrequently through the years, and the album was never performed in its entirety with every original group member. In the late 1990s, Carl Wilson vetoed an offer for the Beach Boys to perform Pet Sounds in full for ten shows, reasoning that the studio arrangements were too complex for the stage, and that Brian could not possibly sing his original parts.As a solo artist, Brian performed the entire album live in 2000 with a different orchestra in each venue, and on three occasions without orchestra on his 2002 tour. The concerts received favorable reviews, however, critics focused on Wilson's \"trancelike\" demeanor and odd interview responses. Recordings from Wilson's 2002 concert tour were released as Brian Wilson Presents Pet Sounds Live. Rolling Stone's Dorian Lynskey says that the shows helped establish the now-ubiquitous practice of artists playing \"classic albums\" in their entirety.In 2013, Wilson performed the album at two shows, unannounced, also with Jardine as well as original Beach Boys guitarist David Marks. In 2016, Wilson performed the album at several events in Australia, Japan, Europe, Canada and the United States. The tour was planned as his final performances of the album, but occasional shows were performed through 2020.

The edition was prepared from the original 1966 mono master, by Mark Linett, who used Sonic Solutions' No Noise processing to mitigate damage that the physical master had accrued. It became one of the first CDs to sell more than a million copies.\nIn 1995, DCC issued a 20-bit audiophile version that was mastered by engineer Steve Hoffman. It was created from a safety copy of the original master. According to Granata, this version \"garnered numerous accolades, and some feel it comes closest to capturing the spirit and punch of Brian's original 1966 mix.\"\nIn 1997, The Pet Sounds Sessions was released as a four-disc box set. It included the original mono release of Pet Sounds, the album's first stereo mix (created by Linett and Wilson), backing tracks, isolated vocals, and session highlights. It was received with controversy among audiophiles who felt that a stereo mix of Pet Sounds was sacrilege against the original mono recording.\nIn 2001, Pet Sounds was issued with mono and \"improved\" stereo versions, plus \"Hang On to Your Ego\" as a bonus track, all on one disc.\nOn August 29, 2006, Capitol released a 40th Anniversary edition, containing a new 2006 remaster of the original mono mix, DVD mixes (stereo and Surround Sound), and a \"making of\" documentary. The discs were released in a regular jewel box and a deluxe edition was released in a green fuzzy box. A two-disc colored gatefold vinyl set was released with green (stereo) and yellow (mono) discs.\nIn 2016, a 50th anniversary edition box set presented the remastered album in both stereo and mono forms alongside studio sessions outtakes, alternate mixes, and live recordings. Of the 104 tracks, only 14 were previously unreleased.\nIn 2023, a Dolby Atmos remix was created by Giles Martin, who closely followed Linett's 1996 stereo mix."

The events are based on Ambrose's research and recorded interviews with Easy Company veterans. The series took some literary license, adapting history for dramatic effect and series structure. The characters portrayed are based on members of Easy Company. Each episode begins with excerpts from interviews with some of the survivors, who are identified by name only at the end of the finale.\nThe title of the book and series comes from the St Crispin's Day Speech in William Shakespeare's play Henry V, delivered by King Henry before the Battle of Agincourt. Ambrose quotes a passage from the speech on his book's first page; this passage is spoken by Carwood Lipton in the series finale."

        "content": "Over the course of ten episodes, Band of Brothers depicts a dramatized account of Easy Company's exploits during World War II.Episodes include their training at Camp Toccoa, the American airborne landings in Normandy, Operation Market Garden, the Siege of Bastogne, the invasion of Germany, the liberation of the Kaufering concentration camp, the taking of the Kehlsteinhaus (Eagle's Nest) in Berchtesgaden, the occupation of Germany, and finally the war's end.Richard Winters is the central character, shown working to accomplish the company's missions and keep his men together and safe. While the series features a large ensemble cast, each episode generally focuses on a single character, following his action.As the series is based on historical events, the fates of the characters reflect those of the persons on which they are based. Many either die or sustain serious wounds which lead to their being sent home. Other soldiers recover after treatment in field hospitals and rejoin their units on the front line. Their experiences, and the moral, mental, and physical hurdles they must overcome, are central to the story's narrative.\nIt follows the story from their initial training starting in 1942 to the end of World War II. They parachuted behind enemy lines in the early hours of D-Day in support of the landings at Utah beach, participated in the liberation of Carentan and again parachuted into action during Operation Market Garden. They also liberated a concentration camp and were the first to enter Hitler's mountain retreat in Berchtesgaden."

        "content": "Pinocchio is a 1940 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Based on Carlo Collodi's 1883 Italian children's novel The Adventures of Pinocchio, it is the studio's second animated feature film, as well as the third animated film overall produced by an American film studio, after Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Fleischer Studios' Gulliver's Travels (1939). With the voices of Cliff Edwards, Dickie Jones, Christian Rub, Walter Catlett, Charles Judels, Evelyn Venable, and Frankie Darro, the film follows a wooden puppet, Pinocchio, who is created by an old woodcarver, Geppetto, and brought to life by a blue fairy. Wishing to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself to be \"brave, truthful, and unselfish.\" Along his journey, Pinocchio encounters several characters representing the temptations and consequences of wrongdoing, as a cricket named Jiminy, who takes the role of Pinocchio's conscience, attempts to guide him in matters of right and wrong.\nThe film was adapted by several storyboard artists from Collodi's book. The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske, and the film's sequences were directed by Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, and Bill Roberts. Pinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles and machinery as well as natural elements such as rain, water, lightning, smoke, and shadow. After premiering at the Center Theatre in New York City on February 7, 1940, Pinocchio was released in theatres on February 23, 1940.\nAlthough it received critical acclaim and became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award \u2014 winning two for Best Music, Original Score and for Best Music, Original Song for \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" \u2014 it was initially a commercial failure, mainly due to World War II cutting off the European and Asian markets. It eventually made a profit after its 1945 rerelease, and is considered one of the greatest animated films ever made, with a 100% rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes. The film and characters are still prevalent in popular culture, featuring at various Disney parks and other forms of entertainment. In 1994, Pinocchio was added to the United States National Film Registry for being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"In 2000, a live-action made-for-television film titled Geppetto, told from Geppetto's perspective, was released via ABC. A live-action remake of the same title directed by Robert Zemeckis was released in 2022 on Disney+."

        "content": "Jiminy Cricket addresses the audience as the narrator and begins telling a story.\nJiminy came to a village in Italy sometime in the late 19th century, where he arrived at the shop of a woodworker and toymaker named Geppetto, who creates a puppet he names Pinocchio. As he falls asleep, Geppetto wishes upon a star for Pinocchio to be a real boy. Late that night, the Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself to be brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy. When Jiminy reveals himself, the Blue Fairy assigns him to be Pinocchio's conscience. Geppetto awakens upon hearing the commotion from Pinocchio falling, and is overjoyed to discover that he is alive and will become a real boy.\nThe next morning, while walking to school, Pinocchio is led astray by con artist fox Honest John and his sidekick Gideon the Cat. Honest John convinces him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction, but when he tries to go home, Stromboli locks him in a bird cage and leaves to tour the world with Pinocchio. After Jiminy unsuccessfully tries to free his friend, the Blue Fairy appears, and an anxious Pinocchio lies about what happened, causing his nose to grow. The Blue Fairy restores his nose and frees Pinocchio when he promises to make amends, but warns him that she can offer no further help.\nMeanwhile, a mysterious Coachman hires Honest John to find disobedient boys for him to take to Pleasure Island. Though the Coachman's implication of what happens to the boys frightens Honest John and Gideon, the former reluctantly accepts the job and finds Pinocchio, convincing him to take a vacation on Pleasure Island. On the way to the island, Pinocchio befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. At Pleasure Island, without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio, Lampwick, and many other boys soon engage in vices such as vandalism, fighting, smoking and drinking. Jiminy eventually finds Pinocchio in a billiard hall smoking and playing pool with Lampwick, and the two have a falling out after Pinocchio defends Lampwick for his actions. As Jiminy tries to leave Pleasure Island, he discovers that the island hides a horrible curse that turns the boys into donkeys after they make \"jackasses\" of themselves, and they are sold by the Coachman into slave labor. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick transform into a donkey, and with Jiminy's help, he escapes before he can be fully transformed, though he still has a donkey's ears and tail.\nUpon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find Geppetto\u2019s workshop deserted and get a letter from the Blue Fairy in the form of a dove, stating that Geppetto went out looking for Pinocchio and sailed to Pleasure Island. However, he was swallowed by a gigantic and vicious sperm whale called Monstro and is now trapped in its belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the ocean with Jiminy and is soon swallowed by Monstro, where he reunites with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze and allow them to escape, but the whale chases them and smashes their raft with his tail. Pinocchio selflessly pulls Geppetto to safety in a cove just as Monstro crashes into it, but Pinocchio dies in the process.\nBack at home, Geppetto, Jiminy, Figaro, and Cleo mourn Pinocchio. However, having succeeded in proving himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, Pinocchio is revived and turned into a real human boy by the Blue Fairy, much to everyone's joy. As the group celebrates, Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience."

        "content": "M. Keith Booker considers the film to be the most down-to-earth of the Disney animated films despite its theme song and magic, and notes that the film's protagonist has to work to prove his worth, which he remarked seemed \"more in line with the ethos of capitalism\" than most of the Disney films. Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh believe that the male protagonists of films like Pinocchio and Bambi (1942) were purposefully constructed by Disney to appeal to both boys and girls. Mark I. Pinsky said that it is \"a simple morality tale\u2014cautionary and schematic\u2014ideal for moral instruction, save for some of its darker moments\", and noted that the film is a favorite of parents of young children.Nicolas Sammond argues that the film is \"an apt metaphor for the metaphysics of midcentury American child-rearing\" and that the film is \"ultimately an assimilationist fable\". He considered it to be the central Disney film and the most strongly middle class, intended to relay the message that indulging in \"the pleasures of the working class, of vaudeville, or of pool halls and amusement parks, led to a life as a beast of burden\". For Sammond, the purpose of Pinocchio is to help convey to children the \"middle-class virtues of deferred gratification, self-denial, thrift, and perseverance, naturalized as the experience of the most average American\".Author and illustrator Maurice Sendak, who saw the film in theaters in 1940, called the film superior to Collodi's novel in its depiction of children and growing up. \"The Pinocchio in the film is not the unruly, sulking, vicious, devious (albeit still charming) marionette that Collodi created. Neither is he an innately evil, doomed-to-calamity child of sin. He is, rather, both lovable and loved. Therein lies Disney's triumph. His Pinocchio is a mischievous, innocent and very naive little wooden boy. What makes our anxiety over his fate endurable is a reassuring sense that Pinocchio is loved for himself -- and not for what he should or shouldn't be. Disney has corrected a terrible wrong. Pinocchio, he says, is good; his \"badness\" is only a matter of inexperience,\" and also that \"Pinocchio's wish to be a real boy remains the film's underlying theme, but \"becoming a real boy\" now signifies the wish to grow up, not the wish to be good.\"Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson has spoken about the film in his lectures extensively, citing it as an example of \"the manner in which great mythological and archetypal themes inform and permeate narrative.\""

Part 2 draws parallels between the impact of the printing press and the internet in terms of making information accessible beyond a privileged group or \"controllers\". The argument is made that the decentralised nature of the internet makes the enforcement of conventional copyright impossible.

During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that he returned to the studios to record new songs, stating \"I didn't want that to be the way my record was remembered or the way I would present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better\" while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site were not going to be included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is \"practically a new album\". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001."

The album's production was handled by several producers including The Neptunes, P. Diddy, Jermaine Dupri\u2014who had produced the majority of Usher's previous album, My Way\u2014Babyface, Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs, Mike City, Bryan Michael Cox and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Both Jam and Lewis were asked by Usher's mother, and then manager, to contribute to 8701's production, during the 2000 MTV Music Awards. According to Jam, his mother had said \"Oh my God, Usher's got this track and we thought you guys would be perfect to produce it\". Several months later, Jam and Lewis produced the song \"Separated\", along with multi-platinum producers Ric Atari & Daron Jones (who also wrote the record) to which the producers then turned in to L.A. Reid, who liked the track, and asked them to produce more. Following this, Usher asked both producers to create a song similar to their 1985 \"Tender Love\", performed by R&B vocal group Force MDs. Though he wanted it to be his own unique record, which contains a small similarity, to which Jam and Lewis created \"Can U Help Me\". Following the completion of 8701, Jam and Lewis were sent back to the studio by Reid to revamp the album's second single \"U Remind Me\", explaining \"we already know he can dance, and he's got the style and that whole thing. But I want people to just go, he can sing."

There's a little bit of all of that in the album. I really appreciate what music was back then as well as in the early '90s when you had artists like Troop and Jodeci, and Michael Jackson was in his prime.\" Usher explained that the album's lyrics also reflect on what has been going on with his relationship; 8701 is predominantly an R&B album. \"Can U Help Me\", is about a deep relationship to which Usher experienced. \"U Don't Have to Call\" is a hip hop song inspired by Jackson, while \"U Got It Bad\" is an R&B slow-jam. About \"U Got It Bad\", Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that it makes use of the acoustic guitar and a \"slow-burning bassline\" throughout. The album's lead single \"U Remind Me\" is also an R&B track, and its lyrics is based on meeting a woman who reminds Usher of an ex-girlfriend, and therefore cannot date her."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 11 reviews. NME's Lucy O'Brien commended Usher for producing a more mature album, that \"reflects his emotional experience\" writing \"Versatility is the key here: staccato beats with mellifluous melody, rich slow-jams and edgy harmonies \u2013 but woven through with Usher's own perspective. A winner.\" BBC Online's Christian Hopwood also favoured the album, commenting on how Usher has developed \"his producing, singing and song writing skills to a new level\" noting his contribution to twelve of the seventeen tracks. Dan Leroy of Yahoo! Music declared the album an improvement \"over Usher's \"old\" new album\"\u2014All About You\u2014and depicted it as his best work to-date. Leroy credited the production groups The Neptunes and Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, depicting that they have done \"some of their best work\" on the album. J. D. Considine of Blender commented that the album \"does what it's supposed to, giving Usher a grown-up R&B sound without reducing his boyish charm\". Kathryn McGuire of Rolling Stone described Usher's vocals as \"velvety\" and further wrote that \"Amid all the playboy pouting and preening, Usher's vocals are impressively adaptable [...]. McGuire noted the album's primary fault is that \"Usher never surrenders his meticulously groomed veneer\", with every track being formulaic, or \"radio-safe\".Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted the distinction between several of the album's songs with Janet Jackson's, while comparing Usher's vocals to that of another Jackson member, Michael Jackson \"[...] bring out the other Jackson in Usher, bolstering falsetto vocal bridges on \"I Don't Know\" and \"U Don't Have to Call\" that are undeniably Pop Royalty.\" Vibe's Jason King complimented some of the material on the album, but was disappointed with the \"heavyweight producers\" not producing any \"masterpieces\". Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic gave a positive opinion on Usher's development, writing \"He looks good, his material is smooth and seductive, and he has a nice voice, even if he tends to favor melisma\". Erlewine also labelled the album as \"a classy, seductive affair\" but was ambivalent towards its material, due to the lack of memorable tracks. Entertainment Weekly's Josh Tyrangiel said that the tracks \"blend harmlessly together\", but was ambivalent towards the quality of the songs produced after Usher's four-year hiatus."

The television series was filmed in and around the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The series premiered on Showtime on July 27, 1997, and moved to the Sci Fi Channel on June 7, 2002; the final episode first aired on Sky1 on March 13, 2007.\nThe story of Stargate SG-1 begins about a year after the events of the feature film when the United States government learns that an ancient alien device called the Stargate can access a network of such devices on a multitude of planets and in space. SG-1 is an elite United States Air Force special operations team, one of about 20 teams from Earth who explore the galaxy and defend against alien threats such as the Goa'uld, the Replicators and the Ori. The series draws upon Egyptian, Greek and Norse mythology, as well as the legend of King Arthur.\nThe series was a ratings success for its first-run broadcasters and in syndication and was particularly popular in Europe and Australia. Stargate SG-1's awards include eight Emmy nominations.  It also spawned the animated television series Stargate Infinity, the live-action spin-off TV series Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe, and Stargate Origins and the direct-to-DVD films Stargate: The Ark of Truth and Stargate: Continuum.

SG-1 and a dozen other SG teams venture to distant planets using an alien portal known as a Stargate, which in the series is housed in a top-secret United States Air Force military base known as Stargate Command (SGC) in the underground Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In the first eight seasons, the mission of the SG teams is to explore the galaxy and search for alien technology and allies to defend Earth against the Goa'uld, a snake-like parasitic alien race from planet P3X-888 that takes humans as unwilling hosts. As explained in the series' backstory, the Goa'uld had transported human slaves from Earth to other habitable planets across the galaxy thousands of years ago and now pose as gods of old Earth mythologies, particularly Ancient Egypt. SG-1 eventually learns that highly evolved human-like beings, known as the Ancients, had originally built the Stargate network millions of years earlier, before ascending to a higher plane of existence, after which they pledged not to interfere in the lives of other species. The Ori, a faction of the same race as the Ancients who instead use their powers to subjugate other species by religious indoctrination, assume the role of the main antagonists in Season 9 and Season 10."

He is coaxed out of retirement in the pilot episode and serves as the leader of the SG-1 team in the first seven seasons. He takes charge of Stargate Command (SGC) after his promotion to brigadier general at the beginning of Season 8. The series repeatedly alludes to romantic feelings between O'Neill and his second-in-command, Carter, but the relationship is never shown as consummated outside alternate reality scenarios. O'Neill is reassigned to Washington, D.C. before Season 9 and receives a promotion to major general. He appears in a recurring role in Seasons 9 and 10 of Stargate SG-1, as well as in Stargate: Continuum and in Seasons 1 and 3 of Stargate Atlantis.

He joins the SG-1 team to facilitate his search for his wife, who was kidnapped by Apophis in the pilot episode, but his na\u00efvet\u00e9 and curiosity regularly create obstacles for the team. He gradually evolves from being an archaeologist and translator, into the moral conscience for the team, and remains part of SG-1 until he ascends to a higher plane of existence at the end of Season 5. Following his forced de-ascension at the beginning of Season 7, he rejoins SG-1 for the remainder of the series. The last three seasons show his flirty, yet antagonistic relationship with Vala Mal Doran.

        "content": "Stargate SG-1 takes place in a military science fiction environment and employs the common science fiction concepts of strongly differentiated characters fighting an unequivocally evil enemy (the Goa'uld). However, it links alien races with well-known Earth mythologies, by use of the central Stargate device. Near-instantaneous interplanetary travel allows quick narrative shifts between the politics on Earth and the realities of fighting an interstellar war. Stargate SG-1 gradually evolves the basic premise of the Stargate film into its own unique mythological superstructure, expanding upon Egyptian mythology (notably the gods Apep/Apophis and Anubis as Goa'uld villains), Norse mythology (notably the god Thor as an Asgard ally) and Arthurian legend (notably Merlin as an Ancient ally against the god-like Ori), among others. SG-1 introduces new alien races (as opposed to alien human civilizations) less often than other science fiction television series and integrates newly encountered races or visited planets in stand-alone episodes into its established mythology while leaving the plotlines accessible for new audience members. Despite the show's extensive intergalactic mythology and science fiction elements, scholar M. Keith Booker considered SG-1 ultimately character-driven and heavily dependent on the camaraderie among the SG-1 members.The producers embraced humor and wanted SG-1 to be a fun show that did not take itself too seriously. Brad Wright regarded SG-1 as a family show with adequate violence as opposed to random or gratuitous violence. Christopher Judge did not consider SG-1 as a \"message show by any stretch of the imagination, but occasionally there are messages there\". Aimed at a popular audience, Stargate SG-1 emphasized its present-day-Earth story frame by frequently referring to popular culture, like The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer had done before. Jonathan Glassner had written The Wizard of Oz references into his own scripts since the first season, which the other writers imitated after Richard Dean Anderson began referring to the film on his own. O'Neill refers to Richard Dean Anderson's favorite television series, The Simpsons, throughout the show. SG-1 makes meta-textual references to the process of writing and filming a science fiction TV series in several episodes and alludes to the main actors' previous TV roles in the pilot episode (Carter: \"It took us fifteen years and three supercomputers to MacGyver a system for the gate on Earth\") and in a Farscape vignette in the milestone episode \"200\"."

Based very loosely on the \"Mowgli\" stories from Rudyard Kipling's 1894 book of the same title, it is the final animated feature film to be produced by Walt Disney, who died during its production. It was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman and written by Larry Clemmons, Ralph Wright, Ken Anderson, and Vance Gerry. Featuring the voices of Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, George Sanders, Sterling Holloway, J. Pat O'Malley, and Bruce Reitherman, the film's plot follows Mowgli, a feral child raised in the Indian jungle by wolves, as his friends, Bagheera the panther and Baloo the bear, try to convince him to leave the jungle before the ruthless tiger Shere Khan arrives.\nThe early versions of both the screenplay and the soundtrack followed Kipling's work more closely, with a dramatic, dark, and sinister tone, which Disney did not want in his family film, leading to writer Bill Peet and songwriter Terry Gilkyson being replaced.\nThe Jungle Book was released on October 18, 1967, to positive reception, with acclaim for its soundtrack, featuring five songs by the Sherman Brothers and one by Gilkyson, \"The Bare Necessities\". With a gross of $23.8 million worldwide, the film initially became Disney's second-highest-grossing animated film in the United States and Canada, the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1967, and was also successful during its re-releases. The film was also successful throughout the world, becoming Germany's highest-grossing film by number of admissions. Disney released a live-action adaptation in 1994 and an animated sequel, The Jungle Book 2, in 2003; a live-action/CGI hybrid remake directed by Jon Favreau was released in 2016, with a sequel to that film in development."

She and her mate, Rama, raise him along with their own cubs, and after ten years, Mowgli becomes well acquainted with jungle life and plays with his wolf siblings. Bagheera is pleased with how happy Mowgli is now but also worries that Mowgli must eventually return to his own kind.\nOne night, the pack elders meet at Council Rock, having learned that Shere Khan, a Bengal tiger, has returned to the pack's part of the jungle. Pack leader Akela decides that Mowgli must leave the jungle for his own safety and the safety of those around him; Shere Khan possesses an intense hatred of humans due to his fear of guns and fire. Bagheera volunteers to escort him to a nearby \"Man-Village\". They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle. He and Bagheera rest in a tree for the night, where Kaa, a hungry Indian python, hypnotizes Mowgli into a deep sleep and tries to devour him, but Bagheera intervenes. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol led by Colonel Hathi and his wife Winifred. Bagheera finds Mowgli but after a fight, decides to leave Mowgli on his own. Mowgli soon meets up with the laid-back, fun-loving sloth bear Baloo, who promises to raise Mowgli himself and never take him to the Man Village.\nShortly afterward, a group of monkeys kidnap Mowgli and take him to their leader, King Louie the orangutan, who offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle in exchange for teaching him how to make fire. However, since he wasn\u2019t raised by humans, Mowgli does not know how. Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli, and in the ensuing chaos, Louie's palace is demolished to rubble. Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli with Shere Khan around. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for him, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol. However, Shere Khan, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli.\nMeanwhile, Mowgli has another encounter with Kaa, who once again, attempts to eat him after hypnotizing him into a deep sleep but he eventually wakes up and escapes thanks to the unwitting intervention of the suspicious Shere Khan. As a storm gathers in a desolate area of the jungle, a depressed Mowgli encounters a group of friendly vultures who accept Mowgli as a fellow outcast. Shere Khan appears shortly after, scaring off the vultures and confronting Mowgli. Baloo arrives and haplessly tries to keep him from hurting Mowgli, getting knocked unconscious in the process. When lightning strikes a nearby tree and sets it ablaze, the vultures swoop in to distract Shere Khan, while Mowgli grabs a large flaming branch and ties it to his tail. Shere Khan, seeing this, panics and runs away.\nAfterward, Bagheera and Baloo take Mowgli to the edge of the Man-Village, but Mowgli is still hesitant to go there. However, his mind abruptly changes when he is smitten by a beautiful young girl from the village who is coming down by the riverside to fetch water. After noticing Mowgli, she \"accidentally\" drops her water pot. Mowgli retrieves it for her and follows her into the Man-Village. After Mowgli shrugs to Baloo and Bagheera, to show that he has made up his mind and chosen to go to the Man-Village, Baloo and Bagheera decide to head home, content that Mowgli is safe and happy with his own kind."

        "content": "Since its original release in 1967, The Jungle Book has been widely acclaimed by the animation industry, with animators such as Brad Bird, Andreas Deja, Glen Keane, and Sergio Pablos citing the film to be their inspiration for entering the business; Eric Goldberg also declared that the film \"boasts possibly the best character animation a studio has ever done.\" The character design and art direction of The Jungle Book heavily influenced the animators of Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Tarzan (1999), and Lilo & Stitch (2002) in creating animal characters for each of these films. Elements of The Jungle Book were recycled in the later Disney feature film, Robin Hood (1973), such as Baloo being inspiration for Little John (who not only was a bear, but also voiced by Phil Harris); in particular, the dance sequence between Baloo and King Louie was rotoscoped for Little John and Lady Cluck's dance.In 1968, Jimmy Johnson approached Larry Clemmons to write a sequel to The Jungle Book for a story-telling records; the album, titled More Jungle Book\u2026 Further Adventures Of Baloo And Mowgli, was released by Disneyland Records the following year, with Phil Harris and Louis Prima reprising their film roles. In 2003, DisneyToon Studios released a theatrical sequel to the original film, The Jungle Book 2; screenwriter Robert Reece also pitched the idea of a third film to Disney executives in 2005, but the project never materialized.In 1978, a live-action sketch titled The Wonderful World of Ernie from Morecambe and Wise parodied I Wan'na Be Like You (The Monkey Song) by doing a full reenactment of the scene with sets and costumes and lip-synching to the song's original recording (including the characters' spoken dialogue in the middle of the song). The sketch starred Danny Rolnick as Mowgli, Derek Griffiths as Bagheera, Eric Morecambe as Baloo and Ernie Wise as King Louie.Many characters appear in the 1990\u201391 animated series TaleSpin. Between 1996 and 1998, the TV series Jungle Cubs told the stories of Baloo, Hahti, Bagheera, Louie, Kaa, and Shere Khan when they were children. Disney later made a live-action adaptation of the film, which was more of a realistic action-adventure film with somewhat-more adult themes. The film, released in 1994, differs even more from the book than its animated counterpart, but was still a box-office success. In 1998, Disney released a direct to video film entitled The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story. A new live-action version of The Jungle Book was released by Disney in 2016, which even reused most of the songs of the animated film, with some lyrical reworking by original composer Richard M. Sherman.There are two video games based on the film: The Jungle Book was a platformer released in 1993 for Master System, Mega Drive, Game Gear, Super NES, Game Boy and PC. A version for the Game Boy Advance was later released in 2003. The Jungle Book Groove Party was a dance mat game released in 2000 for PlayStation and PlayStation 2. Kaa and Shere Khan have also made cameo appearances in another Disney video game, QuackShot. A world based on the film was intended to appear more than once in the Square Enix-Disney Kingdom Hearts video game series, but was omitted both times, first in the first game because it featured a similar world based on Tarzan, and second in Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, although areas of the world are accessible via hacking codes. Baloo and Mowgli appear as interactive characters in Adventureland on Kinect: Disneyland Adventures released in 2011 and re-released in 2017. Mowgli, Bagheera, Baloo, Shere Khan and King Louie appear as playable characters in the video game Disney Magic Kingdoms. Baloo appears as a playable character in Disney Mirrorverse released in 2022. Baloo and Mowgli appear as a playable characters in the kart racing game Disney Speedstorm released in 2022. Since the film's release, many of the film's characters appeared in House of Mouse, The Lion King 1\u00bd, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Aladdin and the King of Thieves. In December 2010, a piece of artwork by British artist Banksy featuring The Jungle Book characters which had been commissioned by Greenpeace to help raise awareness of deforestation went on sale for the sum of \u00a380,000."

Mom and Dad is considered the most successful film within its genre of \"sex hygiene\" films. Although it faced numerous legal challenges and was condemned by the National Legion of Decency, it became one of the highest-grossing films of the 1940s.\nThe film is regarded as an exploitation film as it was repackaged controversial content designed to establish an educational value that might circumvent U.S. censorship laws. Babb's marketing of his film incorporated old-style medicine show techniques, and used unique promotions to build an audience. These formed a template for his later works, which were imitated by his contemporary filmmakers. In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The Academy Film Archive preserved Mom and Dad in 2010."

After being sweet-talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. Joan requests \"hygiene books\" from her mother, Sarah Blake (Lois Austin); however, the mother refuses because the daughter is not yet married. Joan later learns from her father, Dan Blake (George Eldredge), that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission.\nThe film resumes at the point when Joan discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair. She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn (Hardie Albright), who had previously been fired for teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and accuses her of \"neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth.\" Only then is Joan able to confront her mother.The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the female anatomy and footage of live births \u2013 one natural and one Caesarian.  In some screenings, a second film was shown along with Mom and Dad, and contained images portraying syphilis and venereal disease.  Mom and Dad is believed to have had a number of endings, although most typically concluded with the birth of the young woman's child, sometimes stillborn and other times put up for adoption."

Having attended a meeting in Burkburnett, Texas, that discussed the alleged impregnations of young women by G.I.s from nearby Sheppard Air Force Base, Babb was inspired to shoot a film based on the subject.  His future wife Mildred Horn drafted a screenplay which later evolved into Mom and Dad. Babb located 20 investors willing to fund the movie, and hired William Beaudine as director.Production of the film cost Babb and his investors a total of $67,001.12. The movie was shot in five separate studios over six days in 1944, and was spread across various Monogram Pictures lots; co-producer J. S. Jossey was a Monogram stockholder. On January 3, 1945, Mom and Dad premiered at the Warner Bros. theatre in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.The plot is padded with a large amount of filler.  Films of this type were usually produced quickly and at minimal cost, and while filler was sometimes used to increase the production value, the usual motivation was to extend its running time to qualify for feature length status.  Eric Schaefer notes that the \"primary purpose\" of the plot of Mom and Dad  was to \"serve as the vehicle onto which the spectacle of the clinical reels can be grafted\", such as the live birth scene.  The marketing materials suggest the latter reason also, and many posters for the film promised that \"You [will] actually SEE the birth of a baby!\"  The dialogue is carefully worded, and uses period euphemisms rather than explicit terms that may have been controversial at the time.  In particular, at no time does the film specifically mention sexual intercourse or pregnancy."

        "content": "In a Washington Post article covering Babb's career, the film critic Kenneth Turan wrote that Mom and Dad did not \"flourish because of its birth footage or because of its puerile plot, which Babb himself disparages ... [its] success flowed, rather, from Babb's extraordinary promotional abilities.\"  The film was exhibited across the United States, and over 300 prints were produced. In the weeks preceding the screening, local presenters sought to attract the attention of the town's inhabitants by distributing letters to local newspapers and church leaflets protesting against the film's moral basis. This strategy often utilized fabricated letters supposedly written by the mayor of a nearby city, who wished to register concern about local young women in his area who had seen the film and were awakened enough to discuss problems similar to ones of their own.The campaigns were usually orchestrated by employees of either Hygienic or Hallmark Productions, and they nominally based their campaign from information provided by a standard and detailed pressbook containing cast and crew information, as well as other promotional and marketing materials. Babb's marketing strategy centered on overwhelming small towns with advertisements and letters, in an attempt to create a controversial atmosphere. In keeping with his motto of \"You gotta tell 'em to sell 'em,\" the film became so ubiquitous that Time wrote that its presentation \"left only the livestock unaware of the chance to learn the facts of life.\"\nThe local pitch included a variety of limited screenings, including adults-only showings, viewings segregated by gender, and a live lecture by the \"Fearless Hygiene Commentator Elliot Forbes\" which was often placed during the intermission. At any one time, a number of \"Elliot Forbes\"es would give simultaneous talks in a number of locations showing the film. In some predominantly African-American areas, Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens was hired to make appearances instead of an actor playing Forbes. The \"Elliot Forbes\" actors were usually people local to the production company, sometimes out-of-work performers.  Along with \"Forbes\", presentations were often held with \"nurses\" in attendance, ostensibly in the event that someone fainted due to the content of the film; such \"nurses\" were often hired locally.Modern Film Distributors later distributed the film, and sold over forty-five thousand copies of the books Man and Boy and Woman and Girl following Forbes's lecture. The text was written by Babb's wife, and was filled with both biological and sexual education materials relevant to the film's subject matter; generating extra profit items for their distributors. The sales of these books netted an estimated $31,000 for the distribution company, while Babb estimated the total sales for all distributions at 40 million copies.Babb insisted that the program be followed closely; a contractual agreement with theaters required that each presentation follow a similar approach. Because the Forbes lecture formed part of the viewing, extra newsreels or short films were not permitted, although previews were allowed. A contractual agreement disallowed matin\u00e9e pricing, set specific times for the segregated viewings, and prohibited the screening  of the film on Sundays."

        "content": "Mom and Dad is the third highest-grossing film of the 1940s in dollar value, and returned close to $63 for each dollar invested by its backers. The Los Angeles Times estimates that the film grossed between $40 million and $100 million, and it has been cited as the most successful sex hygiene film ever released. It remains the most profitable pre-1960 exploitation film; ranking among the top ten grossing films of both the 1940s and 1950s, even when scaled against those year's mainstream releases.The film was at the center of many high-profile lawsuits and condemnations. The exploitation genre was pitched against numerous challenges during the 1940s and 1950s, and fought many local censorship battles, and fought bitterly against the motion picture censorship system. It has been claimed that nearly 428 lawsuits were laid against both Babb and Mom and Dad during the film's run.  Babb often used the supposed educational value of his films as an offer of defense, and recommended such tactic to theater owners in his pressbooks.  One successful challenge was in New York City, where Mom and Dad remained censored until 1956, when the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the censorship board, deciding that human birth did not qualify as \"indecent\".According to Modern Film Distributors, as of the end of 1956, the film has been dubbed into a dozen languages and attended by an estimated worldwide attendance figure of over 175 million people, at over 650,000 performances.  By then Babb claimed it had played in 47 states (excluding Kansas) and 72 other countries grossing $22 million worldwide. Card Mondor purchased the rights to exhibit the film in New Zealand and Australia during the mid-1960s, almost twenty years after the film's debut.  In the late 1970s, a story on Babb by the Press-Enterprise estimated that the film had been dubbed into 18 languages.The film's success spawned a number of imitators, who sought to saturate the market with genre imitations. In particular, Street Corner (1948) recycled Babb's plot, substituting a concerned physician for a concerned teacher. In 1948, Universal produced a similar film, The Story of Bob and Sally, but was unable to screen it due to the production code, and eventually sold the rights. The volume of imitations led to the formation of Modern Film Distributors, a group of exploitation filmmakers, in an effort to minimize booking conflicts.In 1969, the film was submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America for a film rating, in order to allow the film be shown in traditional movie theaters; it received an R rating. The film was such a success that it is still shown decades later around the world.  In 2005, a version was added to the National Film Registry."

Rachel dates other men during the series, such as Italian neighbor, Paolo, in season one; Joshua Bergin, a client from Bloomingdale's, in season four; Tag Jones, her assistant, in season seven; and Joey Tribbiani, one of her close friends, in season ten. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at the coffee house Central Perk, but she later becomes an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's in season three, and a buyer at Ralph Lauren in season five. Rachel and Ross have a daughter named Emma in \"The One Where Rachel Has a Baby, Part Two\" at the end of season eight. In the final episode of the series, Ross and Rachel confess their love for each other, and Rachel gives up a dream fashion job at Louis Vuitton in Paris to be with him. It is heavily implied in the spin-off series, Joey, that Rachel married Ross after the series finale.\nCourteney Cox as Monica Geller: The \"mother hen\" of the group and a chef, known for her perfectionist, bossy, competitive, and obsessive-compulsive nature. Monica was overweight as a child. She works as a chef in various restaurants throughout the show. Monica's first serious relationship is with a long-time family friend Richard Burke, who is 21 years her senior. The two maintain a strong relationship for some time until Richard expresses that he does not want to have children. Monica and Chandler, one of her best friends, later start a relationship after spending a night with each other in London in the season four finale, leading to their marriage in season seven and the adoption of twins at the end of the series.\nLisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay: A masseuse and self-taught musician. As a child, Phoebe lived in upstate New York with her mother, until her mother committed suicide and Phoebe took to the streets. She writes and sings her own strange songs, accompanying herself on the guitar. She has an identical twin named Ursula, who shares few of Phoebe's traits. Phoebe has three serious relationships over the show's run: David, a scientist, in season one, with whom she breaks up when he moves to Minsk on a research grant; Gary, a police officer whose badge she finds, in season five; and an on-and-off relationship with Mike Hannigan in seasons nine and ten. In season nine, Phoebe and Mike break up due to his desire not to marry. David returns from Minsk, leading to the two getting back together, but she eventually rejects him for Mike when both of them propose to her. Phoebe and Mike marry in season ten.\nMatt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani: A struggling actor and food lover who becomes famous for his role on soap opera Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray. Joey has many short-term girlfriends. Despite his womanizing, Joey is innocent, caring, and well-intentioned. Joey often uses the catchphrase pick-up line \"How you doin'?\" in his attempts to win over most of the women he meets. Joey rooms with his best friend Chandler for years, and later with Rachel. He falls in love with Rachel in season eight, but Rachel politely tells Joey that she does not share his feelings. They eventually date briefly in season ten, but after realizing it will not work due to their friendship and Rachel's complicated relationship with Ross, they return to being friends. At the end of the series, he is the only remaining single member of the group, and becomes the main protagonist of the sequel series Joey.\nMatthew Perry as Chandler Bing: An executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one but is lured back with a new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa, Oklahoma. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being the son of an erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor and bad luck in relationships. Chandler marries Monica, one of his best friends, in season seven, and they adopt twins at the end of the series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times.\nDavid Schwimmer as Ross Geller: Monica's \"geeky\" older brother, a PhD-carrying palaeontologist working at the American Museum of Natural History, and later a tenured professor of palaeontology at New York University. Ross is involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with Rachel throughout the series. He has three failed marriages during the series: Carol Willick, a lesbian who is also the mother of his son, Ben Geller; Emily Waltham, who divorces him after he accidentally says Rachel's name instead of hers during their wedding vows; and Rachel, as the two drunkenly marry in Las Vegas. His divorces become a running joke within the series. Following a one-night stand, he and Rachel have a daughter, Emma, by the end of season eight. They finally confess that they are still in love with each other in the series finale. It is heavily implied in the spin-off series, Joey, that Ross married Rachel after the series finale.James Michael Tyler appears as Gunther, a barista at Central Perk, in every season of the show, but is only ever credited as a guest star. Gunther has a mostly secret profound love for Rachel throughout the entire series. At one point he becomes the manager of the coffee house. It is revealed that Gunther speaks Dutch in addition to English, as well as being a former soap opera actor.\nIn their original contracts for the first season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode. The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode. Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals. The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member. The stars were each paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1 million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid TV actresses of all time. The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit of a piece of the show's lucrative back-end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.Series creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent, and the series was lauded as being \"the first true 'ensemble' show.\" The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate; they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards, opted for collective salary negotiations, and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season. The cast members also became best friends off-screen, so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck reported that he sometimes felt left out.The cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette's daughter, Coco. In the official farewell commemorative book Friends 'Til the End, each separately acknowledged in interviews that the cast had become their family."

They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:\nIt's exactly what I had hoped. We all end up with a sense of a new beginning and the audience has a sense that it's a new chapter in the lives of all these characters. \nNBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of Dateline NBC, one of which ran for two hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before the airing of the episode. Following the finale, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno was filmed on the set of the Friends' Central Perk coffee house, which featured the cast as guests.

Following the finales of Friends and Frasier, media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre, and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows."

        "content": "Although the producers thought of Friends as \"only a TV show\", psychologists investigated the cultural impact of Friends during the series' run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world. Joey's catchphrase, \"How you doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"so\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change. Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech.Friends has also been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter (26%) of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English. Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool F.C. manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp, BTS member RM and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters.Friends was parodied in the twelfth season Murder, She Wrote episode \"Murder Among Friends\". In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) investigates the murder of a writer for Buds, a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved Murder, She Wrote from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite Friends on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and Murder, She Wrote's supervising producer, as having \"a bit of an attitude\" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as \"a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.\"Jerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the \"flavor\" of Buds by watching episodes of Friends. Producers of Married... with Children attempted to create a spinoff series called Enemies, which was intended to act as an antithesis to Friends in the same way Married... with Children had been to family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show. However, the Fox network declined to pick up the series.The Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it. The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by Friends, featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing Friends episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays the Central Perk manager in the series, Gunther, attended the grand opening of the Dubai caf\u00e9, where he worked as a waiter.Central Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in October 2008. Jennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004. From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was based at Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold coffee to customers and featured a display of Friends memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode \"The One with the Football\". In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010.\nIn India, there are six Friends-themed cafes, located in Chandigarh (named Central Perk); Kolkata; and West Bengal (named F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Cafe), which features many icons from the original TV series, including Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, and Phoebe's pink bicycle. The other three cafes are located in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra.There are two Friends themed cafes in Pakistan\u2014one in Lahore, Punjab, known as \"Friends Cafe\" and the other in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa called \"Central Perk\". Both cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and episode reruns on a projector. They're planning to have their own Gunther at the bar.In 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk that has been given the intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. outside of the United States. The caf\u00e9 includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters' apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show. In August 2019, it was announced that a Central Perk Lego set would be launched to mark the show's 25 anniversary.Friends has also developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people who live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that \"all you need are good friends\" and can construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society. According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, Friends is \"one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.\" The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other.\nVox stated that Friends had an impact on the creation of other conflictless \"hangout sitcoms\", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is How I Met Your Mother, which The Guardian's TV and radio blog notes also shares its setting with Friends, Manhattan. Other examples include The Big Bang Theory, New Girl, and Happy Endings.Readers of TV Guide voted the cast of Friends their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating Seinfeld, which registered 18%. A poll undertaken by 60 Minutes and Vanity Fair named Friends the third-greatest sitcom of all time. In 2014, the series was ranked by Mundo Estranho the Best TV Series of All Time. A 2015 survey by The Hollywood Reporter of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named Friends as their No. 1 favorite show."

Kauffman and Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Bright agreed to executive produce the series with Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan. NBC heavily promoted Joey and gave it Friends' Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot.The pilot was watched by 18.6 million American viewers, but ratings continually decreased throughout the series's two seasons, averaging 10.2 million viewers in the first season and 7.1 million in the second. The final broadcast episode on March 7, 2006, was watched by 7.09 million viewers; NBC cancelled the series on May 15, 2006, after two seasons, leaving eight episodes unaired. Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio and other producers for quickly ruining the series:\nOn Friends, Joey was a womanizer, but we enjoyed his exploits. He was a solid friend, a guy you knew you could count on. Joey was deconstructed to be a guy who couldn't get a job, couldn't ask a girl out. He became a pathetic, mopey character.

        "content": "Kids See Ghosts is the debut studio album by the American hip hop supergroup Kids See Ghosts, composed of the rappers and producers Kanye West and Kid Cudi. It was released on June 8, 2018, through Wicked Awesome Records and GOOD Music, and distributed by Def Jam Recordings. Prior to the release, West and Cudi had collaborated on each others' work since 2008, although they experienced personal quarrels due to creative differences. The first studio sessions for the album began after the two reunited in late 2016.\nGuest contributions are included on Kids See Ghosts from Pusha T, Yasiin Bey, and Ty Dolla Sign, as well as a vocal sample of Louis Prima, who is credited posthumously as a featured artist. Kids See Ghosts handled the majority of the stylistically fragmented production that includes varying elements, with further contributions by Dot da Genius, Mike Dean, and Plain Pat, among others. The album was the third of five records produced by West in Jackson Hole as a part of the \"Wyoming Sessions\", each being released weekly in the summer of 2018. It succeeded the release of Pusha T's Daytona and West's Ye, while preceded the release of Nas' Nasir and Teyana Taylor's K.T.S.E.\nCommentators noted the genre of Kids See Ghosts as a fusion of psychedelia and hip hop. The lyrical content includes references to mental health issues, which both West and Cudi had suffered from previously. The cover art was designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami; he based it on Hokusai's landscape print series, Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. The album received widespread acclaim from music critics, who generally pointed out the chemistry of West and Cudi in praise, while some noted an improvement from West's recent work. It was named to year-end lists for 2018 of many publications, including GQ Russia and Pitchfork.\nIn the United States, Kids See Ghosts debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in 2018, alongside entering atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It attained top-10 positions in nine other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom. The album has since been certified gold and silver in the US and the UK by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively. Kids See Ghosts performed live for it at the 2018 Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival and the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival."

        "content": "Since 2008, Kanye West had frequently collaborated with Kid Cudi. That year, they first worked together on \"Welcome to Heartbreak\" from West's fourth studio album 808s & Heartbreak. West released his sixth studio album Yeezus on June 18, 2013, which includes vocals from Cudi on \"Guilt Trip\". In June of the following year, Cudi recalled having recorded the vocals as a reference a couple of years prior and admitted to lacking awareness of being on the song until people mentioned it on social media, initially questioning: \"What the fuck is everyone talking about?\" Cudi stated he was partially flattered and regarded it \"kind of cool that [West] thought of me\", before further consideration led the rapper to feel dissatisfied with West underusing him. On February 14, 2016, West released his seventh studio album The Life of Pablo, with the tracks \"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1\" and \"Waves\" featuring vocals by Cudi. 10 days after releasing the album, West tweeted on February 24 that he would release an album titled Turbo Grafx 16 in the summer, named after the video game console of the same name. Later that month, his longtime associate Ibn Jasper posted a photo on Instagram showing West, Cudi, and record producers Mike Dean and Plain Pat in a recording studio working on the album.Cudi briefly fell out with West, criticizing him and Drake over their usage of writers in September 2016, tweeting that he had been loyal to his colleagues but now he was \"your threat\". West responded to the tweets at the Tampa stop of his Saint Pablo Tour, threatening Cudi not to mention his name again and assuring \"I birthed you\", before adding that he felt \"hurt\" and \"disrespected\". Days later, at a Houston show, West retracted his earlier comments, describing Cudi as his \"brother\" and \"the most influential artist of the past ten years\". Cudi, who had admitted himself into a rehabilitation facility following a struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts, thanked West and other supporters in a Facebook post, writing that \"words can't really express how much it made my heart glow\". West himself was hospitalized due to heavy sleep deprivation in November 2016, with the tour being cancelled after he brought Cudi out to perform at his Sacramento show that ended early. West had suffered from mental illness for 10 years prior to Kids See Ghosts, while Cudi reached post-rehab stage by the time of its release.In December 2016, Cudi released his sixth studio album Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin', which West subsequently described as \"super inspiring\". Work on Kids See Ghosts began that same month and parts of it were created in the summer of 2017 during recording sessions in Japan and China. In November, and again in February of the following year, West performed \"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1\" live with Cudi. West was spotted recording in the US state of Wyoming with various collaborators in March, including Cudi and fellow rapper Nas. He returned to the state two months later for the recording of several then-upcoming albums, which were later referred to as the \"Wyoming Sessions\". The sessions took place in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where West had purchased a property known as Monster Lake Ranch and renamed it to West Lake Ranch.Outside of his own releases, West also executive produced, produced, and provided guest vocals for all of the albums by other artists that originated from the \"Wyoming Sessions\"; he had announced taking on the role of producer for the sessions beforehand. Fellow rapper Pusha T's third studio album Daytona was issued on May 25, 2018, as the first release of West's \"Wyoming Sessions\" recordings. On June 1, a week before the release of Kids See Ghosts, West released his eighth studio album Ye as the second album of the \"Wyoming Sessions\". Cudi made appearances on the tracks \"Ghost Town\", alongside PartyNextDoor and 070 Shake, and \"No Mistakes\", alongside Charlie Wilson and Caroline Shaw. West revealed via Twitter that the former was originally slated to appear on Kids See Ghosts. A sequel to \"Ghost Town\", entitled \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\", is included on it, which features vocals from singer Ty Dolla Sign. The release of Kids See Ghosts on June 8, 2018, served as the third album from the \"Wyoming Sessions\". A week after its release, Nas released his twelfth studio album Nasir as the fourth album of the \"Wyoming Sessions\". Recording artist Teyana Taylor released her second studio album K.T.S.E. on June 22, 2018, as the fifth and final album of the \"Wyoming Sessions\"."

        "content": "According to Jordan Bassett of NME, Kids See Ghosts shows West and Cudi \"catch[ing] up with the fragmented, fragile brand of hip-hop that they helped to shape\", noting how \"the ethereal, low-key beats\" characterize the production. Christopher Thiessen of PopMatters called the tracks \"brooding, somber, [and] psychedelic\", observing that they often make use of minor chords, while Rrampt. magazine's Andrew Johnston deemed it a \"truly adventurous movement in progressive hip-hop\", with its seven songs traversing \"scatted freakouts, bangers, space odysseys, psychedelic soul, and dream pop\". Similarly, Dean Van Nguyen of The Guardian considered the album to be filled with \"blistering electronics, laser-cut samples, psychedelic crescendos and edges as blurry as a half-remembered dream\", while Van Nguyen categorizing track \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\" as rap rock. Sidney Madden of NPR wrote that the track is \"reminiscent of fuzzed-out psychedelic rock of the '70s\" and also noted the rock elements of \"Cudi Montage\". The staff of Highsnobiety pointed out West \"angrily scatting to the beat\" on \"Feel the Love\". \"4th Dimension\" and \"Cudi Montage\" both include samples of posthumously released music: \"What Will Santa Claus Say (When He Finds Everybody Swingin')\" and \"Burn the Rain\" by American singers Louis Prima and Kurt Cobain, respectively. Prima received credit as a featured artist on \"4th Dimension\". \"Feel the Love\" and \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\" include guest vocals from Pusha T and Ty Dolla Sign, respectively. \"Kids See Ghosts\" features rapper Mos Def, who is credited under his real name of Yasiin Bey.The album includes prominent production from West and Cudi, though \"Reborn\" and \"Cudi Montage\" are the only tracks to not include production from West, while \"Feel the Love\" and \"4th Dimension\" are the only tracks without Cudi's production. Dean helped produce \"Feel the Love\", \"4th Dimension\", \"Freeee (Ghost Town Pt. 2)\", and \"Cudi Montage\". Shawn Setaro of Complex wrote that due to Dean's presence on Ye, \"it makes sense he would be equally involved in Kids See Ghosts\". Plain Pat contributed production to \"Feel the Love\", \"4th Dimension\", \"Reborn\", and \"Kids See Ghosts\". Evan Mast helped produce \"Feel the Love\", \"Fire\", and \"Reborn\". \"Feel the Love\", \"4th Dimension\", and \"Kids See Ghosts\" include production from record producer Noah Goldstein. Production was contributed to the tracks \"Fire\", \"4th Dimension\", and \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\" by record producer BoogzDaBeast. Record producer Dot da Genius, Cudi's WZRD bandmate, co-produced the tracks \"Reborn\" and \"Cudi Montage\" for Kids See Ghosts. Musician Justin Vernon was partially responsible for the production of \"Feel the Love\" and \"Kids See Ghosts\". The latter and \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\" include production from record producer Andrew Dawson. Kids See Ghosts also includes production contributed by Francis and the Lights, Cashmere Cat, Andr\u00e9 3000, Andy C, Russel \"Love\" Crews, and Jeff Bhasker."

The album includes the duo battling against their mental fears and anxieties to achieve comfort in a better spirit, with them mostly doing so on the aforementioned tracks. As Robert Christgau summarized for Vice, they demonstrate male bonding and \"acknowledge their madness, with West shitcanning his meds\" and Cudi becoming enough of \"a rehab nut\" that it leads to the mantra of \"I'm movin' forward\" being heavily repeated. Kids See Ghosts also acknowledge their past successes, as well as failures. Pop culture and historical references are frequent throughout Kids See Ghosts, mostly in \"4th Dimension\".The album's opener, \"Feel the Love\", includes a verse from Pusha T, while West contributes gun noises (\"vocal rat-a-tats\", as Christgau described) to the track and Cudi sings a hook about being able to \"feel the love\". The staff of Highsnobiety noticed that the position of \"Fire\" after the track serves as a reminder \"of the ping-pong nature of mental illness\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes you're up, sometimes you're down\", with the song lyrically seeing Kids See Ghosts take \"a softer approach to diagnosing the self, exposing the failures of the aforementioned duo\". Within \"4th Dimension\", Kids See Ghosts prevent being burdened by their feelings by putting forward the random in the form of the duo's current thoughts; this is an example of bipolar disorder. West shows that he is numb to criticism on \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\", which is about the mind becoming free of any impediments. The song interpolates lyrics from the original \"Ghost Town\". \"Reborn\" is linked to getting past mental lows that inspire depression and usage of drugs. The throes of paranoia are addressed on \"Kids See Ghosts\", which also features political ideas from Yasiin Bey: \"Civilization without society / Power and wealth with nobility / Stability without stasis / Spaces and places.\" In contrast to the song's lyrical content, \"Cudi Montage\" features Cudi remarking about the journey to his mind's reconstruction and West referencing an environment's cycle of violence. The track was described by the staff of Highsnobiety as closing out Kids See Ghosts \"on a whimper, purposefully, to dictate the cyclical nature of mental illness\"."

On April 22, 2018, West shared art by Murakami related to the album via Twitter, confirming the title to be Kids See Ghosts. The black and white image featured two caricatures that appeared to be of West and Cudi stood by a smoke ball with a face, while the title was included in a spray paint font. The only parts of the art not in black and white were Japanese writing, an autograph, and a sunflower. Accompanying his tweet, West added the caption \"Murakami vibes\". Regarding the drawing, Murakami told Complex that he and his assistants followed their \"very rudimental plan\" of drawing different ideas on a paper with West and his assistants. Murakami also said that West had brought forward the idea of portraying an anthropomorphized bear and fox, to reflect him and Cudi, respectively. Cudi allegedly had suggested for his character to be represented by a dog, however upon seeing an early sketch, West insisted that Cudi was better represented by a fox.Cudi tweeted out Murakami's artwork for the album on June 6, 2018, which has a high similarity to the art previously shared by West. Murakami explained that Hokusai's Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji was the basis of the artwork's background picture. The pastel-colored cover art presents a psychedelic scene, showing a ghostly figure riding on top of a sperm-shaped monster that has sharp teeth and haunted eyes. The figure is flying through a forest, which is backed by a mountain. The title Kids See Ghosts continues \"the spooky-ghost routine\" that started with West releasing \"Ghost Town\", which is also continued by the album with \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\"."

West tweeted out the track list on June 2, which included a track called \"Devil's Watchin\" that was ultimately not released on Kids See Ghosts. The spot of fourth track was blank at the time after \"Ghost Town\" had been removed, having a possibility of being taken up the track \"Extasy\" after it did not appear on Ye. The latter was later released under the title of \"XTCY\" on August 11, 2018. \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\" ultimately took up the spot of the fourth track on Kids See Ghosts.On June 8, 2018, the album was released for digital download and streaming by Wicked Awesome Records and GOOD Music, distributed by Def Jam Recordings, as Kids See Ghosts' eponymous debut studio album. The digital release of Kids See Ghosts faced technical difficulties, with six of the songs initially being incorrectly titled and ordered on streaming services; \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\" was the only one to not be mislabeled. The same year as being digitally issued, the album was released on CD through the labels in various countries. During an interview with Complex on September 9, 2019, it was revealed by Cudi that more albums by Kids See Ghosts are set to be released in the future, and he assured that West had told him he wanted to start working on Kids See Ghosts 2.\nOn June 5, 2018, Cudi's manager Dennis Cummings announced a listening party for Kids See Ghosts in Los Angeles via Twitter, which was to be conducted a day prior to its release. Cudi announced on Twitter that the live stream of the listening party was intended to take place through WAV at 8 pm EST, simultaneously sharing a link to download the application. Following a series of unexplained delays alongside much frustration being caused, the listening party did not start until 1:50 am EST on June 8, 2018. It was unknown whether the live stream being delayed was because of a technical issue or Kids See Ghosts showing up late. The listening party was held by a bonfire at a secret location in Southern California, with Kids See Ghosts showcasing their merchandise at it. Attendees of the listening party included the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Quentin Miller of American hip hop duo WDNG Crshrs, rapper and singer Desiigner, and Trinidadian-American rapper Trinidad James. Shortly after the party, videos circulated on social media of Dean completing the mixing of Kids See Ghosts.No music videos were released for the album or Ye. Kids See Ghosts made their live debut at the 2018 Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival, performing for 45 minutes inside a rectangular glass box that was floating above the stage. The duo went through a full performance of Kids See Ghosts, delivering the tracks in the order of the track list, and also performed a number of past collaborations, including \"Welcome to Heartbreak\" and \"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1\". West forgot several lyrics from his verses on \"Reborn\" and \"Cudi Montage\". During the first concert of West's gospel group the Sunday Service Choir on January 6, 2019, the group and him performed \"Reborn\" while Cudi was in attendance. Kids See Ghosts performed numerous tracks live at that year's Coachella Festival, including \"Reborn\" and \"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)\". In June 2020, Cudi shared a teaser for the album's CGI animated show of the same name. The clip used \"4th Dimension\" as its soundtrack, while the show is directed by Murakami."

        "content": "Kids See Ghosts was met with widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 18 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 8.1 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.In a positive review, Van Nguyen referred to the album as \"a psychedelic return to godlike power\", commending Cudi's performance and the chemistry of Kids See Ghosts, as well as the lyricism: \"The brevity is effective as [they] stack ideas on top of ideas, packing the 23 minutes with as much creativity as possible. The chemistry is that of two old friends who no longer have to second-guess each other's instincts\", concluding that the album reasserts West \"as a fun, thrilling rap music-maker that tests the genre's boundaries\". Jayson Greene of Pitchfork wrote that \"the songs are the most intriguing ones to emerge from this Wyoming project thus far\". He compared Kids See Ghosts positively to Ye, writing that \"a lot of the energy that Ye seemed to be gasping for fills the lungs of this project, and it's humbling to consider how much this material might have enlivened West's own album\". He further praised the \"soul and depth\" of Cudi's contributions to the album, and the duo's \"psychic bond\", which \"yields a spacious and melancholy album about brokenness\". He concluded that Kids See Ghosts marked \"the first time in years\" that \"Kanye sounds at peace\".Providing a highly positive review, Russell Stone of Highsnobiety praised Cudi's performance for \"fueling the album's immaculate feel\" and \"sounding [his] most empowered\" yet, while complimenting West's \"mind-bending\" production and focused subject matter, in contrast to his lyricism on Ye. Bassett asserted that Kids See Ghosts \"sounds, suitably, ghostly and supernatural\", offering a moderate \"glimpse\" into a different world, and is \"the sound of two artists looking back over the vast distance they've travelled so far\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Marty Sartini Garner commended Cudi's contributions as \"without qualification, the spiritual and artistic backbone of Kids See Ghosts, the source of its truest artistic risks\", writing that he \"lifts Kanye up\", who \"allows Cudi to take him further\" than he has gone on his own. He also stated the album \"marks [Cudi]'s true return only a year and a half after he checked himself into rehab to fight depression and suicidal ideation\", affirming that the rehab \"seems to have done him wonders\". Chuck Arnold of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album \"had a lot going against it before it dropped from the Wyoming wilderness\", but that the album's \"hope, healing, and haunting music in the face of darkness\" causes these concerns to \"go out the window\", and that West and Cudi \"craft a work that easily surpasses Ye both musically and emotionally\". He concluded that the album \"leaves you greedy for more\", hoping West and Cudi \"have rid themselves of enough ghosts to bust out more of this kind of artistry\". In a less enthusiastic review for Rolling Stone, Christopher R. Weingarten wrote that the album is \"nowhere near as incisive, infectious or rewarding as their best work\", but is \"still an important step forward into an era of big moods and short attention spans\"."

        "content": "Unlike Ye, Kids See Ghosts failed to give West a chart topper on the US Billboard 200, debuting at number two on the chart behind Dave Matthews Band's ninth studio album Come Tomorrow (2018). The album totalled 142,000 album-equivalent units, which included 79,000 pure album sales and over 90 million streams. On the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, Kids See Ghosts entered at number one. On January 29, 2021, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for registering 500,000 certified units in the United States. Kids See Ghosts peaked at number two on the Irish Albums Chart, tying with Graduation and Late Registration (2005) for West's second highest charting albums on the chart. On the Canadian Albums Chart, Kids See Ghosts entered at number three, standing as the second highest debut of the week, one place behind Come Tomorrow at number two. This gave Cudi his highest charting album in Canada since his third studio album Indicud attained the same position in 2013. Kids See Ghosts also peaked at number three on Estonia's Albumid tipp-40, the Latvian Albums Chart, New Zealand Albums Chart, and Norwegian Albums Chart.The album debuted at number four on the ARIA Albums chart, becoming West's second top-10 album in 2018 and Cudi's first appearance on the chart since Indicud. This also led to Kids See Ghosts becoming the fourth major hip hop act to have an album reach the top-10 of the ARIA Albums chart in 2018, joining West with Ye, J. Cole with his fifth studio album KOD, and ASAP Rocky with his third studio album Testing. A top-five position was also attained by Kids See Ghosts in the Netherlands, with it peaking at number five on Dutch Album Top 100. The album ranked at number 13 on the midweek album sales chart in the United Kingdom for the week of its release, before debuting six places higher at number seven on the UK Albums Chart. The debut made Kids See Ghosts the week's third highest entry, though was a position five places lower than Ye gave West when peaking at number two on the chart earlier in 2018. On April 2, 2021, the former was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of 60,000 units in the UK.All of the seven tracks from Kids See Ghosts debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, with \"Reborn\" entering the highest at number 39; West had previously achieved this feat with Ye. The song was later certified platinum by the RIAA for amassing 1,000,000 certified units in the US on June 11, 2020. All the tracks also entered the ARIA Singles Chart, Canadian Hot 100, and Irish Singles Chart, with \"Reborn\" charting the highest in Ireland too. The song charted on the UK Singles Chart along with \"Feel the Love\" and \"4th Dimension\", all three of which reached the top-50."

        "content": "Saw II is a 2005 horror film directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Leigh Whannell and Bousman. It is the sequel to 2004's Saw and the second installment in the Saw film series. The film stars Donnie Wahlberg, Franky G, Glenn Plummer, Beverley Mitchell, Dina Meyer, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Erik Knudsen, Shawnee Smith, and Tobin Bell. In the film, a group of ex-convicts are trapped by the Jigsaw Killer inside a house and must pass a series of deadly tests to retrieve the antidote for a nerve agent that will kill them in two hours.\nAfter the successful opening weekend of 2004's Saw, a sequel was immediately green-lit. Whannell and James Wan were busy preparing for their next film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called The Desperate before Saw was released and was looking for a producer but many studios rejected it. Gregg Hoffman received the script and showed it to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into Saw II. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.\nSaw II was released in the United States on October 28, 2005, by Lionsgate Films. It opened with $31.9 million and grossed $88 million in the United States and Canada. It has remained the highest grossing Saw film in those countries. Bell was nominated for \"Best Villain\" at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards for his role as Jigsaw in the film. Saw II was released to home media on February 14, 2006, and topped charts its first week, selling more than 3 million units. Saw II was followed by a sequel titled Saw III (2006) and later a prequel titled Saw X (2023)."

Billy the Puppet on a screen tells him that the key to open the death mask is located inside his eye. He isn't able to retrieve the key in time and is killed when the mask closes on his head. At the scene of Michael's murder, Detective Kerry finds a message for her former partner, Detective Eric Matthews. Matthews joins Kerry and Officer Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Michael's trap. There, they apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who indicates computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house, including his only known survivor Amanda, Matthews's son Daniel, and six other victims: Xavier, Jonas, Laura, Addison, Obi, and Gus. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them all within two hours, but John assures Matthews that if he follows the rules of his own game, he will find Daniel again in a safe place. At Kerry's urging, Matthews agrees to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal. During their conversation, John reveals to Matthews that his main motivation for his games was a suicide attempt after his cancer diagnosis, which led to a newfound appreciation for life; the games are intended to help his victims develop the same appreciation.\nThe group is informed by a microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; one is in the room's safe, and the tape provides a cryptic clue. Gus ignores a warning note and uses the key provided with the cassette on the door, which triggers a revolver through the peephole that kills him. Once the door opens, they search the house and find a basement, where Obi, who helped with abducting the other victims, is killed in a furnace trap while trying to retrieve two antidotes. In another room, Xavier's test involves digging through a pit filled with syringes to retrieve a key to a steel door in two minutes, but he instead throws Amanda into the pit. She retrieves the key, but Xavier fails to unlock the door in time. Throughout the game, the group discuss connections between them and determine that each has been incarcerated before except Daniel. During his father's test, John reveals their affiliation to Matthews, who was a corrupt police officer who framed his suspects in various crimes.\nXavier returns to the safe room and finds a number on the back of Gus's neck. After realizing the numbers are the combination for the safe, he kills Jonas and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent and dies, after finding the clue revealing Daniel's identity. Incensed by the revelation, Addison leaves on her own and finds a glass box containing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the openings which are lined with hidden blades. Xavier enters the room and leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel from the first room leading to a dilapidated bathroom. After Xavier corners them, Amanda taunts him by implying that he will not learn his number because nobody will read it to him. Xavier responds by cutting off a piece of skin from the back of his neck to read his number. Xavier charges them, and Daniel slits his throat with a hacksaw.\nHaving seen Xavier chasing his son, Matthews assaults John and forces him to lead him to the house. The tech team tracks the video's source and while Rigg's team searches the house, Kerry realizes that the game took place days before they captured John and the footage they thought they\u2019d been seeing live was actually pre-recorded. Soon after, the timer for Matthews's game expires and a nearby safe unlocks to reveal Daniel inside, bound and breathing in an oxygen mask. Unaware of these events, Matthews enters the house alone and makes his way to the bathroom, where he is subdued by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe and finds a tape recorder left by Amanda, who reveals she had become John's accomplice after surviving her first trap and helped him set up Matthews's test during the game at the house, intending to continue John's work after he dies. Amanda then appears and seals the door, leaving Matthews to die as John hears his screams outside and smiles."

Griphook agrees, in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy; he senses Draco's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry, who captured it from Draco. A horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff's cup, is found in Bellatrix's vault, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons them. Trapped by security, they release the dragon guardian and flee Gringotts on its back. Harry has a vision of Lord Voldemort at Gringotts, furious at the theft. Harry also realises a Horcrux connected to Rowena Ravenclaw is hidden at Hogwarts. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade and are helped by Aberforth Dumbledore. It is revealed that he was the one who sent Dobby to Malfoy Manor. He then reveals a secret passageway into Hogwarts, which Neville Longbottom guides them through.\nSeverus Snape knows Harry has returned and threatens to punish any staff or students who aid Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees during a duel with Professor McGonagall. McGonagall rouses the Hogwarts community for battle. Luna Lovegood urges Harry to speak to Helena Ravenclaw's ghost. Helena reveals Voldemort performed \"dark magic\" on her mother's diadem and tells Harry that the diadem is somewhere in the Room of Requirement. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron and Hermione destroy the Horcrux cup with a Basilisk fang. Draco, Blaise Zabini and Gregory Goyle attack Harry in the Room of Requirement, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts an uncontrollable Fiendfyre curse that kills him while Harry, Ron, and Hermione save Malfoy and Zabini and escape on brooms. Once outside, Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang and Ron kicks it into the inferno. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake Nagini is the final Horcrux. In the boathouse, the trio overhear Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; Nagini then viciously attacks Snape. As Snape dies, he gives Harry one of his memories. Meanwhile, Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks are killed in the chaos at Hogwarts.\nHarry views Snape's memory in the Pensieve: Snape despised Harry's late father James, who bullied him, but he loved Harry's mother Lily. Following her death, Snape worked with Albus Dumbledore as a double agent amongst the Death Eaters, to protect Harry from Voldemort. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and planned for Snape to kill him. It was Snape who conjured the Patronus doe that led Harry to Gryffindor's sword. Harry also learns that he became an accidental Horcrux when Voldemort's curse originally failed to kill him; Voldemort must now kill Harry to destroy the soul shard within him. Using the Resurrection Stone that had been stored in the Golden Snitch bequeathed to him, Harry summons the spirits of his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus. They comfort him before he surrenders to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who awakens in limbo. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that Harry is now free of Voldemort, and can choose to return to his body or move on. Harry chooses the former.\nVoldemort displays Harry's apparent corpse and demands that Hogwarts surrender. As Neville draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat in defiance, Harry reveals he is alive and the Malfoys and many other Death Eaters abandon Voldemort, demoralised after seeing that Harry still lived. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, Ron's mother, Molly, kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, destroying the last of the horcruxes. Harry finally destroys Voldemort after the Expelliarmus charm deflects the Killing Curse, rebounding it onto the Dark Lord. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that Voldemort never commanded the Elder Wand. It recognised him as its true master after he had disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore, atop the Astronomy Tower. Instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry destroys it.\nNineteen years later, Harry and his friends proudly watch their children leave for Hogwarts at King's Cross station."

Director David Yates stated, \"I want to get them all back\", referring to his desire to bring back as many actors who have appeared in the franchise as possible for that climactic battle sequence in the film. Resultantly, several actors reprise their roles from previous Harry Potter films including Sean Biggerstaff as Oliver Wood, Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn, Gemma Jones as Poppy Pomfrey, Miriam Margolyes as Pomona Sprout, and Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney. \nThe roles of several minor characters were recast or replaced for this film. For example, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds assumed the role of Aberforth Dumbledore, Albus Dumbledore's brother and bartender of the Hog's Head inn. For the final scene in the film which is set nineteen years after the film's main story, the actors playing the main characters were made to look older through the use of makeup and special effects. After the initial look of the actors' aged appearances leaked onto the Internet, some fans reacted by opining that Radcliffe and Grint looked too old, while Watson did not appear significantly different at all. After primary filming concluded in June 2010, Yates examined the footage, and concluded that the problem could not be resolved through editing or CGI, and had the sequence re-shot that December, with redesigned makeup."

        "content": "Band on the Run is the third studio album by the British\u2013American rock band Paul McCartney and Wings, released by Apple on 30 November 1973. It was McCartney's fifth album after leaving the Beatles in April 1970. Although sales were modest initially, its commercial performance was aided by two hit singles \u2013 \"Jet\" and \"Band on the Run\" \u2013 such that it became the top-selling studio album of 1974 in the United Kingdom and Australia, in addition to revitalising McCartney's critical standing. It remains McCartney's most successful album and the most celebrated of his post-Beatles works.\nThe album was mostly recorded at EMI's studio in Lagos, Nigeria, as McCartney wanted to make an album in an exotic location. Shortly before departing for Lagos, drummer Denny Seiwell and guitarist Henry McCullough left the group. With no time to recruit replacements, McCartney went into the studio with just his wife Linda and Denny Laine. McCartney therefore played bass, drums, percussion and most of the lead guitar parts. The studio was of poor quality and conditions in Nigeria were tense and difficult; the McCartneys were robbed at knifepoint, losing a bag of song lyrics and demo tapes. After the band's return to England, final overdubs and further recording were carried out in London, mostly at AIR Studios.\nIn 2000, Q magazine placed Band on the Run at number 75 in its list of the \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever\". In 2012, it was listed at 418 on Rolling Stone's revised list of \"the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". A contemporary review by Jon Landau in Rolling Stone describes the album as being the \"finest record yet\" by a former Beatle \"with the possible exception of John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band\". It was McCartney's last album released on Apple Records. In 2013, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame."

        "content": "By 1973, three years after the break-up of the Beatles, Paul McCartney had yet to regain his artistic credibility or find favour with music critics for his post-Beatles work. After completing a successful UK tour with his band Wings in July 1973, he planned their third album as a means to re-establish himself after the mixed reception given to Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway.Keen to record outside the United Kingdom, McCartney asked EMI to send him a list of all their international recording studios. He selected Lagos in Nigeria and was attracted to the idea of recording in Africa. In August, the band \u2013 consisting of McCartney and his wife Linda, ex-Moody Blues guitarist and pianist Denny Laine, Henry McCullough on lead guitar, and Denny Seiwell on drums \u2013 started rehearsals for the new album at the McCartneys' Scottish farm. During one rehearsal session, McCullough and McCartney argued, and McCullough quit. Seiwell left a week later, the night before the band flew out to Nigeria. This left just McCartney, Linda and Laine to record in Lagos, assisted by former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick. McCartney had chosen Lagos, as he felt it would be a glamorous location where he and the band could sun on the beach during the day and record at night; the reality, however, was that, after the end of a civil war in 1970, Nigeria was run by a military government, with corruption and disease commonplace."

        "content": "The band and their entourage arrived in Lagos on 30 August 1973, returning to London late on 22 September. EMI's studio, located on Wharf Road in the suburb of Apapa, was ramshackle and under-equipped. The control desk was faulty and there was only one tape machine, a Studer 8-track. The band rented houses near the airport in Ikeja, an hour away from the studio. McCartney, Linda, and their three children stayed in one, while Laine, his wife JoJo, Emerick, and Wings' two roadies stayed in another.\nThe group established a routine of recording during the week and playing tourist on the weekends. McCartney temporarily joined a local country club, where he spent most mornings. The band was driven to the studio in the early afternoon, and recording would last into the late evening or early morning. To compensate for the departed band members, McCartney played, in addition to his contributions on bass guitar, the drum and lead guitar parts, with Laine playing rhythm guitar and Linda adding keyboards. The first track they recorded at Apapa was \"Mamunia\", the title for which McCartney appropriated from the name of a hotel in Marrakesh where Wings had stayed in April 1973.\n\nSeveral of the songs on Band on the Run reflect themes of escape and freedom, while the structure of the album recalled the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road. The song \"Band on the Run\" was partly inspired by a remark George Harrison had made during one of the many business meetings the Beatles attended in 1969 in an effort to address the problems afflicting their Apple Corps enterprise. Four years later, the album's creation coincided with what author Peter Doggett terms McCartney's \"moral victory in the debate over Allen Klein\", as Harrison, John Lennon, and Ringo Starr now became embroiled in litigation against Klein \u2013 the business manager they had appointed to run Apple in 1969, despite strong opposition from McCartney. Doggett writes that McCartney was perhaps liberated creatively by this recent development, resulting in Band on the Run bearing \"a frothy self-confidence that was reminiscent of the Beatles at their most productive\".Aside from the challenges presented by the substandard studio, various incidents plagued Wings' stay in Lagos. While out walking one night against advice, McCartney and Linda were robbed at knifepoint. The assailants made off with all of their valuables, and even stole a bag containing a notebook full of handwritten lyrics and songs, and cassettes containing demos for songs to be recorded. On another occasion, McCartney was overdubbing a vocal track when he began gasping for air.  According to Emerick: \"Within seconds, [McCartney] turned as white as a sheet, explaining to us in a croaking voice that he couldn't catch his breath. We decided to take him outside for some fresh air ... [but] once he was exposed to the blazing heat he felt even worse and began keeling over, finally fainting dead away at our feet.  Linda began screaming hysterically; she was convinced that he was having a heart attack ... The official diagnosis was that he had suffered a bronchial spasm brought on by too much smoking.\" Another incident was the confrontation with local Afrobeat pioneer and political activist Fela Kuti, who publicly accused the band of being in Africa to exploit and steal African music after their visit to his club. Kuti went to the studio to confront McCartney, who played their songs for him to show that they contained no local influence. Later on, drummer and former Cream member Ginger Baker invited Wings to record their entire album at his ARC Studio in Ikeja. McCartney agreed to go there for one day, and the song \"Picasso's Last Words (Drink to Me)\" was recorded at ARC, with Baker himself shaking a tin can filled with gravel on the track.\n\nRecording for the majority of the album's basic tracks, together with initial overdubbing, was completed after six weeks in Nigeria. Wings hosted a beach barbecue to celebrate the end of recording, and on 23 September 1973 they flew back to England, where they were met by fans and journalists. Upon returning to London, the McCartneys received a letter from EMI dated before the band had left England warning them to not go to Lagos due to an outbreak of cholera.In October, two weeks after the band's return to London, work began at George Martin's AIR Studios to transfer many of the eight-track recordings made in Nigeria to sixteen-track. \"Jet\", named after one of the McCartney children's ponies, was recorded in its entirety at AIR. The McCartneys and Laine carried out further overdubs on the Lagos recordings during this period; all of the orchestral arrangements for the album were taped at AIR in a single day, conducted by Tony Visconti. Visconti was given three days to write the arrangements, including for the 60-piece orchestra on the title track. He said the arrangements were collaborations with McCartney, and was surprised he was not correctly credited for his work until the 25th anniversary reissue of the album. Another contributor was saxophonist Howie Casey, who overdubbed solos on \"Bluebird\", \"Mrs. Vandebilt,\" and \"Jet\", and would go on to become Wings' regular horn player. On 8 October, Remi Kabaka, a musician coming from Nigeria, although born in Ghana, added a set of percussion on \"Bluebird\". Final mixing of the album was completed over three days at London's Kingsway Studios in early November."

        "content": "The album cover photograph was taken in Osterley Park, West London, on 28 October 1973 by photographer Clive Arrowsmith from a concept by Hipgnosis and McCartney. It depicts the McCartneys, Laine, and six other well-known people dressed as convicts and posed as though caught by a prison searchlight. The six celebrities are: Michael Parkinson, Kenny Lynch, James Coburn, Clement Freud, Christopher Lee, and John Conteh. Arrowsmith said the photo used for the cover was one of four he found acceptable out of the 24 pictures he took during the session. The spotlight's low potency meant everyone had to stand still for two seconds for proper exposure, which was made difficult by the photographer and subjects reportedly being in a \"substance haze\" following a party held by Paul McCartney. The golden hue of the picture comes from Arrowsmith\u2019s use of daylight film instead of nighttime Tungsten film, which would have been more typical for the setting."

Rather than having the band promote the album on radio and television or with a tour, McCartney undertook a series of magazine interviews, most notably with Paul Gambaccini for Rolling Stone. The conversations with Gambaccini took place at various locations from September 1973 onward, and combined to form, in the words of authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, \"a remarkably forthcoming interview in comparison to the 'thumbs-aloft' profiles usually allowed by [McCartney]\".\"Helen Wheels\" was released as a non-album single in late October 1973, and became a top 10 hit in America the following January. For commercial reasons, Capitol Records, the US distributor for Apple Records, asked to include \"Helen Wheels\" on the album. McCartney agreed, although it was never his intention to include the track. While \"Helen Wheels\" is not included on CD editions of Band on the Run in the UK (except as a bonus track on the 1993 \"The Paul McCartney Collection\" edition of the album), it has often appeared on CD releases of the album in the US and Canada, starting with the initial Columbia Records release in 1984. Early versions of the Capitol release fail to list \"Helen Wheels\" on the label or the CD insert, making the song a \"hidden track\"."

        "content": "Initially, the album did not sell especially well, with the record-buying public wary after Wings' preceding releases. On the UK Albums Chart, Band on the Run climbed to number 9 on 22 December, remaining there for a second week before dropping to number 13. On America's Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, it peaked at number 7 on 2 February 1974, and then spent the next six weeks in the lower reaches of the top ten. The album went on to achieve considerable success, however, thanks to the popularity of the two singles culled from it: \"Jet\" and the title track. Writing in 1981, Bob Woffinden described Band on the Run as the first Beatles-related release to be \"planned with a marketing strategy\", as Capitol Records now assumed a fully active role in promoting the album following the removal of Klein's ABKCO Industries as managers of Apple. Although McCartney had been reluctant to issue album tracks as singles, the public's apparent lack of interest in Band on the Run led him to agree to the recommendations of Capitol's head of marketing, Al Coury, who had similarly pushed for the inclusion of \"Helen Wheels\" on the album's American release. McCartney therefore authorised single edits of the two A-sides taken from the album.\"Jet\" was issued as a single in America on 28 January with \"Mamunia\" as the B-side, although \"Let Me Roll It\", which was the B-side of the UK release, replaced \"Mamunia\" on 15 February. The single's success provided new impetus for the album, which hit number 2 in the UK at the end of March and topped Billboard's listings on 13 April. Apple issued \"Band on the Run\" as a single in America on 8 April, backed by \"Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five\"; the UK release followed on 28 June, with the non-album instrumental \"Zoo Gang\" as the B-side. Due to the popularity of \"Band on the Run\", the album returned to number 1 on the Billboard chart on 8 June, when the single simultaneously topped the Hot 100. In Britain, the album finally hit number 1 on 27 July, and it stayed there for seven consecutive weeks. On the alternative UK listings compiled by Melody Maker, Band on the Run remained in the top ten from 26 January through 23 November 1974. During that time, its chart performance similarly reflected the popularity of the two singles, with the album spending three weeks at number 2 in April, and six weeks at number 1 throughout August and the first week of September.The album topped the Billboard chart on three separate occasions during 1974, and was the top selling album of that year in Australia and Canada. In Britain, it came second in the year-end standings, behind the compilation The Singles: 1969\u20131973 by the Carpenters. Through this success with Wings, McCartney established himself as the most commercially successful of the four former Beatles. Author Robert Rodriguez views the album's arrival at number 1 in America in April 1974 as the moment when McCartney usurped George Harrison as the \"ex-Beatle Most Likely to Succeed\", and the beginning of a period of public acclaim that reached its zenith with the Wings Over America Tour in 1976.Band on the Run was eventually certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and would go on to sell 6 million copies worldwide, becoming EMI's top selling album of the 1970s in the UK. Its continued success through 1974 was also beneficial in allowing Wings to recruit a new guitarist and drummer, and to integrate them into the band before beginning new recordings."

If anybody ever puts down McCartney in your presence, bust him in the snoot and play him this. He will thank you for it afterwards.\"Writing in The New York Times, Loraine Alterman considered the album to be \"bursting with a great deal of compelling music even if the lyrics at times make as much sense as that cover photo\" and admired the \"fascinating range of sounds\" offered in the title track, as well as the \"lovely, romantic aura\" of \"Bluebird\". While noting the importance of studio production to the overall effect, Alterman wrote: \"McCartney has managed to make the complexities of multi-track recording sound as natural and fresh as tomorrow.\" Jon Landau of Rolling Stone described the album as, \"with the possible exception of John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band, the finest record yet released by any of the four musicians who were once called the Beatles\". Rolling Stone named Band on the Run one of the Best Albums of 1973.Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote in 1981: \"I originally underrated what many consider McCartney's definitive post-Beatles statement, but not as much as its admirers overrate it.

Sure it's a relief after the vagaries of Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway.\" He praised the title track and the \"Afro-soul\" introduction to \"Mamunia\", calling them \"the high points\". Christgau ultimately awarded the album a C+ rating, indicating \"a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork\". In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that, while some songs are excellent and the album overall is enjoyable, it is more about showmanship than content. A subsequent review on Allmusic by Al Campbell was more generous, considering the arrangements and melodic hooks of the songs up to the caliber of McCartney's work in the Beatles and concluding: \"Though it lacks the emotional resonance of contemporaneous releases by John Lennon and George Harrison, McCartney's infallible instinct for popcraft overflows on this excellent release.\" The Rolling Stone review of the 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of the album said that \"the real action still lies in the original LP's revved-up pleasures\". Writing for Mojo magazine in 2011, John Harris included Band on the Run among \"the trilogy of truly essential post-Beatles solo albums\", along with Harrison's All Things Must Pass and Lennon's Plastic Ono Band.In 2000, Q magazine placed Band on the Run at number 75 in its list of the \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever\". In 2012, it was voted 418th on Rolling Stone's revised list of \"the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The album is featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die."

Tori and Kyle Breyer, a couple who are trying but unable to conceive, see an explosion from their house and go out to the crash site. When they reach the crash they find a spaceship with a baby inside, whom they adopt and name Brandon. The spacecraft is then hidden in their barn, which Brandon's parents tell him to stay away from. Around Brandon's 12th birthday, he begins to discover he has exceptional strength, as well as the ability to fly. It is revealed that Brandon has never bled or received a bruise. His disposition also changes, from a sweet child to having anger and temper issues.\nIn middle school, Brandon is an academically exceptional student but socially awkward and frequently bullied. Caitlyn Connor, a girl in Brandon's class, shows sympathy for him and tells him that smart people end up ruling the world. Brandon develops a crush and stalks Caitlyn in her room in the middle of the night, scaring her. One day, during a trust exercise in Physical Education class, Brandon falls towards Caitlyn, but she lets him drop to the ground and calls him a pervert. Angered by her accusation, Brandon crushes her hand and is suspended from school after being accosted by Caitlyn's mother, Erika.\nThat night, Brandon sleepwalks once again to the spaceship and breaks into the barn where it is hidden, cutting his hand on the ship. Tori follows and sees him levitating, chanting the ship's message: \"Take the world\". Tori reveals the truth of his origin, and Brandon angrily trashes the house and later kills Erika. Police find a series of symbols drawn on a window while investigating Erika's disappearance, the same symbols that Brandon is seen drawing in his notebook. The next day, Brandon dons his costume and is then caught sneaking into his aunt and uncle's house by his uncle, Noah.  After Noah threatens to tell his father, Brandon kills him by lifting and dropping his vehicle. The following morning, Tori and Kyle inform Brandon of Noah's death, which the police believe was an accident, but Brandon shows no emotion nor empathy. Suspecting Brandon to be the killer, Kyle finds Brandon's blood-stained shirt and shows it to Tori, but she refuses to believe it.\nKyle takes Brandon on a father-son hunting trip in the woods. Kyle attempts to shoot and kill Brandon with his hunting rifle, but the execution fails when the bullet bounces off the back of Brandon's head. Brandon then kills him with heat vision. A sheriff arrives at the Breyers' and asks to see Brandon. Tori tells the sheriff that Kyle and Brandon are not home, so he shows Tori the symbol found at the scenes of Erika's and Noah's deaths. Tori finds Brandon's notebook with drawings of his murders, the same symbol that the sheriff found at both murders and his message to \"take the world\". She begins to believe Kyle. She tries calling Kyle, but Brandon answers and implies he is now coming for her.\nBrandon returns and begins destroying the house. Tori calls 911, but both the sheriff and his deputy are killed by Brandon before backup can arrive. Remembering that the ship's hull can cut Brandon, Tori runs to the barn and discovers Erika's eviscerated body. As Brandon pursues her, Tori tries to tell him about how much she loves him. She then tries to stab him with a piece of the ship, but Brandon grabs her arm, tosses the shard to the floor, and flies his mother into the sky to drop her from several thousand feet to her death. After he watches her fall, he looks up to see an oncoming airplane.\nThe following morning, the airplane is revealed to have mysteriously crashed into the farmhouse, destroying the evidence of the murders from the previous night. Brandon's symbol is seen painted on a piece of the plane wreckage.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Brandon, now identified as Brightburn, is seen from the perspective of news reports and eyewitness footage over the locations of various disasters, such as a building collapse and a wildfire. An online conspiracy theorist posts his own video analyzing the disasters and referencing attacks by other cryptids elsewhere in the world, urging the public to recognize the potential danger these beings pose and to take action before it's too late."

The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., and was inspired by an article titled \"Top Guns\", written by Ehud Yonay and published in California magazine three years earlier. It stars Tom Cruise as Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, a young naval aviator aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. He and his radar intercept officer, Lieutenant (junior grade) Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards), are given the chance to train at the United States Navy's Fighter Weapons School (Top Gun) at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California. Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer and Tom Skerritt also appear in supporting roles.\nTop Gun was released on May 16, 1986. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews from film critics, but despite this, its visual effects and soundtrack were universally acclaimed. Four weeks after its release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent. Despite its initial mixed critical reaction, the film was a huge commercial hit, grossing $357 million globally against a production budget of $15 million. Top Gun was the highest-grossing domestic film of 1986. The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an IMAX 3D re-release in 2013, while the retrospective critical reception became more positive. Additionally, the soundtrack to the film has since become one of the most popular movie soundtracks to date, reaching 9\u00d7 Platinum certification. The film won both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for \"Take My Breath Away\" performed by Berlin. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A sequel, Top Gun: Maverick, in which Cruise and Kilmer reprised their roles, was released 36 years later on May 27, 2022, and surpassed the original film both critically and commercially."

During an interception with two hostile MiG-28s, Maverick missile-locks on one, while the other hostile locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. Maverick drives it off, but Cougar is so shaken that Maverick defies orders to land and shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar resigns his commission. Maverick and Goose are sent in his place by CAG \"Stinger\" to attend Top Gun, the Naval Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar.\nBefore the first day of instruction, Maverick unsuccessfully approaches a woman at a bar. He learns the next day she is an astrophysicist and civilian Top Gun instructor, Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood. She becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with a MiG-28. In Maverick's first training hop, he flies below 10,000 feet (3,000 m), breaking a major rule of engagement, to defeat instructor Lieutenant Commander Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly. Maverick and Goose also buzz the control tower when specifically told not to do so. They are reprimanded by chief instructor Commander Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf.\nPrivately, Jester tells Viper that while he admires Maverick's skill, he is not sure if he would trust him as a teammate in combat. In class, Charlie objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics against the MiG-28, but privately tells him she admires his flying; they begin a romantic relationship.\nOn training Hop 19, Maverick abandons his wingman \"Hollywood\" to chase Viper. As a result, first Hollywood and then Maverick are defeated in a demonstration of the value of teamwork. Jester tells Maverick his flying is excellent, but criticizes him for leaving his wingman. Maverick's rival, Lieutenant Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, calls his behavior \"foolish\", \"dangerous\", and worse than the enemy, to which Maverick responds \"I am dangerous\".\nMaverick and Iceman, the leading contenders for the Top Gun Trophy, chase an A-4 in Hop 31. As Iceman has trouble getting a lock on the A-4, Maverick pressures him to break off so that he can move into firing position. However, Maverick's F-14 flies through Iceman's jet wash and suffers a flameout of both engines, going into an unrecoverable flat spin. Maverick and Goose eject, but Goose slams into the jettisoned aircraft canopy and dies.\nThe board of inquiry clears Maverick of any wrongdoing, but he is shaken and guilt-ridden, and considers quitting. He seeks advice from Viper, who flew with Maverick's father in the Vietnam War air battle where he was killed. Contrary to official reports faulting Mitchell, Viper says he died heroically. He tells him he can succeed if he regains his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate and congratulates Iceman, who has won the Top Gun Trophy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick receive immediate deployment orders to deal with a crisis situation; they are sent to Enterprise to provide air support for the rescue of the SS Layton, a disabled communication ship that drifted into hostile waters.\nAboard Enterprise, Iceman and Hollywood are assigned to provide air cover, with Maverick and RIO Merlin on standby. Iceman expresses his concerns to Stinger about Maverick's mental state, but is told to just do his job. Iceman and Hollywood are pulled into a dogfight with what first appear to be two MiGs, but turn out to be six. After Hollywood is shot down, Maverick is scrambled alone due to catapult failure. He goes into a spin after encountering another jet wash, but recovers. Shaken, he breaks off temporarily, but then re-engages and shoots down three MiGs. Iceman destroys a fourth, and the remaining two MiGs withdraw. Upon their triumphant return to Enterprise, the pilots share their newfound respect for one another. Finally confident and able to let go of the guilt caused by the training accident, Maverick later throws Goose's dog tags overboard.\nOffered the choice of any assignment, Maverick chooses to return to Top Gun as an instructor. He and Charlie reunite at a bar in Miramar."

Harold Faltermeyer, who previously worked with both Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson on Beverly Hills Cop, was sent the script of Top Gun by Bruckheimer before filming began. Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock worked on numerous songs including the Oscar-winning \"Take My Breath Away\". Kenny Loggins performed two songs on the soundtrack, \"Playing with the Boys\", and \"Danger Zone\". Berlin recorded the song \"Take My Breath Away\", which would later win numerous awards, sending the band to international acclaim. After the release of Loggins's single \"Danger Zone\", sales of the album exploded, selling 7 million in the United States alone. On the re-release of the soundtrack in 2000, two songs that had been omitted from the original album (and had been released many years before the film was made), \"Great Balls of Fire\" by Jerry Lee Lewis and \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" by The Righteous Brothers, were added. The soundtrack also includes \"Top Gun Anthem\" and \"Memories\" by Faltermeyer, with Steve Stevens also performing on the former.\nOther artists were considered for the soundtrack project but did not participate. Bryan Adams was considered as a potential candidate but refused to participate because he felt the film glorified war. The band Toto was originally meant to record \"Danger Zone\", and had also written and recorded a song \"Only You\" for the soundtrack. However, there was a dispute between Toto's lawyers and the producers of the film, paving the way for Loggins to record \"Danger Zone\" and \"Only You\" being omitted from the film entirely.In 2024, the specialized film music label La-La Land Records released a 2 cd-set of the soundtrack. The second disc contains the same tracks that have been made available on previous editions. But the first disc contains the complete instrumental score by Harold Faltermeyer which is officially available for the first time (only the \"Top Gun Anthem\" ended on the first edition of the soundtrack album with the \"Memories\" track added years later on the expanded and deluxe editions)."

        "content": "Smile (sometimes stylized as SMiLE) is an unfinished album by the American rock band the Beach Boys that was intended to follow their 1966 album Pet Sounds. It was to be an LP of twelve tracks assembled from modular fragments, the same editing process used for their \"Good Vibrations\" single. Instead, after a year of recording, the album was shelved and the group released a downscaled version, Smiley Smile, in September 1967. Over the next four decades, few of the original Smile tracks were officially released, and the project came to be regarded as the most legendary unreleased album in popular music history.The album was produced and almost entirely composed by Brian Wilson with guest lyricist and assistant arranger Van Dyke Parks, both of whom conceived the project as a riposte to the British sensibilities that had dominated popular music of the era. Wilson touted Smile as a \"teenage symphony to God\" to surpass Pet Sounds. It was a concept album that was planned to feature word paintings, tape manipulation, more elaborate vocal arrangements, experiments with musical acoustics, themes of youth and innocence, and comedic interludes, with influences drawn from mysticism, pre-rock and roll pop, doo-wop, jazz, ragtime, musique concr\u00e8te, classical, American history, poetry, spirituality, and cartoons. Over 50 hours of tape was recorded, ranging from musical and spoken word to sound effects and role-playing. The lead single would have been \"Heroes and Villains\", about the early history of California, or \"Vega-Tables\", a tongue-in-cheek promotion of organic food.\nNumerous issues, including legal entanglements with Capitol Records, Wilson's uncompromising perfectionism and mental instabilities, as well as Parks' withdrawal from the project in early 1967, prevented the album's completion. Most of the tracks were produced between August and December 1966, but few were ever finished, and the album's structure was never finalized. Afraid of the public's reaction to his work, Wilson blocked attempts to release Smile in the subsequent years. After the group issued a truncated version of \"Heroes and Villains\", they reworked some of the material into new songs, such as \"Cool, Cool Water\", and completed only three more tracks, \"Our Prayer\", \"Cabinessence\" and \"Surf's Up\". A mythology grew around the project, and its unfulfilled potential inspired many artists, especially those in indie rock, post-punk, electronic, and chamber pop genres.\n\nSmile had been estimated to be \"50% done\" by mid-1967. Since the 1980s, extensive session recordings have circulated widely on bootlegs, allowing fans to assemble hypothetical versions of a finished album, adding to its legacy as an interactive project. Responding to this, Capitol included a loose reconstruction of the album on the 1993 box set Good Vibrations. In 2004, Wilson, Parks, and Darian Sahanaja arranged a version of Smile for concert performances, billed as Brian Wilson Presents Smile, which Wilson then adapted into a solo album. He stated that this version differed substantially from his original vision. The 2011 compilation The Smile Sessions was the first official package devoted to the original Beach Boys' recordings and included an approximation of the completed album. It received universal acclaim and won Best Historical Album at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards in 2013."

        "content": "In late 1964, as Brian Wilson's industry profile grew, he became acquainted with various individuals from around the Los Angeles music scene. He also took an increasing interest in recreational drugs (particularly marijuana, LSD, and Desbutal). According to his then-wife Marilyn, Wilson's new friends \"had the gift of gab [...] All of a sudden [Brian] was in Hollywood\u2014these people talk a language that was fascinating to him. Anybody that was different and talked cosmic or whatever [...] he liked it.\" Wilson's closest friend in this period was Loren Schwartz, an aspiring talent agent that he met at a recording studio. Schwartz introduced Wilson to marijuana and LSD, as well as a wealth of literature commonly read by college students. During his first LSD trip, Wilson had what he considered to be \"a very religious experience\" and claimed to have seen God.\nIn November 1965, early in the sessions for the Beach Boys' 11th studio LP Pet Sounds, Wilson began experimenting with the idea of recording an album focused on humor and laughter. He was intent on making Pet Sounds a complete departure from previous Beach Boys releases and did not wish to work with his usual lyricist, Mike Love. Instead, he worked with jingle writer Tony Asher on most of the album's songs. On February 17, 1966, Wilson began tracking their song \"Good Vibrations\", which was intended for Pet Sounds but omitted due to Wilson's dissatisfaction with the recording. He attempted a couple of different arrangements of the track from then until April.Wilson stated at the time that he \"wanted to write [songs] with more than one level. Eventually, I would like to see longer singles\u2014so that the song can be more meaningful. A song can, for instance, have movements\u2014in the same way as a classical concerto\u2014only capsulized.\" Starting with the fourth session held for \"Good Vibrations\", on May 4, he began recording the song in sections, rather than tracking the full piece all the way through, with the intention of later splicing the fragments into a composite track.\nReleased on May 16, Pet Sounds was massively influential, containing sophisticated orchestral arrangements that raised the band's prestige to the top level of rock innovators. In the US, the album confused their fans and sold worse than previous Beach Boys releases, but in the UK, the reception was highly favorable. The UK success emboldened Wilson to take greater creative risks and helped convince the band's label, Capitol Records, to fund and promote his next project, however ambitious it may be."

        "content": "Although Smile is a concept album, the surviving recordings do not lend themselves to any formal narrative development, only to themes and experiences. According to Heiser, there is also a wealth of material that appears to have \"little, if anything to do with [an] Americana theme\". Other themes involved physical fitness, childhood, and the natural environment. Web journal Freaky Trigger states: \"While the lyrics are usually pretty damned literary, at their most extreme, they're divorced from any kind of meaning in the straightforward sense.\" Parks rebuked the suggestion that Smile was planned as a concept album and said that the work was only envisioned \"to use the American vernacular at a time when there was a lot of soundalike Beatle-esque music around.\"By contrast, musicologist Philip Lambert describes Smile as \"an American history lesson seen through the eyes of a time-travelling bicycle rider on a journey from Plymouth Rock to Hawaii.\" Documentarian Keith Badman states that Wilson intended the album to be an American-themed exploration of the innocence of youth and childhood. Williams concluded that it was to be \"perhaps the story of the unnatural love affair between one man's voice and a harpsichord\". A melodic and rhythmic motif (sometimes called the \"Bicycle Rider\" theme) was configured into several tracks, which he said \"[broke] down the walls that give songs identities without ever offering conceptual ('rock opera') explanation or resolution.\"Parks' lyrics employed wordplay, allusions, and quotations. He acknowledged that there were occasional \"references\" to specific historical entities, however, \"I don't think that I was interested in wordplay as much as I was interested in the power of words.\" References to American history range from the emergence of railroads and automobiles to Western colonialism and its impact on Native American tribes. Scholar Darren Reid interpreted the focus on older American themes as a self-conscious, deeper reflection on the hedonistic, modern Americana of the Beach Boys' earlier songs. He said that, despite Wilson's later claims that the album was about humor and happiness, \"the resultant album does not radiate predominately happy mood. [...] Perhaps the smile Wilson refers to is an ironic one [...] Humour, sarcasm, and lonely introspection are the contrasts that hold Smile together.\"Some songs followed themes related to God and childhood, namely \"Wonderful\", \"Child Is Father of the Man\", and \"Surf's Up\". Only \"Wonderful\" referred to God explicitly. Parks supported that his associations with the spiritual aspect of Wilson's work were \"inescapable\", but professed that he disliked writing lyrics that dealt with religious belief, believing it gave the appearance of \"trying to be uppity\". In his recollection, \"There's a lot of things about belief in Smile, and its very question of belief is what was plaguing Brian at that time. What should we keep from the structure that we had, the hard-wiring that we had with religion? He had religion beat into him, and I did in my own way, too. So there's a lot of thinking about belief.\"Asked what words come to mind when listening to Smile in 2011, Wilson replied, \"Childhood. Freedom. A rejection of adult rules and adult conformity. Our message was, 'Adults keep out. This is about the spirit of youth.'\" In another interview that year, he questioned a journalist how they would categorize Smile. They responded with \"impressionistic psychedelic folk rock\", and said that while most rock seems to be about adulthood, Smile \"expresses what it's like to be a kid in an impressionistic way\" and \"depicts the psychedelic magic of childhood\", to which Wilson replied: \"I love that. You coin those just right.\"Carter summarized that Smile's subject matter engaged with matters related to history, culture, and society while also traversing \"complex landscapes of faith: from national allegiance and ideological persuasion to religious belief and spiritual devotion.\" He argued that \"Smile picks up where Pet Sounds left off\", expanding the introspective themes of Pet Sounds into \"an exploration of the nation's historical, social, ideological, and cultural identity.\" In his view, the lyrics also espouse \"an antiestablishment skepticism toward religious institutions\", \"an interest in alternative belief structures\", and \"exceptionalist leanings\"."

        "content": "Capitol gave Smile the catalog number DT2580. At least two versions of the album jacket were designed, with minor differences. It was to have included cover artwork designed by graphic artist Frank Holmes, a friend of Parks, as well as a booklet containing several pen-and-ink drawings, also by Holmes. He met with Wilson and Parks circa June 1966 and was given lyric sheets of their songs, for which he based his drawings on. By Holmes' recollection, his contributions were finished by October. The pieces were titled:\n\nHolmes based the cover on an abandoned jewelry store near his home in Pasadena. He recalled, \"I thought that was a good image because of the way, any time you go into a store, you're entering something [...] This was something that would be pulling you into the world of Smile\u2013the Smile Shoppe\u2013and it had these little smiles all around.\" Depicted inside the shop is \"a husband and wife\u2014a kind of early-Americana, old-style, 19th-century kind of image.\" Wilson approved the cover and took it to Capitol. Parks later said that the illustrations heavily informed the making of Smile and considered them to be the album's \"third equation\". He felt that he and Wilson would not have continued the project the way they did without thinking of it in cartoon terms.According to Vosse, the smile shop derived from Wilson's humor concept. He said that \"everybody who knew anything about graphics, and about art, thought that the cover was not terribly well done [...] but Brian knew better; he was right. It was exactly what he wanted, precisely what he wanted.\" Parks recalled: \"Frank was supposed to do something 'light-hearted', but there were no specific instructions and he came up with the perfect video vessel for realizing what we were doing, something I thought was an integral part of the situation. I think that still stands; I think of Smile in visual terms.\nIn September, Capitol began production on a lavish gatefold cover with a 12-page booklet containing featuring color photographs of the group (ultimately selected from a November 7 photoshoot in Boston conducted by Guy Webster as well as Holmes' illustrations). In early 1967, they added the repeated written instances of \"Good Vibrations\" on the album cover, which were not featured on Holmes' original design. The back cover featured a monochrome photograph depiction of the group, without Brian, framed by astrological symbols. Capitol produced 466,000 copies of the record sleeve and 419,200 copies of the accompanying booklet. They were stored in a warehouse in Pennsylvania until the 1990s."

Seth and Evan's friend Fogell plans to obtain a fake ID, so Seth promises to buy Jules alcohol for the party. Evan runs into his own love interest, Becca, and offers to get her a specific bottle of vodka.\nDespite the obviously fake ID, Fogell successfully buys the liquor, but is knocked out by a robber. When police officers Slater and Michaels arrive, Seth and Evan, who are outside, believe that Fogell is being arrested. In fact, the officers have agreed to give \"McLovin\" a ride to the party.\nWhile outside the liquor store, Seth is hit by a motorist. In exchange for Seth and Evan not telling the police, the driver promises to take them to another party, where they can get alcohol. Meanwhile, Slater and Michaels take Fogell on a ride-along and then bond with him. Despite being on duty, they start drinking, use their sirens improperly, and shoot at a stop sign.\nAt the party, Seth fills laundry detergent bottles from the basement with alcohol and dances with a drunk girl. She stains his leg with menstrual blood, while a group of intoxicated men make Evan sing \"These Eyes\" for them. Seth is confronted by the party's host for dancing with his fianc\u00e9e, and a brawl ensues; the police are called, while Seth and Evan escape.\nSeth begins to chastise Evan for bailing on him; explaining that they had made childhood plans to go to college together but Evan got accepted into Dartmouth. Evan retorts that Seth is selfish and has held him back for years, concluding he does not want Seth to slow him down anymore. As they begin to argue more, Seth is again hit by a car \u2013 the police cruiser driven by Slater and Michaels. They plan to pin the blame of the crash on Seth, but as Fogell emerges from the car, Evan makes a run for it, and Seth and Fogell escape with the alcohol. Eventually, all three make their way to Jules' party.\nAt the party, Fogell inadvertently reveals that he and Evan will be rooming together at college, upsetting Seth. Seth's stories of the night's antics make him popular, while Becca wants to have sex with Evan, who declines since she is drunk.\nMeanwhile, Fogell impresses Nicola, an attractive foreign exchange student, and goes upstairs to have sex with her. Seth drunkenly attempts to kiss Jules, but she turns him down because she neither drinks nor wants Seth while he is drunk. He believes he has ruined his chances with her, then passes out, accidentally headbutting Jules and giving her a black eye.\nSlater and Michaels bust the party. Seth wakes up and escapes, carrying an intoxicated Evan. Slater busts in on Fogell and Nicola having sex, causing her to run off. Slater yells at Fogell for ditching them, but Michaels points out they just interrupted him. They apologize and reveal they knew all along that Fogell was underage but played along, wanting to show cops can have fun too. To make it up to Fogell, they handcuff him and make a spectactle of perp-walking him to their cruiser, which is highly effective in making him look \"badass\". They resume their bonding, eventually destroying their car with a Molotov cocktail while Fogell shoots it with Slater's gun.\nSeth and Evan have a sleepover together at Evan's, where Seth reveals that he learned weeks earlier that Evan and Fogell planned to live together at college. Evan admits he does not want to room with Fogell but is afraid to live with strangers. They apologize to each other before reconciling.\nThe next day, Seth and Evan visit the mall and run into Jules and Becca. Becca and Seth apologize for their drunken behavior, and the boys pair off with the girls: Seth takes Jules to buy concealer for the black eye he gave her, while Evan and Becca leave to buy a comforter to replace the one she drunkenly vomited on."

After we became the Rockets, we were going to play the Whiskey in Hollywood. We asked him to come sit in with us, which he did. We then formed into Crazy Horse and recorded Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. The sessions went free and easy, like they are to this day. No rehearsals. Neil walks in with a song, then we jump in. We get it in one, two takes. After that, the feel, heart and emotion are lost. Any more takes, and now you're just playing a part. When you're young, there are no politics, nothing to get in the way.

That whole\nalbum was like catching the group just as they were getting to know each other. We didn't even know what we sounded like until we\nheard the album.\" He continues in an April 1970 interview for Rolling Stone: \"Really literally, we'd only been together for six or seven days when \"Down By The River\" was cut. I just wanted to go ahead and do it, I just wanted to catch it, because there is something on those records that was recorded like it was when we were really feeling each other out, you know, and we didn't know each other, but we were turned on to what was happening. So I wanted to record that, because that never gets recorded. And that's what that album is, it's just the bare beginnings.\"\nYoung credits the album's unique sound to the guitar playing of Danny Whitten and the interplay between the two. He explains in the biography Shakey: \"That's what was so great about Crazy Horse in those days: Danny understood my music, and everyone listened to Danny. He understood what we were doing. A really great second guitar player, the perfect counterpoint to everything else that was happening. His style of playing was so adventuresome. So sympathetic. So unthoughtful. And just so natural. That\u2019s really what made \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" and \"Down by the River\" happen: Danny\u2019s guitar parts. Nobody played guitar with me like that; that rhythm. When you listen to \"Cowgirl in the Sand,\" he keeps changing: plays something one and a half, maybe two, times, and he's on to the next thing. Billy and Ralph will get into a groove and everything will be goin' along and all of a sudden Danny'll start doin' somethin' else. He just led those guys from one groove to another, all within the same groove. So when I played these long guitar solos, it seemed like they weren't all that long, that I was making all these changes, when in reality what was changing was not one thing, but the whole band. Danny was the key.\""

        "content": "The album represents a break from the recording methods of Young's work with Buffalo Springfield and his debut album, in which layers of overdubs are used to create each track. Instead, the songs on the album were largely recorded live, without overdubs. Young explains to DJ B. Mitchell Reid: \"That\u2019s when a change came over me, right then. I started just tryin' to be real instead of fabricate something. Since then I've just been striving to get realer and realer on record. As in more real.\" For the first time, Young would record his vocal live while playing. \"My only concern was to make the fuckin' records sound right. When I finally got the studio together and played, I think, \"Running Dry,\" that was my first live vocal.\"\nIn a 1970 interview for Rolling Stone's Elliot Blinder, Young says that he was trying to achieve a sound on the record reminiscent of 1950s and 1960s singles where the singer and band achieve a tight, locked-in sound together: \"I'm trying to make records of the quality of the records that were made in the late Fifties and the Sixties, like Everly Brothers records and Roy Orbison records and things like that. They were all done with a sort of quality to them. They were done at once. It's just a quality about them, the singer is into the song and the musicians were playing with the singer and it was an entity, you know. It was something special that used to hit me all the time, that all these people were thinking the same thing, and they're all playing at the same time. It happens on a few cuts, you can hear it. I think \"Cinnamon Girl,\" \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,\" and \"Round And Round\" has that feeling of togetherness, although it was just Danny and me and Robin Lane.\"\nYoung enlisted David Briggs to produce the record. Young first collaborated with Briggs during the recording of his debut album. The first sessions for the album were held in late January 1969 at Wally Heider Studios in Hollywood, where the band cut \"Down by the River,\" \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" and \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.\"\n\"Down by the River\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" are edited from extended performances, and in some cases combine multiple takes. Young explains that three of four takes of each song were recorded in a 2009 interview for Guitar World Magazine: \"You know, maybe what you hear on the record would be take one, but with a couple pieces of something else in there. I could look it up. We have all the track sheets. All that information could be made available through Archives updates. We could make it so you could go in and figure out exactly what take you're listening to of a specific song. He continues in Shakey: \"'Down by the River' was really edited. We got the vibe, but it was just too long and sometimes it fell apart, so we just took the shitty parts out. Made some radical cuts in there; I mean, you can hear 'em. But Danny just played so cool on that. He made the whole band sound good. Me and Billy and Ralph sounded like Crazy Horse right away. All I had to do was come up with the songs and the riffs. I started realizing how long we could jam. It was fantastic.\"Young's lead vocal track on the song \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" (on the original album) was actually a temporary scratch vocal he sang through the low-quality talk-back microphone on the mixing board, with no effects such as reverb. Young liked the stark contrast to the rest of the recording.\nThe group would take a break in recording from the end of January until late March. Young would perform a series of solo acoustic sets at Le Hibou Coffee House in Ottawa and at the Riverboat Coffee House in Toronto. The Riverboat concerts would see release in 2009 as Live at the Riverboat 1969. Crazy Horse would then join Young for additional dates at coffeehouse folk clubs in late February through March. Young would perform a solo acoustic set followed by a band set, performing at The Bitter End in New York, in Cleveland, Providence, and at the Troubadour in Hollywood.The band would return to Wally Heider on March 20 and record \"Cinnamon Girl,\" \"Losing End\" and \"Running Dry\". \"Cinnamon Girl\" features handclaps, inspired by the 1963 single \"My Boyfriend's Back\" by The Angels. An early single mix of the song features the vocals of Danny Whitten more prominently, with both singers equal in the mix. Young changed the mix for the album, a decision he regrets: \"I have made an Early Daze record of the Horse, and you can hear a different vocal of \"Cinnamon Girl\" featuring more of Danny. He was singing the high part, and it came through big-time. I changed it so I sang the high part and put that out. That was a big mistake. I fucked up. I did not know who Danny was. He was better than me. I didn't see it. I was strong, and maybe I helped destroy something sacred by not seeing it. He was never pissed off about it. It wasn't like that. I was young, and maybe I didn't know what I was doing. Some things you wish never happened. But we got what we got.\"\"Cinnamon Girl\" is noted for its one-note guitar solo. According to Young, \"people say that it is a solo with only one note but, in my head, each one of those notes is different. The more you get into it, the more you can hear the differences.\u201d He elaborates in a 1991 interview: \"The same note on two strings. The wang bar made every one sound different. When people say 'one-note solo,' I listen to it and every one sounds different to me. It sounds like it's all different in that one place. As you're going in farther, you\u2019re hearing all the differences, but if you get back, it's all one.\"On March 23, the band convened with singer Robin Lane at Sunwest Recording Studio in Hollywood to record the final song for the album. \"Round and Round\" was performed live in the studio for the album to achieve a more authentic sound. Young would explain in an April 1970 interview for Rolling Stone: \"There were three people sitting like you and me, and then another, and six microphone booms coming down, absolutely stoned out of our minds in the studio, singing a song with the guitars, three guitars goin' at once. If you listen to it, \"Round And Round\" is one of my favorites on the second album, because ... the echo from the acoustic guitar on the right echoes back on the left, and the echo from the guitar on the left comes back on the right and it makes the guitars go like this: one line starts goin' like da-da-daow, and then you can hear like one voice comes in and out, and that's 'cause Danny was rockin' back and forth. Those things are not featured, they're just in it, you know, and that's what I'm trying to get at. I think they last longer that way. Doing it live and singing and playing all at once just makes it sound more real.\" Singer Robin Lane was caught off guard that her performance on the song became the master take. \"I thought we were rehearsing. I didn\u2019t even know what I was singing. Neil was the original punk rocker.\""

        "content": "Upon its release, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere received generally favorable reviews from critics. Bruce Miroff of Rolling Stone wrote a favorable review, describing Young's voice as \"perpetually mournful, without being maudlin or pathetic. It hints at a world in which sorrow underlies everything [...] because that world is recognizable to most of us, Young's singing is often strangely moving.\" Despite stating that \"in several respects [the album] falls short of his previous effort\" and that \"the lyricism of the first album can only be found in faint traces,\" he concluded that the album \"offers ample rewards. Young's music partially makes up for its lack of grace by its energy and its assurance.\" Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice that \"Young is a strange artist and I am not all the way into him yet, but this record is haunting\". The original review was printed with a grade of \"B+\", but Christgau later said he would have changed it to an \"A\u2212\".In a retrospective review in Rolling Stone, Greg Kot called the record \"raw, rushed, energised\", and the band's interplay \"at once primitive and abstract\", a \"gloriously spontaneous sound\" that \"would endure, not only as a blueprint for Young...but as an influence on countless bands.\" William Ruhlmann of music database website AllMusic said of the album, \"released only four months after his first [album], [it] was nearly a total rejection of that polished effort.\" He noted that \"Cinnamon Girl,\" \"Down by the River,\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" were \"useful as frames on which to hang the extended improvisations Young played with Crazy Horse and to reflect the ominous tone of his singing\". He concluded that the album \"set a musical pattern Young and his many musical descendants have followed ever since [...] and a lot of contemporary bands were playing music clearly influenced by it\". Mark Richardson of Pitchfork wrote, \"the opening riff to 'Cinnamon Girl' erases the memory of Neil Young completely in about five seconds\" and that \"Crazy Horse were loose and sloppy, privileging groove and feeling above all\". He also said that \"Young sounds comfortable and confident, singing with the versatile voice that has changed remarkably little in the 40 years since\" and concluded that it \"was a sort of big bang for Young, a dense moment of creative explosion that saw possibilities expanding in every direction\".In 2003, the album was ranked number 208 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and 210 in a 2012 revised list, and number 407 in the 2020 edition. In 2013, the album was ranked 398 on NME's list of the '500 Greatest Albums of all time'. In 2018, the album won the Polaris Heritage Prize Audience Award in the 1960\u20131975 category."

        "content": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a 1974 American independent horror film  produced, co-composed, and directed by Tobe Hooper, who co-wrote it with Kim Henkel. The film stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow, and Gunnar Hansen. The plot follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. The film was marketed as being based on true events to attract a wider audience and to act as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate. Although the character of Leatherface and minor story details were inspired by the crimes of murderer Ed Gein, its plot is largely fictional.\nHooper produced the film for less than $140,000 ($900,000 adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, so that he could finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor, but it was eventually acquired by the Bryanston Distributing Company. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally, being banned in several countries, and numerous theaters stopped showing the film in response to complaints about its violence.\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released in the United States on October 11, 1974.  While the film initially received mixed reception from critics, it was highly profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office, equivalent with roughly over $150.8 million as of 2019, selling over 16.5 million tickets in 1974. It has since gained a reputation as one of the best and most influential horror films. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, including the use of power tools as murder weapons, the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, masked figure, and the killing of victims. It led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, prequels, a remake, comic books, and video games."

        "content": "In the early hours of August 18, 1973, a grave robber steals several remains from a cemetery near Newt, Muerto County, Texas.  The robber ties a rotting corpse and other body parts onto a monument, creating a grisly display which is discovered by a local resident as the sun rises.\nDriving in a van, five young people take a road trip through the area: Sally Hardesty, Jerry, Pam, Kirk, and Sally's handicapped brother Franklin.  They stop at the cemetery to check on the grave of Sally and Franklin's grandfather, which appears undisturbed.  As the group drive past a slaughterhouse, Franklin recounts the Hardesty family's history with animal slaughter.  They pick up a hitchhiker who says that his own family also has experience with animal slaughter.  When the group refuse to pay the hitchhiker for a photograph, he attacks Franklin and smears a bloody symbol on the side of the van as he is ejected.  Low on gas, the van stops at a station whose proprietor says that no fuel is available.  The group explore a nearby abandoned house, owned by the Hardesty family.\nKirk and Pam leave the others behind, planning to go swimming.  They discover another nearby house, running gas-powered generators.  Hoping to barter for gas, Kirk enters the house.  A large man wearing a mask made of skin attacks Kirk with a hammer, killing him.  When Pam enters the house, she finds its living room strewn with human and animal bones.  The man grabs her, impales her on a meat hook, and starts up a gas-powered chainsaw to dismember Kirk's body as Pam watches.  In the evening, Jerry searches for Pam and Kirk.  When he enters the other house, he finds Pam's nearly-dead, spasming body in a chest freezer.  The masked man kills Jerry with a hammer.\nAt night, Sally and Franklin start towards the other house.  The masked man ambushes them, killing Franklin with the chainsaw.  The man chases Sally into the house, where she finds a very old, seemingly dead man and a woman's rotting corpse.  The masked man chases Sally back to the gas station and vanishes.  The station's proprietor comforts Sally for a moment, after which he beats and subdues her, loading her into his pickup truck.  The proprietor drives to the other house, and the hitchhiker appears.  The proprietor scolds him for his actions at the cemetery, identifying the hitchhiker as the grave robber.  As they enter the house, the masked man reappears, dressed in women's clothing.  The proprietor identifies the masked man and the hitchhiker as brothers, and the hitchhiker refers to the masked man as \"Leatherface\".  The two brothers bring the old man\u2014\"Grandpa\"\u2014down the stairs and cut Sally's finger so that Grandpa can suck her blood.  Sally faints.\nThe next morning, Sally regains consciousness.  The men taunt her and bicker with each other, resolving to kill her with a hammer.  They try to include Grandpa in the activity, but Grandpa's grip is weak, and he drops the hammer repeatedly.  Sally breaks free and runs onto a road in front of the house, pursued by the brothers.  An oncoming truck accidentally runs over the hitchhiker, killing him.  The truck driver attacks Leatherface with a large wrench, injuring him, and escapes on foot.  Sally, covered in blood, flags down a passing pickup truck and climbs into the bed, narrowly escaping Leatherface.  As the pickup drives away, Sally laughs giddily.  Leatherface flails his chainsaw in frustration as the sun rises."

        "content": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre premiered in Austin, Texas, on October 1, 1974, almost a year after filming concluded. It screened nationally in the United States as a Saturday afternoon matin\u00e9e and its false marketing as a \"true story\" helped it attract a broad audience. For eight years after 1976, it was annually reissued to first-run theaters, promoted by full-page ads. The film eventually grossed more than $30 million in the United States and Canada ($14.4 million in rentals), making it the 12th highest-grossing film initially released in 1974, despite its minuscule budget. Among independent films, it was overtaken in 1978 by John Carpenter's Halloween, which grossed $47 million.\n\nHooper reportedly hoped that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) would give the complete, uncut release print a \"PG\" rating due to its minimal amount of visible gore. Instead, it was originally rated \"X\". After several minutes were cut, it was resubmitted to the MPAA and received an \"R\" rating. A distributor apparently restored the offending material, and at least one theater presented the full version under an \"R\". In San Francisco, cinema-goers walked out of theaters in disgust and in February 1976, two theaters in Ottawa, Canada, were advised by local police to withdraw the film lest they face morality charges.After its initial British release, including a one-year theatrical run in London, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was initially banned on the advice of British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) Secretary Stephen Murphy, and subsequently by his successor, James Ferman. While the British ban was in force the word \"chainsaw\" itself was barred from movie titles, forcing imitators to rename their films. In 1998, despite the BBFC ban, Camden London Borough Council granted the film a license. The following year the BBFC passed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre uncut for release with an 18 certificate, and it was broadcast a year later on Channel 4.When the 83-minute version of the film was submitted to the  Australian Classification Board by distributor Seven Keys in June 1975, the Board denied the film a classification, and similarly refused classification of a 77-minute print in December that year. In 1981, the 83-minute version submitted by Greater Union Film Distributors was again refused registration. It was later submitted by Filmways Australasian Distributors and approved for an \"R\" rating in 1984. It was banned for periods in many other countries, including Brazil, Chile, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and West Germany. In Sweden, it would also symbolize a video nasty, a discussed topic at the time."

The British Board of Film Classification had long since refused a certification for the uncut theatrical version and in 1984 they also refused to certify it for home video, amid a moral panic surrounding \"video nasties\". After the retirement of BBFC Director James Ferman in 1999, the board passed the film uncut for theatrical and video distribution with an 18 certificate, almost 25 years after the original release. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released on LaserDisc in the United States in November 1993. It was initially released on DVD in October 1998 in the United States, May 2000 in the United Kingdom and 2001 in Australia.\nIn 2005 the film received a 2K scan and full restoration from the original 16mm A/B rolls, which was subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2014, a more extensive 4K restoration, supervised by Hooper, using the original 16mm A/B reversal rolls, was carried out. After a screening in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, this was also released on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide. Dark Sky Films' US 40th Anniversary Edition was nominated for Best DVD/BD Special Edition Release at the 2015 Saturn Awards.In 1982, shortly after The Texas Chain Saw Massacre established itself as a success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls. As one of the first horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.The film has been followed by eight other films to date, including sequels, prequels and remakes. The first sequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), was considerably more graphic and violent than the original and was banned in Australia for 20 years before it was released on DVD in a revised special edition in October 2006. Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) was the second sequel to appear, though Hooper did not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts with another film, Spontaneous Combustion. Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, was released in 1995. While briefly acknowledging the events of the preceding two sequels, its plot makes it a virtual remake of the 1974 original. A straight remake, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was released by Platinum Dunes and New Line Cinema in 2003. It was followed by a prequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, in 2006. A seventh film, Texas Chainsaw 3D, was released on January 4, 2013. It is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, with no relation to the previous sequels, or the 2003 remake. Another prequel, Leatherface, was released exclusively to DirecTV on September 21, 2017, before receiving a wider release on video on demand and in limited theaters, simultaneously, in North America on October 20, 2017. Another sequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was released exclusively on Netflix on February 18, 2022."

Issued at the height of the band's popularity, it reached the top spot on the US album chart\u2014the band's fourth consecutive album to do so\u2014and peaked at number 2 on the UK album chart. Both singles from the album also reached the top 5 of the UK and US singles charts, with \"Silly Love Songs\" reaching number 1 in the US.\nThe album was recorded and released in the midst of Wings' highly successful Wings Over the World tour, with songs from the album performed on the tour after its release. Subsequently, performances of \"Let 'Em In\", \"Time to Hide\", 'Silly Love Songs' and \"Beware My Love\" were included on the live album Wings over America, released in December 1976.\nAs a reaction to critics who believed Wings was merely a vehicle for Paul McCartney, the album featured every member of the band taking lead vocals on at least one song, and two songs from the album are written or co-written by band members other than the McCartneys."

It was the first time McCartney had fully recorded an album in England since Red Rose Speedway. Because of the tour commitments, Wings were not afforded the opportunity to record in another locale. By the end of February, the album was complete, and Wings went back on the road.\nAround the time of the studio sessions for Wings at the Speed of Sound, Wings were facing criticism for being merely a vehicle for McCartney. He encouraged each of the band members to contribute a song during the sessions. McCartney had previously attempted to create a democratic album in Red Rose Speedway, though it would be rejected by his record label.Engineer Peter Henderson later commented, \"I remember one of my first engineering jobs, working with Paul McCartney on Wings at the Speed of Sound \u2014 he'd do two vocal takes and ask, 'Which is the better one?' And when he played guitar, he'd really lean into it and give it everything he got.\"\nTwo tracks (\"The Note You Never Wrote\" and \"Warm and Beautiful\") were arranged by Fiachra Trench."

The introduction, \"Let 'Em In\" was perceived as an invitation to join the McCartneys on this fantasy day, with explanation of their philosophy (\"Silly Love Songs\"), a lunch break (\"Cook of the House\"), and a chance to get to know McCartney's friends (Denny Laine in \"The Note You Never Wrote\", Jimmy McCulloch in \"Wino Junko\", etc.).The album reached number 2 in the United Kingdom (and was the 4th best-selling album of 1976). It became McCartney's most successful American chart album since his days in the Beatles, spending seven nonconsecutive weeks at number 1 throughout the summer (blocking the new Beatles compilation Rock 'n' Roll Music, which reached number 2). Wings at the Speed of Sound sold 3.5 million copies worldwide.Much of the album's success can be attributed to its two smash singles: \"Silly Love Songs\", a response to his critics, which became one of 1976's biggest-selling singles, followed by \"Let 'Em In\", which also scaled the singles charts. Amid all this, Wings finally went to North America for the Wings Over America Tour, playing McCartney's first shows there in ten years (after the Beatles' final tour of America in 1966) to euphoric reaction; four selections from Speed of Sound were included in the tour setlist.\nDenny Laine covered \"Time to Hide\" and \"The Note You Never Wrote\" in 1996 on his album Denny Laine Performs the Hits of Wings."

        "content": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an American supernatural drama television series created by writer and director Joss Whedon. It is based on the 1992 film of the same name, also written by Whedon, although they are separate and otherwise unrelated productions. Whedon served as executive producer and showrunner under his production tag Mutant Enemy Productions.\nThe series premiered on March 10, 1997, on The WB and concluded on May 20, 2003, on UPN. The series follows Buffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar), the latest in a succession of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"Slayers\". In the story, Slayers, or the \"Chosen Ones\", are chosen by fate to battle against vampires, demons and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a Watcher, who guides, teaches and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\" \u2013 a reference to the animated franchise Scooby-Doo that features a group of friends solving mysteries together.\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, and is often listed among the greatest television series of all time. Original airings often reached four to six million viewers. Although lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox), these ratings were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network. Despite being mostly ignored by major award programs like the Emmys, the series was nominated for the American Film Institute Award for Drama Series of the Year, Gellar was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama for her performance in the show and the series was nominated five times for Television Critics Association Awards, winning once in 2003 for the Television Critics Association Heritage Award.\nThe success of Buffy has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including novels, comics and video games. The series has received attention in fandom (including fan films), parody, and academia, and has influenced the direction of other television series. Buffy was part of a wave of television series from the late 1990s and early 2000s that featured strong female characters, alongside Charmed, Xena: Warrior Princess, La Femme Nikita, Dark Angel, and Alias. The series, as well as its spin-off series, Angel, and extensions thereof, have been collectively termed the \"Buffyverse\"."

        "content": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer first aired on March 10, 1997 (as a mid-season replacement for the series Savannah) on The WB, and played a key role in the growth of the Warner Bros. television network in its early years. After five seasons, it transferred to UPN for its final two seasons. In 2001, the show went into syndication in the United States on local stations and on cable channel FX; the local airings ended in 2005, and the FX airings lasted until 2008 but returned to the network in 2013. Beginning in January 2010, it began to air in syndication in the United States on Logo. Reruns also briefly aired on MTV. In March 2010, it began to air in Canada on MuchMusic and MuchMore. On November 7, 2010, it began airing on Chiller with a 24-hour marathon; the series airs weekdays. Chiller also aired a 14-hour Thanksgiving Day marathon on November 25, 2010. In 2011, it began airing on Oxygen and TeenNick. On June 22, 2015, it began airing on ABC Family.\nWhile the seventh season was still being broadcast, Sarah Michelle Gellar told Entertainment Weekly she was not going to sign on for an eighth year; \"When we started to have such a strong year this year, I thought: 'This is how I want to go out, on top, at our best.'\" Whedon and UPN gave some considerations to production of a spin-off series that would not require Gellar, including a rumored Faith series, but nothing came of those plans. The Buffy canon continued outside the television medium in the Dark Horse Comics series, Buffy Season Eight. This was produced starting March 2007 by Whedon, who also wrote the first story arc, \"The Long Way Home\".In the United Kingdom, the entire series aired on Sky One and BBC Two. After protests from fans about early episodes being edited for their pre-watershed time-slot, from the second run (mid-second season onwards), the BBC gave the show two time slots: the early-evening slot (typically Thursday at 6:45 pm) for a family-friendly version with violence, objectionable language and other stronger material cut out, and a late-night uncut version (initially late-night Sundays, but for most of the run, late-night Fridays; exact times varied). Sky1 aired the show typically at 8:00 pm on Thursdays. From the fourth season onwards, the BBC aired the show in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen format. Whedon later said that Buffy was never intended to be viewed this way. Despite his claims, Syfy now airs repeat showings in the widescreen format.\nIn August 2014, Pivot announced that, for the first time, episodes of Buffy would be broadcast in high-definition and in a widescreen 16:9 format authorized by the studio, but not by any of the series' principals. The transfer was poorly received by some fans, owing to a number of technical and format changes that were viewed as detrimental to the show's presentation; various scenes were heavily cropped to fit the 16:9 format, and shots were altered to have a brighter look, often with color levels altered. Other problems included missing filters, editing errors, and poorly re-rendered CGI. Series creator Joss Whedon and other members of the original team also expressed their displeasure.The series became available on Disney+ (under the Star brand) beginning February 2021, and was added to Comet's digital network in 2022."

Raphael also has an illegitimate son, Bernard, with his former maid Maria Laurel. When Maria and Bernard have nowhere else to go, Raphael takes both of them in. Unaware that they are siblings, Bernard, who is gay, and Detty become close friends, as both share their love for fashion. When Kara discovers Raphael and Maria sleeping with each other, as well as realizing that Raphael is Bernard's father, she confronts them in front of Bernard and Detty, kicks them out, and accidentally pushes Maria down the stairs, leaving her paralyzed. With no assistance from the family or the other maids, Bernard swears vengeance against the Sabrosos.\nMany years later, the adult Detty and Bernard have different lives. Following the bankruptcy of her tailor shop, Detty struggles to make ends meet for her children Kathy and Cindy, for whom she is fighting for custody from her ex-husband. Bernard, going by the name \"Bernice\", owns the successful fashion brand Ponytale, which he rules with an iron fist, and lives in a large mansion with Maria and Angelo, the son of Bernice's deceased former maid. Detty applies for a job as an executive assistant at Ponytale, unaware that Bernice is her estranged sibling. With encouragement from his mother, Bernice sees this as his long-awaited opportunity for revenge by hiring her and giving her absurd and embarrassing tasks. He also advises Angelo to pursue and date Kathy, who is his schoolmate, and then dump her to break her heart. Despite her duties becoming increasingly odd, Detty accepts and accomplishes her tasks with no complaints. Bernice begins to second-guess his intentions, but his mother advises him to continue with his plans.\nAt the Run Away Fashion Show, Bernice confronts his rival Roselle Hermosa, who owns the equally successful La Yondelle and competes with him for a European partnership deal. When La Yondelle's collection turns out to be stolen from Ponytale's, Detty devises a last-minute plan to revise the fashion line. The revamped line is a success, but Bernice, angry about the stolen designs, does not thank Detty for rescuing the brand. A frustrated Detty attempts to resign, but Bernice convinces her to stay by raising her salary and increasing her work benefits.\nRoselle decides to hire the Brazilian Filipino model Marlon as her brand's endorser, and requests Bernice's design partner James, revealed to be the mole in Ponytale, to convince Detty to join La Yondelle instead. Detty finds Marlon, who has encountered a flat tire; she repairs the tire and escorts him to the hotel where Bernice and Roselle argue over Marlon. Due to Detty's assistance, Marlon decides to sign with Ponytale. Marlon and Detty begin to show interest in each other. Marlon and Detty visit Bernice's house, where Detty twists her ankle. Marlon decides to massage it, but Bernice walks in and believes that they are having oral sex, which results in him firing Marlon. Bernice and Maria confront Detty about their pasts, but Detty fails to recall the incident where Maria was paralyzed. Maria decides to do a reenactment by falling down the stairs again, helping Detty remember who Bernice is. Detty begs for forgiveness, claiming that she was too young and unaware of what to do at the time, while Bernice counters by saying that she did not do anything to help even in their adulthood, and fires her. Arriving home, Detty reveals to Kathy that she was fired from her job and her boss was her brother. The siblings confront each other in a shopping district, where Bernice reveals to Kathy that he used Angelo, who developed feelings for her, as part of his revenge.\nAngelo approaches Kathy at their school to explain that he went through with Bernice's plan because he owes him for taking him in and that he really loves her. Roselle and James convince Detty to join La Yondelle. Bernice confronts them, where he realizes that James was the mole, and despite negotiations from him, Detty decides to remain at La Yondelle. Bernice devises an elaborate plan to scare Roselle with two employees in a costume of ghostly flower girl (a parody of Sukob) and Lotus Feet (a parody of Feng Shui), which causes her to fall down a flight of stairs and fracture her foot, and the latter vows revenge against Ponytale, which is facing dwindling sales. Bernice's close friend Jessie advises him to get back Detty and forget about his revenge scheme if he wants Ponytale to emerge successful. After a failed attempt at reconciliation with his sister, Bernice tells his mother that he wants to stop his revenge scheme and that nothing good will come out of it.\nRoselle's father Simon wants Detty to replace Roselle; James convinces Roselle to eliminate Detty. Detty, Kathy, and Cindy are brought to an abandoned warehouse, with Bernice and Angelo in pursuit. Detty's family is ambushed by Roselle, James, and several thugs, but after pleading with Kathy and Cindy, Roselle has a change of heart and begs James to call it quits. James decides to also kill Roselle to take over La Yondelle, but Bernice, who arrives with Angelo and the police, intervenes and takes a bullet for Detty. At the hospital, the siblings reconcile after blaming each other, and Bernice eventually recovers after Roselle donates blood and makes amends with Detty and Bernice, although not before Detty had a nightmare of Bernice's death. Angelo decides to pursue Kathy again. Detty rejoins Ponytale and becomes co-president, and Bernice and Detty partner with Roselle to form a new fashion line named \"Sisterakas.\""

Warhol decided to undercut Schlesinger by filming his own story about a male prostitute.The film was photographed by Morrissey, using a 16mm Auricon camera favored by Warhol for his earlier films. This camera permitted the recording of sound directly onto the film and had a maximum run time of 33 minutes. This allowed for long improvised scenes. Morrissey often included the camera's flash frames and pops, which occur when starting and stopping the camera, as an aesthetic choice. Assisting Morrisey on Flesh was Jed Johnson, who had recently begun working at the Factory and would become Warhol's longtime partner."

        "content": "Like the Replicas album as a whole, \"Down in the Park\" marked a major shift from Tubeway Army's previous output. The band's early releases, the 1978 singles \"That's Too Bad\" and \"Bombers\" plus the self-titled debut album, contained elements of punk, hard rock, heavy metal and new wave but were exclusively guitar driven with only occasional use of primitive synthesizer effects. \"Down in the Park\", on the other hand, was Numan's first composition on keyboards and his first release to feature the predominantly electronic sound that became his trademark. Musically, it pared down still further the guitar power chord and bass root note style arrangements he had used previously, reducing the harmony to bare unisons of layered bass guitar, Fender Rhodes electric piano, and Polymoog synthesizer. The semitone key changes (A to B\u266d) and chromatic melodic riffs between the song's verses are somewhat unusual in the context of traditional Western music theory, although they are less unusual in rock music."

The two talk of getting married but keep experiencing setbacks due to Chuck being constantly called away to work, which also starts to put a strain on their relationship. During a Christmas dinner, Chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia. \nBefore leaving, Kelly gives Chuck her grandfather's pocket watch with a photo of her in it. He gives her a small box, saying she can wait to open it on New Year's Eve when he returns, implying it is an engagement ring.  \nHowever, the FedEx cargo plane Chuck is on gets caught in a violent storm, loses control and crashes into the Pacific Ocean. He is the only survivor and escapes on an inflatable life raft, losing the emergency locator transmitter in the process. The next day, he washes up on an uninhabited island.\nAs FedEx packages begin to wash ashore, Chuck gathers and sorts them but leaves them unopened. The body of one of the pilots, Albert Miller, washes up on the coast; he buries him and writes an epitaph on the rock above the burial site. \nIn the following days, Chuck struggles to locate food and water. After seeing the lights of a passing ship in the distance, he tries to escape in the life raft, but the strong tide tosses him onto a coral reef which pierces and badly cuts Chuck's leg.\nRealizing it is unlikely he will be rescued, Chuck opens most of the packages, finding useful items he uses to improve his living conditions. However, he does not open a package with pink angel wings painted on it. \nWhile attempting to start a fire, Chuck cuts his hand and furiously throws several objects including a Wilson volleyball, leaving a bloodstained handprint. After calming himself down, he draws a face into the blood, names the ball \"Wilson\" and begins talking to it. \nChuck realizes that the chances of ever being found are extremely low as the search area is equal to twice the size of Texas. After enduring a constant toothache, he is forced to extract his own tooth using a rock and an ice skate from one of the packages. \nFour years later, Chuck, now bearded and disheveled, has adapted to life alone on the island. After a section from a portable toilet enclosure washes up on the island, he begins construction on a raft, using the plastic as a sail. While making a rope from tree fibers, aided by the enclosure sail, which he has painted with golden angel wings, Chuck launches a raft stocked with his belongings, as well as the unopened package. The sail helps the raft clear the surf, and allows Chuck to finally escape the island. \nChuck survives a storm, but afterward, Wilson falls off the raft and floats away. He unsuccessfully attempts to rescue Wilson and is left to grieve its loss. Soon after, he is rescued by a passing cargo ship.\nFour weeks later, Chuck is cleaned up and returned to the mainland, where he learns he was declared dead by his family and friends. He is given a hero's welcome home party at the FedEx Headquarters in Memphis, where he learns that Kelly has since married and has a daughter. \nOne night, Chuck visits Kelly, where they bond for the last time; the two share a passionate kiss and confess their love for each other, but they both realize she cannot leave her family, and they part ways, with Chuck returning the watch Kelly gave him.\nChuck drives to Texas to return the angel-winged package to its sender. Finding no one home, he leaves it at the door with a note saying the package saved his life. He departs in his vehicle and stops at a remote crossroads. A woman named Bettina Peterson in a pickup truck stops and gives information about where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices the two angel wings painted on the tailgate of her truck. He looks down each road, trying to decide which way to go, before he notices the wind is blowing back down the road where Bettina drove off to and turns back to her direction with a smile."

As with the band's first two efforts, it is a concept album, and satirizes left- and right-wing politics, particularly the hippie subculture, as well as the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was conceived as part of a project called No Commercial Potential, which produced three other albums: Lumpy Gravy, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets, and Uncle Meat.\nWe're Only in It for the Money encompasses rock, experimental music, and psychedelic rock, with orchestral segments deriving from the recording sessions for Lumpy Gravy, which was previously issued as a solo instrumental album by Capitol Records and was subsequently reedited by frontman Frank Zappa and released by Verve; the reedited Lumpy Gravy was produced simultaneously with We're Only in It for the Money and is the first part of a conceptual continuity, continued with the reedited Lumpy Gravy and concluded with Zappa's final album Civilization Phaze III (1994)."

All the material in the albums is organically related and if I had all the master tapes and I could take a razor blade and cut them apart and put it together again in a different order it still would make one piece of music you can listen to. Then I could take that razor blade and cut it apart and reassemble it a different way, and it still would make sense. I could do this twenty ways. The material is definitely related.\"As the recording sessions continued, the Beatles released their acclaimed album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. In response to the album's release, Zappa decided to change the album's concept to parody the Beatles album, because he felt that the Beatles were insincere and \"only in it for the money\". The Beatles were targeted as a symbol of Zappa's objections to the corporatization of youth culture, and the album served as a criticism of them and psychedelic rock as a whole."

        "content": "Recording for We're Only in it for the Money began on March 6, 1967, with the basic tracking of \"Who Needs the Peace Corps?\" at TTG Studios which was then under the title of \"Fillmore\". The working title was inspired by a series of performance the Mothers of Invention held at the Fillmore Auditorium, finishing a day prior to the recording session. Zappa would then inaugurate a three-day recording stint at Capital Studios to record Lumpy Gravy from March 14-16, 1967. The band returned to New York in the following week, where Zappa became acquainted to then Cream guitarist Eric Clapton during an acoustic guitar led jam at his home. The band subsequently spent from April to June rehearsing and gigging locally in support of their previous album Absolutely Free, which released on May 26, 1967. Popular contemporaries such as guitarist Jimi Hendrix, and singer-songwriter Essra Mohawk, joined the Mothers of Invention during their New York shows.\nIn July, band member Ray Collins had left the Mothers before the New York recording sessions took place, but later rejoined when the band was recording the doo-wop songs that formed the album Cruisin' with Ruben & the Jets. Gary Kellgren was hired as an engineer for the project, and subsequently wound up delivering whispered pieces of dialogue that linked segments of We're Only in It for the Money. During the recording sessions, Verve requested that Zappa remove a verse from the song \"Mother People\". Zappa complied, but reversed the recording and included the backwards verse as part of the dialogue track \"Hot Poop\", concluding the album's first side, but this would be removed by Verve themselves on subsequent represses of their own. Also censored on all copies was the Lenny Bruce reference in \"Harry, You're A Beast\", and a spoken segment of \"Concentration Moon\" in which Kellgren called the Velvet Underground \"as shitty a group as Frank Zappa's group\".Primary recording sessions ran from July until September 1967 at Mayfair Studios in New York. During this period of work on the album, the band recorded at a continuous rate, only taking breaks on the weekends. While the Jimi Hendrix Experience occupied Mayfair Studios on July 19 and 20, to record \"The Stars That Play with Laughing Sam's Dice\", the band worked on and executed ideas for the cover art for We're Only in it for the Money. Hendrix would make an appearance in the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band mock cover, blending in with the cardboard cutouts of other major figures.  Weekday work was only halted again on August 4, when Bob Dylan booked the studio to mix and press an acetate disc of \"Too Much Of Nothing\". A majority of the basic tracks would be finished in August, and September was spent mostly overdubbing onto the basic recordings. On September 4, the Velvet Underground, who the Mothers of Invention then detested, entered the studio's second recording space with Tom Wilson, the band's previous producer, to record their sophomore album, White Light/White Heat. Both bands did however co-operate in the studio, and Zappa even suggested to Velvet Underground front-man Lou Reed that he record himself stabbing a cantaloupe with a wrench in the band's song \"The Gift\". The Mothers of Invention halted work on September 22 to pursue what is considered to be their first European tour, before returning to Apostolic Studios, also in New York, from October 3-8 in order to finish the album off, with final overdubs and mixing occurring.While recording We're Only in It for the Money, Zappa discovered that the strings of Apostolic Studios' grand piano would resonate if a person spoke near those strings. The \"piano people\" experiment involved Zappa having various speakers improvise dialogue using topics offered by Zappa. Various people contributed to these sessions, including Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart and Tim Buckley, who Zappa became familiar with after a concert in December 1966. The \"piano people\" voices primarily consisted of Motorhead Sherwood, Roy Estrada, Spider Barbour, All-Night John (the manager of the studio) and Louis Cuneo, who was noted for his laugh, which sounded like a \"psychotic turkey\".\n\nDuring the production, Zappa experimented with recording and editing techniques which produced unusual textures and musique concr\u00e8te compositions; the album featured abbreviated songs interrupted by segments of dialogue and unrelated music which changed the continuity of the album. Segments of orchestral music included on the album came from a solo orchestral album by Zappa previously released by Capitol Records under the title Lumpy Gravy in 1967. MGM claimed that Zappa was under contractual obligation to record for them, and subsequently Zappa re-edited Lumpy Gravy, releasing a drastically different version on Verve Records, after the release of We're Only in It for the Money. The artwork of Lumpy Gravy identified it as \"phase 2 of We're Only in It for the Money\", while We're Only in It for the Money was identified in its artwork as \"phase one of Lumpy Gravy\", alluding to the conceptual continuity of the two albums.For some pressings of the album, MGM censored several tracks without Zappa's knowledge, involvement or permission. On the song \"Absolutely Free\", the line \"I don't do publicity balling for you anymore\" was edited by MGM to remove the word \"balling\", changing the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, on \"Let's Make the Water Turn Black\", the line \"and I still remember Mama, with her apron and her pad, feeding all the boys at Ed's Cafe\" was removed. Zappa later learned that this line was censored because an MGM executive thought that the word \"pad\" referred to a sanitary napkin, rather than a waitress's order pad. The Kellgren dialogue segment in \"Concentration Moon\" was also re-edited, making it seem that he was calling the Velvet Underground \"Frank Zappa's group.\" Zappa later declined to accept an award for the album upon being made aware of the censorship, stating \"I prefer that the award be presented to the guy who modified this record, because what you're hearing is more reflective of his work than mine.\""

Subsequently, the album satirizes hippie culture and left-wing politics, as well as targeting right-wing politics, describing both political sides as \"prisoners of the same narrow-minded, superficial phoniness.\"Zappa later stated in 1978, \"hippies were pretty stupid. ... the people involved in [youth] processes ... are very sensitive to criticism. They always take themselves too seriously. So anybody who impugns the process, whether it's a peace march or love beads or whatever it is \u2013 that person is the enemy and must be dealt with severely. So we came under a lot of criticism, because we dared to suggest that perhaps what was going on was really stupid.\"Another element of the album's lyrical content came from the Los Angeles Police Department's harassment and arrests of young rock fans, which made it difficult for the band to perform on the West Coast, leading the band to move to New York City for better financial opportunities. Additionally, Zappa made reference to comedian Lenny Bruce; the song \"Harry, You're A Beast\" quotes Bruce's routine \"To Is A Preposition, Come Is A Verb\".The song \"Flower Punk\" parodies the garage rock staple \"Hey Joe\", and depicts a youth going to San Francisco to become a flower child and join a psychedelic rock band. Additionally, the track makes a reference to \"Wild Thing\", one of the songs that defined the counterculture of that period. The rhythmic pattern of \"Flower Punk\" is complex, consisting of 4 bars of a fast 5 (2\u20133), followed by 4 bars of 7 (2\u20132\u20133)."

Pepper] had blue skies ... we had a thunderstorm.\" Jimi Hendrix, a friend of Zappa, took part in the photo shoot.Zappa phoned Paul McCartney, seeking permission for the parody. McCartney told him that it was an issue for business managers, but Zappa responded that the artists themselves were supposed to tell their business managers what to do. Nevertheless, Capitol objected, and the album's release was delayed for five months. Verve decided to package the album with inverted cover artwork, placing the parody cover as interior artwork (and the intended interior artwork as the main sleeve) out of fear of legal action. Zappa was angered over the decision; Schenkel felt that the Sgt. Pepper parody \"was a stronger image\" than the final released cover. In recent years, the album has been reissued with the intended front cover."

The remix reinstated audio that had been censored by Verve, as well as the original \"Mother People\" verse. It also featured new rhythm tracks recorded by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman. Zappa would later do the same with Cruising with Ruben & the Jets, stating \"The master tapes for Ruben and the Jets were in better shape, but since I liked the results on We're Only in It for the Money, I decided to do it on Ruben too. But those are the only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself.\"Lumpy Gravy was also remixed by Zappa, but not released at the time. After the remixing was announced, a $13 million lawsuit was filed against Zappa by Jimmy Carl Black, Bunk Gardner and Don Preston, who were later joined by Ray Collins, Art Tripp and Motorhead Sherwood, increasing the claim to $16.4 million, stating that they had received no royalties from Zappa since 1969.Zappa would later prepare a CD of the original stereo mix for release by Rykodisc in 1995. Unlike the remix, this retained the censorship applied to \"Concentration Moon,\" \"Harry You're a Beast\" and \"Mother People\" on the original releases.The audio documentary box set The Lumpy Money Project/Object chronicles the production of We're Only in It for the Money, including the orchestral version of Lumpy Gravy, a 1968 mono mix of We're Only in It for the Money and 1984 remixes of We're Only in It for the Money and the reedited Lumpy Gravy album, as well as additional material from the original recording sessions."

He concluded that while the initial listening may be significantly profound, due to the reliance on shock, subsequent listening may be reduced in value; and he returns to a comparison with the Beatles, in which he feels that Zappa has the greater musical genius, but is less comfortable to listen to.AllMusic writer Steve Huey wrote, \"the music reveals itself as exceptionally strong, and Zappa's politics and satirical instinct have rarely been so focused and relevant, making We're Only in It for the Money quite possibly his greatest achievement.\" Robert Christgau gave the album an A, writing, \"With bohemia permanent and changed utterly, this early attack on its massification hasn't so much dated as found its context.

        "content": "The elderly and pious Protestant sisters Martine and Filippa live in a small village on the remote western coast of Jutland in 19th-century Denmark. Their late father was a pastor who founded his own Pietistic conventicle. Lacking new converts, the aging sisters preside over a dwindling, elderly congregation.\nForty-nine years before, the sisters have many suitors, but their father rejects them, as he wishes to retain the assistance of the women to further his pastoral mission. Martine is courted by a young Swedish cavalry officer, Lorens L\u00f6wenhielm, who is visiting Jutland. Filippa is courted by a famous baritone Achille Papin, from the Paris Opera, who is currently on hiatus. Both sisters decide to spurn their suitors and stay with their father.\nThirty-five years later, Babette Hersant appears at their door. She carries a letter from Papin which explains that she is a refugee from counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris and recommends her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot afford to employ Babette, but she begs to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next fourteen years, producing improved versions of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation and gaining their respect, and that of the other locals. As the years go by, the sisters are deeply distressed by the increasing number of disputes between the congregants. Babette is also troubled, and at one point, interrupts the arguments with a stern rebuke.\nBabette's only link to her former life is a lottery ticket. A Parisian friend annually renews the ticket. One day, she wins the lottery and receives 10,000 francs. After her win she decides to prepare a dinner for the sisters and their small congregation on the occasion of the founding pastor's hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette's appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice.\nThe sisters accept both Babette's meal and her offer to pay for the creation of a \"real French dinner.\" Babette arranges for her nephew to go to Paris and gather the supplies for the feast. The ingredients are plentiful, sumptuous and exotic, and their arrival causes much consternation and discussion among the villagers. As the various never-before-seen ingredients arrive and preparations commence, the sisters begin to worry that the meal will become a sin of sensual luxury, if not some form of devilry. In a hasty conference, the sisters and the congregation agree to eat the meal, but to forgo speaking of any pleasure in it and to make no mention of the food during the dinner.\nMartine's former suitor, Lorens, now a famous general married to a member of the Queen's court, comes as the guest of his aunt, the local lady of the manor and a member of the old pastor's congregation. He is unaware of the other guests' austere plans and as a man of the world and former attach\u00e9 in Paris, he is the only person at the table qualified to comment on the meal. He regales the guests with abundant information about the extraordinary food and drink, comparing it to a meal he enjoyed years earlier at the famous Caf\u00e9 Anglais in Paris. Although the other celebrants refuse to comment on the earthly pleasures of their meal, Babette's gifts break down their distrust and superstitions, elevating them physically and spiritually. Old wrongs are forgiven, ancient loves are rekindled and a mystical redemption of the human spirit settles over the table.\nBereft, the sisters assume that Babette will return to Paris. However, when she says that all of her money is gone and that she is not going anywhere, the sisters are aghast. Babette then reveals that she was formerly the head chef of the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, where a dinner for twelve cost 10,000 francs. Martine tearfully says, \"Now you will be poor the rest of your life\", to which Babette replies, \"An artist is never poor.\" Filippa then says: \"But this is not the end, Babette. In paradise you will be the great artist God meant you to be\" and then embraces her with tears in her eyes saying: \"Oh, how you will enchant the angels!\"."

        "content": "Blixen's original story takes place in the Norwegian port town of Berlev\u00e5g, albeit in an inaccurate setting of multi-coloured wooden houses on a long fjord. However, when Axel researched locations in Norway, he found the settings were too idyllic and resembled a \"beautiful tourist brochure\". He shifted the location to the flat windswept coast of western Jutland and asked his set designer, Sven Wichmann, to build a small grey village offering very few or no attractions. M\u00e5rup Church, a plain Romanesque church built around 1250 on a remote seaside cliff near the village of L\u00f8nstrup, was used as a backdrop. Somewhat ironically, the actual village of Berlev\u00e5g is not on a fjord, but directly on the Barents Sea, and is subject to strong winds\u2014very much similar to Axel's vision.\nAxel altered the setting from a ship-filled harbor to fishermen's rowboats on a beach. He said the changes would highlight Blixen's vision of Babette's life in near complete exile.\nThere is a lot that works in writing, but when translated to pictures, it doesn't give at all the same impression or feeling. All the changes I undertook, I did to actually be faithful to Karen Blixen. \u2013 Gabriel Axel\nThe Nordisk Film production company suggested the cast of Babette's Feast should include only Danish actors to reduce production costs. However, Axel wanted Danish, Swedish and French actors to play the roles for the sake of authenticity. Axel was supported by the Danish Film Institute's consultant, Claes Kastholm Hansen, who also agreed the cast should include international stars. The title character of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve was interested in the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual \u2018sophisticated woman\u2019 roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress St\u00e9phane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol's films Violette Nozi\u00e8re (1978) and Cop au Vin (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabrol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her if she might be able to respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.Two other major parts were the characters of the elderly maiden sisters, Phillipa and Martine. Phillipa, the once-promising singer, was portrayed by Bodil Kjer, considered the first lady of Danish theater and namesake of the Bodil Award. Birgitte Federspiel, best known for Carl Dreyer's 1955 classic film Ordet, was cast as the staid, lovelorn Martine.\nThe role of the Swedish General Lorens L\u00f6wenhielm, the former suitor of Martine, was accepted by Jarl Kulle and the Swedish Court Lady by Bibi Andersson. Both had achieved international recognition as two of Ingmar Bergman's favorite actors, appearing in many of his films.The group of elderly villagers was composed of Danish actors, many of whom were well known for their roles in the films of Carl Theodor Dreyer. These included Lisbeth Movin as the Old Widow, Preben Lerdorff Rye as the Captain, Axel Str\u00f8bye as the Driver, Bendt Rothe as Old Nielsen and Ebbe Rode as Christopher.\nThe popular Danish actress Ghita N\u00f8rby was cast as the film's narrator. Although production consultants complained to Axel that the use of a narrator was too old-fashioned, Axel was adamant about using one. He said it was not about being old-fashioned but only about the need: \"If there is need for a narrator, then one uses one.\""

The young son of one of the anglers falls into the water and something unseen drags him under the surface. Another angler prepares a flare gun, but he slips and accidentally fires it into the deck, which is soaked with gasoline dropped earlier by the boy. The vessel bursts into flames and explodes; everybody aboard is killed. Jim Hill and his wife Carol witness the explosion. Later, Jim and Carol's dog goes missing and the pair finds its dismembered corpse on the nearby beach.\nThe following day, teenagers Jerry Potter and Peggy Larson go for a swim at the beach. Jerry is abruptly pulled under the water. Peggy believes it is a prank until she discovers his mutilated corpse. Peggy screams and tries to reach the beach, but a monstrous figure drags her across the sand. The humanoid creature tears off her bikini and rapes her.\nThat night, two more teenagers are camping on the same beach. Billy is about to have sex with his girlfriend, Becky when another humanoid monster claws its way inside, kills him, and chases Becky onto the beach. She outruns her assailant, but then runs into the arms of yet another monster, which throws her to the sand and rapes her. More attacks follow; not all of them successful, but few witnesses survive to tell the public about the incidents; only Peggy is found alive, though severely traumatized. Jim's brother is also attacked, prompting Jim to take a personal interest in the matter.\nA company called Canco has announced plans to build a huge cannery near Noyo. The murderous, sex-hungry mutations are apparently the result of Canco's experiments with a growth hormone they had earlier administered to salmon. The salmon escaped from Canco's laboratory into the ocean during a storm and were eaten by large fish that then mutated into the brutal, depraved humanoids that have begun to terrorize the village.\nBy the time Jim and Canco scientist Dr. Susan Drake have deduced what is occurring, the village's annual festival has begun. At the festival, many humanoids appear, murdering the men and raping every woman they can grab. Jim devises a plan to stop the humanoids by pumping gasoline into the bay and setting it on fire, cutting off the humanoids' way of retreat. Meanwhile, Carol is attacked at home by two of the creatures, but manages to kill them before Jim arrives.\nThe morning after the festival, normality seems to have returned to the village. Jim asks the sheriff about Dr. Drake. The sheriff mumbles that she went back to the lab, where she is coaching a pregnant Peggy, who has survived her sexual assault. Peggy is about to give birth when her monstrous offspring bursts from her womb, with Peggy screaming at the screeching baby."

        "content": "Humanoids from the Deep was originally offered to Joe Dante, who turned it down. Peeters accepted the film, and shooting commenced in October 1979. Executive producer Corman said Peeters' version of the film lacked the required exploitative elements needed to satisfy its intended audience. In an interview included on the 2010 Blu-ray release by Shout! Factory, Corman stated Peeters and he had discussed his expectations of the film regarding B-movie exploitation \u2013 this being to fulfill Corman's maxim that monsters \"kill all the men and rape all the women\". In postproduction, Corman said Peeters had done an outstanding job in filming the death scenes involving male characters, but all of the rape scenes had been left \"shadowy\" or used cutaways before the attacks occurred. Portions of the film were directed by an uncredited Murakami, who directed the Corman-produced sci-fi cult classic Battle Beyond the Stars the same year.\nThe film's budget was $2.5 million. The monster costumes were designed and created by Rob Bottin.Second unit director James Sbardellati, who later directed Deathstalker, was hired to enliven the film; he filmed explicit scenes in which the humanoids rape women. These changes were not communicated to most of the people who had made the film with the working title Beneath the Darkness; several of them expressed shock and anger at the released film, its changed title, and the nudity and sexual exploitation. After Peeters and Turkel saw the additional sequences, they asked for their names to be removed from the film, but were refused. Turkel appeared on television talk shows and castigated Corman for his actions.Primary filming took place in the California towns of Mendocino, Fort Bragg, and Noyo."

The film was a modest financial success for New World Pictures.Critical reviews were mostly negative. Paul Taylor said in Time Out, \"Despite the sex of the director, a more blatant endorsement of exploitation cinema's current anti-women slant would be hard to find; Peeters also lies on the gore pretty thick amid the usual visceral drive-in hooks and rip-offs from genre hits; and with the humor of an offering like Piranha entirely absent, this turns out to be a nasty piece of work all round\".Briefly discussing the film in Fangoria, Alien writer Dan O'Bannon criticized the film, saying, \"Roger Corman's people ripped off the chestburster idea for Humanoids of the Deep.\"Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror stated that additional sex and violence scenes had been edited into the film without director Peeter's knowledge. Hardy continued, \"As weighed down as it is with solemn musings about ecology and dispossessed Indians, it looks as if it had always been a hopeless case\".Nathaniel Thompson said on his Mondo Digital website, \"Director Peeters claimed that Roger Corman added some of the more explicit shots of slimy nudity at the last minute to give the film some extra kick, but frankly, the movie needed it. Though competently handled, the lack of visual style, occasionally slow pacing, and peculiar lack of (intentional) humor hinder this from becoming an all-out trash masterpiece\".In his Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, Michael Weldon said, \"Many were offended by the rape aspect of this fast-paced thriller featuring lots of Creature from the Black Lagoon-inspired monsters. Like it or not, it was a hit and is not dull\".Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 out of a possible 4 stars, calling it \"fast, occasionally hilarious gutter trash from the Roger Corman stable\".On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 50% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 5.17 out of 10."

        "content": "The Little Mermaid is a 1989 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is loosely based on the 1837 Danish fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. The film was written and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements and produced by Musker and Howard Ashman, who also wrote the film's songs with Alan Menken. Menken also composed the film's score. Featuring the voices of Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jodi Benson, Pat Carroll, Paddi Edwards, Buddy Hackett, Jason Marin, Kenneth Mars, Ben Wright and Samuel E. Wright, The Little Mermaid tells the story of a teenage mermaid princess named Ariel, who dreams of becoming human and falls in love with a human prince named Eric, which leads her to make a magic deal with the sea witch, Ursula, to become human and be with him.\nWalt Disney planned to put the story in a proposed package film containing Andersen's stories, but scrapped the project. In 1985, while working on The Great Mouse Detective (1986), Clements and Musker decided to adapt the fairy tale and proposed it to Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who initially declined due to its similarities to a proposed sequel to the 1984 film Splash, but ultimately approved of it. Ashman became involved and brought in Menken. With supervision from Katzenberg, they made a Broadway-style structure with musical numbers as the staff was working on Oliver & Company (1988). Katzenberg warned that the film would earn less since it appealed to female viewers, but he eventually became convinced that it would be Disney's first blockbuster hit.\nThe Little Mermaid was released to theaters on November 17, 1989, to critical acclaim, earning praise for the animation, music, and characters. It was also a commercial success, garnering $84 million at the domestic box office during its initial release, and $235 million in total lifetime gross worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1989. Along with the major success of both Disney's 1986 animated film The Great Mouse Detective and the 1988 Disney/Amblin live-action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Little Mermaid is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after some films produced by Disney were struggling. It also marked the start of the era known as the Disney Renaissance. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (\"Under the Sea\").\nThe film's success led to a media franchise. A direct-to-video sequel was released in 2000, focusing on Ariel's daughter, Melody. A prequel followed in 2008. The first film was adapted into a stage musical with a book by Doug Wright and additional songs by Alan Menken and new lyricist Glenn Slater opened in Denver in July 2007 and began performances on Broadway January 10, 2008 starring Sierra Boggess.Other derived works and material inspired by the film, include a 2019 live musical presentation on ABC as part of The Wonderful World of Disney, and a 2023 live-action film adaptation directed by Rob Marshall and starring Halle Bailey.\nIn 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

With her best friend Flounder, Ariel visits Scuttle, a seagull who gives inaccurate information about humans, and collects human artifacts in her grotto. However, her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, says contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden. One night, Ariel, Flounder, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, travel to the surface to watch a birthday celebration for Prince Eric. Ariel falls in love with Eric at first sight. A storm later wrecks the ship and knocks Eric overboard. Ariel rescues Eric and brings him to shore. She sings to him, but leaves just as he regains consciousness to avoid being discovered. Eric vows to find the girl who saved him. Discovering a change in Ariel's behavior, Triton questions Sebastian and learns of her love for Eric. Frustrated, Triton travels to Ariel's grotto and destroys her collection of artifacts in a misguided attempt to protect her. After a remorseful Triton leaves, two eels named Flotsam and Jetsam convince Ariel to visit Ursula the sea witch.\nUrsula makes a deal with Ariel to transform her into a human for three days in exchange for Ariel's voice, which Ursula puts in a nautilus shell. Within these three days, if Ariel receives a \"true love's kiss\", she will remain a human permanently. Otherwise, she will transform back into a mermaid and belong to Ursula. After accepting, Ariel is given human legs and taken to the surface by Flounder and Sebastian. Eric finds Ariel on the beach and takes her to his castle, unaware that she is the one who rescued him earlier. Ariel spends time with Eric, and at the end of the second day, they almost kiss but are thwarted by Flotsam and Jetsam. Furious at Ariel's close success, Ursula disguises herself as a young woman named Vanessa and appears onshore singing with Ariel's voice. Eric recognizes the song, and Ursula casts a hypnotic enchantment that makes him forget about Ariel.\nThe next day, Ariel discovers that Eric will be married to Vanessa. Scuttle discovers Vanessa's true identity and informs Ariel, who pursues the wedding barge. Sebastian informs Triton, and Scuttle disrupts the wedding with the help of various sea animals. In the chaos, Ursula's shell is destroyed, restoring Ariel's voice and breaking the enchantment over Eric. Realizing that Ariel is the girl who saved his life, Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid. Turning back into her true form, Ursula kidnaps Ariel. Triton confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. At Ursula's urging, Triton agrees to take Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as Triton transforms into a polyp and loses his authority over Atlantica. Ursula declares herself the Queen of the Seven Seas, but before she can use the trident, Eric appears with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to kill Eric, but Ariel intervenes, causing Ursula to inadvertently kill Flotsam and Jetsam. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to grow in size.\nAriel and Eric reunite on the surface just before a gigantic Ursula separates them. She then gains full control of the ocean, creating a storm and bringing sunken ships to the surface. Just as Ariel is about to be killed, Eric commandeers a wrecked ship and impales Ursula with its splintered bowsprit. With Ursula dead, Triton and the other polyps in her garden revert to their original forms. Realizing that Ariel truly loves Eric, Triton turns her into a human and approves her marriage to Eric. Ariel and Eric marry on a ship and depart, with all of Ariel's friends and family watching them as well."

        "content": "Sleeping Beauty is a 1959 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. Based on Charles Perrault's 1697 fairy tale, the production was supervised by Clyde Geronimi, and was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, Eric Larson, and Les Clark. Featuring the voices of Mary Costa, Bill Shirley, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton, Barbara Luddy, Barbara Jo Allen, Taylor Holmes, and Bill Thompson, the film follows Princess Aurora, who was cursed by the evil fairy Maleficent to die from a prick from the spindle of a spinning wheel. She is saved by three good fairies, who alter the curse so that the princess falls into a deep sleep and is awakened by true love's kiss.\nSleeping Beauty began development in 1950. The film took nearly a decade and $6 million to produce, and was Disney's most expensive animated feature at the time. Its tapestry-like art style was devised by Eyvind Earle, who was inspired by pre-Renaissance European art; its score and songs, composed by George Bruns, was based on Pyotr Tchaikovsky's 1889 ballet. Sleeping Beauty was the first animated film to use the Super Technirama 70 widescreen process and was the second full-length animated feature filmed in anamorphic widescreen, following Lady and the Tramp (1955).It was released in theaters on January 29, 1959, to mixed reviews from critics who praised its art direction and musical score and criticized its plot and characters. The film was a box-office bomb in its initial release, grossing $5.3 million, and losing $900,000 for the distributor and many employees from the animation studio became layoffs. Sleeping Beauty's re-releases have been successful, and it has become one of Disney's most artistically acclaimed features. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture at the 32nd Academy Awards.\nMaleficent, a live-action reimagining of the film from Maleficent's perspective, was released in 2014, followed by a sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, in 2019. The latter year, Sleeping Beauty was selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress' National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

        "content": "King Stefan and Queen Leah, rulers of a European kingdom, welcome their newborn daughter Aurora after many years of childlessness. They proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess, and she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the son of Stefan's friend King Hubert, at her christening to unite their kingdoms. Among the guests are three good fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Flora and Fauna bless Aurora with beauty and song, but Merryweather's gift is interrupted by the arrival of the evil fairy Maleficent. As revenge for not being invited, she places a curse on Aurora: before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die.\nAlthough her magic is not as powerful as Maleficent's, Merryweather uses her blessing to weaken the curse; Aurora will fall into a deep sleep instead of dying, and will only awaken with true love's kiss. Stefan orders all the kingdom's spinning wheels burned as a precaution. The fairies come up with the idea of raising Aurora in a secluded location, so she lives in safety until her sixteenth birthday. At their urging, Stefan and Leah reluctantly agree to the fairies' plan. The fairies move into a forest cottage, decide to stop using magic for the next sixteen years, and rename Aurora \"Briar Rose\".\nOn Aurora's sixteenth birthday, the fairies send her to gather berries so they can prepare a surprise party. In the forest, Aurora begins to sing to the forest animals; this attracts the attention of Phillip, now a handsome young man. They meet, and immediately fall in love; Aurora invites Phillip to the cottage that evening, but they depart without revealing who they are. Flora and Merryweather argue about the color of Aurora's birthday gown. They begin using magic, which attracts the attention of Maleficent's pet raven, Diablo, who learns the princess's whereabouts. Back at home, Aurora tells her guardians that she has fallen in love; they tell her that she is a princess, already betrothed to a prince, and must never see the man she met again. Meanwhile, Phillip tells his father about the peasant girl he met and wants to marry, despite his prearranged marriage. King Hubert unsuccessfully tries to dissuade him.\nShortly before sunset, the fairies bring Aurora to the castle for her birthday celebration. Maleficent appears and lures her away from them to a tower room, where Aurora pricks her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel Maleficent has conjured. The fairies place the sleeping Aurora in the highest tower and cast a spell on the people in the castle, causing them to sleep until their princess awakens. Flora overhears a conversation between the kings and realizes that Phillip is the man with whom Aurora has fallen in love. The fairies rush to the cottage, only to learn that Phillip has been abducted by Maleficent and her goons.\nAt her domain, the Forbidden Mountain, Maleficent reveals Aurora's identity to Phillip. She plans to lock him away until he is an old man on the verge of death before releasing him to meet Aurora, who will not have aged a single day. The fairies rescue Phillip and arm him with the magical Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue. Maleficent surrounds Stefan's castle with a forest of thorns to stop Phillip, but he breaks through it. She then appears in front of him and transforms into a giant, fire-breathing dragon. They fight, and Phillip kills Maleficent by thrusting his sword into her heart.\nPhillip awakens Aurora with a kiss, breaking the spell and awakening the kingdom. They descend to the ballroom, where Aurora reunites with her parents and happily waltzes with Phillip while Flora and Merryweather continue arguing about the color of her dress."

        "content": "Since its original release in 1959, Sleeping Beauty has become one of the most artistically-acclaimed animated films ever produced; its artistic direction, background and color styling, and character animation have been praised. It is considered one of the most influential Disney features by the animation industry, with animators such as Mike Gabriel and Michael Giaimo citing the film as inspiring them to enter the business. Sleeping Beauty's background and color styling heavily influenced the design of the animated films such as Pocahontas (1995), Frozen (2013), Frozen II (2019), and Wish (2023). Andreas Deja, Glen Keane, and Russ Edmonds were inspired by the film's design and animation for their characters in Aladdin (1992), Pocahontas (1995), and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). In 2019, Sleeping Beauty was selected for preservation in the United States' National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nIn 1955, while the film was still in production, Sleeping Beauty Castle opened at Disneyland as a symbol of the park and a promotional tool for the film. Walt Disney and Shirley Temple opened an indoor walk-through exhibit with a series of dioramas depicting the story of Sleeping Beauty, designed by Eyvind Earle and Ken Anderson, in 1957. The walk-through was redesigned in 1977, replacing the original hand-painted displays with three-dimensional sets and doll-like figurines. It was closed in 2001 due to declining attendance, although the September 11th attacks are also believed to be a factor. The exhibit, refurbished to recreate the original 1957 dioramas, reopened in 2008. The film's characters (particularly Princess Aurora and Maleficent) make regular appearances in the parks and parades, with Maleficent a villain in the nighttime show Fantasmic! at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios.Opened in 1992, Le Ch\u00e2teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant at Disneyland Paris is a variant of Sleeping Beauty Castle with a gallery of displays illustrating the story of Sleeping Beauty in tapestries, stained-glass windows and figures. The building also contains an animatronic version of Maleficent's dragon form, La Tani\u00e8re du Dragon, in the lower-level dungeon. Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005 with a Sleeping Beauty Castle nearly replicating Disneyland's design; it was closed in 2018, redesigned as the Castle of Magical Dreams, and reopened in 2020.DisneyToon Studios released a 2007 direct-to-video animated film, Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams, featuring two new stories about Aurora and Jasmine from Aladdin (1992). Many of Sleeping Beauty's characters make cameo appearances in the 2001\u201303 television series House of Mouse, as well as in the films Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and The Lion King 1\u00bd (2004). Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather are recurring characters in the 2013\u201318 Disney Junior series Sofia the First, and Aurora makes a guest appearance in the \"Holiday in Enchancia\" episode. With other Disney Princesses, Aurora appears in the 2018 film Ralph Breaks the Internet. Like other Walt Disney Animation Studios characters, Sleeping Beauty characters have cameo appearances in the short film Once Upon a Studio (2023).A 2014 live-action adaptation of the film, Maleficent, tells the story from the perspective of the antagonist (played by Angelina Jolie). It was followed by a sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, in 2019. Live-action versions of Sleeping Beauty characters are featured in the 2011\u201318 fantasy television series Once Upon a Time (produced by Disney-owned ABC Studios), including Maleficent, Aurora, Prince Phillip, and King Stefan. Maleficent is a main villain in the 2015 television film Descendants, which follows the teenage children of Disney's iconic heroes and villains (including Maleficent's daughter Mal and Audrey, the daughter of Aurora and Phillip).Maleficent is a recurring villain in the Square Enix/Disney Kingdom Hearts video-game series, and Aurora is one of the Princesses of Heart. The Enchanted Dominion, a world based on the film, appears in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. Aurora, Phillip, and the Three Good Fairies are playable characters in the world-builder video game Disney Magic Kingdoms, with Maleficent its main antagonist. An alternate version of Maleficent appears as a playable character in the video game Disney Mirrorverse (2022).A retrospective exhibition, Awaking Beauty: The Art of Eyvind Earle, was presented at the Walt Disney Family Museum from May 18, 2017 to January 8, 2018. With over 250 works such as thumbnail paintings, concept artworks, and commercial illustrations, the exhibit reflected Eyvind Earle's biography and his work at the Walt Disney Studios (including his contribution to Sleeping Beauty). An exhibition catalog was published by Weldon Owen on August 8, 2017."

Monty intends to perform a mercy kill and shoot him, but changes his mind after he looks it in the eye; he takes the dog to a nearby clinic instead.\nA few years later, Monty is about to begin serving a seven-year prison sentence for dealing drugs. He sits in a park with Doyle, the dog he rescued, on his last day of freedom. He plans to meet childhood friends Frank, a boorish Wall Street trader, and Jacob, an introverted high school teacher with a crush on his student Mary, at a club with his girlfriend Naturelle.\nMonty visits his father, James, a former firefighter and recovering alcoholic at his bar, to confirm their plans to drive to the prison the following morning. James was able to establish the bar with Monty\u2019s drug money, and remorsefully sneaks a drink when Monty goes to the bathroom. Facing himself in the mirror, Monty lashes out in his mind against everyone in New York before finally turning on himself, angry for becoming greedy and not giving up drug dealing before he was caught.\nIn a flashback, Monty remembers the night he was arrested: DEA agents raided Monty's apartment and quickly found the drugs he was selling for Uncle Nikolai, a Russian mobster. Kostya tries to persuade Monty it was Naturelle who betrayed him, since she knew where he hid his drugs and money. Monty refused to turn state's evidence against Nikolai, but is unsure about Nikolai\u2019s actions. Monty remembers how he met Naturelle hanging around his old school, and how happy they were. He then asks Frank to find out if it was Naturelle who betrayed him.\nJacob sees Mary outside the club, and Monty invites her inside with them. Discussing what kind of a future Monty can have after prison, Frank says they can open a bar together, even though he told Jacob that he believes Monty deserves his sentence for dealing drugs. Frank accuses Naturelle of living high on Monty's money despite knowing its origins, but she retorts that Frank also knew but said nothing. The argument culminates with Frank insulting Naturelle's ethnicity, followed by her slapping Frank and leaving. Jacob, meanwhile, finds the courage to kiss Mary, but both are shocked afterwards and go their separate ways.\nMonty and Kostya go to see Nikolai, who gives Monty advice on surviving in prison. Nikolai then reveals it was Kostya who betrayed Monty, and offers him a chance to kill Kostya in exchange for protecting his father's bar. Monty refuses, reminding Nikolai that he was the one who told Monty to trust Kostya in the first place. Monty walks out, leaving Kostya to be killed by the Russian mobsters.\nMonty returns to his apartment and apologizes to Naturelle for mistrusting her. He then hands Doyle over to Jacob in the park. He admits that he is terrified of being raped in prison, whereupon he asks Frank to beat him, believing that he might have a chance at survival if he enters the prison ugly. Frank refuses, and Monty goads Frank into taking out his frustrations, leaving Monty bruised and bloody, with a broken nose.\nNaturelle tries to comfort him as Monty's father arrives to take him to Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville. On the drive to prison, Monty once again sees a parade of faces from the streets of the city. As they drive up the Henry Hudson Parkway, James suggests they take the George Washington Bridge to go west, into hiding, and gives Monty a vision of a future where he avoids imprisonment, reunites with Naturelle, starts a family, and grows old. When the vision stops, they are past the bridge, still driving towards prison."

The film stars Jon Heder in the role of the titular character, a nerdy high-school student who deals with several dilemmas: befriending an immigrant who wants to be class president, awkwardly pursuing a romance with a fellow student, and living with his quirky family.\nThe film was Hess's first full-length movie and is partially adapted from his earlier short film, Peluca (2002). Napoleon Dynamite was acquired at the Sundance Film Festival by Fox Searchlight Pictures, who partnered up with Paramount Pictures and MTV Films for the release. Filming was done at Preston High School and in different areas in Franklin County, Idaho, in the summer of 2003. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. Most of the situations in the movie are loosely based on the life of Jared Hess. The film's total worldwide gross revenue was $46.1 million. The film has since developed a cult following and was voted at number 14 on Bravo's 100 funniest movies."

        "content": "Napoleon Dynamite is a socially awkward 16-year-old from Preston, Idaho, who lives with his grandmother, Carlinda, and his even more awkward older brother, Kip. Napoleon daydreams his way through school, reluctantly dealing with various bullies who torment him.\nCarlinda is injured in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious former high-school athlete who lives in a conversion van, treats Napoleon like a child. He takes advantage of the visit to team up with Kip in a get-rich-quick scheme by selling items door-to-door. Kip wants money to pay for his internet girlfriend, LaFawnduh, to travel from Detroit to see him while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and the recent breakup with his girlfriend.\nNapoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college, and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from Juarez, Mexico. Preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who gladly accepts. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks a popular classmate, Trisha, from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws an unintentionally bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is one of Rico's customers. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from Trisha's mother, who buys his wares and forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's invitation. Trisha goes to the dance with Napoleon but soon abandons him, leading Pedro to let Deb dance with Napoleon.\nPedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer. The two factions put up flyers and hand out trinkets to students to attract voters. To increase their respect by demonstrating \"skills,\" Napoleon and Pedro enter a Future Farmers of America competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits a thrift store and buys an instructional dance videotape called D-Qwon's Dance Grooves.\nKip's girlfriend, LaFawnduh, arrives from Detroit and gives him an urban makeover, outfitting him in hip-hop regalia. Seeing that he is learning to dance, LaFawnduh gives Napoleon a mixtape.\nRico's ongoing sales scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about Napoleon to prospective customers. Rico tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends after his sales pitch to the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, goes awry: Rex assaults Rico after unexpectedly arriving during his demonstration of the breast-enhancement product.\nSummer gives a speech before the student body on election day, and then presents a dance skit to \"Larger than Life\" by the Backstreet Boys with a school club. A despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech after discovering he is also required to perform a skit. To save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's mixtape and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to \"Canned Heat\" by Jamiroquai. Proving himself to be a skilled dancer, Napoleon's routine receives a standing ovation from students, stunning Summer and her boyfriend, Don.\nPedro becomes the class president, Kip and LaFawnduh leave on a bus for Michigan, Rico reunites with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returns from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb reconcile and play tetherball.\nIn a post-credits scene set two months later, Kip and LaFawnduh get married, and Napoleon arrives at the wedding late with a wild honeymoon stallion which he tamed for Kip and LaFawnduh to ride out on."

Many of the featured festival themes related to events occurring during the film. For example: Tetherball Tournament, Tater Tot Eating Contest, Moon Boot Dance, Impersonation, Look-A-Like Contest, Football Throwing Contest and more. Fifteen years after the film came out fans continue to visit Preston, primarily as a side trip as they make their way to Yellowstone National Park.The success of Napoleon Dynamite led to other films set in small towns, such as Little Miss Sunshine (2006) and Juno (2007), which would have similar critical, popular, and financial success."

        "content": "The Simpsons Movie is a 2007 American animated comedy film based on the Fox animated sitcom The Simpsons by Matt Groening. The film was directed by series veteran David Silverman and stars the series' regular cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Pamela Hayden, and Tress MacNeille reprising their roles and Albert Brooks as the film's main antagonist, Russ Cargill, head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The film follows Homer Simpson, who irresponsibly pollutes Springfield's local lake, causing the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to imprison the town under a giant glass dome. After he and his family escape to Alaska, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness and return to Springfield to prevent the town's demolition by Cargill. Homer then works to redeem his folly by returning to Springfield himself in an effort to save it.\nAlthough previous attempts to create a Simpsons film had been made, they failed due to the lack of a script. Eventually in 2001, producers James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Al Jean, Mike Scully and Richard Sakai began development on the film and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, Matt Selman, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one adapted. The script was rewritten over a hundred times, also continuing after work on the animation began in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including cameo roles from Erin Brockovich, Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher, Edward Norton, and Kelsey Grammer, who would have reprised his role as Sideshow Bob. Tom Hanks and the members of Green Day voice their own animated counterparts in the final cut of the film, while Albert Brooks, a frequent guest performer on the series, provides the voice of Cargill.\nTie-in promotions were made with several companies to promote the film's release, including Burger King and 7-Eleven, the latter of which transformed selected stores into Kwik-E-Marts. The film premiered in Springfield, Vermont, on July 21, 2007, and was released theatrically six days later on July 27 by 20th Century Fox across the United States. The Simpsons Movie grossed $536.4 million worldwide, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2007, the second-highest-grossing traditionally animated film (behind Disney's The Lion King) and the highest-grossing film based on an animated television series. The film received very positive reviews for its humor, emotional weight, writing  and callbacks to early seasons, while being nominated for numerous awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film at the 65th Golden Globe Awards."

        "content": "After finishing a concert at Lake Springfield, Green Day tries to engage the audience in a discussion about the environment, but they refuse to listen and throw trash at them. The pollution in the lake erodes the band's barge, causing them to sink and drown. During their memorial, Grampa Simpson has a spiritual experience and prophesies that a disaster will befall Springfield. However, only Marge takes his cryptic message seriously. Concerned about the terrible state of the environment, Lisa and her new friend Colin hold a seminar and convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, Homer dares Bart to skateboard to Krusty Burger naked, humiliating him when he is arrested. Homer follows Bart to Krusty Burger, and adopts a pig to save it from being killed by Krusty the Clown. Marge, identifying the pig as a part of the prophecy, warns Homer to get rid of it, but he refuses and names it Plopper. Homer's fawning over Plopper makes Bart, now fed up with his father's carelessness, look to their neighbor, Ned Flanders, as a father figure.\nMarge orders Homer to dispose of an overflowing silo full of Plopper's feces. Rather than dispose of it safely, as Marge had warned him to, he dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it.  Russ Cargill, head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), informs President Arnold Schwarzenegger of Springfield's pollution crisis and presents him with five solutions. The president randomly picks the third option: sealing Springfield off from the rest of the world under a glass dome.\nBeing trapped under the dome causes mass hysteria in Springfield, and when Homer's silo is discovered on live television, hundreds of townspeople arrive at The Simpsons' house in an attempt to lynch the family. They escape through a sinkhole hidden in Maggie's sandbox, which destroys the house, the debris trapping in the rest of the town. The family is furious at Homer for ruining their lives, but he convinces them to follow him to Alaska, where he had always planned to go if he burned every bridge in Springfield. Homer wins a truck by riding a motorcycle around a globe of death, and the family restarts their lives in a remote Alaskan cabin.\nMeanwhile, as Springfield exhausts its supplies, the townspeople begin to make cracks in the dome. Cargill, mad with power, tricks the president into ordering Springfield's destruction. The Simpsons see Tom Hanks on television advertising a \"new Grand Canyon\" on the site of Springfield. Realizing that Springfield is in danger, Marge and the kids vow to save their friends and neighbors. Homer, however, refuses to help the people who tried to kill them and storms out. When he returns the next morning, he finds his family gone, and a videotaped message from Marge explaining that they are saving Springfield without him, taped over their wedding video. An Inuit shaman helps Homer to have an epiphany about his selfishness and he vows to save the town. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids are captured by the EPA in Seattle and placed back inside the dome.\nThe EPA lowers a time bomb suspended by a rope through a hole at the top of the dome, and the townspeople plot to escape by climbing the rope. Homer returns to Springfield and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and the bomb off, inadvertently shortening its countdown and further provoking the town's ire. Homer and Bart use a motorcycle to travel up the side of the dome, and Bart throws the bomb through the hole seconds before it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill attempts to kill Homer and Bart for foiling his plan, but Maggie knocks him out by dropping a rock on his head. The townspeople celebrate Homer as a hero as he's seen riding into the sunset, sharing a passionate kiss with Marge. Later, the rest of the town pitches in to rebuild the Simpsons' house."

        "content": "Al Jean described the film's message as being \"a man should listen to his wife\". In addition, the film parodies two major contemporary issues, religion and environmentalism. The theme of environmentalism is present throughout the film: in Homer's polluting of Lake Springfield, Green Day's cameo, Lisa's activism and her romance with Colin. The villainous Russ Cargill is head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Reviewer Ed Gonzalez argued the plot was a satire of the government's reaction to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. Ian Nathan of Empire magazine criticized this focus, believing it gave the film an \"overt political agenda [which] border[s] on polemic\". James D. Bloom of Muhlenberg College commented on the \"explicitness\" of the film's \"intellectual agenda\", on this issue, shown particularly through Lisa. He wrote that the film's first post-opening credits scene, which sees Green Day fail in an attempt to engage their audience on the issue of the environment, \"sets in motion a plot expressly built around cultural agenda-setting\" and \"reflection on timely 'issues'.\"Religion is focused on in Grampa's momentary possession, and Marge believing what he said to be a message from God. Groening joked the film \"posit[s] the existence of a very active God\", when asked if he believed it was likely to offend. Mark I. Pinsky, author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, said the film \"treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping a sharp eye out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds\". Regarding the scene where the tenants of Moe's Tavern and the Church switch locations, he believed it took the \"chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility.\" In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, \"It is [the] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion.\" Trees are a motif in the film, and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film. The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting, which was a reference to the biblical figures of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden."

        "content": "Many cultural references and allusions are made throughout the film. Green Day plays \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" on violins as their barge sinks, in a sequence parodying the film Titanic. When Bart is riding his skateboard naked, different passing objects are almost constantly covering his genitalia, a nod to similar techniques used in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Homer and Marge's love scene parodies many Disney films, including Cinderella, with Disney-style animals helping them undress. Originally, the music from The Wizard of Oz was used in that scene, and the fawn had white spots; these were removed because the animators felt it resembled Bambi too clearly. Bart impersonates Mickey Mouse on the train, calling himself \"the mascot of an evil corporation\". Homer plays Grand Theft Walrus, an allusion to the video game series Grand Theft Auto. In the game, his character shoots a tap-dancing penguin in reference to the film Happy Feet. The \"Spider-Pig\" song is a parody of the theme song of the 1967 Spider-Man TV series, and the name of Lisa's lecture is An Irritating Truth, a play on Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth. The bomb disposal robot was based on Vincent D'Onofrio's character Leonard \"Pyle\" Lawrence from the film Full Metal Jacket, who commits suicide in a similar way. At the end of the film, the crowd's celebration is similar to the conclusion of Return of the Jedi, with Carl performing exactly the same hand gestures as Lando Calrissian.The $1,000 Homer received when entering Alaska is a reference to the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend. As Homer leaves Eski-Moe's he grabs on to a passing truck and uses it to propel himself back to the house, a tribute to actor Buster Keaton, while the epiphany scene features homages to the film Brazil and the works of Salvador Dal\u00ed. Hillary Clinton appears as Itchy's vice president, while an Orc from The Lord of the Rings appears in the mob scene. A scene that was cut had Marge and the kids appear on the TV talk show The View to spread the news of Springfield's impending doom. Parts were written for the show's entire panel and the scene was planned to feature Russ Cargill having a gunfight with Joy Behar. Another dropped scene featured Moe describing Springfield's varying physical states inside the dome, one of which was the Disneyland ride Autopia. There are several references to events in previous TV episodes of The Simpsons. These include the wreckage of the ambulance from the episode \"Bart the Daredevil\" crashed into a tree next to Springfield Gorge. The Carpenters' song \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" was used in Homer and Marge's wedding video and had also been used in several emotional moments between them in the TV series."

He added that there were no immediate plans, stating, \"We've been asked to [develop it], but we haven't. We're doing a lot of other stuff.\" In December 2014, just prior to the broadcast of the episode \"The Man Who Came to Be Dinner\", Jean wrote on Twitter that the episode (which had been produced in 2012 and was originally set to air in May 2013) had been held back by himself and Brooks because it was being considered for adaptation into a sequel film as the episode was \"cinematic\". Jean later expanded that there was the fear of the potential film being considered \"not canonical\" with the TV series and the potential backlash of overcoming it by using a \"memory wipe\". In July 2017, Silverman and Jean said that the sequel was in the early stages of development and stressed the toll production of the first picture took on the entire staff. On August 10, 2018, it was reported that a sequel was in development. On July 22, 2019, Groening stated that he had \"no doubts\" that The Walt Disney Company, which acquired 21st Century Fox early that year, would likely produce a sequel one day. In July 2021, Jean stated that discussions for the potential sequel had stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

One day, he gets drawn to his old and vacant family apartment, where he opens the lid of a treasure chest, only to see a vision of Misha dead inside. He finally seeks psychiatric help in the form of the odd Dr. Palit, who puts him under regression hypnosis to go back to the past, when Bobo was 11 and Misha was 6.\nIt is revealed that Bobo and Misha lived with their single father in their apartment. One day, Bobo reads a book about witchcraft, from which he discovers the number 666 and uses it to travel on the elevator to an unlisted floor at the bottom of the building, which he tells Misha is the entrance to hell. According to Bobo, each building has its own hell, where the \"bad people\" of the building are consigned for eternity once they are dead. One day, a woman named Diana moves into their building, and Bobo is convinced that she is a daayan who surfaced following his and Misha's trip on the elevator.\nDiana charms Bobo's father and marries him. Bobo then learns that a daayan's source of power is her plait. On Diana's birthday, during the night of the red moon, she sacrifices Misha to restore her dark powers. Bobo and his father discover Misha's corpse inside the trunk and a now-undisguised Diana hovering over her body. Diana kills Bobo's father with her ear-piercing screams. As she performs the rest of her ritual, the distraught Bobo finds his father's dagger and cuts off Diana's plait, destroying her source of power. Diana begins to crumble into dust, but she tells him that she will return.\nDr. Palit dismisses Bobo's visions as fantasy. Bobo and Tamara marry and adopt ten-year-old Zubin. Everything goes well till the irresistible Lisa Dutt enters their lives during a magic show. Everyone loves her, but Bobo suspects that the witch is back in the form of Lisa. Lisa buys Bobo's old apartment, adding to his suspicion. During Lisa's housewarming party, Tamara falls off the balcony and is hospitalized. Lisa visits her, but Bobo walks in and angrily tells her to get out when he finds her tinkering with the IV bag. Afraid for his family, he calls Dr. Palit for help.\nDr. Palit finds out something disturbing and calls Bobo, but the witch appears as Diana and kills him. Bobo finds Dr. Palit dead and sees a paper in his hand, on which Zubin's name is written. He looks for Zubin everywhere but finds him missing. He then rushes back to the old apartment and takes the elevator to hell.\nThere, he finds Zubin lying on an altar and the witch ready to sacrifice his son's life to sustain her powers. Bobo tries to save Zubin but encounters Tamara. In a twist, it is revealed that Tamara is the witch, not Lisa. Diana appears and tells him that he is a Pishacha, because no average person who pushes a button in an elevator finds hell. Tamara tells him that it took her twenty years to be reborn and she will not let him kill her again, and she knocks him unconscious.\nBobo wakes up and remembers the book where he read that a Pishacha can regain his strength on the night of a red moon, and today is the night of the red moon. With his newly acquired powers, he kills Tamara and returns his powers to Satan. The witch, now appearing as Diana, reveals that only an innocent person can kill a witch, and since Bobo killed her once before, he is no longer innocent. The two fight again until Bobo kicks the sacrificial dagger at Zubin. Zubin then manages to cut off Diana's plait, but the crumbling witch promises that she will return again.\nIn the end, Bobo meets Lisa, and she asks him why he was so aggressive towards her in the beginning. Bobo tells her that he thought she was a witch."

        "content": "Hoodwinked!  is a 2005 American animated mystery comedy film. It retells the folktale \"Little Red Riding Hood\" as a police procedural, using backstories to show multiple characters' points of view. It was produced independently by Blue Yonder Films with Kanbar Entertainment, directed and written by Cory Edwards along with Todd Edwards, and Tony Leech, and produced by Katie Hooten, Maurice Kanbar, David K. Lovegren, Sue Bea Montgomery, and Preston Stutzman. The film features the voices of Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, Jim Belushi, Patrick Warburton, Anthony Anderson, David Ogden Stiers, Xzibit, Chazz Palminteri, and Andy Dick.\nHoodwinked! was among the earliest computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's low budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines with a stylized design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until near the end of production, and while the company had several roles recast with higher-profile actors, it otherwise made few changes to the film. Structurally, the film was inspired by non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon and Pulp Fiction. It was released shortly after the first two installments in the successful Shrek series, which accentuated the fairy tale parody genre of which Hoodwinked! is a part. Hoodwinked!, however, intentionally deviated from the Shrek series in its style of humor and in certain plot elements. This was in part based on Cory Edwards' concerns over exposing children to the high level of cynicism often found in the genre.\nThe film was released by the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles, California, and Philadelphia on December 16, 2005, for a one-week engagement before expanding nationwide on January 13, 2006. Critical reception to the film was varied; although its script and voice performances were praised by many reviews, its animation quality was heavily criticized. The film was a commercial success, earning over thirteen times its less-than-$8 million budget. A sequel, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil, was released in 2011 to negative reviews and failed to match the financial success of the first film."

As the wolf attacks Red, the tied-up Granny jumps out of a closet just as an ax-wielding woodsman bursts through the window. The police arrive, and Detective Nicky Flippers, believing the incident to be tied to a string of \"goody\"-related robberies, questions everyone about the incident.\nRed explains she was delivering goodies for Granny's business when she discovered a threat from the Goody Bandit. Believing the family recipes would be safer at Granny's house Red set out for her mountaintop home but fell out of a cable car operated by a bunny named Boingo and encountered the Wolf, who asked her suspicious questions. Evading the Wolf, she then met the old singing goat Japeth, who accompanied her to Granny's house where she found the Wolf waiting in ambush.\nThe Wolf reveals that he is an investigative reporter on the trail of the Goody Bandit, and had reason to believe Red and Granny were the culprits. He and his hyperactive fast talking squirrel assistant Twitchy confronted Red in hope of solving the Goody Bandit mystery. When they failed to detain Red, they made haste for Granny's house, arriving ahead of Red despite poor instructions given by Boingo. They found Granny already tied up in the closet. The Wolf disguised himself as Granny, planning to trick Red into revealing the truth about the Goody Bandit.\nThe woodsman explains his appearance at Granny's house was pure coincidence; he is actually an aspiring actor named Kirk trying out for the part of a spokesperson in a commercial. After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, Kirk received a callback for the commercial and was told to 'find his inner woodsman'. He spent the rest of the day getting into character by chopping trees, until at sunset a tree collapsed and pushed him through the window of Granny's home.\nThe investigation turns to Granny, who admits that, unbeknownst to Red, she is secretly an extreme sports enthusiast. Earlier that day she had competed in a ski race, with Boingo watching as a fan. During the race, the opposing team attacked Granny, explaining that the Goody Bandit hired the team to eliminate her. While parachuting back home, she got tangled in the parachute strings, which snagged on her ceiling fan and threw her into the closet.\nFeeling betrayed by Granny's secrecy, Red wanders off alone, arousing supicion. Flippers deduces that Boingo had been present in all four stories and must be the Goody Bandit. Red notices Boingo sneaking in and stealing the Puckett family recipes, follows him to his cable car station hideout where she confronts him but is overpowered and captured. The police pursue Boingo in the wrong direction.

        "content": "Hoodwinked! was one of the first independent computer-animated films to be produced without the aid of a distributor. Although the film's budget is listed as $30 million on Box Office Mojo, several sources have rejected this figure, reporting that the film was produced for no more than $15 million. Director Cory Edwards explained in a 2009 interview that the film's actual budget was under $8 million. Any of these figures would be significantly lower than is typical for a computer-animated film's budget. At the time of Hoodwinked!'s production, the costs of computer-animation software had only recently decreased to a price that was accessible to more than just major studios, and leading up to the film's release, producer David Lovegren said, \"Six or seven years ago, the idea of doing Hoodwinked! as an independent [animated] feature would have been impossible\".The filmmakers only made the film independently by necessity, and Cory Edwards has said, \"It's not a model to be followed. It was a once-in-a-lifetime, seat-of-your-pants kind of thing that just barely came off.\" However, he added that the process was worth going through to get the film made and encouraged aspiring filmmakers to be willing to follow it."

        "content": "In February 2006, author Timothy Sexton wrote an article titled \"Hoodwinked: A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism\" for Associated Content, in which he posited that Hoodwinked! was one of the first postmodern animated films and that the film also carried political undertones. He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters' points of view. Calling Hoodwinked! \"the most subversive movie released nationwide since Fahrenheit 9/11\", Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on the free enterprise system. He drew comparisons between the film's villain and the typical American business owner, going so far as to say that the character was \"clearly based on people like Bill Gates and Sam Walton\". In Sexton's view, the film exposed the flaws of capitalism, showing that if left unregulated, business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition.The film's director and co-writer Cory Edwards was surprised by Sexton's interpretation and denied that the film intentionally carried any political messages. He explained that he and the other filmmakers were simply drawing from the evil schemes common of James Bond films, Bugs Bunny cartoons, and The A-Team, and wrote \"If Mr. Sexton sees my movie as a sermon against mega-corporations monopolizing America, that's fine. But our villain is just as easily the face of every dictator in history, or every schoolyard bully who is compensating for low self-esteem, or any Mafia boss who dominates by either absorbing or wiping out his competition. Hey, if you look at an abstract painting and see the devil in a red splotch, that's your prerogative ... I guess a movie's message is only partially supplied by the filmmaker.\"In May 2007 Time magazine ran an article by James Poniewozik titled \"Is Shrek Bad for Kids?\" which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, \"I thought Hoodwinked! and most of the Shrek series were hilarious ... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood.\" Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, \"As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We went to great lengths to distance our film from Shrek's humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not.\""

It was first announced in January 2006 and in February, Cory Edwards, Todd Edwards, and Tony Leech explained that although they would be writing the screenplay, they would not return to direct. Cory Edwards later elaborated on this decision, explaining that he had a negative experience working with some of the first film's \"key players\" and felt that he had been poorly treated by them. He also cited concerns over being confined to animation, and stated that he felt it would be a lateral move to direct a sequel to his first film as his second film. In March 2007, Edwards announced that Mike Disa had been hired to direct the sequel and expressed enthusiasm over his involvement, saying that he \"has a real passion for the film and a devotion to maintaining the Hoodwinked world. He wants to do the sequel justice and he really gets what we're trying to do.\" Although much of the first film's cast returned for the sequel, Anne Hathaway was replaced by Hayden Panettiere in the role of Red and Jim Belushi was replaced by Martin Short in the role of Kirk the Woodsman.Kanbar Entertainment initially intended to finance production of the sequel independently as it had done with the first film, but entered into a co-financing agreement proposed by The Weinstein Company. The film was initially scheduled to be released on January 15, 2010, but in December 2009, The Weinstein Company postponed the film's release date indefinitely. In April 2010, Kanbar Entertainment brought a lawsuit against The Weinstein Company. In addition to claiming that the postponement of the film's release date breached an agreement between the two companies, the lawsuit accused the Weinstein Company of not contributing to monthly production accounts after February 2009, neglecting to consult Kanbar Entertainment of a release strategy, and not responding to proposed changes to the film, even though Kanbar Entertainment held \"final authority on production decisions\".The film was a financial failure, earning $23.1 million worldwide; less than its budget. Critical reception to the film was almost universally negative, with a Rotten score of 11% across 61 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 20/100 on Metacritic. Cory Edwards expressed disappointment with the finished film, indicating that it was heavily altered from the original script and saying that it was \"deflating to give this thing away and watch others run with it in ways I would not.\""

He reports that the Order of the Phoenix will move Harry Potter, no longer under his mother's protective spell, to a safe location. Voldemort confiscates Lucius Malfoy's wand; his own is powerless against Harry because it and Harry's wand are \"brothers\" by sharing the same phoenix feather core. During the move, Harry survives Voldemort's attack, but Mad-Eye Moody and Hedwig are killed.\nDuring preparations for Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, the new Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour arrives. He informs Harry, Ron, and Hermione that Albus Dumbledore left each a bequest: Ron a Deluminator, Hermione a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Harry the Golden Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match. Dumbledore also bequeathed the Sword of Gryffindor to Harry, but it has gone missing.\nNews arrives during the wedding that the Ministry has fallen and Scrimgeour is dead. Death Eaters attack, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape to Number 12, Grimmauld Place. While there, Ron realises that Sirius' brother, Regulus Black, is the R.A.B. who stole Salazar Slytherin's locket from Voldemort. Local thief Mundungus Fletcher later sold it to Dolores Umbridge. Harry, Ron, and Hermione infiltrate the Ministry and recover the locket, but they are chased by Death Eaters in a chaotic exit. Hermione disapparates them to a forest. Meanwhile, Ron is injured. The trio decides to start their journey to discover and destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, beginning with the locket.\nAttempts to destroy the locket fail. Hermione deduces that Gryffindor's sword can destroy Horcruxes because it is impregnated with basilisk venom. Ron, affected by the dark locket, is frustrated with their slow progress and irrationally jealous of Harry and Hermione. He argues with Harry then leaves. When Harry touches the Snitch to his lips, it reveals a cryptic message: \"I open at the close.\" Hermione notices a strange symbol drawn in Beedle the Bard that is identical to one Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius wears.\nHarry and Hermione search for the sword in Godric's Hollow and encounter the same strange symbol in a cemetery. Elderly historian Bathilda Bagshot invites them in her cottage, where they find a photo of the young man in Harry's dream who stole a wand from wandmaker Gregorovitch. Bathilda morphs into Voldemort's snake Nagini and attacks Harry. Hermione disapparates them to safety, but her rebounding spell accidentally destroys Harry's wand. Hermione identifies the man in the photo as dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald. That night, a doe patronus leads Harry to a frozen pond where Gryffindor's sword lies on the bottom. Harry dives into the frigid water, but the locket around his neck tightens, strangling him. Ron appears, retrieves the sword, and saves Harry. They destroy the locket Horcrux with the sword. Ron explains that the Deluminator led him to their location.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione visit Xenophilius Lovegood and learn the symbol represents the Deathly Hallows. Many years before, three brothers each received a prize that evades Death: the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility, and the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand known. Possessing all three makes one the Master of Death. Xenophilius secretly summons the Death Eaters, hoping to exchange Harry for a kidnapped Luna. The three escape, but Snatchers capture them. During a vision, Harry sees an elderly Grindelwald telling Voldemort that the Elder Wand is buried with Dumbledore.\nAt Malfoy Manor, Bellatrix Lestrange sees a Snatcher with Gryffindor's sword that she believed was in her Gringotts vault. Harry and Ron are locked into the cellar, where they encounter Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook. Upstairs, Bellatrix tortures Hermione. Harry begs for help using a mirror shard in which he believes he glimpsed Dumbledore; Dobby appears in response and helps save everyone while Harry grabs their captured wands from Draco Malfoy. As they disapparate, Bellatrix throws a knife, killing Dobby. Harry buries him near Bill and Fleur's seaside cottage, an Order safe house. Meanwhile, Voldemort retrieves the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb."

The album's lyrical content is filled with some of the emotions that he felt while mourning the loss of his close friend. In the song, titled \"Is This the End?\", he raps about experiencing the drive-by shooting that happened in Los Angeles, California, which took the Notorious B.I.G.'s life. The album was originally called Puff Daddy & the Goodfellas, then slated to be titled Hell Up in Harlem, but following the death of the Notorious B.I.G., he decided to switch the album's title to No Way Out. As discussed in \"Unbelievable: The Life, Death, and Afterlife of The Notorious B.I.G.\" by Cheo Hodari Coker, the weight of the East Coast/West Coast rivalry and the accompanying threats had taken its toll on Combs and those around him. It was decided that they needed to get away and become focused on making hits. So, Combs brought producers Steven \"Stevie J.\" Jordan, Deric \"D-Dot\" Angelettie, Nashiem Myrick and Ron Lawrence as well as engineers Axel Niehaus and Tony Maserati down to the Caribbean Sound Basin studio in Maraval, Trinidad, along with everything that they needed to craft hits. In the book, Puffy is quoted as saying, \"For the next two years, I wanna have radio on lock.

Conceived following his songwriting breakthrough with \"Let Me Love You\" for fellow R&B singer Mario in 2004, Ne-Yo worked with musicians Ron \"Neff-U\" Feemster, Brandon Howard, Shea Taylor, and Curtis \"Sauce\" Wilson, as well as Norwegian production duo Stargate on most of the album, some of which would become regular contributors on subsequent projects. The singer co-wrote the lyrics for each song on In My Own Words which features guest appearances by rappers Peedi Peedi and Ghostface Killah.\nUpon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics and earned a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Contemporary R&B Album category. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 301,000 copies sold, and reached the top ten of the Canadian Albums Chart. It was subsequently certified platinum by Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with 1.5 million copies sold in the United States, and became a platinum-seller in Australia, Japan, and the United Kingdom as well. Four singles were released from the album, including \"Stay\", \"When You're Mad\", \"Sexy Love\", and the number-one hit \"So Sick\". In further support, Ne-Yo went on tour in August 2006 with singer Chris Brown and Dem Franchize Boyz."

AllMusic editor Andy Kellman gave In My Own Words a four-and-a-half-out-of-five-stars-rating and noted that it \"could turn out to be the most impressive R&B debut of 2006, as well as one of several milestones in a lengthy career [...]  It's very focused and surprisingly taut, especially for a debut that involves several producers [...] Its modern approach, interlocked with touches of '70s and '80s R&B sensibilities, is also in effect for the entirety of the album.\" In his review for USA Today, Steve Jones remarked that \"Ne-Yo is the latest in a recent line of engaging young R&B singers but with his own words he sets himself apart [...] On his soulful solo debut, it's apparent that the Las Vegas-bred singer saved some of his best lyrical work for himself.\" Yardbarker listed the album among \"The best R&B albums of the 2000s\".Dan Nishimoto from PopMatters declared the album a \"notable success. With spare but clean, rounded yet consistent production, the album has an appealing azure quality.\" Billboard found that \"though, at times, the lyrics are a bit too sentimental and production is spotty, In My Own Words should have listeners clinging to Ne-Yo's every word.\" Kelefa Sanneh, writer for The New York Times, complimented Ne-Yo for his \"smooth\" writing and added: \"Not everything on this CD is that brilliant, or that shameless, but Ne-Yo is a deft and appealing player in the game of modern-day R&B.\" Slightly less impressed, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani found that In My Own Words \"might pale next to [John] Legend\u2019s stellar debut, but, even at its Robert Kelly worst, it\u2019s not hateable. And isn\u2019t that all one can ask for from mainstream R&B these days?\" Blender wrote that \"even at its weepiest, his music, thankfully, stays vivacious.\" Raymond Fiore from Entertainment Weekly called the album a \"confident if slightly underwhelming debut.\""

        "content": "The Deer Hunter is a 1978 American epic war drama film co-written and directed by Michael Cimino about a trio of Slavic-American steelworkers whose lives are upended after fighting in the Vietnam War. The three soldiers are played by Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and John Savage, with John Cazale (in his final role), Meryl Streep and George Dzundza in supporting roles. The story takes place in Clairton, Pennsylvania, a working-class town on the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, and in Vietnam.\nThe film was based in part on an unproduced screenplay called \"The Man Who Came to Play,\" by Louis A. Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, about Las Vegas and Russian roulette. Producer Michael Deeley, who bought the script, hired writer/director Michael Cimino who, with Deric Washburn, rewrote the script, taking the Russian roulette element and placing it in the Vietnam War. The film went over-budget and over-schedule, and ended up costing $15 million. Its producers EMI Films released it internationally, while Universal Pictures handled its North American distribution.\nThe Deer Hunter received acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for Cimino's direction, the performances of its cast (particularly De Niro, Walken, Cazale and Streep), and its screenplay, realistic themes and tones, and cinematography. It was also successful at the box office, grossing $49 million. At the 51st Academy Awards, it was nominated for nine Academy Awards, and won five: Best Picture, Best Director for Cimino, Best Supporting Actor for Walken, Best Sound, and Best Film Editing. It was Meryl Streep's first Academy Award nomination (for Best Supporting Actress).\nDespite its critical acclaim and awards, some of the industry's most prominent critics derided what they considered The Deer Hunter's simplistic, bigoted, and historically inaccurate depictions of the Viet Cong and of America's position in the Vietnam War. The central theme of the Viet Cong forcing American captives to play Russian roulette has been widely criticized as having no historical basis, a claim Cimino denied but did not refute with documentary evidence.\nThe Deer Hunter has been included on lists of the best films ever made, including being named the 53rd-greatest American film of all time by the American Film Institute in 2007 in their 10th Anniversary Edition of the AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1996, as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\""

Mike, Steven, and Nick are preparing to leave for military service in Vietnam. Steven is engaged to Angela Ludhjduravic, who was secretly impregnated by another man. Mike and Nick are close friends who live together and both love Linda, who will be moving into their home to escape from her alcoholic father. While dancing at Steven and Angela's wedding, Linda accepts Nick's spontaneous marriage proposal. Nick implores Mike to ensure he returns from Vietnam. Mike, Nick, and their friends go on a final hunting trip. Mike kills a deer with a single shot.\nIn Vietnam in early 1969, Mike, a member of Special Forces, happens upon Nick and Steven in a village, where the three are imprisoned by the Viet Cong in a cage along a river and forced to participate in games of Russian roulette while the jailers bet. Steven fires his round at the ceiling and is forced into a cage with rats and previous victims of the jailers. Mike convinces his captors to put three bullets into the revolver's cylinder; Nick and Mike then use the pistol to overpower their captors and escape, rescuing Steven in the process.\nThe trio floats down the river but Nick's leg is shot; they are rescued by an American helicopter, but Steven falls back into the river. Mike drops down to help Steven while Nick is flown away. Steven's legs were broken in the fall, so Mike carries him until they meet refugees fleeing to Saigon.\nNick is treated at a U.S. military hospital. Once released, Nick, now suffering from PTSD, wanders into a gambling den. French businessman Julien Grinda persuades him to come inside. Upset, Nick interrupts a game of Russian roulette, pulling the trigger on himself. Mike is present as a spectator, but Nick and Julien hurriedly leave.\nIn 1970, Mike returns home, but cannot integrate into civilian life. He avoids a welcome-home party, opting to stay alone in a hotel. He visits Linda and learns that Nick has deserted. Mike then visits Angela, now a mother, but has slipped into catatonia following the return of Steven, who has lost both of his legs in the war. Stan, Axel, and John understand nothing of war or what Mike has experienced. Linda and Mike find comfort in each other's company. During a hunting trip, Mike stops himself from shooting a deer and returns to the cabin where he finds Stan cavalierly threatening Axel with his pistol. Mike takes it, chambering a single round, and triggers an empty chamber at Stan's head.\nMike visits Steven at a veterans' hospital; both of Steven's legs have been amputated, and he has lost the use of an arm. Steven refuses to come home, saying he no longer fits in. He tells Mike that he has been regularly receiving large sums of money from Vietnam. Mike intuits that Nick is the source of these payments, and forces Steven home to Angela. Mike returns to Vietnam in search of Nick. Wandering around Saigon, which is now in a state of chaos shortly before its fall, Mike finds Julien and persuades him to take him to the gambling den. Mike finds himself facing Nick, who has become a professional in the macabre game and fails to recognize Mike. Mike attempts to bring Nick back to reason, but Nick, who is now a heroin addict, is indifferent. During a game of Russian roulette, Mike invokes memories of their hunting trips. Nick recalls Mike's \"one shot\" method and smiles before pulling the trigger, killing himself.\nMike and his friends attend Nick's funeral, and the atmosphere at their local bar is dim and silent. Moved by emotion, John begins to sing \"God Bless America\" in honor of Nick, as everyone joins in."

After Roy Scheider withdrew from the cast two weeks before the start of filming over creative differences, producer Michael Deeley pursued De Niro, who was paid one million dollars for the role, in search of star power to sell a film with a \"gruesome-sounding storyline and a barely known director.\" De Niro later said: \"I liked the script, and [Cimino] had done a lot of prep. I was impressed.\" He prepared by socializing with steelworkers in local bars and by visiting their homes. De Niro claimed this was his most physically exhausting film and that the sequence in which Mike visits Steven in the hospital was the most emotional scene of his career.\nChristopher Walken as Corporal Nikanor Chevotarevich (\"Nick\"). His performance won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nJohn Savage as Corporal Steven Pushkov\nJohn Cazale as Stanley (\"Stan\"/\"Stosh\"). All scenes involving Cazale, who had terminal cancer, were filmed first. Because of his illness, the studio wanted to dismiss him, but Streep, with whom he was in a romantic relationship, and Cimino threatened to withdraw from the project if Cazale was released. He was also uninsurable, and according to Streep, De Niro paid for his insurance because he wanted Cazale in the film. This was Cazale's last film, as he died shortly after filming wrapped. Cazale never saw the finished film.\nMeryl Streep as Linda. In the screenplay, Streep's role was negligible, but Cimino explained the role to her and suggested that she write her own lines.\nGeorge Dzundza as John Welsh\nPierre Segui as Julien Grinda\nShirley Stoler as Steven's mother\nChuck Aspegren as Peter Axelrod (\"Axel\"). Aspegren was not an actor; he was the foreman at an East Chicago steel factory visited early in preproduction by De Niro and Cimino. They were so impressed with him that they offered him the role. He was the second person to be cast in the film after De Niro.\nRutanya Alda as Angela Ludhjduravic-Pushkov\nPaul D'Amato as Sergeant\nAmy Wright as Bridesmaid\nJoe Grifasi as Bandleader\nJohn F. Buchmelter III as a bar patron. Buchmelter was a steel worker whom Cimino wanted in order to lend the film a sense of authenticity.While Deeley was pleased with the revised script, he was still concerned about being able to sell the film. He later wrote: \"We still had to get millions out of a major studio, as well as convince our markets around the world that they should buy it before it was finished. I needed someone with the caliber of Robert De Niro.\" Deeley felt that De Niro was \"the right age, apparently tough as hell, and immensely talented.\"De Niro, who knew many actors in New York, brought Streep and Cazale to the attention of Cimino and Deeley. De Niro also accompanied Cimino to scout locations for the steel mill sequence and rehearsed with the actors to use the workshops as a bonding process.Each of the six principal male characters carried a photo in his back pocket depicting them all together as children in order to enhance the sense of camaraderie among them. Cimino instructed the props department to fashion complete photo IDs for each of them, including driver licenses and medical cards, to enhance each actor's sense of his character."

While the film opened the same year as Hal Ashby's Coming Home, Sidney Furie's The Boys in Company C, and Ted Post's Go Tell the Spartans, it was the first film about Vietnam to reach a wide audience and critical acclaim, culminating in the winning of the Oscar for Best Picture. Other films released later that illustrated the 'hellish', futile conditions of bloody Vietnam War combat included:\nFrancis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979)\nOliver Stone's Platoon (1986)\nStanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987)\nBrian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989)\nOliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July (1989)David Thomson wrote in an article titled \"The Deer Hunter: Story of a scene\" that the film changed the way war-time battles were portrayed on film: \"The terror and the blast of firepower changed the war film, even if it only used a revolver. More or less before the late 1970s, the movies had lived by a Second World War code in which battle scenes might be fierce but always rigorously controlled. The Deer Hunter unleashed a new, raw dynamic in combat and action, paving the way for Platoon, Saving Private Ryan and Clint Eastwood's Iwo Jima films.\"In a 2011 interview with Rotten Tomatoes, actor William Fichtner retrospectively stated that he and his partner were silenced after seeing the film, stating that \"the human experience was just so pointed; their journeys were so difficult, as life is sometimes. I remember after seeing it, walking down the street \u2014 I actually went with a girl on a date and saw The Deer Hunter, and we left the theater and walked for like an hour and nobody said anything; we were just kind of stunned about that.\"The deaths of approximately 25 people who died playing Russian roulette were reported as having been influenced by scenes in the movie."

It was released on June 22, 1979, by Reprise Records and features both studio and live tracks. Most of the album was recorded live, then overdubbed in the studio, while others originated in the studio. Young used the phrase \"rust never sleeps\" as a concept for his tour with Crazy Horse to avoid artistic complacency and try more progressive, theatrical approaches to performing live.The album peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 album chart and spawned the hit single \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" that peaked at No. 79 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also included one of Young's most popular and critically acclaimed songs, the enigmatic \"Powderfinger\". The album, along with Young's 1990 release Ragged Glory, has widely been considered a precursor of grunge music with the bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam having cited Young's heavily distorted and abrasive guitar style on the B side to this album as an inspiration."

        "content": "The album sees Young reunited with Crazy Horse, his first credited to the band since 1975's Zuma. Four of the albums's eight songs date from the sessions from that previous album: \"Pocahontas\", \"Ride My Llama\", \"Powderfinger\" and \"Sedan Delivery\". Studio attempts at each of these songs from the summer of 1975 have since been released through Young's Archives series. Young explains in his memoir, Waging Heavy Peace: \"The album Zuma is the first album we made with Crazy Horse after Poncho joined the band. We kept playing day after day and partying at night. We did the original \"Powderfinger\" and held it back. We did \"Sedan Delivery\" and held it back. \"Ride My Llama\" was completely finished and mixed and held back. Today I like listening to all of those tracks together in a compilation I call Dume that is in The Archives Volume 2.\"\nThe album's title, Rust Never Sleeps takes its name from the song that bookends the album, titled \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\" and \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\". The line \"It's better to burn out than it is to rust\" was borrowed from a line in a song by Jeff Blackburn, Young's bandmate in The Ducks, with whom he toured in 1977. Devo vocalist Mark Mothersbaugh added the lyrics \"Rust never sleeps\", a slogan he remembered from his graphic arts career promoting the automobile rust proofing product Rust-Oleum. Young recalls in a 1981 Rockline interview: \"I think Mark had the idea in the first place. We were doing this version of \"Out of the Blue\" together and we were in the studio playing and Booji Boy was there and he was singing 'Hey Hey, My My' and he just had a lyric sheet and it said 'It's better to burn out than to rust' and he just said 'Well it's better to burn out 'cause rust never sleeps' and I thought, well all right, that makes a lot of sense to me.\"\nYoung adopted Mothersbaugh's lyrics and created a new version of the song with Crazy Horse. He also adopted Mothersbaugh's lyrics for the title of his album as a metaphor about the hazards of complacency on his music career and the need to keep moving forward. Young explained in a June 1988 interview for Spin Magazine how the lyrics resonated with him, and how he felt both the record industry should be shaken up at the time, and how he applies the sentiment of the song to his style of recording: \"I never met Johnny Rotten, but I like what he did to people. He pissed off a lot of people who I think needed waking up. Rock 'n' roll people, who in the Seventies were asleep and thinking they were just so fucking cool and they knew what had to happen. They were telling me why don\u2019t you make a real record. People became aware that there was more to it than perfection and overdubs, and fucking equipment and limousines back and forth to Studio B, and the other group down the hall and getting high in the bathroom with the other group that's going in and singing on their record. That's not intense enough for me. I think art is a private thing. I'm not sharing my creative moment with whoever's in the hallway. Rust implies you're not using anything, that you're sitting there and letting the elements eat you. Burning up means you're cruising through the elements so fucking fast that you're actually burning, and your circuits, instead of corroding, are fucking disintegrating. You're going so fast you're actually fucking the elements, becoming one with the elements, turning to gas. That's why it's better to burn out.\"\nThe lyrics, \"It's better to burn out than fade away\", were widely quoted by his peers and by critics. In a 1980 interview with David Sheff from Playboy magazine, John Lennon was dismissive of the lyric and the song's reference to Johnny Rotten for what he interpreted as worship for the dead saying, \"No, thank you. I\u2019ll take the living and the healthy.\" In 1994, Kurt Cobain quoted the lyric in his suicide note. After Cobain's death, Young vowed never to perform the song again, but reversed his stance at the request of the surviving members of Nirvana.\"Thrasher\" was written while filming Human Highway in New Mexico with Dennis Hopper. Young remembers in a 2022 post to his website: \"After leaving Taos with Carpio, a Native American friend I had met during the filming of Human Highway, sitting in the front seat of his car, I wrote this song, \"Thrasher\". Driving through the magnificent beauty of New Mexico, the words just kept coming to me. I saw the eagles circling, the deep canyons, the road ahead, reflecting on my journey through recent years, and thankful to be where I was.\" The song's music bears similarity to Young's previous song \"Evening Coconut,\" which he wrote about his boat. In the song's lyrics, he uncharitably describes his CSNY bandmates as \"dead weight.\" Young explains in a 1985 interview: \"Well, at that point I felt like it was kind of dead weight for me. Not for them. For me. I could go somewhere and they couldn't go there. I wasn't going to pull them along, they were doing fine without me. It might have come off a little more harsh than I meant it, but once I write I can't say, 'Oh, I'm going to hurt someone's feelings.' Poetically and on feeling it made good sense to me and it came right out. I think I'd be doing a disservice to change it based on what I think a reaction would be. I try not to do that.\" Young chose not to perform the song for several years after its initial release, due to his reaction to a particularly harsh review of the song. He would tell a 2014 audience \"This song, you know, I did it, I haven't done it that much in my life because at a very vulnerable moment I read something about it. Just like the worst fucking review I've ever read. So for all your reviewers, if you feel like your words don't mean anything, you're probably right, but in that case, in that case they were damaging. So, anyway, I think I got this, I think this it's the one here. I hope so.\"\"Ride My Llama\" tells a tale of space travel and playing guitars with an alien. When introducing the song at The Boarding House, Young described it as \"an extraterrestrial folk song\" about \"close encounters of the finest kind.\" He further shares that he wrote the song the same day as \"Cortez the Killer\". Young and Crazy Horse would first record \"Cortez the Killer\", \"Ride My Llama\" and \"Sedan Delivery\" on the same day at the beginning of the Zuma sessions. \n\"Pocahontas\" was written at the home of CSNY road manager and video producer Taylor Phelps \"one night when I was just sitting around on one of my friend's farms out there. We were getting high sitting there in front of that old pot belly, thinking about what it could've been like. I turned over and said, 'Wow, I wish I had my 12 string with me right now'.\" The song was written \"just after Marlon Brando received his Academy Award and didn't accept it.  And sent an Indian girl to receive the award and make a few comments.\"\"Sail Away\" was first performed live in 1977 with The Ducks. Its lyrics celebrate the feeling of freedom that comes with being able to change one's settings. Referring to the song, Young shares on his website in 2018 that \"When i think about the road, I always see those long strips of blacktop cutting through immense valleys.\"\n\"Powderfinger\" took several years to write; when Young first played the song live at The Boarding House, he claimed he still didn't know it well. Young explains its evolution in a 1993 interview: \"It's a unique thing when you start a song at one point and finish it years later. Something happens. You get an original idea and get it going, and something stops you. It could be anything- some distraction that happens and takes your mind away from it. You could be trying too hard. These things happen, and you don't finish the song.\n\"Powderfinger\" took a long time; I wrote the first line in 1967 and didn't finish the song until 1975. It was funny to pick up where I left off. Something blocks me once in awhile, and I don't try to force anything to an unnatural end. I just put it away and maybe come back to it later.\" Young would offer the song to Lynyrd Skynyrd for one of their albums, but members of the group perished before it could be recorded. Cameron Crowe remembers in a post to his blog, The Uncool: \"Neil Young gave a tape to Joel Bernstein to give to me which I gave to Ronnie [Van Zant], that had three songs on it - \"Captain Kennedy,\" \"Sedan Delivery,\" and \"Powderfinger\" - before they'd come out. And he wanted to give them to Lynyrd Skynyrd if they wanted to do one of his songs.\"\n\"Sedan Delivery\" appears with a faster tempo and with one less verse than its studio performance from the Zuma sessions that surfaced on Chrome Dreams. In a 1995 interview with Nick Kent for Mojo magazine, Young denies any influence of U.K. punk rock on the album: \"I wasn't really influenced by that scene. Most of the songs on that album had been written well before the Sex Pistols were ever heard of.\" Instead, in a 2019 post on his website, he does credit Devo's influence: \"This version was inspired by DEVO in attitude, moving a lot faster than the original earliest recording of \"Sedan Delivery\".\""

        "content": "The acoustic portions of the album including, \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\", \"Thrasher\" and \"Ride My Llama\" were recorded live in San Francisco at the Boarding House between May 24 and 28, 1978. Young played ten acoustic sets over five days. Young used the occasion to play several songs in concert for the first time. In addition to the three tracks on the album he also debuted \"Powderfinger\", \"Shots\" and \"The Ways of Love\" and played the rarities \"Out of My Mind\" and \"I Believe in You\" on piano. \"Shots\" would later appear on \"Re\u00b7ac\u00b7tor\" in 1981; \"The Ways of Love\" would first surface on Freedom in 1989. The concert takes were heavily overdubbed in the studio. For example, Young would later double the guitar part to \"Ride My Llama\" in the studio. \nTwo songs from the album were not recorded live: \"Pocahontas\" had been recorded solo in August 1976 during the Hitchhiker session, with later overdubs in September 1977 at Triiad studios for the album Oceanside/Countryside, an early version of Comes a Time. \"Sail Away\" was also recorded at Triiad as a solo track, and received full band overdubs during the Comes a Time recording sessions in November 1977.Following the May 27th performances at The Boarding House, Young joined Devo onstage at the punk club Mabuhay Gardens. The following day, they  collaborated on the first electric performance of \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" at Different Fur Studios for the film Human Highway. Young would later push Crazy Horse to match Devo's intensity of performance when recording their version of the song for the album.The electric sets were recorded during the Neil Young/Crazy Horse tour in October 1978, with overdubs added later. The same performance of \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" is used on both Rust Never Sleeps and Live Rust, with the former receiving significant overdubs. Audience noise is removed from the album as much as possible, although it is clearly audible at certain points, most noticeably on the opening and closing songs.  \nYoung adopted a new look for the concerts, with much shorter hair and wearing a sport coat and bolo tie. The concerts incorporated several visual stunts: ridiculously oversized amplifiers, Star Wars Jawa-inspired \"road-eye\" characters roaming the stage and 3D \"Rust-O-Vision\" glasses were given out to the audience. He would also appear onstage alongside three large wood-carved Indian statues from the set of Human Highway. One of the statues, \"Woody\", would accompany Young on future tours.The 1978 tour featured an abrasive style of guitar playing influenced by the punk rock zeitgeist of the late 1970s that Young saw as a wake up call for a rock music world which, in his opinion had become predictable and overdone. The electric sets provided a reenergized response to the punk rock revolution and, were in stark contrast from Young's previous, folk-inspired album Comes a Time."

        "content": "Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1979, Robert Christgau called Rust Never Sleeps Young's best album yet and said although his melodies are unsurprisingly simple and original, his lyrics are surprisingly and offhandedly complex. \"He's wiser but not wearier\", Christgau wrote, \"victor so far over the slow burnout his title warns of\". Paul Nelson, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, found its first side virtuosic because of how Young transcends the songs' acoustic settings with his commanding performance and was impressed by its themes of personal escape and exhaustion, the role of rock music, and American violence: \"Rust Never Sleeps tells me more about my life, my country and rock & roll than any music I've heard in years.\"Rust Never Sleeps was voted the second best album of 1979 in The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it second on his own list for the poll, as did fellow critic Greil Marcus. The album also won Rolling Stone magazine's 1979 critics poll for Album of the Year. In a decade-end list for The Village Voice, Christgau named it the ninth best album of the 1970s.In 2000, Rust Never Sleeps was voted number 240 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums book. In 2003, it was ranked number 350 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone re-ranked the album at 351 in the list's 2012 edition, and later at number 296 in the 2020 edition. In a retrospective review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that the acoustic and electric sides were both astounding. AllMusic's William Ruhlmann viewed that Young reinvigorated himself artistically by being imaginative and bold, and in the process created an exemplary album that \"encapsulated his many styles on a single disc with great songs \u2014 in particular the remarkable 'Powderfinger' \u2014 unlike any he had written before.\" Rob Sheffield, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), felt that \"Powderfinger\", \"Pocahontas\", \"Thrasher\", and \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" were among Young's greatest songs."

        "content": "The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records in the UK and Capitol Records in the US. Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and also deal with the mental health problems of the former band member Syd Barrett, who departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.\nThe record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised the band's earlier work. The group employed multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers, including experimentation with the EMS VCS 3 and a Synthi A. The engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many of the sonic aspects of the recording, and for the recruitment of the session singer Clare Torry, who appears on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\nThe Dark Side of the Moon explores themes such as conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew and others are featured alongside philosophical quotations. The sleeve, which depicts a prismatic  spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson in response to the keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design which would represent the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\".\nThe Dark Side of the Moon is among the most critically acclaimed albums and often features in professional listings of the greatest of all time. It brought Pink Floyd international fame, wealth and plaudits to all four band members. A blockbuster release of the album era, it also propelled record sales throughout the music industry during the 1970s. The Dark Side of the Moon is certified 14 times platinum in the United Kingdom, and topped the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, where it has charted for 988 weeks. As of 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon had sold over 45 million copies worldwide, making it the band's best-selling release, the best-selling album of the 1970s, and the fourth-best-selling album in history. In 2012, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999."

        "content": "Following Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. In a band meeting at the drummer Nick Mason's home in north London, the bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters conceived an album that dealt with things that \"make people mad\", focusing on the pressures associated with the band's arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the mental health problems suffered by the former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with the 1969 concert suite The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, the guitarist David Gilmour said: \"I think we all thought \u2013  and Roger definitely thought \u2013  that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.\"\n\nThe band approved of Waters' concept for an album unified by a single theme, and Waters, Gilmour, Mason and the keyboardist Richard Wright all participated in writing and producing new material. Waters created the early demo tracks in a small studio in a garden shed at his home in Islington. Parts of the album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of \"Breathe\" came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of The Body, and the basic structure of \"Us and Them\" was borrowed from an original composition, \"The Violent Sequence\" by Wright for Zabriskie Point. The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by the Rolling Stones and at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel quadraphonic output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three lorries. This would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour. The album had been given the provisional title of Dark Side of the Moon (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). After discovering that title had already been used by another band, Medicine Head, it was temporarily changed to Eclipse. The new material was premiered at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference.\nDark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it was then known, was performed for an assembled press on 17 February 1972 at the Rainbow Theatre, more than a year before its release, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as \"bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.\" Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote \"The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast.\" Melody Maker was less enthusiastic: \"Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London Zoo.\" The following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed in the same order in which it was eventually sequenced on the album. Differences included the lack of synthesisers in tracks such as \"On the Run\", and Clare Torry's vocals on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" replaced by readings from the Bible.Pink Floyd's lengthy tour through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make improvements to the scale and quality of their performances. Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band travelled to France and recorded music for the French director Barbet Schroeder's film La Vall\u00e9e. They performed in Japan, returned to France in March to complete work on the film, played more shows in North America, then flew to London and resumed recording in May and June. After more concerts in Europe and North America, the band returned to London on 9 January 1973 to complete the album."

        "content": "The Dark Side of the Moon was built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings, although it lacked the extended instrumental excursions which, according to the critic David Fricke, had become characteristic of the band following the departure of the founding member Syd Barrett in 1968. Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as \"that psychedelic noodling stuff\". He and Waters cited 1971's Meddle as a turning point towards what would later be realised on the album. The Dark Side of the Moon's lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death and insanity, the last inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state. The album contains musique concr\u00e8te on several tracks.Each side of the vinyl album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience and, according to Waters, \"empathy\". \"Speak to Me\" and \"Breathe\" together highlight the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life \u2013  \"Don't be afraid to care\". By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesiser-driven instrumental \"On the Run\" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying. \"Time\" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane pursuits; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in \"Breathe (Reprise)\". The first side of the album ends with Wright and Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".\"Money\", the first track on side two, opens with the sound of cash registers and rhythmically jingling coins. The song mocks greed and consumerism with sarcastic lyrics and cash-related sound effects. \"Money\" became the band's most commercially successful track and was covered by other artists. \"Us and Them\" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. \"Any Colour You Like\" tackles the illusion of choice one has in society. \"Brain Damage\" looks at mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line \"and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes\" reflects the mental breakdown of Syd Barrett. The album ends with \"Eclipse\", which espouses the concepts of otherness and unity, while encouraging the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity."

        "content": "The Dark Side of the Moon was recorded at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in approximately 60 days between 31 May 1972 and 9 February 1973.  Pink Floyd were assigned the staff engineer Alan Parsons, who had worked as the assistant tape operator on their fifth album, Atom Heart Mother (1970), and had gained experience as a recording engineer on the Beatles albums Abbey Road and Let It Be. The Dark Side of the Moon sessions made use of advanced studio techniques, as the studio was capable of 16-track mixes which offered greater flexibility than the eight- or four-track mixes Pink Floyd had previously worked with, although the band often used so many tracks that second-generation copies were still needed to make more space available on the tape. The mix supervisor Chris Thomas recalled later, \"There were only two or three tracks of drums when we came to mixing it. Depending on the song, there would be one or two tracks of guitar, and these would include the solo and the rhythm guitar parts. One track for keyboard, one track for bass, and one or two sound effects tracks. They had been very, very efficient in the way they'd worked.\"The first track recorded was \"Us and Them\" on 31 May, followed seven days later by \"Money\". For \"Money\", Waters had created effects loops in an unusual 74 time signature from recordings of money-related objects, including coins thrown into a mixing bowl in his wife's pottery studio. These were re-recorded to take advantage of the band's decision to create a quadraphonic mix of the album, although Parsons later expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, which he attributed to a lack of time and a shortage of multitrack tape recorders.\"Time\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" were recorded next, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for a tour of the United States. The recording sessions were frequently interrupted: Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus on television while Parsons worked on the tracks. Gilmour recalled, \"...but when we were on a roll, we would get on.\"\nAfter returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded \"Brain Damage\", \"Eclipse\", \"Any Colour You Like\" and \"On the Run\", and fine-tuned work from previous sessions. Four female vocalists were assembled to sing on \"Brain Damage\", \"Eclipse\" and \"Time\", and the saxophonist Dick Parry was booked to play on \"Us and Them\" and \"Money\". With the director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii. The album was completed and signed off at Abbey Road on 9 February 1973."

        "content": "The album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism, as they were employed by the band. For The Dark Side of the Moon, Wright suggested something \"smarter, neater \u2013  more classy\", and simple, \"like the artwork of a Black Magic chocolate box\".The design was inspired by a photograph of a prism with a beam of white light projected through it and emerging in the colours of the visible spectrum that Thorgerson had found in a 1963 physics textbook, as well as by an illustration by Alex Steinweiss, the inventor of album cover art, for the New York Philharmonic's 1942 performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. The artwork was created by an associate of Hipgnosis, George Hardie. Hipgnosis offered a choice of seven designs for the sleeve, but all four members of the band agreed that the prism was the best. \"There were no arguments,\" said Roger Waters. \"We all pointed to the prism and said 'That's the one'.\"The design depicts a glass prism dispersing white light into colours and represents three elements: the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design. At Waters' suggestion, the spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold. Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, to make possible interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colours, missing indigo, compared with the usual division of the visible spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.  Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers. One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photograph of the Great Pyramids of Giza, created by Powell and Thorgerson.The band were so confident of the quality of Waters' lyrics that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve."

The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the band, and the stereo mix of the album was played over a poor-quality public address system. Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; Melody Maker's Roy Hollingworth described Side One as \"so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow\", but praised Side Two, writing: \"The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night.\" Steve Peacock of Sounds wrote: \"I don't care if you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd unreservedly recommend everyone to The Dark Side of the Moon\". In his 1973 review for Rolling Stone magazine, Loyd Grossman declared Dark Side \"a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement\". In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clich\u00e9d and its music pretentious, but called it a \"kitsch masterpiece\" that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry's saxophone, and studio effects which enhance Gilmour's guitar solos.The Dark Side of the Moon was released first in the US on 1 March 1973, and then in the UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US. Throughout March 1973 the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart's number one spot on 28 April 1973, and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour."

Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: \"I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it.

It is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes made with Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, including a premise explored by Ben Schleifer in 'Speak to Me': The Legacy of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (2006) that the two albums share a theme that \"the creative individual loses the ability to function in the [modern] world\".In a 2018 book about classic rock, Steven Hyden recalls concluding, in his teens, that The Dark Side of the Moon and Led Zeppelin IV were the two greatest albums of the genre, vision quests \"encompass[ing] the twin poles of teenage desire\". They had similarities, in that both albums' cover and internal artwork eschew pictures of the bands in favour of \"inscrutable iconography without any tangible meaning (which always seemed to give the music packaged inside more meaning)\". But whereas Led Zeppelin had looked outward, toward \"conquering the world\" and were known at the time for their outrageous sexual antics on tour, Pink Floyd looked inward, toward \"overcoming your own hang-ups\". In 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

Winifred's strict, ambitious husband George returns home from his job at the bank (\"The Life I Lead\"). Constable Jones brings the children home and reveals they were chasing after a lost kite. The children ask George to help them make a better kite, but he dismisses them. George puts an advertisement in the newspaper for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. In contrast, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kind, sympathetic nanny (\"The Perfect Nanny\"). Winifred strongly agrees with the children. However, George rips up the letter and throws the scraps in the fireplace, but a strong wind draws the scraps up through the chimney and into the sky.\nThe next day, several sour-faced nannies wait outside the Banks family's home, but a strong gust of wind blows them away. Jane and Michael then witness a young woman using an umbrella as a parachute to gracefully descend from the sky. The woman goes to the Banks family's home and introduces herself as Mary Poppins. To George's shock, Mary is holding the children's advertisement, and the scraps have been put back together. Mary agrees with the advertisement's requests but promises George that she will be firm with his children. Mary hires herself and convinces George it was originally his idea. Mary helps the children magically tidy their nursery (\"A Spoonful of Sugar\").\nWhile walking outside, the trio encounters Mary's friend Bert, a jack of all trades working as a street painter; Mary transports the group into one of Bert's drawings. While the children ride on a carousel, Mary and Bert sing while strolling (\"Jolly Holiday\"), and Bert flirts with Mary. Mary then enchants the carousel horses to move on their own. Bert rescues a fox from a fox hunt. Bert and Mary take part in a horse race, which Mary wins. Describing her victory, Mary uses a nonsense word (\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\"). When a thunderstorm dissolves Bert's drawings, the group is returned to London. While putting the children to bed, Mary calmly sings a lullaby (\"Stay Awake\").\nThe next day, the trio and Bert meet Mary's odd Uncle Albert, whose uncontrollable laughter has caused him to float (\"I Love to Laugh\"). When Albert and Bert begin discussing a sad topic, Mary leaves with Jane and Michael. George becomes annoyed by the household's cheery atmosphere and threatens to fire Mary. She persuades him to take the children to his workplace. That evening, Mary sings a lullaby  about a woman who sells bird food on the steps of the St. Paul's Cathedral (\"Feed the Birds\"). The next day at the bank, the children meet George's boss, the elderly Mr. Dawes Sr., who advises Michael to invest his tuppence in the bank, ultimately snatching his coin out of Michael's hand(\"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\"). Michael demands it back; other customers overhear the conflict, and they all begin demanding their own money back, causing a bank run.\nJane and Michael flee the bank and get lost in the East End of London. Bert, now working as a chimney sweep, escorts them home (\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\"). The three and Mary venture onto the rooftops, where they dance with other chimney sweeps (\"Step in Time\"). George and Winifred return home to find Bert's friends dancing in their home; George sends them away. George then receives a phone call from the bank, requesting a meeting with him regarding Michael's actions. The children overhear the phone call and become concerned. Bert takes George to task for his neglect of his children, warning him to spend more time with Jane and Michael before they grow up (\"A Man Has Dreams\"). Michael gives George the tuppence, hoping to make amends. Besieged with regret George slowly walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating cashiering. Lost for words, he exclaims \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\" tells a joke Uncle Albert had told the children, and happily heads home. When Mr. Dawes Sr. understands the joke, he floats up into the air, laughing.\nThe next day, Mary Poppins tells the children she must leave. George mends his children's kite and takes the family out to fly it. At the park, the family encounters Mr. Dawes Sr.'s son, Mr. Dawes Jr., who reveals that his father died laughing at the joke (\"Let's Go Fly a Kite\"). Mr. Dawes Jr. says his father had never been happier and gratefully re-employs George as a junior partner. Mary watches the family and decides her work is done. As Mary flies away, Bert looks up and says, \"Goodbye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.\""

Based on the 1812 German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, it is the first animated feature film produced in the United States and the first cel animated feature film. The production was supervised by David Hand, and the film's sequences were directed by Perce Pearce, William Cottrell, Larry Morey, Wilfred Jackson, and Ben Sharpsteen.\nSnow White premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on December 21, 1937. Despite initial doubts from the film industry, it was a critical and commercial success, with international earnings of more than $8 million during its initial release against a $1.5 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1937, and briefly held the record of highest-grossing sound film. It was also the highest-grossing animated film for 55 years. The popularity of the film has led to its being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the top-ten performers at the North American box office and is still the highest-grossing animated film. Worldwide, its inflation-adjusted earnings top the animation list.Snow White was nominated for Best Musical Score at the Academy Awards in 1938, and the next year, producer Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar for the film. This award was unique, consisting of one normal-sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes. They were presented to Disney by Shirley Temple.In 1989, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the National Film Registry. The American Film Institute ranked it among the 100 greatest American films, and also named the film as the greatest American animated film of all time in 2008. Disney's take on the fairy tale has had a significant cultural effect, resulting in popular theme park attractions, a video game, a Broadway musical, and an upcoming live-action film."

Fearing that Snow White's beauty will outshine her own, the Queen forces her to work as a scullery maid and asks her Magic Mirror daily \"who is the fairest one of all.\" For years, the mirror always answers that the Queen is, pleasing her.\nOne day, Snow White meets and falls in love with a prince who overhears her singing. On that same day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now the fairest in all of the land. Angered, the Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest, kill her, and bring back her heart in a jeweled box as proof. The Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White and reveals to her the Queen's plot. He then urges her to flee into the woods and never return.\nLost and frightened, Snow White is befriended by woodland animals who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children. With the animals' help, she proceeds to clean the place and cook a meal. Snow White soon learns that the cottage is the home of seven dwarfs named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean, and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. Snow White introduces herself, and the dwarfs welcome her after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day; and at night, they all sing, play music, and dance.\nBack at the castle, the Magic Mirror reveals that Snow White is still living, and with the dwarfs. Enraged that the Huntsman tricked her, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into a death-like sleep. She learns the curse can be broken by \"love's first kiss,\" but is certain Snow White will be buried alive before this can happen. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away. The animals see through the disguise, but are unable to warn Snow White; they rush off to find the dwarfs. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the apple, and she falls into a death-like slumber.\nThe dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage, and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder onto them, but lightning strikes the cliff before she can do so, causing her to fall and get crushed to death by the boulder. In their cottage, the dwarfs find Snow White asleep by the poison. Unwilling to bury her in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin in the forest. Together with the animals, they keep watch over her.\nThe following spring, the prince learns of Snow White's eternal sleep and visits the coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the prince takes Snow White to his castle."

Written by the Andersons and directed by David Lane, Thunderbirds Are Go concerns spacecraft Zero-X and its human mission to Mars. When Zero-X suffers a malfunction during re-entry, it is up to life-saving organisation International Rescue, supported by its technologically-advanced Thunderbird machines, to activate the trapped crew's escape pod before the spacecraft hits the ground.\nFilmed between March and June 1966 at Century 21's studios on the Slough Trading Estate and on location in Portugal, Thunderbirds Are Go features guest appearances by puppet versions of Cliff Richard and The Shadows, who also contributed to the film's score. It was the first film to be shot using an early form of video assist called \"Add-a-Vision\". The film's special effects sequences, directed by Derek Meddings, took six months to complete.\nAlthough early reviews praised the film as a successful cinematic transfer of the TV series, Thunderbirds Are Go drew a lukewarm public response and proved to be a box office failure. Later reviews would criticise the film for its minimal characterisation, lengthy effects shots, and inclusion of a fantasy dream sequence centring on Richard and The Shadows. Surprised by the film's underperformance, and confident that Thunderbirds still had cinematic potential, distributors United Artists ordered a sequel, Thunderbird 6. However, this too received a mediocre critical and commercial response and caused the franchise to be abandoned until the early 2000s. Zero-X later appeared in the first episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, the Andersons' follow-up to Thunderbirds, while tie-in publication TV Century 21 ran a Zero-X comic strip until 1969."

Unknown to Captain Travers and his four-man crew, master criminal the Hood has stowed away on board to photograph Zero-X's wing mechanism. Shortly after lift-off, the Hood inadvertently traps his foot in the craft's hydraulics, jamming them and causing Zero-X to go out of control. As the astronauts eject in the escape pod, the Hood extracts his crushed foot and parachutes to safety from the undercarriage. Zero-X crashes into the ocean and explodes.\nIn 2067, the Inquiry Board of the Space Exploration Center concludes that Zero-X was sabotaged. Meanwhile, a second Zero-X has been built and another mission to Mars planned. International Rescue agrees to provide security at the launch given the possibility of further sabotage. Jeff Tracy dispatches Scott to Glenn Field in Thunderbird 1 to monitor the situation from the ground, while Virgil and Alan are assigned to escort Zero-X through the atmosphere in Thunderbirds 2 and 3. Posing as a reporter at the pre-launch press conference, Lady Penelope arranges for each member of the crew to wear a St Christopher brooch with a concealed homing device. On launch day, Dr Grant's device is no longer registering, even though Grant is on board Zero-X awaiting lift-off. Scott unmasks \"Grant\" as the Hood in disguise. The Hood flees Glenn Field in a car, pursued by Penelope and Parker in FAB 1. Reaching the coast, he transfers to a speedboat and then a helicopter. Parker shoots down the helicopter with FAB 1's machine gun. Meanwhile, the kidnapped Grant is found and returned to Zero-X and the spacecraft is launched without further incident.\nMission complete, Penelope invites Scott and Virgil to join her at popular nightclub The Swinging Star. Returning to Tracy Island, Alan feels unappreciated when Jeff insists that he stay at base while the others spend the night partying. Asleep in bed, Alan has a surreal dream in which he and Penelope travel to another Swinging Star located in space. Appearing at the nightclub are Cliff Richard Jr and the Shadows, who perform a song called \"Shooting Star\" and an instrumental called \"Lady Penelope\". The dream ends when Alan falls out of The Swinging Star and back to Earth, waking to discover that he has merely fallen out of bed.\nAfter a six-week flight, Zero-X reaches Mars on 22 July and all of the astronauts except Space Navigator Newman touch down on the planet in their lander, the Martian Excursion Vehicle (MEV). Investigating the surface, the men are puzzled to find strange, coil-like rock formations. Space Captain Martin destroys one of the structures with the MEV's gun and Dr Pierce prepares to go outside to collect samples. The other structures come to life, revealing themselves to be one-eyed rock snakes. The aliens bombard the MEV with fireballs from their mouths, forcing the astronauts to take off prematurely. Docking with Newman in orbit, they start back to Earth.\nAs Zero-X re-enters Earth's atmosphere on 2 September, lifting body no 2 fails to connect with the spacecraft due to a radio control fault, and damages various systems, including flight control and the escape pod circuit. With the astronauts unable to eject and Zero-X set to impact on Craigsville, Florida (pop 4,800), Jeff launches Scott and Brains in Thunderbird 1 and Virgil, Alan and Gordon in Thunderbird 2. Craigsville is evacuated. Lifted into Zero-X's undercarriage, Alan repairs the escape circuit under Brains' guidance. Seconds before impact, Alan completes his task and jumps out as the astronauts eject. The empty Zero-X crashes into Craigsville. Picked up by Penelope and Parker in FAB1, Alan is driven to the real Swinging Star where Penelope, joined by the Tracy family, Brains and Tin-Tin, toast Alan as a hero."

With United Artists contracted to distribute, a budget of \u00a3250,000 (about \u00a35.15 million in 2021) was set and Anderson and his wife, Sylvia, began work on the script at their second home in Portugal.The couple decided to base the film on the American-Soviet \"Space Race\" \u2013 in particular the race to land astronauts on the Moon \u2013 but adapt this premise for the futuristic world of Thunderbirds by switching the location to Mars. During the pre-production of their next puppet series, Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, they would write in a second appearance of the Zero-X as a link to Thunderbirds. Like Thunderbirds Are Go, Captain Scarlet depicts hostile life on Mars, though the Mysterons of the TV series pose a greater threat than the \"Rock Snakes\" of the film in that they strike at Earth itself. The rescue of Zero-X is similar to that of Fireflash in the Thunderbirds episode \"Operation Crash-Dive\".Frustrated with the limitations of the puppets and concerned that the TV series would not transfer well to the big screen, Alan Pattillo declined to direct the film. The role was instead given to 24-year-old David Lane, who had directed several of the TV episodes. This made Lane the UK's youngest film director at the time.The dream sequence set at The Swinging Star was spearheaded by Sylvia, who expanded it by scripting a musical interlude performed by puppet versions of Cliff Richard and The Shadows. Richard and Shadows band member Bruce Welch both owned homes in Portugal near the Andersons, and it was there that the two agreed to \"appear\" in the film as Supermarionation puppets. Having also agreed to contribute to the film's score, Richard and The Shadows recorded a song titled \"Shooting Star\" and an instrumental titled \"Lady Penelope\". Sylvia acknowledged that the dream sequence does not advance the plot, noting in her autobiography that it was \"sheer indulgence that would not have been possible on our television budget.\" Stephen La Rivi\u00e8re, author of Supermarionation: A History of the Future, regards the sequence as the strangest ever created for an Anderson production."

Records as the soundtrack album to the 1984 film of the same name. Purple Rain was musically denser than Prince's previous albums, emphasizing full band performances, and multiple layers of guitars, keyboards, electronic synthesizer effects, drum machines, and other instruments.\nMuch of the album had a grandiose, synthesized, and psychedelic sheen to the production and performances. The music on Purple Rain is generally regarded as the most pop-oriented of Prince's career, though a number of elements point towards the more experimental records Prince would release after Purple Rain. The music video for the album's lead single \"When Doves Cry\" sparked controversy among network executives, who thought its sexual nature was too explicit for television. The risqu\u00e9 lyrics of \"Darling Nikki\" raised complaints from Tipper Gore and the Parents Music Resource Center and contributed to the implementation of Parental Advisory stickers and imprints on album covers.\nPurple Rain became Prince's first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. The album spent 24 consecutive weeks atop on the Billboard 200 and was present on the chart for a total of 167 weeks. \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"Purple Rain\" peaked at number two and \"I Would Die 4 U\" peaked at number eight. In May 1996, the album was certified 13\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is Prince's commercial peak, with total sales standing at 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Prince and the Revolution won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, while Prince also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Purple Rain.\nMusic critics noted the innovative and experimental aspects of the soundtrack's music, most famously on the spare, bass-less \"When Doves Cry\". Other aspects of the music, especially its synthesis of electronic elements with organic instrumentation and full-band performances along with its consolidation of rock and R&B, were identified by critics as distinguishing, even experimental factors. Purple Rain is regularly ranked among the greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone ranked the album number 8 on its 2020 list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry list of sound recordings that are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

        "content": "While Prince's previous albums were primarily solo recordings by Prince, Purple Rain contained the credits \"produced, arranged, composed and performed by Prince and the Revolution\", though he had teased the name two years earlier on 1999, writing \"and the Revolution\" backwards on the album cover. The album was mostly recorded between July 1983 and March 1984, the exception being \"Baby I'm a Star\", composed and demoed in early December  1981. The last three songs on the album (\"I Would Die 4 U\", \"Baby I'm A Star\" and the title track \"Purple Rain\") were recorded live at the 3 August 1983 First Avenue show in Minneapolis, although overdubs and edits took place on all three in September 1983; this marked Prince's first album to include live recordings.Regarding the meaning of \"Purple Rain\", both Mikel Toombs of The San Diego Union and Bob Kostanczuk of the Post-Tribune have written that Prince took the title \"Purple Rain\" from lyrics in the America song \"Ventura Highway\". Asked to explain the phrase \"purple rain\" in \"Ventura Highway\", Gerry Beckley responded: \"You got me.\" However, Prince explained the meaning of \"Purple Rain\" as follows: \"When there's blood in the sky \u2013 red and blue = purple ... purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain.\"\"Purple Rain\" was originally written as a country song and intended to be a collaboration with Stevie Nicks. According to Nicks, she received a 10-minute instrumental version of the song from Prince with a request to write the lyrics, but felt overwhelmed. She said: \"I listened to it and I just got scared. I called him back and said, 'I can't do it. I wish I could. It's too much for me.'\" At a rehearsal, Prince then asked his backing band to try the song: \"I want to try something before we go home. It's mellow.\" According to the Revolution member Lisa Coleman, Prince then changed the song after the Revolution's Wendy Melvoin started playing guitar chords to accompany the song: \"He was excited to hear it voiced differently. It took it out of that country feeling. Then we all started playing it a bit harder and taking it more seriously. We played it for six hours straight and by the end of that day we had it mostly written and arranged.\"\"Take Me with U\" was written for the Apollonia 6 album Apollonia 6 (1984), but later enlisted for Purple Rain. The inclusion of that song necessitated cuts to the suite-like \"Computer Blue\", the full version of which did not earn an official release, although a portion of the second section can be heard in the film of the same name, in a sequence where Prince walks in on the men of the Revolution rehearsing. The risqu\u00e9 lyrics of \"Darling Nikki\" contributed to the use of Parental Advisory stickers and imprints on album covers that were the record label's answer to complaints from Tipper Gore and the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC).Prince wrote and composed the album's lead single \"When Doves Cry\" after all the other tracks were complete on Purple Rain. In addition to providing vocals, he played all instruments on the track. With there being no bass line, the song's production is noted for being unconventionally bare in comparison to 1980s pop hits. Prince said there originally was a bass line but, after a conversation with singer Jill Jones, he decided the song was too conventional with it included."

        "content": "Like Prince's previous albums, nearly all tracks on Purple Rain were written by him. Purple Rain was musically denser than Prince's previous albums, emphasizing full band performances, and multiple layers of guitars, keyboards, electronic synthesizer effects, drum machines, and other instruments. As a soundtrack record, much of the music had a grandiose, synthesized, and even \u2013 by some evaluations \u2013 a psychedelic sheen to the production and performances. The music on Purple Rain is generally regarded as the most pop-oriented of Prince's career, though a number of elements point towards the more experimental records Prince would release after Purple Rain. Apollonia 6 member Apollonia recalled that after watching the Purple Rain cinematographic takes, she told Prince, \"You know you're going to get an Oscar for this movie \u2013 not for the acting, but for the music.\"The Revolution member Doctor Fink told PopMatters in 2009 the recording of the album was \"a very creative time ... There was a lot of influence and input from band members towards what [Prince] was doing. He was always open to anybody trying to contribute creatively to the process of writing ... But Prince was the main lyricist and melody maker for all the songs ... and never took any lyrical content from people.\" Melvoin told Mojo in 1997 the band members were \"absolute musical equals in the sense that Prince respected us, and allowed us to contribute to the music without any interference ... I think the secret to our working relationship was that we were very non-possessive about our ideas, as opposed to some other people that have worked with him.\"Revolution members Fink, Coleman, and Melvoin helped write the album's fourth track \"Computer Blue\". Doctor Fink, who wrote a keyboard bass line for the track, said he \"started playing that main bass groove which later became 'Computer Blue'. So the band [the Revolution] started grooving on it, and Prince started coming up with some stuff, then we recorded a rough version and he took it into the studio and just incorporated it all and made it fly that way. Wendy [Melvoin] and Lisa [Coleman] did some of the stuff on it. Prince borrowed the bridge/portal section from the then-unreleased Father's Song, by his father jazz musician John L. Nelson, who had given him some music over the years to play around with. So the song was a real mixture of different people and influences.\"The full band appears on six tracks: \"Let's Go Crazy\", \"Take Me With U\", \"Computer Blue\", \"I Would Die 4 U\", \"Baby I'm A Star\" and \"Purple Rain\" while the remaining three tracks are essentially solo performances by Prince. Apollonia sings co-lead on \"Take Me With U\". Three of the tracks include a string section arranged by Coleman and Prince which were conducted by Coleman and Melvoin: \"Take Me With U\", \"Baby I'm A Star\", and \"Purple Rain\". The string players are violin and viola player Novi Novog and cellists David Coleman and Suzie Katayama."

        "content": "Purple Rain was well received by contemporary critics. Kurt Loder, writing for Rolling Stone in 1984, compared Prince to Jimi Hendrix and praised him for merging \"black and white styles\": \"The spirit of Jimi Hendrix must surely smile down on Prince Rogers Nelson. Like Hendrix, Prince seems to have tapped into some extraterrestrial musical dimension where black and white styles are merely different aspects of the same funky thing. Prince's rock & roll is as authentic and compelling as his soul and his extremism is endearing in a era of play-it-safe record production and formulaic hit mongering.\"At the end of 1984, Purple Rain was voted the second best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice. However, the newspaper's chief critic and poll creator Robert Christgau was less impressed by the album, saying that while it is \"quirky, dangerous, [and] unabashedly pop\", it is also plagued by \"despair\" and, \"for Prince ... ingratiatingly unsolipsistic\", although he would later call it \"seriously gorgeous\".Prince and the Revolution won a 1984 Grammy Award for Purple Rain, for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, the four composers (Nelson, Coleman, Prince, and Melvoin) won Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, and the album was nominated for Album of the Year. Prince won a third Grammy that year for Best R&B Song for Chaka Khan's cover of \"I Feel for You\". Purple Rain also won an Oscar for Best Original Song Score in 1985. Purple Rain posthumously won Top Soundtrack at the American Music Awards in 2016.Retrospective appraisals have also been positive. Music critics noted the innovative and experimental aspects of the soundtrack's music, most famously on the spare, bass-less \"When Doves Cry\". Other aspects of the music, especially its synthesis of electronic elements with organic instrumentation and full-band performances (some, as noted above, recorded live) along with its landmark consolidation of rock and R&B, were identified by critics as distinguishing, even experimental factors.Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that Purple Rain finds Prince \"consolidating his funk and R&B roots while moving boldly into pop, rock, and heavy metal\", as well as \"push[ing] heavily into psychedelia\" under the influence of the Revolution. Erlewine identifies the record's nine songs as \"uncompromising ... forays into pop\" and \"stylistic experiments\", echoing general sentiment that Purple Rain's music represented Prince at his most popular without forsaking his experimental bent. In a retrospective review, Kenneth Partridge, writing for Billboard, described the album's opening track, \"Let's Go Crazy\", as \"arguably the best intro in pop history\"."

In 2019, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".Jon Bon Jovi, lead singer of the rock band Bon Jovi, observed that \"There's every emotion [in Purple Rain] from the ballad to the rocker\" and \"All the influences were evident, from Hendrix to Chic.\" Lionel Richie praised Prince for making a \"very important step\" in advancing the concept from creating music videos for songs to making a motion picture for an album. Partridge of Billboard emphasized Prince's popularity during the Purple Rain era, writing,\nIn 1984, there was only one man in America more popular than President Ronald Reagan. His name was Prince, and he was funky. Had Prince run for president that year, he would have certainly carried his native Minnesota \u2013 the only state Ronnie lost \u2013 and he probably would've cleaned up most other places. The reason: Purple Rain, his groundbreaking, genre-blurring, utterly genius sixth album. It was a massive seller wherever there were radios and people with pulses.\nDescribed as a \"masterpiece\" by the Grammy Awards, Ana Yglesias wrote, \"Even after his heartbreaking passing, Prince will live on forever in our hearts, through his music, and even on the charts. Purple Rain was inducted into Grammy Hall of Fame in 2011, celebrating it as a 'recording of lasting qualitative or historical significance'. ... It is safe to say there will never be another star quite like Prince.\"For The New Yorker, Ben Greenmane wrote, \"Purple Rain may or may not be Prince's best record, but it came at the best time, propelling him from ordinary stardom (his previous album 1999 put three singles into the Billboard top 20) to supernova status. It created his iconic look (ruffled shirt, purple jacket, motorcycle), formally introduced his most famous backing band (the Revolution), and included the lion's share of the songs most likely to appear in a capsule bio ('When Doves Cry', 'Let's Go Crazy', and the title track).\" In Rolling Stone's list of The 25 Greatest Soundtracks of All Time, Purple Rain was described as \"an epic celebration of everything rock & roll, which means sex and religion and eyeliner and motorcycles and guitars and Lake Minnetonka\".Chris Gerard wrote for PopMatters that \"Purple Rain is one of the cornerstone albums not just of the 80s, but in all of pop/rock history ... at the core of [Prince's] legacy Purple Rain will always stand as his signature triumph, a monument to his boundless talent and ambition.\" Gerard also praised \"When Doves Cry\" for being the \"gateway\" to the \"Purple Rain universe: an album, a major motion picture, and a tour that dominated the pop culture landscape of 1984\".\nAndrew Unterberger of Billboard gave the album high appraisal, regarding it as one of the greatest albums in popular music: \"Purple Rain is certainly in contention for the most perfect album in rock or pop history, expertly flowing from track to track while delighting, surprising and astounding at each bend. Personal and universal, familiar and challenging, romantic and narcissistic, religious and orgasmic, accessible to all and profoundly weird, Purple Rain rightly remains the cornerstone of Prince's recorded legacy, almost too obvious in its brilliance to even be worth discussing at length.\"Writing for Pitchfork, Carvell Wallace appraised the album's impact and Prince's musicianship, \"With Purple Rain, Prince bursts forth from the ghetto created by mainstream radio and launches himself directly onto the Mt. Rushmore of American music. He plays rock better than rock musicians, composes better than jazz guys, and performs better than everyone, all without ever abandoning his roots as a funk man, a party leader, a true MC ... for the 24 weeks Purple Rain spent atop the charts in 1984, the black kid from the midwest had managed to become the most accurate expression we had of young America's overabundance of angst, love, horniness, recklessness, idealism, and hope.\""

Recording resumed on April 18, 1968, at the newly opened Record Plant Studios in New York City, with Chas Chandler as producer and engineers Eddie Kramer and Gary Kellgren.Hendrix was famous for his studio perfectionism; he and drummer Mitch Mitchell recorded over 50 takes of \"Gypsy Eyes\" over three sessions. Hendrix was insecure about his voice and often recorded his vocals hidden behind studio screens. He sang backing vocals himself on the title track and on \"Long Hot Summer Night\". As recording progressed, Chandler became frustrated with Hendrix's perfectionism and his demands for repeated takes.Hendrix allowed friends and guests to join them in the studio, which contributed to a chaotic and crowded environment in the control room and led Chandler to sever his professional relationship with Hendrix. Bassist Noel Redding recalled: \"There were tons of people in the studio; you couldn't move. It was a party, not a session.\"Redding, who had formed his own band in mid-1968, Fat Mattress, found it increasingly difficult to fulfill his commitments with the Experience, so Hendrix played many of the bass parts. The album's cover states that it was \"produced and directed by Jimi Hendrix\", which disturbed Chandler since he produced some of the songs.  The double LP was the only Experience album mixed entirely in stereo.Hendrix experimented with other combinations of musicians, including Jefferson Airplane's Jack Casady and Traffic's Steve Winwood, who played bass and organ, respectively, on the 15-minute slow-blues jam \"Voodoo Chile\". In March 1968, he was joined onstage at the Scene Club in New York by Jim Morrison of the Doors and in early April, Hendrix appeared at an impromptu jam with B.B. King, Al Kooper, and Elvin Bishop."

During its recording, Kramer experimented with innovative studio techniques such as backmasking, chorus effect, echo, and flanging, which AllMusic's Cub Koda said recontextualized Hendrix's psychedelic and funk sounds on the album.Electric Ladyland is a cross-section of Hendrix's wide range of musical talent. It includes examples of several genres and styles of music: the psychedelic \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\", a UK single the previous summer (1967), the extended blues jam \"Voodoo Chile\", the New Orleans-style R&B of Earl King's \"Come On\", the epic studio production of \"1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)\", the social commentary of \"House Burning Down\", and the Sixties-era Britpop of Noel Redding's \"Little Miss Strange\". The album also features an electric reworking of the Bob Dylan classic \"All Along the Watchtower\", which has been well-received by critics as well as by Dylan himself, and also \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\", a staple of both radio and guitar repertoire. Rolling Stone's Holly George-Warren praised \"Crosstown Traffic\" for its hard rock guitar riff.\"All Along the Watchtower\" became the band's top-selling single and their only US top 40 hit, peaking at number 20; it reached number five in the UK.

Melody Maker called it \"mixed-up and muddled\", with the exception of \"All Along the Watchtower\", which the magazine called a masterpiece. Reviewing for Rolling Stone in 1968, Tony Glover said Hendrix's original songs sometimes sound unstructured and was somewhat disappointed by the \"heavy handed guitar\" on \"1983...

Ultimately, Glover appreciated the \"energy flow\" unifying the songs and described Hendrix as \"amazing\", adding that Electric Ladyland serves as \"an extended look into Hendrix's head, and mostly it seems to have some pretty good things in it (who among us is totally free of mental garbage?)\". Robert Christgau was more enthusiastic in Stereo Review, regarding it as an explosive showcase of rock's \"most important recent innovation\"\u2014the \"heavy\" guitar aesthetic\u2014and \"an integrated work-in-itself in more ways than one\".

        "content": "Thunderbird 6 is a 1968 British science fiction puppet film based on Thunderbirds, a Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company Century 21 Productions. Written by the Andersons and directed by David Lane, it is the sequel to Thunderbirds Are Go (1966).\nThe film is largely set on Skyship One \u2013 a futuristic airship designed by Brains, the inventor of International Rescue's Thunderbird machines. The plot sees Alan Tracy, Tin-Tin Kyrano, Lady Penelope and Parker representing International Rescue as guests of honour on Skyship One's round-the-world maiden flight, unaware that master criminal The Hood is once again plotting to acquire the organisation's technological secrets. The Hood's agents murder the airship's crew and assume their identities to lure International Rescue into a trap. Meanwhile, Brains' efforts to design a proposed sixth Thunderbird collide with fate when Skyship One is damaged and its occupants' only salvation seems to be Alan's old Tiger Moth biplane.\nActors John Carson and Geoffrey Keen provided guest voices, with additions to the regular voice cast in the form of Keith Alexander and Gary Files. The puppet design compromised between the caricatures that Century 21 had used up until Thunderbirds Are Go and the realistically proportioned marionettes that were introduced in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. The film was shot between May and December 1967. Some of the sequences showing the Tiger Moth in flight were shot on location using a full-sized plane, but a legal dispute with the Ministry of Transport over alleged dangerous flying forced the crew to film the remaining shots in-studio with scale models.\nThunderbird 6 was released in July 1968 to a mediocre box office response that ruled out the production of further sequels. Critical response has remained mixed: while the special effects have been praised, the story polarised commentators."

        "content": "In 2068, the New World Aircraft Corporation in England gives Brains an open brief to design a revolutionary aircraft. Brains suggests an airship, prompting howls of laughter from the executives. Nevertheless, his proposal is accepted and the corporation builds Skyship One, a fully automated airship powered by an anti-gravity field. Representing International Rescue for the maiden flight \u2013 a private round-the-world trip with pre-programmed stops \u2013 are Alan Tracy, Tin-Tin, Lady Penelope and Parker. Brains, meanwhile, is forced to remain on Tracy Island after Jeff asks him to design a sixth Thunderbird craft. Working without a specification, Brains produces a range of concepts but all are rejected by Jeff.\nAlan and Tin-Tin fly to England in an old Tiger Moth biplane and join Penelope and Parker before Skyship One departs. However, the group are unaware that Captain Foster and the stewards have been murdered and replaced by agents of The Hood, now operating as \"Black Phantom\" from an abandoned airfield near Casablanca. As the ship is automated, the impostors are not required to demonstrate any detailed knowledge of its systems and are thus able to avoid raising their guests' suspicions as the trip progresses.\nAfter Skyship One leaves the Egyptian pyramids, Penelope finds a bugging device in her bedroom. Unknown to her, Foster and his men have been recording and editing her voice to assemble a fake radio message asking Jeff to send Thunderbirds 1 and 2 to the abandoned airfield, where The Hood and his men intend to hi-jack the craft. During a stop in the Swiss Alps, Parker discovers the editing equipment, but before the group can act the message is completed and transmitted to Tracy Island via John on  Thunderbird 5. Jeff immediately dispatches Scott and Virgil in Thunderbirds 1 and 2, but Alan realises that his brothers are flying into a trap and Penelope is able to forward the warning just in time. On landing at the airfield, Scott and Virgil use the Thunderbirds' rocket launchers to destroy The Hood's base. They then take off to rendezvous with Skyship One.\nAboard the airship, Alan, Penelope and Parker engage in a shootout with the impostors but are forced to surrender when Tin-Tin is taken hostage. The anti-gravity system is damaged in the fighting, causing the ship to lose altitude and crash into a radio mast at a missile base near Dover. With Skyship One balanced precariously on top of the mast and its anti-gravity field weakening, it is up to Scott, Virgil and Brains to rescue all aboard before the ship collapses onto the base below. However, Scott and Virgil are unable close in without their thrusters tipping it over and none of Thunderbird 2's Pod Vehicles is light enough to deploy onto it. At Gordon's suggestion, Brains flies the Tiger Moth up to Skyship One's top deck to airlift the passengers and crew to safety one by one. However, on landing, he is held at gunpoint by Foster and his two surviving henchmen. With Penelope hostage in the plane's cockpit, Foster tries to take off but is shot dead by Alan. The Tiger Moth launches with the International Rescue agents and impostors clinging on to the wings and landing gear. Shortly after, Skyship One crashes to the ground, starting a chain reaction that obliterates the missile base.The remaining impostors are killed in a shootout aboard the Tiger Moth. Stray bullets puncture the fuel tank, forcing Penelope to make an emergency landing. After near misses with a factory chimney, a bridge on the M104 motorway and a tree, Penelope ditches the plane into a field. Parker is thrown out when the plane clips the tree top and ends up dangling upside down in its branches before falling to the ground.\nBack on Tracy Island, Brains unveils the new Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its worth in the field."

Filmed on a budget of \u00a3300,000 (approximately \u00a35.79 million in 2021), Thunderbird 6's principal production credits were unchanged from the first film, with Gerry and Sylvia Anderson returning as writers and producers and David Lane reprising his role of director.The Andersons wrote the script in three months, originally intending the film to be about a \"Russo-American space project\". The focus was changed to an ill-fated airship when the Andersons' colleague Desmond Saunders suggested they base the film on the destruction of the R101. In preparation, Gerry read books on the R101 and other airships, including the R100 and the Graf Zeppelin. The plot was intended to be more light-hearted than that of the first film, which focused on the Mars-bound spacecraft Zero-X. Presenting a de Havilland Tiger Moth as the eponymous Thunderbird 6, the script alluded to advertising for Esso: during the Skyship One rescue, a line of dialogue from Virgil Tracy playfully adapts the oil company's slogan \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\" to refer to the \"Tiger\" in Thunderbird 2's pod. However, the model of the plane is never named in full.Principal photography began on 1 May 1967 and was completed in four months."

Commenting on the lengthy gap between certification and release, Chris Bentley suggests that with the failure of the previous film and the cancellation of the TV series, United Artists had lost faith in the Thunderbirds brand and intentionally postponed the sequel.

Clay was offered the job solely because he once met a nephew of the King. Clay is haunted by a previous job in which outsourced production led to several hundred layoffs and, in the long run, financial ruin. He is also depressed because of a messy and costly divorce which leaves him unable to financially support his daughter Kitty.\nOversleeping on the first day due to jet lag, he misses the shuttle bus to his sales presentation and rents a car. The driver, Yousef, tells him that he is in contact with a woman whose wealthy and jealous husband has led him to fear for his life. After arriving, Clay is informed that neither the King nor his direct contact, Karim Al-Ahmed, are there. Clay's team is placed in a tent outside the office building lacking food or workable internet access.\nOver the following few days Clay repeatedly oversleeps and calls Yousef to drive him to the development, both becoming closer during the long drives. At the development, he is repeatedly put off and confined to the tent. One day, he slips inside the building and meets Danish executive Hanne. She is sympathetic to his plight but cannot help him get contact the King or Karim Al-Ahmed. She offers him alcohol disguised as olive oil, which Clay has missed since arriving in Saudi Arabia.\nIn the evening, Clay gets drunk and tries to cut open a lump on his back. Waking the next day, covered with blood from the cut, he goes to a hospital, where he meets his doctor, Zahra, resulting in an immediate connection. She performs a biopsy and asks him to return in a few days. After more days without progress, Clay is invited by Hanne to a party at the Danish consulate, where she unsuccessfully tries to seduce him. The next day, after the tent's air conditioning breaks down, Clay becomes upset. He again slips into the office building and finally meets Karim Al-Ahmed. Clay tells Karim about all his grievances. Karim assures him that he will take care of the problems but cannot give him a date for the presentation.\nShortly after, Clay has a panic attack in the hotel and, mistaking it for a stroke, calls Zahra and Yousef. Yousef, arriving shortly after Zahra, notices how close they are and, after she leaves, chastises Alan for endangering her by making advances to her, something Clay vehemently denies. Yousef confesses that the jealous husband has threatened him. He flees to his home town over the weekend to let things cool down, and Clay accompanies him.\nAfter returning, Clay learns his lump contains precancerous cells and should be removed the next day. When returning to the development, Clay notices the technical problems have been resolved, and he gives the King his presentation. However, Clay sees the officials talking with a Chinese company who can offer a better product at a cheaper rate. It is implied the government had always planned to make a deal with the Chinese and knowingly wasted Clay's time. Afterwards, Clay again rejects Hanne's advances.\nThe next day, the operation begins with an unknown doctor but, at the last moment, Zahra takes over, to Clay's delight. After the procedure, Clay and Zahra exchange increasingly personal and intimate e-mails, which culminate in a secret meeting. They talk about their families, and Zahra explains she has children and is going through a messy divorce. They are driven to Zahra's beach house, where they go swimming and have sex. Clay writes to Kit, telling her that the deal was unsuccessful, but he has taken a well-paid job in Saudi Arabia, and he has found a new positive force in his life."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 13 reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman commented that the album \"reflects the versatility Hilson demonstrated prior to its release. It's a songwriting showcase as much as it is a coming out for a full-blown artist, yet more about what Hilson can do than who Hilson is\". Entertainment Weekly's Margeaux Watson called it \"a seductive debut CD full of slick, radio-friendly cuts\". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone found its songs \"uniformly excellent. Hilson's halfway there \u2014 she just needs a lil' more personality\". Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters shared a similar sentiment, perceiving Hilson's songwriting as impersonal, and wrote \"As a whole, the album suffers from an overriding sense of sameness, of mood as well as in relation to the current R&B landscape. [...] it\u2019s a bit melodramatic in places and maybe a touch too hip for its own good\". Rob Sheffield of Blender wrote that Hilson \"comes across as fresh on her long-delayed debut.\"In a mixed review, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani called it \"merely passable\", and Q observed \"too much flab\" at \"70 minutes\" and criticized that \"the ballads drag horribly.\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found Hilson \"often inventive, approaching the beat from odd angles and picking unexpected moments for rhyme\", but felt that too much of the production is cluttered and \"ornate\", writing that it \"favors texture and rhythm over melody or feeling.\" Barry Walters of Spin wrote that Hilson's \"fresh attitude eventually gets lost in a slew of downtrodden ballads that sink the album's second half.\" Vibe found it only \"satisfactory\" and \"simply okay, not quite the sum of its parts. She has the right juice. Now it\u2019s just a matter of how to keep it flowing.\" Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau named \"Intro\", \"Return the Favor\", and \"Turnin Me On\" as highlights on an otherwise unimpressive album.In a Perfect World... earned Hilson two 2010 Grammy Award nominations, in the category of Best New Artist and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (for \"Knock You Down\")."

Spike Stent was involved in mixing tracks for the album which Ciara recorded at Chalice Studios.Ciara stated in 2008 that she wanted her third album \"to take fans on a musical journey\". Billboard magazine initially reported that the album would be released across three discs, each representing a different theme and featuring stylistically similar songs. Danja executively produced the Crunktown and Kingdom of Dance cuts while the Groove City offerings were overseen by Tricky Stewart and Jasper Cameron. The Groove City recordings were intended to remind fans of the Evolution era. The first single \"Never Ever\" (featuring Young Jeezy) falls under this theme and is similar to previous single \"Promise\". Crunktown tracks are remincent of single \"Goodies\" and the trademark genre that Ciara is associated with. \"High Price\" (featuring Ludacris) was the original lead single and an example of what Ciara had created under the crunk theme. The final recordings where up-tempo pop-tinged, house, and freestyle cuts under the theme Kingdom of Dance which can be heard on the album's second single \"Love Sex Magic\" (featuring Justin Timberlake). However, during an interview the editor of Vibe in April, magazine Ciara confirmed that along with changing management she had dropped the three disc idea. The editor previewed six of the songs recorded for the album."

        "content": "On Metacritic, Fantasy Ride received a score of 60 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". BBC Music states: \"When listing great pop stars of the 2000s, it's more than likely that Ciara will be unfairly forgotten. It's just as exciting to hear the slow jams as the club tracks, thanks to the detailed and often strange sounding backing tracks. She uses her silky vocals on softer tracks such as the Ne-Yo produced \"I Don't Remember\" or the delicate \"Never Ever\" to great effect. Only \"Like a Surgeon\" with its somewhat bizarre sex/hospital metaphors may leave you at a loss for words. Overall it is a record that manages to make you dance as much as retreat to the bedroom, Fantasy Ride is an album which could take Ciara to the much deserved next level. Slant Magazine also gave the album a positive review ending the review by calling the album \"Ciara's smoothest ride ever\".\nThe Guardian said \"despite the usual collaborators, it is Ciara's presence that is stamped firmly on the album. Evidence that she is an under-rated balladeer comes in the form of \"Keep Dancin' on Me\", a shimmering slow jam, and the morning-after existential haze of \"I Don't Remember\", but a terpsichorean swagger remains at the heart of Ciara's world. Few artists go as hard as she does on her club jams, whether inviting the world to 'kiss my swag' over kinetic freestyle beats on \"Pucker Up\", combining outraged soprano braggadocio with thunderous crunk baselines on the broiling \"High Price\" or gliding smoothly through the delectable, sun-kissed \"Echo\". At her best, her pace is furious, and keeping up is exhilarating.\" Digital Spy gave it three out of five stars and commented that \"Fantasy Ride features much the same cast of producers as countless other R&B albums from the last couple of years, but these A-list knob-twiddlers rarely try anything risky or inventive here. However, this isn't to say that Fantasy Ride is a bad album. It actually offers a consistently sexy listen with enough minor triumphs \u2013 \"Love Sex Magic\", \"Turntables\" and the electro-scuzzy \"Pucker Up\" \u2013 to hold your attention. Ciara, meanwhile, is on a seductive form throughout. Ciara's Fantasy Ride deserves the benefit of the doubt.\" However, Billboard gave it an average review, stating, \"On 'High Price,' where she takes her vocals to an opera-like pitch, and her collaboration with the-Dream, 'Lover's Things,' whose faint tenor would seem like an ideal match, Ciara seems to go almost unnoticed. Thankfully, 'Work,' featuring Missy Elliott, has Ciara showing fly-girl antics over a house-like, clap-laden production, and the breakup song 'Never Ever,' featuring Young Jeezy, which samples 'If You Don't Know Me by Now,' pick up the slack.\"  In his Consumer Guide, however, Robert Christgau gave the album a \"dud\" score ()."

        "content": "The film documents the varied playing and recording styles of guitarists Jimmy Page, David \"The Edge\" Evans, and Jack White.\nPage's history with guitar traces back to his childhood when he played in a skiffle band. After desiring to do more than play pop music, Page \"retires\" from guitar playing to attend art school. He later revives his music career as a session guitarist, only to be discouraged by the realization that he is playing others' music and stifling his own creativity. At that point, Page begins to write and perform in the bands The Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin. Page discusses the skiffle and blues music that influenced him at the time. For many of Page's scenes, he is seen visiting Headley Grange, where several songs from Led Zeppelin IV were recorded, and in one scene, explains how the distinctive drum sound from \"When the Levee Breaks\" was achieved from the acoustics of the house in which it was recorded.\nEdge's history with guitar traces back to building a guitar with his brother Dik and learning to play. In the film, he visits Mount Temple Comprehensive School and recalls forming U2 in his childhood. He also demonstrates his playing technique, in how he eliminates certain strings from chords, as well as his use of echo and delay effects to \"fill in notes that aren't there\". He also discusses his purchase of his signature guitar, the Gibson Explorer, in New York City and the punk music that influenced him. In other scenes, he plays early demo tapes of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", discusses his inspiration for \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and spends time experimenting with guitar effects for the riffs to \"Get on Your Boots\".\nWhite traces his musical background to his childhood in a rundown neighborhood of Detroit. Living with two drum sets and a guitar occupying his room and sleeping on a piece of foam due to taking out his bed for more room for his music, White struggled to find a musical identity, as it was \"uncool\" to play an instrument and his nine siblings all shared a musical propensity. His strong interest in blues and roots music ran counter to the hip hop and house music popular in the predominantly Latino neighbourhood at the time. White eventually finds a niche in a garage rock band called The Upholsterers while working as an upholsterer, which paves the way for his future bands The White Stripes and The Raconteurs. White's philosophy is to limit and challenge himself in various ways to force creative approaches to recording and playing.\nThe touchstone of the film is a meeting of the three guitarists at a Los Angeles soundstage, dubbed \"The Summit\", on Jan. 23, 2008. In these scenes, the three guitarists not only converse about their influences and techniques, but they also play each other's songs together, showing each other how to play \"I Will Follow\", \"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\", and \"In My Time of Dying\". The film concludes with the men playing an impromptu cover version of The Band's \"The Weight\" on acoustic guitars."

The film is interspersed with songs, both traditional and modern. Mangunharso, in a review in Suara Merdeka, suggested that the character of Mbah Genggong was included to show that people considered useful to their country can fall, and that those who are prostitutes now could have been something else had their lives taken a different turn. He also noted that a strong sense of mystery pervaded the film. Weiland noted a strong sense of social commentary about poverty."

        "content": "The movie opens with an animated telling of Tom\u00e1s Fuentes (Eduardo Ver\u00e1stegui)'s life, in which he is always surrounded by women. In his current life, he is a representative for the Olivero & Sanchez Marketing Group in Los Angeles and is busy travelling to visit all three of his girlfriends to give them each a gift. Cici (Sof\u00eda Vergara), a cocktail waitress from Miami who enjoys being the center of attention; Patricia Sofia Ordonez Coronado del Pescador (Jaci Velasquez), a debutante of New York's high society who is tired of her mother's (Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso) endless attempts to marry her off; and Lorena Morales (Roselyn S\u00e1nchez), a lawyer from Chicago who loves how Tomas makes her feel sexy; have fallen for him and given him the affectionate nickname \"Papi\". This love triangle of sorts affects Tom\u00e1s's work life, causing him to pass out during a presentation. His doctor (Ian Gomez) learns of the love triangle, tells Tom\u00e1s to choose only one woman, prescribes tranquilizers and advises against driving, alcohol, and women.\nBy coincidence, all three of his girlfriends go to Los Angeles after hearing their horoscopes read by fortune teller Walter Mercado on Univision's Primer Impacto. The three women arrive at his house while he is at the doctor's. Instead of fighting each other, all three agree to leave and quit Tomas cold turkey as revenge for his cheating on them. In their absence, Tom\u00e1s arrives home and takes his tranquilizers with alcohol. The girls each have second thoughts about leaving and return to confront Tom\u00e1s directly. First Lorena, then Patricia and finally Cici, causing Tom\u00e1s to overdose on alcohol and tranquilizers and pass out again.\nMary, Tom\u00e1s' secretary, calls hoping that he is doing better. Outside Tomas' house, FBI agent Carmen Rivera (Lisa Vidal), is waiting. She followed Cici to Los Angeles as part of an investigation. Fala, Cici's business partner, had Cici do her boyfriend, Ricky, a favor by taking a car that he sold online to the buyer in Los Angeles. Ricky is involved in the Whittaker counterfeit ring that Agent Rivera is investigating. The girls spot her while panicking about what to do with Tomas and think she is \"the L.A. woman\" who just called, probably from a cell phone.\nScared by Agent Rivera's firearm, the girls decide to take Tom\u00e1s out of the house and wait until he wakes up and decide which girl he wants to be with. They load all their bags in Ricky's car and, after a short chase, they decide to stay at a Marriott hotel instead of a Motel 6. Unfortunately, Patricia's credit cards have been canceled by her mother. However, Lorena is their saving grace. The Miss Latina American Beauty Pageant is being held in that very same hotel and Miss Puerto Rico's flight was delayed. Lorena bears a resemblance to the real beauty contestant and takes her place. Cici passes herself and Patricia off as her staff. When moving their bags to Miss Puerto Rico's room, a bag falls off the cart onto the luggage room floor. In the hotel room, all three girls have dinner, empty three bottles of champagne and share their life stories with each other. They each then have a dream in which they end up with Tom\u00e1s but feel bad about leaving the other two behind.\nThe next morning, Lorena has to meet the judges and Cici has to deliver Ricky's car to a man named Rodrigo (D.L. Hughley) who apparently bought it. They leave Tom\u00e1s but, in their absence, he's taken by Agent Rivera who has followed them to the hotel. It turns out Rodrigo was not interested in the car but a bag that was supposed to be in the trunk. Upon returning to the hotel with Rodrigo's associate, Victor (Freddy Rodriguez), the girls discover Tom\u00e1s is missing and a note that reads, \"If you want your Papi back, bring the money to the Don Quixote puppet at L.A. Latin festival at 5 PM. No cops.\"\nPatricia knocks Victor out with a lamp and Cici calls Fala in Miami for answers about the car but doesn't get any. All that is left is to do what the note says. They are interrupted by Costas Delgado (Paul Rodriguez, uncredited), the director of the pageant, who has been looking for Lorena and needs her to meet with the judges immediately. Patricia finds the extra bag filled with money in the luggage room and Cici gets a map to the festival. Victor comes to, calls Rodrigo and they plan to catch the girls at the festival.\nWhile Miss Mexico is being interviewed, Lorena unbuttons her blouse slightly to show off her cleavage and Costas helps her with her sash. During Lorena's interview, Patricia and Cici arrive but so does the real Miss Puerto Rico, who outs Lorena as an impostor. Cici trips her, allowing all three to escape. Tom\u00e1s wakes up in Agent Rivera's car. Agent Rivera tells him she intends to use him and the girls in order to detain Victor and Rodrigo. They follow the girls to the festival as they leave in Ricky's car.\nOn the way, the girls' car breaks down completely. They steal a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which Patricia knows how to drive, promising the owner to bring it right back. They lose both the map and Agent Rivera in another chase. Upon arrival, the girls see the puppet is behind the stage. Running through the crowd to avoid the cops, Patricia loses one of her colored contact lenses. Since she looks \"so much better without all that money\", she simply takes the other one out. Victor and Rodrigo spot them and the girls run on stage where Sheila E. is performing and dance to singer Christina Vidal's song, Dejar\u00e9, regardless of their mixed dance backgrounds. Victor and Rodrigo get closer to the stage, causing the girls to run off mid-performance. They all run to the puppet, where Carmen and other FBI agents surround them and apprehend Victor and Rodrigo. Tom\u00e1s is reunited with all three of his girlfriends. He apologizes to them for his deception and is unable to choose between them. The girls, however, have all found their inner strengths and choose to leave him instead. Tom\u00e1s decides to take Agent Carmen's advice and spend some time alone after taking her out for dinner. Returning to the festival crowds, the girls are invited to return to the stage where they dance to Christina Vidal's song It's All About Nothing.\nThe movie's timeline advances five months later and the girls have kept in touch. Patricia has moved into her own apartment with her dog Fifi and has gotten a job at an art gallery. Cici is an entertainer on a cruise liner with her business partner Fala. Lorena is still a lawyer working pro-bono but puts her time off to good use and becomes the self-proclaimed \"Queen of Tango\". Fifi hears her horoscope that advises her to \"go outside the door because love is waiting for [her].\" The movie ends with Fifi finding her \"Puppy Chulo.\""

Then, his partner disappeared, along with a large stash of police-impounded money. Due to the fact that Matt was an avid gambler, he was the prime suspect for the crime, but his colleague Steve lied that he and Matt were playing poker, thus giving him an alibi. Since the police still suspected Matt of the crimes, he was thrown off the police force. Matt's wife files for divorce and marries Steve. Matt's daughter Becky stays with Steve while Matt spends his time gambling and heavily drinking.\nSome time later, Matt's markers from extended gambling are mysteriously picked up. Eventually the collector, called the \"Old Man\", sends him a messenger named Blue. Matt is told that he must work off his debt as a hitman for the Old Man's vigilante organization. He begins to receive contracts to kill criminals who avoid arrest with their money and influence.\nMatt deals with his first assignments without much difficulty. Matt also surprisingly learns that his new girlfriend Drea is also an operative for the Old Man, like Blue. Later, Matt is ordered to kill Steve. He refuses and confronts Blue, the Old Man, and Drea with the assignment. Matt is told that Steve is actually a dirty cop who deals with criminals; Matt refuses to believe this. Elsewhere, Steve kills an innocent chaplain because in a prior confession to the priest Matt had talked about his history with Steve. Steve uses this to frame Blue for the crime. When Matt returns to the church, he swears that he will avenge the clergyman's death, despite Steve's urgent requests to stay out of the situation. Unwilling to heed Steve's request, Matt is then arrested by Steve for being a \"material witness\" and released after two hours because Steve hopes to find the Old Man and kill Matt and Blue through following Matt. Still, Matt and Blue manage to escape. At the priest's funeral, which Matt later attends, Steve and his associates plan to kill Matt.\nAfter the funeral ends, a standoff ensues between Matt and Steve. It is revealed that Steve stole the confiscated money and murdered Matt's partner out of fear that he would blow the whistle on Steve's operations. Blue and Drea show up to support Matt, much to the surprise of Steve, and a gunfight ensues. As a trump card, Steve reveals that he is holding Becky hostage, and threatens to kill her if Matt does not back down. Drea is able to free Becky while Matt and Blue fight Steve's associates. Blue is mortally wounded and says his goodbyes to Matt before passing. Matt and Steve confront each other once more and Matt successfully kills Steve.\nMuch later, Becky and her father are shown to be reunited and spending more time together than before. The camera cuts to Matt praying in the church as Drea walks in to give Matt his next assignment from the Old Man."

He compares it to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 2007 film Until Death and Abel Ferrara's 1992 film Bad Lieutenant in its subversion of action icons through the use of an unusually flawed protagonist, and claims that, \"[Pistol Whipped] has Seagal stretching his persona and exploring new territory without abandoning his classic themes\".David Johnson of DVD Verdict gave the film a negative review, saying \"this entry into the Seagal canon is dull,\" and going on to criticize Seagal's physique and calling the plot, \"slow-moving, emotionally contrived and utterly predictable.\""

Although she is initially too insecure to approach him, her friend Ruby talks her into it.  While awkwardly hitting on him, Deb is interrupted by Ryan's fianc\u00e9, who breaks up with him when he refuses to accept a high-paying job at his father's company.  The next thing Deb knows, she wakes in Ryan's bed with a hangover.  Ryan asks her to leave and after several attempts to seduce him, she reluctantly agrees but sees people attack and cannibalize each other.  Deb saves Ryan from a zombie attack, and they return to his apartment.\nDeb once again attempts to seduce Ryan, who is more concerned with checking on his family and ex-fianc\u00e9e.  Since he has no car, Deb agrees to help him.  They first visit his elderly neighbor for supplies.  Finding her apparently dead, they bicker over arrangements, only to be surprised when she rises as a zombie.  After they kill her, Deb drops the supplies, alerting many zombies.  The two flee to her car, agreeing that they will not stop until they reach Ryan's family.  Along the way, Deb eagerly rams several zombies; Ryan objects, saying they may be treatable.  Although skeptical of his idealism, Deb agrees not to unnecessarily kill them.\nDespite their earlier agreement, Deb takes a detour to visit Ruby, who is now a zombie.  Convinced the zombies may be treatable, Deb traps Ruby in the car's trunk.  At Ryan's father's mansion, the two meet Chaz, Ryan's brother, who quizzes them on whether they are zombies before allowing them in.  Ryan is reunited with Stacy and Ryan's father, Frank, reveals that his water treatment plant spread the zombie virus to the town.  When Deb pushes for more information, he blames the governor for pushing an environmentally dangerous project, to Ryan's disgust.\nFrank privately tells Ryan the governor has arranged a helicopter for them and Ryan insists they take Deb.  Frank refuses, but relents when Ryan threatens to stay behind.  Frank tries to drug Deb so they can abandon her, but she hands the drugged food to their security guard.  When Ryan tells Stacy he no longer wants to marry her, she loudly simulates having sex, driving Deb to leave the house and Chaz to become intensely jealous.  After their guard dies, zombies attack Stacy.  Chaz ignores her pleas for help and, dazed by seeing her eaten alive, allows himself to be bitten.  The Waverlys leave the house for the helicopter, taking Chaz with them.\nDeb discovers a security checkpoint at the town limits.  Satisfying the paramilitary group, they allow her to leave but say she must turn back to the town.  After she invokes Frank's name to the governor, Frank appears, demanding his helicopter transportation.  The governor explains there never was a helicopter, and he wants only to clean up loose ends.  Ryan tells the Governor that Deb is a reporter who has evidence on him hidden in her car's trunk; the governor opens the trunk and is killed by Ruby. When Frank is also bitten, he tells Ryan and Deb to flee while he holds off the soldiers.\nDeb realizes they can use her television station to send out a broadcast that can not be jammed.  After she proclaims her love for Ryan on-air, she is bitten.  Believing herself to be turning into a zombie, she asks Ryan to leave her behind and wait for help, but he refuses to abandon her, instead offering himself to her as zombie food.  Before she can bite him, paramedics break into the station and reveal the virus is not contagious.  Frank and Chaz, revealed to have also survived although under arrest, encourage Ryan to proclaim his love to Deb.  As fighter jets bomb the city, Deb and Ryan kiss."

Tukaram is kindhearted and ameliorates everyone, for which he absorbs his property. He leads a family with two wives, Avalai Jija Bai & Rukma Bai, and 2 infants. However, he is not interested in worldly matters. He is constantly immersed in the adoration of the Lord\u2014Mumbaji Go Swamy, who presents himself as holy and exploits public faith for his own gain. Tukaram permanently exiles him, so resentful Mumbaji causes him much pain, lavelling him as an atheist, and ostracizing him. Hence, his family suffers from starvation even though no one comes forward to support him when Rukma Bai passes away. Devastated Tukaram quits questioning the existence of God when Panduranga appears and endorses his divinity as Abhang s to scripture. Now Tukaram awakes the devotion via singing and becomes eminent, which impresses emperor Shivaji, who facilitates him with material gifts but refuses courteously. \nAt this point, Mumbaji's envy is boundless, so he uses a brothel, Bahina Bai, to lure Tukaram when he shows the reality of life, how her beauty shrinks in old age and makes her a devotee. Later, Mumbaji claims that Tukaram stole his verses when Pandit Rameswara Bhattar, a religious authority, arrives and orders Tukaram to immerse his works in the river and never publicly discuss religion, which he does. The river Ganga retrieves it, affirming it as sacred when Rameswara Bhattar becomes his follower. Meanwhile, Mumbaji hides the Lord's statue, indicates Tukaram, and complains to Shivaji. So, he lands at Dehu to test Tukaram when, with his holy power, he restores the statue. Now, Mumbaji intrigues by notifying Shivaji's presence therein to the Mughals, but the Lord protects him at the behest of Tukaram. Knowing it, the enraged Mughal Empire amputates Mumbaji, which Tukaram retrieves, and he bows his head down. At last, the Lord invites Tukaram to Vaikuntha with the mortal body by sending his vehicle Garuda. Finally, the movie ends with Tukaram going to heaven, giving his ultimate preaching to follow righteousness, truth, peace, kindness & mercy."

        "content": "Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is the debut studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on June 12, 1985, by Combat Records. At the beginning of 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. The band was forced to fire their original producer and produce the album by themselves, after spending half of the album's budget on drugs, alcohol, and food. Despite the poor production, the album was a well-received effort that obtained strong reviews in various music publications. Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! played an essential role in establishing thrash metal as an authentic subgenre of heavy metal music. It explores themes of death, occultism, and violence.\nThe album features the track \"Mechanix\", a song that frontman Dave Mustaine would perform with Metallica during his tenure in the band, and a controversial cover of the 1965 song \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\". A deluxe edition, completely remixed and remastered with several bonus tracks, was released through Loud Records on February 5, 2002. It features vastly different artwork, with its cover based on the version originally designed by Mustaine in 1985. All songs from the album were performed frequently during Megadeth's initial tour but have been steadily dropped from the setlist since, except for \"Mechanix\". A new remastered version of the album called Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill was released on June 8, 2018, which includes a version of \"These Boots\" with re-recorded vocals, redone to Lee Hazlewood's version."

        "content": "Dave Mustaine had been originally the lead guitarist for Metallica. However, due to drinking, substance abuse, violent behavior, and personality conflicts with bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, Mustaine was eventually fired from the band. Two months after being fired from Metallica, Mustaine met bassist David Ellefson and together they formed Megadeth in Los Angeles. Mustaine later recalled: \"After getting fired from Metallica, all I remember is that I wanted blood. Theirs. I wanted to be faster and heavier than them.\" Fueled by the desire for revenge, Mustaine elevated the intensity of Megadeth's music in order to challenge his former band. He sped up existing songs such as \"Mechanix\", which Metallica's new line-up adapted into the slower paced \"The Four Horsemen\". Mustaine included his original version of the song on the album to \"straighten Metallica up\", as Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk, and said that he could not play guitar.After going through multiple vocalists, including Billy Bonds and John Cyriis, Mustaine decided to handle the vocal duties himself, while also serving as the band's primary lyricist, main songwriter, and co-lead and rhythm guitarist. Megadeth recorded a three-song demo tape early in 1984 titled \"Last Rites\", engineered by Karat Faye, and released it on March 9, 1984. On the strength of the demo, the band was asked to sign with the New York-based independent label Combat Records in November 1984. Early in 1985, Megadeth was given $8,000 by Combat to record and produce its debut album. However, this proved not to be enough, and the band was given a further $4,000. Instead, a majority of the budget was spent on drugs, alcohol, and food, prompting the group to fire the original producer, and produce the record themselves. Poland has disputed this account. The album was successfully recorded at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California."

        "content": "The album's artwork, featuring a plastic skull with tinfoil, was not intended to be the original artwork. The intended artwork was inspired by the Three wise monkeys; Mustaine drew the original sketch and asked his friend Peyton Tuttle to paint a version of it; this early version was used on Megadeth merchandise. Both Mustaine and Ellefson had many phone conversations with Combat Records to get the cover artwork properly reproduced from a sketch given to them by Mustaine of a picture of Megadeth mascot Vic Rattlehead on the cover. However the studio lost the artwork, and instead made their own improvised replacement, with which Mustaine and the whole band were mortified.Megadeth began with live performances before the record was released. Although not a member of the band, Kerry King of Slayer played guitar for a short period because Mustaine had not recruited a full-time guitarist yet. In mid-1985, the group started a tour promoting the Killing Is My Business... album with the band Exciter. During the tour, guitarist Chris Poland abruptly left the band, and was replaced by guitarist Mike Albert. However, Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, and stayed with the band up after the tour of the next album.The album was released on June 12, 1985. To date it remains the only Megadeth album that did not chart on the Billboard 200, primarily because it was released through an independent label with little promotion. Nevertheless, the album still went on to become one of Combat Records' highest selling releases. Later that year, Capitol Records signed Megadeth as they began working on their second album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, released the following year.A limited edition of Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was released in 2002. This version's cover is redesigned to match Mustaine's original sketch, and the song \"These Boots\" was re-added, with extra \"bleeps\" in place of the rewritten sections. Over 254,000 copies of the album were sold in the United States since the beginning of the Nielsen SoundScan era.In April 2018 it was announced that the album would once again be remixed and remastered, with Mark Lewis remixing the album and Ted Jensen remastering it. Titled Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill, the deluxe reissue features new album artwork, new mixes and masters of the original album, a new version of \"These Boots\" featuring Lee Hazlewood's original lyrics, the original 1984 demos featured on the 2002 remix, and newly-discovered live tracks sourced from VHS tapes found in Dave Mustaine's attic, as well as a previously undiscovered \"performance\" by Samuelson. The new remaster was released on June 8, 2018."

        "content": "According to writer Peter Buckley, the record presented a faster, \"thrashier kind of heavy metal\". Steve Huey of AllMusic opined that the music on Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is predominantly \"chaotic\", accompanied by \"lightning-fast\" solo sections. Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno said that the original pressing greatly suffered from the poor production, which made the record difficult to listen to. However, he noted that the music is performed at rapid speed, with precise riffing by both Poland and Mustaine. In his book Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal, editor Jeff Wagner wrote the album displayed unusual rhythms and unorthodox guitar riffs, which carried \"like a runaway train\". Speaking about the intensity of the record, Ellefson said that \"extreme speed was deemed the cool factor in thrash metal back in those days\". Although Ellefson considers the album as a solid debut release, he wanted some of the songs to be recorded in slower tempo.The album explores gloomy lyrical subjects such as death, violence, and occultism. Speaking about the themes on the album, author Bob Larson asserted that Megadeth \"cranks out songs about spilling blood and stomping guts with venomous anger\". The album's title, as well as its lyrics, led to accusations whether the band was promoting Satanism. These allegations were rigidly denied by Mustaine, who said that the band consciously kept away from the Satanic image. \"I mean, it's great to thrash and pound, cut yourself up, scream and have fun, but you don't have to take out a Pagan attitude. Why support the Devil? He's already there. I'd rather just fucking thrash and be a metalist and listen to whatever I want to than be forced to listen to one style of music.\""

Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, called the album a \"ferocious blast of high-energy thrash metal\", weakened by a thin production. Similarly, Steve Huey from AllMusic observed that the album is \"as raw as Megadeth gets\". However, Huey noted that the riffs and compositions weren't completely developed, and called Mustaine's vocals \"amateurish at best\". Chad Bowar from About.com said that Megadeth were still \"finding their way\" on their debut album, but remarked that the band showed great potential through angry and passionate musicianship.Adrien Begrand of PopMatters dismissed the original recording, but praised the re-release, writing that the album \"blazes on at a furious pace\". According to him, the record greatly influenced the heavy metal genre in the upcoming two decades. Sputnikmusic staff member Mike Stagno agreed with the praise for the remaster, saying that the \"fuzzy\" sound of the original release was replaced with a clearer production. Even so, he opined that the album still retained the \"thrashy\" sound characteristic for the band during this period. Mike Marsh of Drowned in Sound recommended the music \"for people who want it loud, fast and brutal\". In a retrospective review for KNAC, Frank Meyer said that the album put Megadeth at the forefront of heavy metal scene in the early 1980s and credited it for paving the way for thrash metal's arrival. CMJ New Music Report praised Mustaine's \"masterful\" wordplay and called the record a representative of \"the golden age of speed metal\"."

The film stars Jack Nicholson as a new patient at a mental institution, alongside Louise Fletcher as a sadistic nurse. The supporting cast is Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Sydney Lassick, William Redfield, and the film debuts of Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif.  \nOriginally announced in 1962 with Kirk Douglas starring, the film took 13 years to develop. Filming finally began in January 1975 and lasted three months, on location in Salem, Oregon and the surrounding area, and in Depoe Bay on the north Oregon coast. The producers shot the film in the Oregon State Hospital, an actual psychiatric hospital, which is also the setting of the novel. The hospital is in operation, though the original buildings in the film have been demolished. The film was released on November 19, 1975. Considered by many to be one of the greatest films ever made, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is No. 33 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.\nThe film is the second to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Director, and Screenplay) following It Happened One Night in 1934, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 with The Silence of the Lambs. It won numerous Golden Globe and BAFTA Awards.

The ward is dominated by Head Nurse Ratched, a cold, passive-aggressive tyrant who intimidates her patients.\nThe other patients include young, anxious, stuttering Billy Bibbit; Charlie Cheswick, who is prone to temper tantrums; delusional, child-like Martini; the articulate and repressed Dale Harding; belligerent and profane Max Taber; epileptics Jim Sefelt and Bruce Fredrickson; quiet but violent-minded Scanlon; tall, deaf-mute Native American \"Chief\" Bromden; and several others with chronic conditions.\nRatched sees McMurphy's lively, rebellious presence as a threat to her authority, which she responds to by confiscating and rationing the patients' cigarettes and suspending their card-playing privileges. McMurphy finds himself in a battle of wills against Ratched. He steals a school bus, picks up his girlfriend Candy and escapes with several patients to go fishing on the Pacific Coast. He exposes them to the outside world and encourages them to discover their own abilities and find self-confidence.\nAfter an orderly tells him that his prison sentence can become indefinite, since he has been committed, McMurphy makes plans to escape with Chief. He also learns that he, Chief, and Taber are the only non-chronic patients who have been involuntarily committed; the others have committed themselves and may leave at any time, but are too afraid to do so. After Cheswick bursts into a fit and demands his cigarettes from Ratched, McMurphy starts a fight with the orderlies and Chief intervenes to help him.\nMcMurphy, Chief, and Cheswick are sent to the disturbed ward after the fight, and Chief reveals to McMurphy that he can speak and hear normally. He has feigned deaf-muteness to avoid engaging with anyone, remembering the way in which alcoholism destroyed his father's life. After being subjected to electroconvulsive therapy, McMurphy returns to the ward pretending to be brain-damaged, but then reveals that the treatment has made him even more determined to defeat Ratched. McMurphy and Chief make plans to escape, but decide to throw a secret Christmas party for their friends after Ratched and the orderlies leave for the night.\nMcMurphy sneaks Candy and her friend Rose into the ward, each bringing bottles of alcohol for the party.\nHe then bribes the night orderly Turkle to allow the party. Afterward, McMurphy and Chief prepare to escape, inviting Billy to come with them. Billy refuses, but asks for a \"date\" with Candy; McMurphy arranges for him to have sex with her. McMurphy and the others get drunk, and McMurphy falls asleep instead of making his escape with Chief.\nRatched arrives in the morning to find the ward in disarray and most of the patients passed out. She discovers Billy and Candy together, and aims to embarrass Billy in front of everyone. Billy manages to overcome his stutter and stands up to Ratched. When she threatens to tell his mother, Billy cracks under the pressure and reverts to stuttering. Ratched has him placed in the doctor's office. Moments later, McMurphy punches an orderly when trying to escape out of a window with the Chief, causing the other orderlies to intervene. This attempt to escape is disrupted when Billy suddenly commits suicide by slitting his throat with broken glass. Ratched tries to control the situation by calling for the day's routine to continue as usual, but her nonchalant reaction enrages McMurphy and he strangles Ratched. The orderlies subdue McMurphy, saving Ratched's life.\nSome time later, Ratched is wearing a neck brace and speaking with a weak voice, and Harding leads the now-unsuspended card-playing. McMurphy is nowhere to be found, leading to rumors that he has escaped. Later that night, Chief sees McMurphy being returned to his bed. Chief greets him, elated that McMurphy had kept his promise not to escape without him, but discovers that McMurphy has been lobotomized. After tearfully hugging McMurphy, Chief smothers him to death with a pillow. He then tears a hydrotherapy console free of its floor mountings, just like when McMurphy attempted to do so earlier, and throws it through a window, and escapes as Taber and the other inmates awaken and cheer for him."

        "content": "Critics praised the film, sometimes with reservations. Roger Ebert said: \"Milo\u0161 Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a film so good in so many of its parts that there's a temptation to forgive it when it goes wrong. But it does go wrong, insisting on making larger points than its story really should carry, so that at the end, the human qualities of the characters get lost in the significance of it all. And yet, there are those moments of brilliance.\" Ebert later put the film on his \"Great Movies\" list. A.D. Murphy of Variety wrote a mixed review as well, as did Vincent Canby in The New York Times: \"A comedy that can't quite support its tragic conclusion, which is too schematic to be honestly moving, but it is acted with such a sense of life that one responds to its demonstration of humanity if not to its programmed metaphors.\"The film opens and closes with original music by composer Jack Nitzsche, featuring an eerie bowed saw (performed by Robert Armstrong) and wine glasses. On the score, reviewer Steven McDonald: \"The edgy nature of the film extends into the score, giving it a profoundly disturbing feel at times\u2013even when it appears to be relatively normal. The music has a tendency to always be a little off-kilter, and from time to time, it tilts completely over into a strange little world of its own\"The film won the \"Big Five\" Academy Awards at the 48th Oscar ceremony. These include the Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher, Best Direction for Forman, Best Picture, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman. The film has a 93% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 115 critics, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher are worthy adversaries in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, with Milo\u0161 Forman's more grounded and morally ambiguous approach to Ken Kesey's surrealistic novel yielding a film of outsized power.\" The film has an 84 rating on Metacritic.\nKesey claimed never to have seen the movie, but said he disliked what he knew of it, which was confirmed by Chuck Palahniuk, who wrote: \"The first time I heard this story, it was through the movie starring Jack Nicholson. A movie that Kesey once told me he disliked.\"In 1993, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in its National Film Registry.The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this as one of his 100 favorite films."

        "content": "Fantasia is a 1940 American animated musical anthology film produced by Walt Disney Productions, with story direction by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer and production supervision by Walt Disney and Ben Sharpsteen. It consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski, seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film's Master of Ceremonies who introduces each segment in live action.\nDisney settled on the film's concept in 1938 as work neared completion on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, originally an elaborate Silly Symphony cartoon designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs surpassed what the short could earn, Disney decided to include it in a feature-length film of multiple segments set to classical pieces with Stokowski and Taylor as collaborators. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound system developed by Disney and RCA that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereo and a precursor to surround sound.\nFantasia was first released as a theatrical roadshow that was held in 13 cities across the U.S. between 1940 and 1941 by RKO Radio Pictures; the first began at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. While acclaimed by critics, it failed to make a profit owing to World War II's cutting off distribution to the European market, the film's high production costs, and the expense of building Fantasound equipment and leasing theatres for the roadshow presentations. Since 1942, the film has been reissued multiple times by RKO Radio Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution with its original footage and audio being deleted, modified, or restored in each version. When adjusted for inflation, Fantasia is the 23rd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S.\nThe Fantasia franchise has grown to include video games, Disneyland attractions, and a live concert series. A sequel, Fantasia 2000, co-produced by Walt's nephew Roy E. Disney, was released in 1999. Fantasia has grown in reputation over the years and is now widely acclaimed as one of the greatest animated films of all time; in 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their 100 Years...100 Movies and the fifth greatest animated film in their 10 Top 10 list. In 1990, Fantasia was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\""

        "content": "Disney had wanted Fantasia to be an ongoing project, with a new edition being released every few years. His plan was to replace one of the original segments with a new one as it was completed, so audiences would always see a new version of the film. From January to August 1941, story material was developed based on additional musical works, including Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner, The Swan of Tuonela by Jean Sibelius, Invitation to the Dance by Carl Maria von Weber, the Polka and Fugue from Schwanda the Bagpiper by Jarom\u00edr Weinberger, a \"baby ballet\" set to Berceuse by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and a \"bug ballet\" set to Flight of the Bumblebee by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, which was later adapted into the Bumble Boogie segment in Melody Time (1948). The film's disappointing initial box office performance and the USA's entry into World War II brought an end to these plans. Deems Taylor prepared introductions for The Firebird by Stravinsky, La Mer by Claude Debussy, Adventures in a Perambulator by John Alden Carpenter, Don Quixote by Richard Strauss, and Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky \"to have them for the future in case we decided to make any one of them\".Another segment, Debussy's Clair de lune, was developed as part of the film's original program. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two Great white herons flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night, with more focus towards the segment's background art than story and animation. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the Blue Bayou segment in Make Mine Music (1946). In 1992, a workprint of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000.Destino, a collaboration between Walt Disney and surrealist artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, was also considered for inclusion as a future Fantasia segment, but was shelved until it was re-discovered during production of Fantasia 2000. In her host sequence for The Steadfast Tin Soldier in that film, Bette Midler mentions several cancelled sequences, specifically Ride of the Valkyries, Destino, Flight of the Bumblebee, Berceuse and the Polka and Fugue."

Released in November 1980 on Geffen Records, the album marked Lennon's return to recording music full-time, following his five-year hiatus to raise his son Sean. Recording sessions took place at the Hit Factory in New York City between August and October 1980. The final album features songs from both Lennon and Ono, largely alternating between the two in its track listing. Other tracks recorded by Lennon from the sessions were compiled by Ono for release on Milk and Honey in 1984.\nUpon its release, the album stalled on music charts and received largely negative reviews from music critics, with many focusing on the album's idealisation of Lennon and Ono's marriage. However, following Lennon's murder three weeks after its release, it became a worldwide commercial success and went on to win the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In subsequent decades, the album has been viewed favourably, with Lennon's songs in particular garnering praise as some of his finest.\nIn 2010, Ono and Douglas released a remix of the album, titled Double Fantasy Stripped Down, which featured less lavish production than the original."

        "content": "Following the birth of his son, Sean, in 1975, Lennon put his musical career on hold to raise him. After five years of little musical activity, aside from recording the occasional demo in his apartment in New York, Lennon resumed his career.\nIn June 1980, Lennon embarked on a sailing trip from Newport, Rhode Island to Bermuda. During the journey, the 43-foot schooner named Megan Jaye encountered a severe storm. One by one, the crew of five were overcome with fatigue and seasickness save for Lennon, who was eventually forced to take the helm alone for six hours. It had the effect of both renewing his confidence and making him contemplate the fragility of life. As a result, he began to write new songs and reworked earlier demos. He commented later, \"I was so centred after the experience at sea that I was tuned in to the cosmos \u2013 and all these songs came!\" Ono also wrote many songs, inspired with new confidence after Lennon had stated that he believed that contemporary popular music, such as \"Rock Lobster\" by the B-52's, bore similarities to Ono's earlier work.The couple decided to release their work on the same album, the first time they had done so since 1972's politically charged Some Time in New York City. In stark contrast to that album, Double Fantasy (subtitled A Heart Play) was a collection of songs wherein husband and wife would conduct a musical dialogue. The album took its title from a species of freesia, seen in the Bermuda Botanical Gardens, whose name Lennon regarded as a perfect description of his marriage to Ono.Lennon was also inspired to return to music by his former songwriting partner within the Beatles. Upon hearing former bandmate Paul McCartney's 1980 single \"Coming Up\", Lennon deemed the song \"a good piece of work.\" According to McCartney, the track prompted Lennon to return to recording later that year."

Lennon and Ono were rarely in the studio at the same time, primarily because Ono did not want Lennon imposing himself in her work. They produced dozens of songs, enough to fill Double Fantasy and a large part of a projected second album, Milk and Honey.\nLennon wanted to work with different musicians than he had previously, and had Douglas assemble and rehearse the band without telling them who they would be recording with.  While the sessions were underway, Douglas brought Rick Nielsen and Bun E. Carlos of the band Cheap Trick (whom he was also producing) to play on Lennon's \"I'm Losing You\" and Ono's \"I'm Moving On\", but these were eventually re-recorded with the studio musicians. The Cheap Trick version of \"I'm Losing You\" was included on the John Lennon Anthology collection released in 1998.The sessions remained top secret. According to Douglas, this was because Lennon was not confident in his work, feeling that he was out of touch with the contemporary music scene and could no longer write or sing up to the standard he set in his heyday, and wanted to be able to discreetly abort the sessions if he felt they were not turning out well; at one point he spoke of giving most of the songs he wrote for the album to his ex-bandmate Ringo Starr. Lennon and Ono still were not signed to a record label and paid for the initial sessions themselves. After they were satisfied with the album, their publicist Bruce Replogle leaked the news that the couple were back in the studio again.\nImmediately, Lennon was inundated with offers from all the major labels. The recording industry was shocked when the couple signed with the newly formed Geffen Records on 22 September 1980 because David Geffen shrewdly insisted on speaking with Ono first and regarded her contributions as equal to Lennon's. He signed them before hearing any of the tracks."

Geffen had planned an elaborate cover for Lennon's comeback, but Ono could not decide on a photo.  Not wanting to miss the Christmas release deadline, Geffen used the single sleeve as the front cover, while choosing an outtake from the same photo session for the back.

Set during the war in Afghanistan, it dramatizes the unsuccessful United States Navy SEALs counter-insurgent mission Operation Red Wings, during which a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team was given the task of tracking down the Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. The film was written and directed by Peter Berg, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Eric Bana.\nUpon first learning of the book in 2007, Berg arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss adapting the book to film. Universal Pictures acquired the film rights in August 2007, after bidding against other major studios. In re-enacting events, Berg drew much of his screenplay from Luttrell's eyewitness accounts in the book, as well as autopsy and incident reports related to the mission. After directing Battleship (2012) for Universal, Berg resumed working on Lone Survivor. Principal photography began in October 2012 and concluded in November, after 42 days. Filming took place on location in New Mexico, using digital cinematography. Luttrell and several other Navy SEAL veterans acted as technical advisors, while multiple branches of the United States Armed Forces aided the production. Two companies, Industrial Light & Magic and Image Engine, created the visual effects.\nLone Survivor opened in limited release in the United States on December 25, 2013, before opening across North America on January 10, 2014. It received generally positive reviews; critics praised Berg's direction and realism, as well as the acting, story, visuals and battle sequences, though some criticism was directed at the film's focus on action rather than characterization. It grossed over $154 million, of which $125 million was from North America. It was chosen by National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2013 and received two Oscar nominations for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing."

A Navy SEAL team, consisting of Michael Murphy, Matthew Axelson, Danny Dietz and Marcus Luttrell, is ordered to capture Shah.\nInserted overnight via helicopter, the four-man team make their way toward Shah's last known location. Due to the mountainous terrain the team is operating in, communications with J-Bad become difficult. Though the team identify Shah, they are discovered by local villagers; one of whom is carrying a walkie-talkie. Believing that the villagers are Taliban sympathisers, the SEALs debate setting them free or killing them. Murphy orders them to be set free.\nThe team proceed up the mountainside, aborting their mission and intending to extract. However, true to the SEALs\u2019 concerns, the villagers alert the Taliban, who pursue the team. Though the SEALs begin with the advantage, the sheer number of the Taliban forces begins to overwhelm them and their position. Pushed toward a ravine the SEALs are given little choice but to jump, but are thrown off balance when an RPG detonates in front of them. Dietz is killed and the remaining SEALs try desperately to raise support. Murphy scales the cliff to gain a clear signal which finally alerts the QRF, though he is killed shortly after.\nThe QRF scrambles to the SEALs\u2019 aid, though the two Chinook helicopters fly in without Apache support. Briefly encouraged by the arrival of reinforcements, Luttrell and Axelson watch helplessly as one Chinook is shot down by an RPG. The second aborts, leaving Luttrell and Axelson to fend for themselves. Already grievously wounded from battle, the disoriented Axelson is soon cornered by Taliban gunmen and killed. Luttrell is also discovered, though he survives an RPG attack and is able to hide from his pursuers overnight and escapes.\nWandering alone, Luttrell happens across a small stream when he is discovered by Mohammed Gulab, a local Pashtun. Taking the wounded and exhausted Luttrell into his care, Gulab hides him from the Taliban in his home, and also sends another villager to the nearest American base to report on Luttrell's location. Shah arrives at the village to execute Luttrell, however the villagers resist. Shah leaves, but returns later with several Taliban gunmen and engages the villagers. Rangers arrive mid battle and evacuate Luttrell, who also thanks Mohammed for his assistance.\nImages of the real Luttrell, Gulab and the fallen service members killed during the mission are shown during a four-minute montage, and an epilogue explains that the Pashtun villagers agreed to help Luttrell as part of a traditional code of honor known as the Pashtunwali."

        "content": "While the film was based on actual events, it has been noted that it contained a number of historical inaccuracies.The number of Taliban fighters involved in the ambush has been widely disputed. In Marcus Luttrell's original after-action report, he stated that he and his teammates were attacked by 20\u201335 insurgents, while his book places the number at over 200. The screenplay describes \"A solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on top of the hill above them.\"  The summary of action for Lt. Murphy's posthumous Medal of Honor describes the enemy force as numbering \"more than 50,\" while the official citation puts the number at \"between 30 and 40 enemy fighters.\"In his book, Victory Point: Operations Red Wings and Whalers \u2013 the Marine Corps' Battle for Freedom in Afghanistan, military journalist Ed Darack cites a military intelligence report stating the strength of the Taliban force to be 8\u201310. The military intelligence estimate cited by Darack is based on research sourced from intelligence reports, including aerial and eyewitness studies of the battlefield after the fact, including the men sent in to rescue Luttrell, as well as reports from Afghan intelligence.The number of casualties sustained by the Taliban fighters has also been disputed. Naval Special Warfare Command has estimated that Luttrell and his teammates killed around thirty-five insurgents during the battle. Andrew MacMannis, a former Marine Colonel who was involved in planning Operation Red Wings and assisted in recovering bodies after the mission, has stated that there were no known enemy casualties. Mohammad Gulab, the Afghan villager who rescued Luttrell, agrees with MacMannis, as does another Marine who was involved with the mission, Patrick Kinser, who has said, \"I've been at the location where [Luttrell] was ambushed multiple times. I've had Marines wounded there. I've been in enough firefights to know that when shit hits the fan, it's hard to know how many people are shooting at you. [But] there weren't 35 enemy fighters in all of the Korengal Valley [that day].\" Furthermore, Gulab has claimed that he found Luttrell with eleven magazines of ammunition \u2013 the full amount that Luttrell had brought on the mission.In the film, the four-man SEAL reconnaissance team is discovered by three goat herders\u2014an elderly man and two teenage boys. In fact, Luttrell wrote in his book that only one of the goat herders was a teenage boy, not two.\nLuttrell's book and the film both suggest that the SEALs decision to release the goat herders led to their subsequent ambush - yet according to Gulab, people throughout the area heard the SEALs being dropped off by helicopter, and the Taliban proceeded to track the SEALs' footprints. Other villagers recounted to Gulab that the Taliban found the SEALs while the debate over the goat herders was taking place and that the Taliban then waited for a more opportune time to attack.The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) being able to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell explained that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell also said that he did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, enter the room where Luttrell was being kept and physically beat him, before being pressured to leave by the village elder. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.In his book, Luttrell claims that Ahmad Shah was \"one of Osama bin Laden's closest associates\". The film's production notes add to this mistake, calling Shah \"a high-level al Qaeda operative\". Shah was not actually a member of al Qaeda, nor did he know bin Laden. Rather, Shah was a local militia leader with ties to the Taliban. In the film, Shah is said to have killed twenty Marines in the week before Operation Red Wings. Although Shah did in fact participate in multiple attacks against U.S. forces prior to the events of Lone Survivor, there is no evidence to suggest that he had been responsible for the deaths of any American service members. Only five Marines had died in combat in the entire war up to that point, and only two U.S. service-members were killed in Kunar Province in the months leading up to Operation Red Wings."

        "content": "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, often referred to as simply Viva la Vida, is the fourth studio album by British rock band Coldplay, released on 12 June 2008 on the Parlophone label. \"Viva la vida\" is a Spanish phrase that translates into English as \"long live life\", \"live the life\", or simply \"live life\". Lyrically, the album contains references to love, life, death and war.\nRecording sessions for the album took place from November 2006 to April 2008 and featured production by Jon Hopkins, Rik Simpson, Markus Dravs, and Brian Eno. The album was Coldplay's first to be produced by Eno, and also their first album to not be produced by long-time Coldplay producer Ken Nelson. The band forced themselves to explore new styles, as Eno required every song on the album to sound different. Development of the album delayed the release date several times. The album cover of Viva la Vida is the 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix with the album title over it in bold lettering.\nViva la Vida was both a critical and commercial success. Five songs were released in promotion of the album: \"Violet Hill\" and \"Viva la Vida\" in May 2008, \"Lovers in Japan\" and \"Lost!\" in November 2008, and \"Strawberry Swing\" in September 2009. \"Viva la Vida\" became the band's first song to reach number one in both the United States and the United Kingdom. It won Best Rock Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards and was also nominated for Album of the Year. It was the best-selling album of 2008. By 2011, the album had sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. Viva la Vida was re-released on 25 November 2008 in a deluxe edition containing the original album and the Prospekt's March EP, which contained another hit, \"Life in Technicolor II\"."

The new baby, and the fact that Coldplay had no touring or recording schedule at the time, had fans wondering if the band's new album would not be released until 2010. Dispelling such reports, Ambrosia Healy, spokesperson to Capitol Records, sent an e-mail message to MTV saying that there was no self-imposed hiatus. However, Healy clarified that Coldplay was indeed \"enjoying a much-deserved break\", and that there was no timetable for the follow-up to the band's third studio album, X&Y.Work on the album began in November 2006, only being interrupted by the Latin American leg of their Twisted Logic Tour in early 2007."

        "content": "Ambient musician and English record producer Brian Eno produced the album. Coldplay moved to the Bakery, after finishing up their Twisted Logic Tour, building a studio there. The songs written during their time at the studio are lyrically \"much more abstract, much more visual than before\", and musically \"less straight-forward, more oblique\". Additionally, lead singer Chris Martin wanted to make a vocal transition from his trademark falsetto to a lower register. This is explored in \"Yes\", where the main characteristic of the Velvet Underground\u2013inspired song is the lowest vocals Chris Martin ever recorded; this was suggested by the producer Brian Eno, to make every single song sound different. The band's drummer Will Champion said in an interview for MTV: \"One of the main things we tried to focus on with this record is changing vocal identities, because Chris has a very recognizable voice.\" Coldplay sparked an interest with Hispanic influences after having recorded in churches and in Spanish-speaking countries such as in Mexico in North America and Spain in Europe, specifically in Barcelona. However, it was stressed that the influence was not in any specific sound but a general feel to the songs taken as a whole. On their website, the band also described taking acoustic guitars and basic recording equipment to churches and experimenting with particular sounds.Throughout the recording of the album, Coldplay communicated to fans through their website. \"Famous Old Painters\" and \"Glass of Water\" were written in late 2007, and they were considering both tracks for the album; however, they were not well received by the producers, though the latter was added to the finalised Prospekt's March extended play track listing instead. The album was delayed further, but a December 2007 post gave hints that the recording stage was nearly finished. The article was signed \"Prospekt\", strengthening rumours that this would be the album's title. While the band completed two more songs (\"Lovers in Japan\" and \"Strawberry Swing\"), they denied that the album was called \"Prospekt\". Martin revealed he had been reading many Charles Dickens novels during the recording process which may have contributed to the strong visual imagery on such tracks as \"Violet Hill\" and \"Cemeteries of London\". \nWhen asked about why \"Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love\" had an additional song, bassist Guy Berryman explained that the band had wanted to keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks. Champion followed with, \"We just preferred to have less titles and more stuff. The album as a whole has got the most on it, but it's the shortest. We wanted to make it almost impossible for you to not listen to it all in one go.\"The Italian violinist and composer Davide Rossi collaborated with Coldplay to record strings on his acoustic and electric violin (the latter being capable of reaching notes as low as the upright bass, thus recreating a full orchestra) throughout the album. His strings are featured in six songs: \"Viva la Vida\" (the song in which his strings are the most used), \"Violet Hill\", \"Life in Technicolor\", \"42\", \"Yes\" and \"Strawberry Swing\". Some of the songs they recorded with Rossi didn't make the cut for the album but were released on the Prospekt's March EP.\nOn 18 July 2009, two early demos from the Viva la Vida recording sessions leaked onto the Internet: the previously unheard \"Bloodless Revolution\" and a very early version of Viva la Vida promotional single \"Lovers in Japan\". A day later another demo, called \"St. Stephen\", appeared online. On 20 July 2009, six more demos were leaked: \"The Fall of Man\", \"The Man Who Swears\", \"The Man Who Swears II\" (actually just the second half of \"The Man Who Swears\"), \"First Steps\", \"Loveless\" and \"Goodbye and Goodnight\". Three other left-off tracks were leaked later into the internet: an instrumental of \"Lukas\", an unreleased song given to Natalie Imbruglia; \"Solid Ground (Until The Water Floats Over)\", a song written and performed live in 2006; and an instrumental of \"Famous Old Painters\"."

        "content": "Viva la Vida is a rock album, which has been more specifically described as alternative rock, art rock, pop rock, indie pop and art pop, with dream pop influences. Musically, it contrasts with their previous records. The title track uses an orchestra, while \"Lovers in Japan\" features a tack piano. \"Lost!\" is influenced by tribal music, whereas \"Strawberry Swing\" incorporates Afropop music. Martin described Viva la Vida as a new direction for Coldplay: a change from their past three albums, which they have referred to as a \"trilogy\". He said the album featured less falsetto, as he allowed his voice's lower register to take precedence, which is particularly evident on such tracks as \"Yes\" and \"Death and All His Friends\".The album contains an array of different themes such as love, war, and revolution. Unlike their previous releases, the album has a more universal approach, dealing less with personal problems and more with issues of humanity. Songs like \"Life in Technicolor II\" (which didn't make it to the final track list but instead was released on Prospekt's March) and \"Death and All His Friends\" talk about war and politics, while \"Violet Hill\" has been described as the first anti-war protest song from the band. Martin stated the lyrics of \"Violet Hill\" were a commentary on Fox News. Other songs, such as the double track \"Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love\" and \"Yes\", are about love and desire.\nRevolutionary themes are also an important part of the album and its promotion. Coldplay used customised French revolutionary costumes throughout the Viva la Vida Tour and in the videos produced for the album's singles. In an interview for the Latin American TV channel Boomerang in 2010, Martin said that a big inspiration for the record was Victor Hugo's book Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2014which can be noted by the French revolution themes on \"Viva la Vida\", for example.The work of the Beatles is apparently an inspiration throughout the album, starting with orchestration on the title track. The song \"Violet Hill\", with its distorted guitar riffs and bluesy undertones, references the Beatles' album Abbey Road (1969), being named after a street near Abbey Road and borrowing its rhythm from the Beatles. At the 2009 Grammy Awards, when accepting the award for Song of the Year, Will Champion joked: \"I'd like to say, first of all, thank you and sorry to Sir Paul McCartney for blatantly recycling the Sgt. Pepper outfits.\""

        "content": "The artwork for Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was designed by Coldplay and Tappin Gofton; the latter designed the X&Y cover three years earlier. The design style for the album took months to be completed; it was initially developed from a set of large-scale sketches and paintings of expressive typography. Lyrics and song titles were boldly painted across old maps, books, copies of old paintings, newspapers and various sorts of second-hand things. The final work was photographed and some additional typography was later added by computer.Almost all tracks from the album and the Prospekt's March EP have one or more graphic images. On the album's booklet there are nine paintings made by the band. The first is a blue map of Brazil that includes part of the lyrics from \"Glass of Water\" painted in white. However, the image was later reworked and used as the artwork for the \"Lost!\" single cover. The second painting on the booklet illustrates the song \"42\". The image consists of part of the song's composition written in a red background, with a black stripe covering the centre. The design for \"Cemeteries of London\" contains an illustration of London, the song's title and a messy violet background. A portion of the lyrics is used on the top of it. The visual design for \"Reign of Love\" has its lyrics drawn on a green background. In the middle of the booklet, most of the lyrics of the album are shown amidst an unrecognisable object. The artwork for \"Yes\" consists of a ripped heart, and a line from the song, \"Lord lead me not into temptation\". The painting next to the song's artwork contains lyrics from \"Viva la Vida\" painted in black on a blue background. The artwork for \"Death and All His Friends\" was made with scissors and paper. Lyrics for the song appear in the design. The last page in the booklet is simple: a Roman numeral of the number 7 painted in red and green on a yellow background. Some of the paintings were shown on a screen during the Viva la Vida Tour, or used on big balloons inside of the venues.There were three covers for the album. The front cover for the standard edition is a painting by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, entitled Liberty Leading the People, which was slightly altered for the cover by using a white paint brush to draw \"VIVA LA VIDA\". The Prospekt's March Edition cover uses the same words again, but they are bigger and painted in gold on a solid black background. The cover for the Prospekt's March EP included another Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix painting, Battle of Poitiers, and had \"Prospekt's March\" drawn across the painting similarly to how \"Viva la Vida\" was drawn across Liberty Leading the People for the standard album cover. The cover used for the Asian Tour edition and has the word \"VIVA\" painted in red and black stripes against a white background; this same painting was used as the home page for the official Coldplay website for a while, and it was created by the band and painted by the drummer Will Champion on a wall at the Bakery."

On 10 April 2008, a new journal entry appeared on the band's website announcing the track list and release date, as well as hinting at new tracks to be issued before the album's release. \"Violet Hill\" was confirmed as the first single from Viva la Vida, with a release date of 5 May. In May 2008, Coldplay featured in an advertisement for Apple's iTunes with the song \"Viva la Vida\".\nThe band's official website was updated in late April to reveal the official Viva la Vida artwork as well as a free release of the single \"Violet Hill\", which became available for download for one week from 29 April 2008. The album was leaked around 5 June, so the band decided to make the album available to stream via their Myspace profile from 8:30 pm WEST on 6 June. On 25 June 2008, the band became the third band ever to perform on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, performing \"42\" and \"Lost!\". On 27 June at 7:00 am EDT, Coldplay began a live outdoor performance for the Today Show on the streets outside of Rockefeller Plaza, New York. The band performed on the Late Show with David Letterman on 30 June and on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on 17 July.\nIn August 2008, Coldplay announced they would be releasing an EP, Prospekt's March, consisting of unreleased material from the Viva la Vida recording sessions. The album was re-released on 25 November 2008 in a deluxe edition, titled Viva la Vida \u2013 Prospekt's March Edition. It contains tracks from the original album and Prospekt's March.The stage setup for the Viva la Vida Tour consisted of a stripped-down main stage and two catwalks; Coldplay also performed among audience members at the back of venues in a special acoustic set. Instead of a giant video screen on-stage, the band opted for six hanging giant lightbulbs that displayed images and closeups. The band started the tour playing a concert at the Paradiso in the Netherlands, on 5 June 2008, and played their first UK show of the tour at Brixton Academy eleven days later on 16 June. Free shows at Madison Square Garden on 23 June, and they ended the tour in Barcelona."

On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the album has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated, \"They demonstrate a focused concentration throughout this tight album \u2013 it's only 47 minutes yet covers more ground than X&Y and arguably A Rush of Blood to the Head \u2013 that turns Viva la Vida into something quietly satisfying.\" Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly magazine rated the album \"A\u2212\" and called it their best album, while Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, however, wrote a mixed review, explaining: \"Viva la Vida's mild tinkering with the formula represents a failure of imagination: perhaps it's hard to think outside the box when the box is the size of the Las Vegas MGM Grand Garden Arena. Equally, however, there's a genuine conviction about its contents, a huge advance both on its predecessor and their legion of imitators.\" Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that \"Coldplay's desire to unite fans around the world with an entertainment they can all relate to is the band's strength, and a worthy goal. But on Viva la Vida, a record that wants to make strong statements, it's also a weakness. Sometimes, to say what needs to be said, you need to risk pissing people off.\" Melodic magazine's critic Kaj Roth gave the album 4/5 and felt that \"the typical Coldplay trademark is there too with beautiful atmospheric melodies that will embrace the heart\". Spin magazine's critic Mikael Wood said in a positive review of the album, \"For all of Coldplay's experimentation, though, there's no doubting that Viva la Vida, with its sturdy melodies and universal themes \u2013 think love, war and peace \u2013 is an album meant to connect with the masses (arenas have been built for less than the climax of \"Death and All His Friends\"). The band's triumph lies in how exciting they make that prospect seem\". IGN gave the album 9.3/10, while Q said: \"So some habits die hard, but on every other level Viva La Vida [...] is an emphatic success [...], radical in its own measured way but easy to embrace\". Robert Christgau gave it a one-star honourable mention (), saying: \"Applying all his powers, Chris Martin successfully dilutes Radiohead, with \u2014 what else? Pleasant results\".The album won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards. It appeared in several Best Albums of 2008 lists, including New York Post (Number 1), Rolling Stone (Number 7), Q (Number 3), Spin (Number 9), Entertainment Weekly (Number 6), and Billboard (Number 6). Despite giving the album three stars out of five in The Times, Pete Paphides admitted in December 2008 that he was wrong to give it this score and had in fact become his favourite album of the year. Conversely, NME nominated the album for Worst Album at the 2009 NME Awards despite reviewing it with a 8/10 grade."

NYPD detective John McClane was assigned to New Jersey to bring in Matthew Farrell. As McClane arrives, assassins sent by Thomas Gabriel, a hacker and leader of cyberterrorists, attack them, but McClane and Farrell manage to escape.\nOn the way to Washington D.C., Farrell tells McClane he had written an algorithm for Mai Linh to crack a specific security system for white hat purposes. Meanwhile, Gabriel orders his crew of hackers to take over transportation grids and the stock market while nationally broadcasting a threatening message to the U.S. government. Farrell realizes this is a \"fire sale\", a cyber attack designed to disable the nation's infrastructure. As McClane and Farrell are driven to DHS headquarters, Linh, posing as a dispatcher, reroutes them into a helicopter ambush. McClane fends off the attackers and destroys the helicopter.\nMcClane asks Farrell what would be Gabriel's next move, and he deduces Gabriel's next target is the power grid. They drive to a utility superstation in West Virginia. They find the superstation under the control of a team led by Linh. McClane and Farrell kill the team, and McClane kills Linh by locking her into a car that falls from an elevator shaft and explodes.\nWhile Farrell is working on the hub computer to slow the damage, he traces Gabriel and uploads his picture to Bowman. McClane learns that Bowman and Gabriel once worked together for the DOD, and Gabriel was the chief programmer for infrastructural security. He warned the department of weaknesses that made America's network infrastructure vulnerable to cyberwarfare, but he was ignored and his unorthodox methods got him fired, and he is out for revenge. Enraged over Linh's death, Gabriel redirects the natural gas pipelines to the superstation to kill McClane and Farrell, and they barely escape before a massive blackout occurs throughout the Eastern Seaboard.\nMcClane and Farrell then travel by helicopter to the home of super hacker Frederick \"Warlock\" Kaludis in Baltimore. Warlock identifies the piece of code Farrell wrote for Linh as a means to access data at a Social Security Administration building at Woodlawn, Maryland. Doing a traceroute, Warlock locates Gabriel.\nThe Woodlawn building is actually an NSA facility intended to back up the nation's personal and financial records in the event of a cyber attack and was designed by Gabriel himself. The blackout on the FBI triggered a download of financial data to Woodlawn, which Gabriel plans to steal. Meanwhile, Gabriel taps into the connection they made, which reveals the location of McClane's estranged daughter Lucy, whom he kidnaps. McClane and Gabriel then meet - virtually - McClane telling him he will lose.\nMcClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility. Farrell finds the facility's main server and encrypts the data Gabriel's men downloaded before getting captured. Gabriel then takes Farrell and Lucy with him as he flees. McClane pursues them, hijacking their semi mobile base. Accessing the communication system of an F-35B Lightning II, Gabriel orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving, but the jet is destroyed by falling debris. McClane barely survives and sees Gabriel's vehicle pull into a nearby hangar.\nThere, Gabriel demands that Farrell decrypt the financial data. When he refuses, Gabriel shoots him and threatens to kill Lucy. McClane arrives, killing two of Gabriel's men, but he is shot and wounded by Gabriel's last man, Emerson. Gabriel positions himself behind McClane, putting the barrel of the gun in his shoulder wound. McClane then pulls the trigger. The bullet travels through McClane's shoulder and hits Gabriel in the heart, killing him instantly. Farrell then grabs a pistol and kills Emerson as the FBI arrives. Afterward, McClane thanks Farrell for saving Lucy's life, who takes a romantic interest in him."
