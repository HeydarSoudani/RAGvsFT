        "content": "La fille du r\u00e9giment (The Daughter of the Regiment) is an op\u00e9ra comique in two acts by Gaetano Donizetti, set to a French libretto by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bayard. It was first performed on 11 February 1840 by the Paris Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the Salle de la Bourse.\nDonizetti wrote the opera while living in Paris between 1838 and 1840 and preparing a revised version of his then-unperformed Italian opera, Poliuto, as Les martyrs for the Paris Op\u00e9ra. Since Martyrs was delayed, the composer had time to write the music for La fille du r\u00e9giment, his first opera set to a French text, and to stage the French version of Lucia di Lammermoor, Lucie de Lammermoor.\nLa fille du r\u00e9giment quickly became a popular success partly because of the famous aria \"Ah! mes amis, quel jour de f\u00eate!\", which requires the tenor to sing no fewer than eight high Cs \u2013 a frequently sung ninth is not written. La figlia del reggimento, a slightly different Italian-language version (in translation by Calisto Bassi), was adapted to the tastes of the Italian public."

        "content": "La boh\u00e8me ( LAH boh-EM, Italian: [la bo\u02c8\u025bm]) is an opera in four acts, composed by Giacomo Puccini between 1893 and 1895 to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, based on Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de boh\u00e8me (1851) by Henri Murger. The story is set in Paris around 1830 and shows the Bohemian lifestyle (known in French as \"la boh\u00e8me\") of a poor seamstress and her artist friends.\nThe world premiere of La boh\u00e8me was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio, conducted by the 28-year-old Arturo Toscanini. Since then, La boh\u00e8me has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas worldwide.In 1946, 50 years after the opera's premiere, Toscanini conducted a commemorative performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. A recording of the performance was later released by RCA Victor on vinyl record, tape and compact disc. It is the only recording ever made of a Puccini opera by its original conductor.\nLa boh\u00e8me is also known for being the loose inspiration for the Broadway musical Rent by Jonathan Larson."

        "content": "As credited on its title page, the libretto of La boh\u00e8me is based on Henri Murger's 1851 novel, Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de boh\u00e8me, a collection of vignettes portraying young bohemians living in the Latin Quarter of Paris in the 1840s. Although often called a novel, the book has no unified plot. Like the 1849 play drawn from the book by Murger and Th\u00e9odore Barri\u00e8re, the opera's libretto focuses on the relationship between Rodolfo and Mim\u00ec, ending with her death. Also like the play, the libretto combines two characters from the novel, Mim\u00ec and Francine, into the single character of Mim\u00ec. Early in the composition stage Puccini was in dispute with the composer Ruggero Leoncavallo, who said that he had offered Puccini a completed libretto and felt that Puccini should defer to him. Puccini responded that he had had no idea of Leoncavallo's interest and that having been working on his own version for some time, he felt that he could not oblige him by abandoning the opera. Leoncavallo completed his own version in which Marcello was sung by a tenor and Rodolfo by a baritone. It was not as successful as Puccini's and is now rarely performed.Much of the libretto is original. Major sections of acts two and three are the librettists' invention, with only a few passing references to incidents and characters in Murger. Most of acts one and four follow the book, piecing together episodes from various chapters. The final scenes in acts one and four\u2014the scenes with Rodolfo and Mim\u00ec\u2014resemble both the play and the book. The story of their meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the book, in which the two lovers living in the garret are not Rodolphe and Mim\u00ec at all, but rather Jacques and Francine. The story of Mim\u00ec's death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the book, one relating Francine's death and the other relating Mim\u00ec's.The published libretto includes a note from the librettists briefly discussing their adaptation. Without mentioning the play directly, they defend their conflation of Francine and Mim\u00ec into a single character: \"Chi pu\u00f2 non confondere nel delicato profilo di una sola donna quelli di Mim\u00ec e di Francine?\" (\"Who cannot confuse in the delicate profile of one woman the personality both of Mim\u00ec and of Francine?\"). At the time, the book was in the public domain, Murger having died without heirs, but rights to the play were still controlled by Barri\u00e8re's heirs."

The 1959 recording conducted by Tullio Serafin with Renata Tebaldi as Mim\u00ec and Carlo Bergonzi was included in the soundtrack of the 1987 movie Moonstruck.\nThe earliest commercially released full-length recording was probably that recorded in February 1917 and released on HMV's Italian label La Voce del Padrone. Carlo Sabajno conducted the La Scala Orchestra and Chorus with Gemma Bosini and Reno Andreini as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo. One of the most recent is the 2008 Deutsche Grammophon release conducted by Bertrand de Billy with Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villaz\u00f3n as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo.There are several recordings with conductors closely associated with Puccini. In the 1946 RCA Victor recording, Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the world premiere of the opera, conducts the NBC Symphony Orchestra with Jan Peerce as Rodolfo and Licia Albanese as Mim\u00ec. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor. Thomas Beecham, who worked closely with Puccini when preparing a 1920 production of La boh\u00e8me in London, conducted a performance of the opera in English released by Columbia Records in 1936 with Lisa Perli as Mim\u00ec and Heddle Nash as Rodolfo. Beecham also conducts on the 1956 RCA Victor recording with Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles and Jussi Bj\u00f6rling as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo.\nAlthough the vast majority of recordings are in the original Italian, the opera has been recorded in several other languages. These include: a recording in French conducted by Erasmo Ghiglia with Ren\u00e9e Doria and Alain Vanzo as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo (1960); a recording in German with Richard Kraus conducting the Deutsche Oper Berlin Orchestra and Chorus with Trude Eipperle and Fritz Wunderlich as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo (1956); and the 1998 release on the Chandos Opera in English label with David Parry conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra and Cynthia Haymon and Dennis O'Neill as Mim\u00ec and Rodolfo.\nEnrico Caruso, who was closely associated with the role of Rodolfo, recorded the famous aria \"Che gelida manina\" in 1906. This aria has been recorded by nearly 500 tenors in at least seven different languages between 1900 and 1980. In 1981 the A.N.N.A. Record Company released a six LP set with 101 different tenors singing the aria."

It was then discovered that the librettists had prepared an act which Puccini decided not to use in his composition. It is noteworthy for explaining Rodolfo's jealous remarks to Marcello in act 3.\nThe \"missing act\" is located in the timeline between the Caf\u00e9 Momus scene and act 3 and describes an open-air party at Musetta's dwelling. Her protector has refused to pay further rent out of jealous feelings, and Musetta's furniture is moved into the courtyard to be auctioned off the following morning. The four Bohemians find in this an excuse for a party and arrange for wine and an orchestra. Musetta gives Mim\u00ec a beautiful gown to wear and introduces her to a Viscount. The pair dances a quadrille in the courtyard, which moves Rodolfo to jealousy. This explains his act 3 reference to the \"moscardino di Viscontino\" (young fop of a Viscount). As dawn approaches, furniture dealers gradually remove pieces for the morning auction.\nRuggero Leoncavallo composed an opera based the same source material, also titled La boh\u00e8me; this episode is included in Leoncavallo's treatment which premiered in 1897."

Here the lovers, Roger and Mimi, are faced with AIDS and progress through the action with songs such as \"Light My Candle\", which have direct reference to La boh\u00e8me. Many of the character names are retained or are similar (e.g. the character Angel is given the surname \"Schunard\"), and at another point in the play, Roger's roommate and best friend Mark makes a wry reference to \"Musetta's Waltz\", which is a recurring theme throughout the first act and is played at the end of the second act.\nThe opera was adapted into a 1983 short story by the novelist V.

The libretto was originally prepared by Joseph Sonnleithner from the French of Jean-Nicolas Bouilly. The opera premiered at Vienna's Theater an der Wien on 20 November 1805. The following year, Beethoven's friend Stephan von Breuning rewrote the libretto, shortening the work from three acts to two. After further work on the libretto by Georg Friedrich Treitschke, a final version was performed at the K\u00e4rntnertortheater on 23 May 1814. As these libretto revisions were going on, Beethoven was also revising some of the music. By convention, only the final version is called Fidelio, and the others are referred to as Leonore.\nThe libretto tells how Leonore, disguised as a prison guard named \"Fidelio\", rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison. Bouilly's scenario fits Beethoven's aesthetic and political outlook: a story of personal sacrifice, heroism, and eventual triumph. With its underlying struggle for liberty and justice mirroring contemporary political movements in Europe, such topics are typical of Beethoven's \"middle period\". Notable moments in the opera include the \"Prisoners' Chorus\" (O welche Lust\u2014\"O what a joy\"), an ode to freedom sung by a chorus of political prisoners, Florestan's vision of Leonore come as an angel to rescue him, and the scene in which the rescue finally takes place. The finale celebrates Leonore's bravery with alternating contributions of soloists and chorus."

        "content": "Fidelio had a long and complicated history of composition. Portions of the score were originally written for an earlier, never-completed opera. Beethoven revised Fidelio three times; the work caused Beethoven so much vexation that he vowed never to compose another opera.\nThe distant origin of Fidelio dates from 1803, when the librettist and impresario Emanuel Schikaneder worked out a contract with Beethoven to write an opera. The contract included free lodging for Beethoven in the apartment complex that was part of Schikaneder's large suburban theater, the Theater an der Wien. Beethoven was to set a new libretto by Schikaneder, entitled Vestas Feuer; however, this libretto was not to Beethoven's liking. He spent about a month composing music for it, then abandoned it when the libretto for Fidelio came to his attention.\nThe time Beethoven spent on Vestas Feuer was not entirely wasted, as two important numbers from Fidelio, Pizarro's \"'Ha! Welch' ein Augenblick!\" and the duet \"O namenlose Freude\" for Leonore and Florestan, both originated as music for Vestas Feuer. Beethoven continued to live at the Theater an der Wien for some time after he had abandoned Vestas Feuer for Fidelio, and was eventually freed from his obligations to Schikaneder after the latter was fired from his post as theater director in 1804.\n\nFidelio itself, which Beethoven began in 1804 immediately after giving up on Vestas Feuer, was first performed in 1805 and was extensively revised by the composer for subsequent performances in 1806 and 1814. Although Beethoven used the title Leonore, oder Der Triumph der ehelichen Liebe (\"Leonore, or The Triumph of Married Love\"), the 1805 performances were billed as Fidelio at the theatre's insistence, to avoid confusion with Pierre Gaveaux's L\u00e9onore, ou L'amour conjugal (1798) and Ferdinando Paer's Leonora (1804), both of which were based on the same source material as Beethoven's opera (and in fact Beethoven is known to have owned a copy of Paer's score). Beethoven published the 1806 libretto and, in 1810, a vocal score under the title Leonore. The current convention is to use the name Leonore for both the 1805 (three-act) and 1806 (two-act) versions and Fidelio only for the final 1814 revision.\nThe first version, with a three-act German libretto adapted by Joseph Sonnleithner from the French of Jean-Nicolas Bouilly, premiered at the Theater an der Wien on 20 November 1805, with additional performances the following two nights. The success of these performances was hindered by the fact that Vienna was under French military occupation, and most of the audience were French military officers who had little interest in German opera.\nAfter this premiere, Beethoven's friends suggested he revise and shorten the opera into just two acts, and he did so with the help of his close friend, Stephan von Breuning. The composer also wrote a new overture (now known as \"Leonore No.3\"; see below). In this form, the opera was first performed on 29 March and 10 April 1806, with greater success. Further performances were prevented by a disagreement between Beethoven and the theatre management.\nIn 1814, Beethoven revised his opera yet again, with additional work on the libretto by Georg Friedrich Treitschke. This version was first performed at the K\u00e4rntnertortheater on 23 May 1814, again under the title Fidelio. The 17-year-old Franz Schubert was in the audience, having sold his school books to obtain a ticket. The increasingly deaf Beethoven conducted the performance, \"assisted\" by Michael Umlauf, who later performed the same task for Beethoven at the premiere of the Ninth Symphony. The role of Pizarro was taken by Johann Michael Vogl, who later became known for his collaborations with Schubert. This version of the opera was a great success, and Fidelio has been part of the operatic repertory ever since.\nAlthough critics have noted the similarity in plot with Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice (1762) \u2014 another underground rescue mission in which the protagonist must control, or conceal, his emotions in order to retrieve his spouse \u2014 it is not known whether Beethoven or any of the librettists had this in mind while constructing the opera.\nNo other work of Beethoven's caused him so much frustration and disappointment. He found the difficulties posed by writing and producing an opera so disagreeable, he vowed never to compose another. In a letter to Treitschke he said, \"I assure you, dear Treitschke, that this opera will win me a martyr's crown. You have by your co-operation saved what is best from the shipwreck. For all this I shall be eternally grateful to you.\"The full score was not published until 1826, and all three versions are known as Beethoven's Opus 72.The first performance outside Vienna took place in Prague on 21 November 1814, with a revival in Vienna on 3 November 1822. In its two-act version, the opera was staged in London on 18 May 1832 at the King's Theatre, and in New York on 9 September 1839 at the Park Theatre."

Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra, featuring soloists Rose Bampton, Jan Peerce and Eleanor Steber, with the performance divided into two consecutive broadcasts. The recording of the opera was later issued by RCA Victor on LP and CD.Fidelio was the first opera performed in Berlin after the end of World War II, with the Deutsche Oper staging it under the baton of Robert Heger at the only undamaged theatre, the Theater des Westens, in September 1945. At the time, Thomas Mann remarked: \"What amount of apathy was needed [by musicians and audiences] to listen to Fidelio in Himmler's Germany without covering their faces and rushing out of the hall!\"Not long after the end of World War II and the fall of Nazism, conductor Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler remarked in Salzburg in 1948:\n\n[T]he conjugal love of Leonore appears, to the modern individual armed with realism and psychology, irremediably abstract and theoretical.... Now that political events in Germany have restored to the concepts of human dignity and liberty their original significance, this is the opera which, thanks to the music of Beethoven, gives us comfort and courage.... Certainly, Fidelio is not an opera in the sense we are used to, nor is Beethoven a musician for the theater, or a dramaturgist. He is quite a bit more, a whole musician, and beyond that, a saint and a visionary. That which disturbs us is not a material effect, nor the fact of the 'imprisonment'; any film could create the same effect. No, it is the music, it is Beethoven himself. It is this 'nostalgia of liberty' he feels, or better, makes us feel; this is what moves us to tears. His Fidelio has more of the Mass than of the Opera to it; the sentiments it expresses come from the sphere of the sacred, and preach a 'religion of humanity' which we never found so beautiful or necessary as we do today, after all we have lived through. Herein lies the singular power of this unique opera.... Independent of any historical consideration ... the flaming message of Fidelio touches deeply.\nWe realize that for us Europeans, as for all men, this music will always represent an appeal to our conscience.\n\nOn 5 November 1955, the Vienna State Opera was re-opened with Fidelio, conducted by Karl B\u00f6hm. This performance was the first live television broadcast by ORF at a time when there were about 800 television sets in Austria.\nThe first night of Fidelio at the Semperoper in Dresden on 7 October 1989 on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the DDR (East Germany) coincided with violent demonstrations at the city's main train station. The applause after the \"Prisoners' Chorus\" interrupted the performance for considerable time, and the production by Christine Mielitz had the chorus appear in normal street clothes at the end, signifying their role as representatives of the audience. Four weeks later, on 9 November 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled the end of East Germany's regime."

        "content": "Beethoven struggled to produce an appropriate overture for Fidelio, and ultimately went through four versions. His first attempt, for the 1805 premiere, is believed to have been the overture now known as \"Leonore No. 2\" in C major. Beethoven then focused this version for the performances of 1806, creating \"Leonore No. 3\", also in C major. The latter is considered by many listeners as the greatest of the four overtures, but as an intensely dramatic, full-scale symphonic movement it had the effect of overwhelming the (rather light) initial scenes of the opera. Beethoven accordingly experimented with cutting it back somewhat, for a planned 1808 performance in Prague; this is believed to be the version now called \"Leonore No. 1\". Finally, for the 1814 revival Beethoven began anew, and with fresh musical material wrote what is now known as the Fidelio overture, in E major. As this somewhat lighter overture seems to work best of the four as a start to the opera, Beethoven's final intentions are generally respected in contemporary productions.\nWhile some believe that Gustav Mahler introduced the practice of performing \"Leonore No. 3\" between the two scenes of the second act, something which was common until the middle of the twentieth century, David Cairns states that it goes back to the middle of the 19th century and was therefore prior to Mahler. In this location, it acts as a kind of musical reprise of the rescue scene that has just taken place."

The story is based loosely on the life of the French poet Andr\u00e9 Ch\u00e9nier (1762\u20131794), who was executed during the French Revolution. The character Carlo G\u00e9rard is partly based on Jean-Lambert Tallien, a leading figure in the Revolution. It remains popular with audiences, though less frequently performed than in the first half of the 20th century. One reason for its survival in the repertoire is the lyrical-dramatic music provided by Giordano for the tenor lead, which gives a talented singer opportunities to demonstrate his skills and flaunt his voice. Giuseppe Borgatti's triumph in the title role at the first performance immediately propelled him to the front rank of Italian opera singers. He went on to become Italy's greatest Wagnerian tenor, rather than a verismo-opera specialist."

Rodolfo Ferrari conducted.\nOther notable first performances include those in New York City at the Academy of Music on 13 November 1896; in Hamburg on 3 February 1897 under the baton of Gustav Mahler; and in London's Camden Theatre on 16 April 1903 (sung in English).\nApart from Borgatti, famous Ch\u00e9niers in the period between the opera's premiere and the outbreak of World War II included Francesco Tamagno (who studied the work with Giordano), Bernardo de Muro, Giovanni Zenatello, Giovanni Martinelli, Aureliano Pertile, Francesco Merli, Beniamino Gigli, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi and Antonio Cortis. Enrico Caruso also gave a few performances as Ch\u00e9nier in London in 1907. All of these tenors with the exception of Borgatti have left 78-rpm recordings of one or more of the part's showpiece solos.\nPost-war, Franco Corelli, Richard Tucker and Mario Del Monaco were the most famous interpreters of the title role during the 1950s and 1960s, while Pl\u00e1cido Domingo became its foremost interpreter among the next generation of tenors, although Domingo's contemporary Luciano Pavarotti also sang and recorded the work. The Wagnerian tenor Ben Heppner tackled the role in New York City at a 2007 Metropolitan Opera revival with mixed success; his voice was impressively powerful but did not fit the style, critics alleged.The Keith Warner-directed production was performed in 2011 and 2012 in Bregenz, Austria, under the name of \"Andr\u00e9 Ch\u00e9nier\", using an almost 78-foot high statue of a dying Jean-Paul Marat sinking in the water, an ode to the 1793 Jacques-Louis David painting, The Death of Marat, which depicts the murdered revolutionary slumped over in his bathtub.In addition to four arias for the principal tenor (\"Un d\u00ec all'azzurro spazio\"; \"Io non amato ancor\"; \"Si, fui soldato\"; \"Come un bel d\u00ec di maggio\"), the opera contains a well-known aria (\"La mamma morta\") for the soprano heroine, which was featured in the film Philadelphia (the Maria Callas version is used on the soundtrack.) Also worth noting are the baritone's expressive monologue \"Nemico della patria\" and the final, rousing, soprano\u2013tenor duet for the two leads as they prepare to face the guillotine (\"Vicino a te\")."

It was Verdi's penultimate opera, first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, on 5 February 1887.\nThe composer was reluctant to write anything new after the success of Aida in 1871, and he retreated into retirement. It took his Milan publisher Giulio Ricordi the next ten years, first to encourage the revision of Verdi's 1857 Simon Boccanegra by introducing Boito as librettist and then to begin the arduous process of persuading and cajoling Verdi to see Boito's completed libretto for Otello in July/August 1881. However, the process of writing the first drafts of the libretto and the years of their revision, with Verdi all along not promising anything, dragged on. It wasn't until 1884, five years after the first drafts of the libretto, that composition began, with most of the work finishing in late 1885. When it finally premiered in Milan on 5 February 1887, it proved to be a resounding success, and further stagings of Otello soon followed at leading theatres throughout Europe and America."

The composer chose Marlowe's morality play rather than Goethe's drama as the basis of the composition. He wrote his own English-language libretto, inspired also by Caligula, Shakespeare, William Blake, Gertrude Stein, and Al Capone. Faustus has been described as a work of ideas rather than actions.Dusapin's opera was premiered on 21 January 2006 at the Berlin State Opera, conducted by Michael Boder and staged by Peter Mussbach with Georg Nigl (Faustus), Hanno M\u00fcller-Brachmann (Mephistopheles), Robert W\u00f6rle (Sly), Jaco Huijpen (Togod), Caroline Stein (Angel) in the lead roles.

In the orchestra, long chords contrast to short eruptions (\"explosionsartigen Ausbr\u00fcchen\").

        "content": "During his student days in Milan, Verdi began the process of making connections to the world of music in that city which were to stand him in good stead. These included an introduction by his teacher Lavigna to an amateur choral group, the Societ\u00e0 Filarmonica, where he functioned as rehearsal director and continuo player for Haydn's The Creation in 1834, as well as conducting Rossini's La cenerentola himself the following year. 1836 saw his involvement in an April concert celebrating Emperor Ferdinand's birthday; for this he wrote a cantata in the Emperor's honour which received some praise.But it was after his return to his hometown of Busseto in 1835 to become director of the music school with a three-year contract that Verdi took advantage of the connection he had made to the Filarmonica's director, Pietro Massini. In a series of letters from 1835 to 1837 he informed him about the progress towards writing his first opera using a libretto supplied by Massini which had been written by Antonio Piazza, a Milanese \"journalist and man of letters\". By then it had been given the title of Rocester and the young composer expressed hopes of a production in Parma.However, Parma was not interested in new works and so approaches were made to Milan.  Whether Rocester actually became the basis for Oberto when Verdi was able to return to Milan in February 1839 after fulfilling two and a half years of his contract in Busseto is subject to some disagreement amongst scholars.  How much of Rocester remained visible in Oberto is discussed by Roger Parker, who does suggest that \"in this shape-shifting tendency, the opera was, of course, very much of its time.\"In his recollections in 1881 (quoted in Budden) following his return to Milan from Busseto in 1838, Verdi describes how he was invited to meet the La Scala impresario, Bartolomeo Merelli, who had heard a conversation about the music of the opera between soprano Giuseppina Strepponi and Giorgio Ronconi in which she praised it.  Merelli then offered to put on Oberto during the 1839 season and, after its premiere, Oberto was given a respectable 13 additional performances."

There is an abundant, perhaps a too abundant wealth of melody. In some passages where the words demand energy and passion the vocal line is languid and monotonous.\" The paper then goes on to praise two arias and a quartet in the second act, a judgment shared by the periodical Figaro which, incidentally, advised the composer to make a further study of the classics. As a matter of fact, the quartet in question may be described as an afterthought, Merelli himself having suggested it when Verdi was making certain alterations in the opera to meet the requirements of the new cast.Julian Budden comments on the performance reviews of the time, especially one which indicates that Verdi's music was not inspired by Donizetti, Bellini, Mercadante nor Rossini, and he states \"in detail it owes a little to all of them. But what finally emerges is often subtly different, with a flavour of its own. Above all, it has that ultra-Verdian quality of gathering momentum as it proceeds.\""

Ignazio Marini, the bass who sang the title role, was \"a performer of impressive vocal and dramatic range, for whom Verdi would later write the title role of Attila, notes Parker.  He continues by adding that \"la Marini\" was undoubtedly grateful to Verdi in that it was she who quite probably helped to secure most of the revivals of the opera during the following few years where she appeared as Leonora in four of the five of them.Agreeing with Parker that the support given to \"la Marini\" helped with stagings of further performances from 1840 to 1843 (and, therefore, allowed the composer the opportunity to make additions and changes as these performances were played in different cities and with different singers).For the 1840 revival after the failure of Un giorno di regno, the role of Cuniza was sung by Luigia Abbadia and it was for her that Verdi wrote an entrance aria in act 1 and a duet for Cuniza and Riccardo also in act 1, the latter described as being \"full of that intensely condensed melodic expressiveness that will characterise the best of his early music.  It is on quite a different level of invention from the rest of Oberto.Toye notes that, in spite of its weaknesses, the opera:\n\nstill compels attention.  For instance, the energy of the finale of the first act, at times surprisingly classical in feeling, is remarkable; and the same is true to an even greater extent of the quartet in the second act, certainly the best music in the opera and a fine piece of ensemble writing in which, towards the end, the curious will find an amusing reminiscence of Schubert['s] \"Marche Militaire.\""

Messiaen changed his mind when Liebermann arranged that he be a guest at a dinner at the Elys\u00e9e Palace, hosted by then French President Georges Pompidou; at the end of the dinner Pompidou said: \"Messiaen, you will write an opera for the Op\u00e9ra de Paris!\". In searching for subject matter, Messiaen pondered dramatizing either Christ's Passion or his Resurrection. Feeling unworthy of either subject, he eventually chose to dramatize the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, which paralleled Christ's chastity, humility, poverty, and suffering. Messiaen commented that Francis's life \"resembled Christ's life the most\" and that Francis, like Christ, was \"a friend of the birds\".\nThe process of writing the opera took its toll on the composer. Initially, Messiaen made rapid progress as the opera became the sole object of his musical attention. In search of inspiration, he had traveled to Italy, where he examined paintings and frescoes and paid his respects at the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi. \nBy 1977, he contacted the general manager of the Paris National Opera to say he was ready to play through an unorchestrated version of the opera. Messiaen could not envisage orchestrating the opera by 1980. Adding to the pressure on Messiaen was a leak on the radio that he was writing an opera about Saint Francis. This revelation transgressed Messiaen's normal practice of secrecy when composing.\nMessiaen appealed for a deadline extension in 1979. The new date was agreed to be 1983; however, Messiaen's health was beginning to deteriorate. In 1981 he had several periods of ill-health, and Messiaen once again doubted that he would finish according to plan. Messiaen began to suffer from depression, and by December 1981 he felt unable to go on. However, his doctor advised him to take daily walks to increase his well-being and he began to attend evening mass at the Sacre Coeur. This encouraged Messiaen to go on to complete the work. Completing it had left its mark on him, and he was convinced it would be his last composition."

It opened on 14 March 1885, in London, where it ran at the Savoy Theatre for 672 performances, the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time. By the end of 1885, it was estimated that, in Europe and America, at least 150 companies were producing the opera.The Mikado is the most internationally successful Savoy opera and has been especially popular with amateur and school productions. The work has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history. The Mikado is a satire of late 19th century British institutions, society and politics. By setting the opera in a fantasy Japan, an exotic locale far away from contemporary Britain, Gilbert was able to satirise British politics more freely and soften the impact of his criticisms of British social institutions, in a similar way that he used other \"foreign\" settings in Princess Ida, The Gondoliers, Utopia, Limited and The Grand Duke. Nevertheless, some 21st-century productions of the opera in the United States have drawn criticism for promoting stereotypes of East Asians."

        "content": "Gilbert and Sullivan's opera immediately preceding The Mikado was Princess Ida (1884), which ran for nine months, a short duration by Savoy opera standards. When ticket sales for Princess Ida showed early signs of flagging, the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte realised that, for the first time since 1877, no new Gilbert and Sullivan work would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, Carte gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required within six months. Sullivan's close friend, the conductor Frederic Clay, had suffered a serious stroke in December 1883 that effectively ended his career.  Reflecting on this, on his own precarious health, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, Sullivan replied to Carte that \"it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself\". Gilbert, who had already started work on a new libretto in which people fall in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge, was surprised to hear of Sullivan's hesitation. He wrote to Sullivan asking him to reconsider, but the composer replied on 2 April 1884 that he had \"come to the end of my tether\" with the operas:\n\n...I have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one [syllable] should be lost.... I should like to set a story of human interest & probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous (not serious) situation, & where, if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character.\nGilbert wrote that Sullivan's letter caused him \"considerable pain\". Sullivan responded that he could not set the \"lozenge plot\", stating that it was too similar to the plot of their 1877 opera The Sorcerer. As April 1884 wore on, Gilbert tried to modify his plot, but he could not satisfy Sullivan. The parties were at a stalemate, and Gilbert wrote, \"And so ends a musical & literary association of seven years' standing \u2013 an association of exceptional reputation \u2013 an association unequaled in its monetary results, and hitherto undisturbed by a single jarring or discordant element.\" But by 8 May 1884, Gilbert was ready to back down, writing: \"am I to understand that if I construct another plot in which no supernatural element occurs, you will undertake to set it? ... a consistent plot, free from anachronisms, constructed in perfect good faith & to the best of my ability.\" The stalemate was broken, and on 20 May, Gilbert sent Sullivan a sketch of the plot to The Mikado. It would take another ten months for The Mikado to reach the stage. A revised version of The Sorcerer coupled with their one-act piece Trial by Jury (1875) played at the Savoy while Carte and their audiences awaited their next work. Gilbert eventually found a place for his \"lozenge plot\" in The Mountebanks, written with Alfred Cellier in 1892.\n\nIn 1914, Cellier and Bridgeman first recorded the familiar story of how Gilbert found his inspiration:\n\nGilbert, having determined to leave his own country alone for a while, sought elsewhere for a subject suitable to his peculiar humour. A trifling accident inspired him with an idea. One day an old Japanese sword that, for years, had been hanging on the wall of his study, fell from its place. This incident directed his attention to Japan. Just at that time a company of Japanese had arrived in England and set up a little village of their own in Knightsbridge.\nThe story is an appealing one, but it is largely fictional. Gilbert was interviewed twice about his inspiration for The Mikado. In both interviews the sword was mentioned, and in one of them he said it was the inspiration for the opera, though he never said the sword had fallen. What puts the entire story in doubt is Cellier and Bridgeman's error concerning the Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge: it did not open until 10 January 1885, almost two months after Gilbert had already completed Act I. Gilbert scholar Brian Jones, in his article \"The Sword that Never Fell\", notes that \"the further removed in time the writer is from the incident, the more graphically it is recalled.\" Leslie Baily, for instance, told it this way in 1952:\n\nA day or so later Gilbert was striding up and down his library in the new house at Harrington Gardens, fuming at the impasse, when a huge Japanese sword decorating the wall fell with a clatter to the floor. Gilbert picked it up. His perambulations stopped. 'It suggested the broad idea,' as he said later. His journalistic mind, always quick to seize on topicalities, turned to a Japanese Exhibition which had recently been opened in the neighbourhood. Gilbert had seen the little Japanese men and women from the Exhibition shuffling in their exotic robes through the streets of Knightsbridge. Now he sat at his writing desk and picked up the quill pen. He began making notes in his plot-book.\nThe story was dramatised in more or less this form in the 1999 film Topsy-Turvy. But although the 1885\u201387 Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge had not opened when Gilbert conceived of The Mikado, European trade with Japan had increased in recent decades, and an English craze for all things Japanese had built through the 1860s and 1870s. This made the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert told a journalist, \"I cannot give you a good reason for our ... piece being laid in Japan. It ... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is ... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public.\"In an 1885 interview with the New-York Daily Tribune, Gilbert said that the short stature of Leonora Braham, Jessie Bond and Sybil Grey \"suggested the advisability of grouping them as three Japanese school-girls\", the opera's \"three little maids\". He also recounted that a young Japanese lady, a tea server at the Japanese village, came to rehearsals to coach the three little maids in Japanese dance. On 12 February 1885, one month before The Mikado opened, The Illustrated London News wrote about the opening of the Japanese village noting, among other things, that \"the graceful, fantastic dancing featured ... three little maids!\" In the Tribune interview, Gilbert also related that he and Sullivan had decided to cut the only solo sung by the opera's title character (who appears only in Act II, played by Savoy veteran Richard Temple), but that members of the company and others who had witnessed the dress rehearsal \"came to us in a body and begged us to restore the excised 'number'\"."

        "content": "The Mikado had the longest original run of the Savoy Operas. It also had the quickest revival: after Gilbert and Sullivan's next work, Ruddigore, closed relatively quickly, three operas were revived to fill the interregnum until The Yeomen of the Guard was ready, including The Mikado, just 17 months after its first run closed. On 4 September 1891, D'Oyly Carte's touring \"C\" company gave a Royal Command Performance of The Mikado at Balmoral Castle before Queen Victoria and the Royal Family. The original set design was by Hawes Craven, with men's costumes by C. Wilhelm. The first provincial production of The Mikado opened on 27 July 1885 in Brighton, with several members of that company leaving in August to present the first authorised American production in New York. From then on, The Mikado was a constant presence on tour. From 1885 until the company's closure in 1982, there was no year in which a D'Oyly Carte company (or several of them) was not presenting it.The Mikado was revived again while The Grand Duke was in preparation. When it became clear that that opera was not a success, The Mikado was given at matinees, and the revival continued when The Grand Duke closed after just three months. In 1906\u201307, Helen Carte, the widow of Richard D'Oyly Carte, mounted a repertory season at the Savoy, but The Mikado was not performed, as it was thought that visiting Japanese royalty might be offended by it. It was included, however, in Mrs. Carte's second repertory season, in 1908\u201309. New costume designs were created by Charles Ricketts for the 1926 season and were used until 1982. Peter Goffin designed new sets in 1952.\nIn America, as had happened with H.M.S. Pinafore, the first productions were unauthorised, but once D'Oyly Carte's American production opened in August 1885, it was a success, earning record profits, and Carte formed several companies to tour the show in North America. Burlesque and parody productions, including political parodies, were mounted. More than 150 unauthorised versions cropped up, and, as had been the case with Pinafore, Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan could do nothing to prevent them or to capture any license fees, since there was no international copyright treaty at the time. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried various techniques for gaining an American copyright that would prevent unauthorised productions. The U.S. courts held, however, that the act of publication made the opera freely available for production by anyone. In Australia, The Mikado's first authorised performance was on 14 November 1885 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, produced by J. C. Williamson. During 1886, Carte was touring five Mikado companies in North America.Carte toured the opera in 1886 and again in 1887 in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. In September 1886 Vienna's leading critic, Eduard Hanslick, wrote that the opera's \"unparalleled success\" was attributable not only to the libretto and the music, but also to \"the wholly original stage performance, unique of its kind, by Mr D'Oyly Carte's artists... riveting the eye and ear with its exotic allurement.\" Authorised productions were also seen in France, Holland, Hungary, Spain, Belgium, Scandinavia, Russia and elsewhere. Thousands of amateur productions have been mounted throughout the English-speaking world and beyond since the 1880s. One production during World War I was given in the Ruhleben internment camp in Germany.After the Gilbert copyrights expired in 1962, the Sadler's Wells Opera mounted the first non-D'Oyly Carte professional production in England, with Clive Revill as Ko-Ko. Among the many professional revivals since then was an English National Opera production in 1986, with Eric Idle as Ko-Ko and Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum, directed by Jonathan Miller. This production, which has been revived numerous times over three decades, is set in a swanky 1920s English seaside hotel, with sets and costumes in black and white \"as an homage to the Marx Brothers, No\u00ebl Coward, and Busby Berkeley\". Canada's Stratford Festival has produced The Mikado several times, first in 1963 and again in 1982 (revived in 1983 and 1984) and in 1993.The following table shows the history of the D'Oyly Carte productions in Gilbert's lifetime:"

Some of the best-known of these cultural influences are described below.\nQuotes from The Mikado were used in letters to the police by the Zodiac Killer, who murdered at least five people in the San Francisco Bay area in 1968 and 1969. A second-season (1998) episode of the TV show Millennium, titled \"The Mikado\", is based on the Zodiac case. The Mikado is parodied in Sumo of the Opera, which credits Sullivan as the composer of most of its songs. The detective novel Death at the Opera (1934) by Gladys Mitchell is set against a background of a production of The Mikado. In 2007 the Asian American theatre company Lodestone Theatre Ensemble produced The Mikado Project, an original play by Doris Baizley and Ken Narasaki. It was a deconstruction of the opera premised on a fictional Asian American theatre company attempting to raise funds, while grappling with perceived racism in productions of The Mikado, by producing a revisionist version of the opera. This was adapted as a film in 2010.\nFilm and television references to The Mikado include the climax of the 1978 film Foul Play, which takes place during a performance of The Mikado. In the 2010 episode \"Robots Versus Wrestlers\" of the TV sitcom How I Met Your Mother, at a high-society party, Marshall strikes an antique Chinese gong. The host rebukes him: \"Young man, that gong is a 500-year-old relic that hasn't been struck since W. S. Gilbert hit it at the London premiere of The Mikado in 1885!\" Marshall quips, \"His wife's a 500-year-old relic that hasn't been struck since W. S. Gilbert hit it at the London premiere\".\n\"The Mikado\" is a villainous vigilante in the comic book superhero series The Question, by Denny O'Neil and Denys Cowan. He dons a Japanese mask and kills malefactors in appropriate ways \u2013 letting \"the punishment fit the crime\". In 1888, Ed J. Smith wrote a stage parody of The Mikado called The Capitalist; or, The City of Fort Worth to encourage capital investment in Fort Worth, Texas. The 2-8-2 railroad locomotive was renamed \"The Mikado\" when a U.S. production run of these locomotives was shipped to Japan in 1893. Fans even decorated Mikado rooms in their homes, Mikado clubs were established across America, and in 1886 a Michigan town took the name of the opera."

        "content": "According to contemporary accounts, Hulak-Artemovsky based the libretto on a story by the historian Mykola Kostomarov. The composer wrote nearly all of libretto, although some poetic phrasings are attributed to his good friend, the journalist V. Sykevych.\nThe story depicts the events following the destruction of the island fortress of Zaporizhian Sich, the historic stronghold of the Ukrainian Cossacks on the Dnieper River. Although historically this destruction was ordered by the Russian Empress Catherine II in 1775, for unknown reasons the composer chose to set the action in 1772. To tell the story of the freedom-loving Zaporozhian Cossacks of Ukraine, who had fought against the Russian Empire, Hulak-Artemovsky deliberately set the story in Turkish lands with the Cossacks fighting for the Sultan. This change of locale helped the work get past the Tsar's censors, who normally banned stories about Ukrainian Cossacks.The orchestral score was completed in the autumn of 1862 by Konstantin Lyadov, (father of Anatoly Lyadov), who developed it under the guidance of Hulak-Artemovsky. Hulak-Artemovsky had composed the original piano score and written the libretto (in Russian), no later than 12 July of that year (as the earliest known manuscript bears that date). The libretto and score were first published in 1866 in St Petersburg, by the firm of F. Stelovsky.\nIn 1902, the Ukrainian composer Oleksandr Horily wrote the aria Prylyn', prylyn (Ukrainian: \u041fp\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044c, \u043fp\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044c \u2013 \"Come, come\"), when arranging the comic opera for Mykola Sadovsky's theatrical troupe. The aria essentially extended the vocal range of the character Oksana, who had previously been played by mezzo-sopranos; this aria is intended for a soprano.\nAfter 1898, the original role of Prokop Teren (Ukrainian: \u041fpo\u043ao\u043f Tepe\u043d), a rival of Andriy for the affections of Oksana, was eliminated (although in Moscow, the role was performed up until 1915)."

The plot revolves around a chance encounter between Ivan Karas, an old Dnieper Cossack and the Turkish Sultan travelling incognito, resulting in permission for all the \"Cossacks beyond the Danube\" to resettle on Imperial Russian land, back in Ukraine."

It was from there that he wrote the music and traveled to Naples for rehearsals.  The first performance was given on 8 December 1849.\nThis was Verdi's 15th opera (counting J\u00e9rusalem, the French translation and revision of I Lombardi alla prima crociata), and it is regarded as the beginning of the composer's \"middle period\"."

        "content": "In August 1848, Verdi had written to the Naples opera house cancelling his contract of three years previous, in which he had agreed to write an opera for them.  However, the management held him to it by threatening his librettist for failing to provide a libretto, and Verdi relented, encouraging Cammarano to develop \"a brief drama with plenty of interest, action and above all feeling \u2013 which would make it easier to set to music\"In Verdi's mind, he had the perfect subject, to be based on the novel L'assedio di Firenze (\"The Siege of Florence\") by Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, which glorified the life of the 16th Century Florentine soldier Francesco Ferruccio. This new subject was also a patriotic piece: Verdi had taken to heart the admonitions of the poet Giuseppe Giusti, who had pleaded with him after Macbeth and after Milan's political turmoil of March 1848 and its aftermath to \"do what you can to nourish the [sorrow of the Italian people], to strengthen it, and direct it to its goal\".Attempting to get a new libretto underway, Verdi approached Francesco Maria Piave, found him engaged as a soldier for the new Venetian republic, and so contacted Cammarano in Naples with the idea of L'assedio. But, as it turned out, Cammarano had to tell Verdi that the Naples censors rejected the outline of a subject which had interested Verdi very much since the time he prepared his previous opera, La battaglia di Legnano.  His inability to continue to develop the project came as a blow. Verdi's biographer Julian Budden notes that \"next to Re Lear (King Lear), this was to be the most fascinating of Verdi unrealized subjects\"; another biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz adds that she regards L'assedio di Firenze as \"one of Verdi's most important uncomposed works.\"Cammarano advised the composer to avoid a story which had any sort of revolutionary tinge, and he came back with an idea which Verdi himself had once proposed in 1846 when he was recovering from his illness and in the company of Andrea Maffei (who was writing the libretto for I masnadieri): to adapt Schiller's Kabale und Liebe. Therefore, he sent a synopsis of Luisa Miller (which he called Eloisa Miller) to Verdi on 14 May 1849.\nVerdi's reply to Cammarano on 17 May outlines some of his concerns; these revolved around the shift of some elements (especially in act 2) and the addition of a duet for Walter and Wurm. As Budden notes, \"the only one of these points on which Verdi got his way was the new duet\" (because the librettist raised various objections regarding the conditions at the San Carlo and various others), but Budden emphasizes the \"spirit of give and take\" which prevailed through their relationship. One example regarded the ending of act 1 where Verdi emphasized that there should no stretta, and the librettist agreed provided that \"the act did not end in slow tempo but should quicken towards an animated finish.\"(See \"Music\" below).\nCammarano moved the action from a princely court (in the 18th century) to a Tyrolean village (in the 17th century), and shifted the characters away from the princely intrigues which preoccupied Schiller. He therefore moved the focus much more toward the \"Liebe\" (Love) and away from the \"Kabale\" (Intrigue) aspects of the play.\nWith the idea of Luisa Miller agreed upon, from Paris Verdi approached the Naples management, trying to obtain a delay or, at least, to allow the new opera to be presented in his absence.  When this approach was rejected, the composer made plans for both himself and his companion Giuseppina Strepponi to leave Paris; Verdi went to his native Busseto, arriving about 10 August, and took up residence in the Palazzo Orlandi (also referred to as the Palazzo Cavalli, after its architect) which he had bought in 1845; Strepponi joined him there a  month later, for what was to be a difficult period in both their lives.It was from Busseto that Verdi then began work on the score of this opera, having received the libretto from Cammarano on 13 August. In October he left for Naples, accompanied by Antonio Barezzi, whom he continued to refer to as his \"father-in-law\"."

        "content": "Julian Budden provides a summary of the strengths of this opera and demonstrates how it takes on many new dimensions based on several things: the relatively longer time-frame for completing the piece, the fact that Verdi did make sketches of some of the music in advance, the opportunity \"to allow the newly-acquired Parisian elements to become assimilated into his Italian style\" \u2013 resulting in \"the best of it set[ting] a new standard in Verdian opera.\"  He demonstrates how in act 3, \"the sensitive scoring, the flexibility of the musical forms, the growing importance of the role which Verdi assigned to the orchestra ... permits him to write two lengthy dialogue recitatives (Luisa and Miller; Luisa and Rodolfo).  Of these two duets, David Kimball notes that they \"best illustrate Verdi's habit of fashioning the musical forms to match the dramatic purpose\", although Parker slightly qualifies this by stating that he sees the opera's importance amongst those written pre-Rigoletto as being not so much \"for its formal experiments as for its control of conventional musical forms, especially the grand duet.\" In that regard, he sees it as resembling Il trovatore.\nAs to the overall importance of Luisa, Baldini goes as far as to state that:\n\nin terms of artistic value the opera is comparable only to Nabucco, Ernani, and Macbeth.  It is, in short, the fourth Verdi opera which may be taken completely seriously: and up to this point he had written fourteen.Another musical example has been noted by Budden (See \"Composition history\" above): that Verdi was unwilling to set a conventional stretta to end act 2 (but, at the same time, he accommodated the librettist who wanted the act to conclude with music that \"should quicken towards an animated finish\").  In musical terms, Budden notes that Verdi agreed and:\n\nEnded with an allegro in three mounting stages; but it is nothing like a conventional stretta.  Nor is there any operatic model for this type of ending.  Verdi had gone far beyond the example of his Italian predecessors in allowing the original drama to dictate his formal ideas."

        "content": "While based on ancient Greek mythology and Sophocles' tragedy Electra, the opera is highly modernist and expressionist in style. Hofmannsthal's and Strauss's adaptation of the story focuses tightly on Elektra, thoroughly developing her character by single-mindedly expressing her emotions and psychology as she meets with other characters, mostly one at a time. (The order of these conversations closely follows Sophocles' play.) The other characters are Klytaemnestra, her mother and one of the murderers of her father Agamemnon; her sister, Chrysothemis; her brother, Orestes; and Klytaemnestra's lover, Aegisthus.\nVarious aspects from the myth are minimized as background to Elektra's character and her obsession. Other facets of the ancient story are completely excluded, in particular the earlier sacrifice by Agamemnon of his and Klytaemnestra's daughter Iphigenia, which was the motivation for Klytaemnestra's subsequent murder of Agamemnon. These changes tightened the focus on Elektra's furious lust for revenge. The result is a very modern, expressionistic retelling of the ancient Greek myth. Compared to Sophocles's Electra, the opera presents raw, brutal, violent, and bloodthirsty horror. Some scholars detect hints of incest in Elektra's dysfunctional family relationships. Norwegian musicologist St\u00e5le Wiksh\u00e5land has analysed the use of time and temporality in the dramaturgy of Elektra.Elektra is the second of Strauss's two highly modernist operas (the other being Salome), characterized by cacophonous sections and atonal leitmotifs. These works contrast highly with his earliest operas and his later period. The reception of Elektra in German-speaking countries was mostly divided along traditionalist and modernist lines."

        "content": "Between 1912 and 1913, S. Ansky headed an ethnographic commission, financed by Baron Vladimir G\u00fcnzburg and named in honor of his father Horace G\u00fcnzburg, which traveled through Podolia and Volhynia in the Pale of Settlement. They documented the oral traditions and customs of the native Jews, whose culture was slowly disintegrating under the pressure of modernity. According to his assistant Samuel Schreier-Shrira, Ansky was particularly impressed by the stories he heard in Miropol of a local sage, the hasidic rebbe Samuel of Kaminka-Miropol (1778 \u2013 May 10, 1843), who was reputed to have been a master exorcist of dybbuk spirits. Samuel served as the prototype for the character Azriel, who is also said to reside in that town. Historian Nathaniel Deutsch suggested he also drew inspiration from the Maiden of Ludmir, who was also rumored to have been possessed, thus explaining her perceived inappropriate manly behavior.Craig Stephen Cravens deduced that Ansky began writing the play in late 1913. It was first mentioned in a reply to him from Baron G\u00fcnzburg, on 12 February 1914, who commented he read a draft and found it compelling. The original was in Russian; shortly after completing it, the author was advised by friends to translate it into Yiddish. In the summer, he started promoting The Dybbuk, hoping it would be staged by a major Russian theater. He was rebuffed by Semyon Vengerov of the Alexandrinsky Theatre, who explained they could not perform another play by a Jew after the negative reaction to Semyon Yushkevich's Mendel Spivak. Ansky then contacted the managers of the Moscow Art Theatre. He failed to secure a meeting with Constantin Stanislavski himself, but director Leopold Sulerzhitsky read the play during the autumn, and replied much further work was required. Guided by him via correspondence, the author rewrote his piece through 1915. When he accepted the revised version in September, Sulerzhitsky regarded it as much better, but not satisfactory. At that time, Ansky's publisher Zinovy Grzhebin submitted it to the state censorship in St. Petersburg. Censor Nikolai von Osten-Driesen commented the banishment of the spirit resembled the Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac, and Ansky rewrote the scene using subtler terms. This version was approved by Driesen on 10 October, after removing another minor reference to angels. The play was still undergoing modifications: on 21 October, Ansky propositioned to Sulerzhitsky they add a prologue, epilogue and a long scene of Leah's wedding day. He agreed, and the censor approved the expanded edition on 30 November. Both copies submitted by Ansky were found in 2001 at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts. They were considerably different from the known stage version: most notably, the Messenger was not yet conceived.\nStanislavski agreed to review the play, though not thoroughly, on 30 December. Though many accounts link him with The Dybbuk, Cravens commented this is the only actual documentation in the matter. He never even watched The Dybbuk fully. He and the rest of the management continued to request revisions. On 25 November 1916, Ansky wrote in his diary that Stanislavski was almost pleased, asking but for only minor changes in the ending. On 8 January 1917, the press reported the Moscow Art Theatre accepted The Dybbuk and was preparing to stage it.\nAt the very same time, Stanislavski was supporting the incipient Habima Theater, a Hebrew-language venture headed by Nahum Zemach. Ansky read his play to Hillel Zlatopolsky, a patron of Habima, who purchased the rights to translate it to Hebrew. The author set but one condition, demanding it would be handed over to Hayim Nahman Bialik. The latter accepted the task in February and completed it in July. Bialik's translation was the first version of the play to be published: it was released in the Hebrew literary magazine Ha'tkufa in February 1918. Meanwhile, the Moscow Art Theatre's planned production of The Dybbuk encountered severe hardships. Michael Chekhov, cast as Azriel, had a severe nervous breakdown due to the use of extreme acting techniques; Stanislavski fell ill with typhus. On 7 March 1918, Boris Suskevich notified Ansky his play was not to be included in that season's repertoire. The author left the city to Vilnius, losing his original copy on the way, but eventually receiving another from Shmuel Niger. He read his renewed edition before David Herman, director of the Vilna Troupe, but did not live to see it performed. He died on November 8, 1920."

        "content": "On 9 December, at the end of the thirty days' mourning after Ansky's departure, Herman and his troupe staged the world premiere of The Dybbuk in Yiddish, at the Warsaw Elizeum Theater. Miriam Orleska, Alexander Stein, Abraham Morevsky and Noah Nachbusch portrayed Leah, Khanan, Azriel and the Messenger, respectively. The play turned into a massive success, drawing large audiences for over a year, from all the shades of society and a considerable number of Christians. A Yiddish columnist in Warsaw remarked that \"of every five Jews in the city, a dozen watched The Dybbuk. How could this be? It is not a play you attend merely once.\" In the Polish capital alone, they staged it over three hundred times. During their tour across Europe between 1922 and 1927, it remained the pinnacle of their repertoire. While most of their acts drew few visitors, The Dybbuk remained an audience magnet.\nOn 1 September 1921, the play had its American premiere in the New York Yiddish Art Theatre of Maurice Schwartz. Celia Adler, Bar Galilee, Schwartz and Julius Adler appeared as Leah, Khanan, Azriel and the Messenger. It ran for several months.\nWhile Habima Theater accepted Bialik's translation much earlier, both the intricacy of the play and the production of others delayed its stagings. Director Yevgeny Vakhtangov planned it for years. He originally cast Shoshana Avivit (Lichtenstein), one of his young actresses, as Leah. Avivit was a notorious prima donna and an intimate friend of Bialik, and abandoned the theater unexpectedly on 21 March 1921, due to constant quarrels with the directors. She was confident that the management would call her back, but they dismissed her of the role of Leah, to Bialik's chagrin; he ceased attending rehearsals. Vakhtangov gave the piece to Hanna Rovina, to the dismay of his associates, who considered the thirty-year-old actress too mature for portraying an eighteen-year-old Leah. Rovina was recovering from Tuberculosis in a sanatorium north of Moscow, and left the establishment in spite of the doctors' protests. Leah became her signature role. The Hebrew-language premiere was staged on 31 January 1922, at Habima's residence in the Sekretariova Theater. Rovina, Miriam Elias (who was replaced by male actors in subsequent stagings), Shabtai Prudkin and Nachum Tzemach appeared in the four leading roles. Habima performed it precisely 300 times in the Soviet Union, 292 in Moscow; the last was on 18 January 1926, before it embarked on an international tour.\nIn the British Mandate of Palestine, it premiered in a makeshift production organized by a labor battalion paving Highway 75; while the exact date was unrecorded, it was sometime in February 1922. Abba Hushi depicted Azriel. Professional stagings soon followed suit. On the 6th and 16 June 1926, in two consecutive meetings, the members of the Hebrew Writers Union in Tel Aviv conducted \"the Dybbuk trial\", a public debate attended by an audience of 5,000 people. They discussed the gap between the needs of the Zionist enterprise and the play's atmosphere, voicing concern that it might overshadow the \"young Hebrew culture\" developing in Palestine, struggling to free itself from the constraints of diaspora mentality. Eventually, they approved the play.\nThe German-language premiere opened on 28 February 1925, in Vienna's Rolandb\u00fchne, with Friedrich Feher as Azriel and Magda Sonja playing Leah. The first English production ran from 15 December 1925 and 1926 at the off-Broadway Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. It was translated and adapted by Henry G. Alsberg and Winifred Katzin. On 31 January 1928, Gaston Baty's French-language version premiered in the Studio des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\nIn 1977, Joseph Chaikin, a central figure in American avant-garde theatre, directed a new translation of The Dybbuk by Mira Rafalowicz, a dramaturg, yiddishist and longtime collaborator of Chaikin's at The Public Theater. The Royal Shakespeare Company staged Rafalowicz' translation, directed by Katie Mitchell, in 1992."

When Aaron Copland attended a performance of the play in New York in 1929, he was struck by this melody and made it the basis of his piano trio Vitebsk, named for the town where Ansky was born.In 1929 George Gershwin accepted a commission from the Metropolitan Opera to write an opera based on The Dybbuk. When he was unable to acquire the rights (assigned to the Italian composer Lodovico Rocca, whose opera, Il Dibuk, was written on a libretto by Renato Simoni), he instead began work on his opera Porgy and Bess.In 1933, David Tamkin and Alex Tamkin adapted the play into the opera The Dybbuk. It did not premiere until 1951.\nIn 1937, the play was adapted into the film The Dybbuk, directed by Micha\u0142 Waszy\u0144ski.\nOn October 3, 1960, The Play of the Week presented \"The Dybbuk\", an English adaptation by Joseph Liss. It was directed by Sidney Lumet and starred Carol Lawrence.In the early 1970s, Leon Katz created multiple adaptations of The Dybbuk (Toy Show and Shekhina: The Bride), both directed by Rina Yerushalmi and produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club.\nIn 1974, Jerome Robbins created the ballet Dybbuk with music by Leonard Bernstein. That year, it was also adapted for CBS Radio Mystery Theater under the title The Demon Spirit.In 1979 a version was made for Saturday Night Theatre on BBC Radio 4 starring Cyril Shaps. The same year, a two-person adaptation by Bruce Myers won him an Obie when he performed it in New York. The Jewish Theatre San Francisco (formerly Traveling Jewish Theatre) also performed Myers' adaptation, winning several awards.In 1980 the BBC aired the TV Movie \"The Dybbuk\", starring David Swift, Simon Callow and other notable actors of that era. It was well received and syndicated overseas.\nIn 1997, an Israeli film adaptation was produced under the name Forbidden Love or The Dybbuk of the Holy Apple Field, starring Israeli actors Yehezkel Lazarov and Ayelet Zurer in the leading roles. The film featured the song Forbidden Love by popular Israeli Mizrahi singer Zehava Ben, which went on to become a popular hit in Israel and, in its Arabic version, throughout the Middle East.In November 1997 an adaptation by Tony Kushner and Joachim Neugroschel opened at The Public Theatre in New York.\nIn 1999 The Dybbuk: An opera in Yiddish, by American composer Solomon Epstein, premiered in Tel Aviv. This is apparently the world's first original Yiddish opera.\nIn 1999, the Hollywood Theater of the Ear, under the direction of Yuri Rasovsky, recorded an English-language production, released by Dove Audio. It won the 2000 Audie Award for Audiobook Adapted from another Media.In January 2008, the opera The Dybbuk: Between Two Worlds, by composer Ofer Ben-Amots, premiered in Montreal, Canada.In May 2015, an adaptation by Canadian playwright Anton Piatigorsk opened at Toronto's Soulpepper Theatre."

Rossini entrusted the composition of the recitatives as well as the aria \"Le femmine d'Italia\" to an unknown collaborator. The opera is notable for Rossini's mixing of opera seria style with opera buffa. The overture is widely recorded and performed today, known for its distinct opening of slow, quiet pizzicato basses, leading to a sudden loud burst of sound from the full orchestra. This \"surprise\" reflects Rossini's early admiration for Joseph Haydn, whose Symphony No. 94 in G major, \"The Surprise Symphony\", is so named for the same shocking and semi-comic effect."

The last opera to be completed by Wallace, its premiere on 12 October 1863 at Covent Garden opened the 8th and final season of Louisa Pyne and William Harrison's English Opera Company. The Prince of Wales was in the audience, and Louisa Pyne herself sang the role of Oanita, with Harrison as Captain Maurice. A contemporary review pronounced  the songs \"pretty\" and the music \"pleasing\" but noted that \"there are no passages which, by their brilliancy and sweetnesss, raise the work to the heights which the composer has achieved in some of his former operas.\"The opera was not a particular success with audiences either, and was withdrawn after two weeks. The Desert Flower received its US premiere at New York's Academy of Music on 12 January 1868 with Caroline Richings as Oanita and William Castle as Captain Maurice. Wallace's opera is all but forgotten now, but the overture is occasionally played in concerts. Wilhelm Kuhe composed a Fantasia for piano based on its score, and in 1867 its main arias and duets were published as parlour songs in The Vocal Gems of William Vincent Wallace's Romantic Opera The Desert Flower."

The settlement is protected by two Dutch officers, the brave Captain Maurice and a reluctant new arrival, Major Hector Van Pumpernickle (who provides the comic relief). Matters become complicated when Oanita and Captain Maurice fall in love. This leads to the enmity of Casgan, and a tryst by the lovers is interrupted by him, and results in the capture of Maurice, who refuses Casgan's request to betray his comrades and countrymen. Oanita however allows Maurice to escape, and is, in turn, about to be put to death by her enraged tribe when she is rescued by Maurice and his soldier band, resulting in the death of his rival Casgan.

        "content": "A Man for All Seasons is a play by Robert Bolt based on the life of Sir Thomas More. An early form of the play had been written for BBC Radio in 1954, and a one-hour live television version starring Bernard Hepton was produced in 1957 by the BBC, but after Bolt's success with The Flowering Cherry, he reworked it for the stage.\nIt was first performed in London opening at the Globe Theatre (now Gielgud Theatre) on 1 July 1960. It later found its way to Broadway, enjoying a critically and commercially successful run of over a year. It has had several revivals, and was subsequently made into a multi-Academy Award-winning 1966 feature film and a 1988 television movie.\nThe plot is based on the historical events leading up to the execution of More, the 16th-century Chancellor of England, who refused to endorse Henry VIII's wish to divorce his wife Catherine of Aragon, who did not bear him a son, so that he could marry Anne Boleyn, the sister of his former mistress.\nThe play portrays More as a man of principle, envied by rivals such as Thomas Cromwell, but loved by the common people and by his family."

Bolt borrowed the title from Robert Whittington, a contemporary of More's, who in 1520 wrote of him:\n\n\"More is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons.\""

        "title": "A Man for All Seasons (play)_p1",
        "content": "A Man for All Seasons struggles with ideas of identity and conscience. More argues repeatedly that a person is defined by his conscience. His own position is depicted as almost indefensible; the Pope is described as a \"bad\" and corrupt individual, forced by the Emperor Charles V to act according to his will. But as More says to Norfolk, \"What matters is not that it's true, but that I believe it; or no, not that I believe it, but that I believe it.\"  More fears that if he breaks with his conscience, he will be damned to hell, while his associates and friends are more concerned with holding onto their own temporal power.\nAt another key point of the play, More testifies before an inquiry committee and Norfolk attempts to persuade him to sign the Succession to the Crown Act 1534 (pp. 78, Heinemann edition):\nNorfolk:\n\nOh, confound all this. ... I'm not a scholar, as Master Cromwell never tires of pointing out, and frankly, I don't know whether the marriage was lawful or not. But damn it, Thomas, look at those names. ... You know those men! Can't you do what I did, and come with us, for fellowship?More:\n\nAnd when we stand before God, and you are sent to Paradise for doing according to your conscience, and I am damned for not doing according to mine, will you come with me - for \"fellowship\"?More's persecution is made to seem even more unjust by the inclusion of Eustace Chapuys, the long-time Imperial ambassador to England, in the story. Chapuys recognizes More as a stout man of the church, and in Act II, after More's resignation from the Chancellorship, he informs More of a planned rebellion along the Scottish border, expecting More to be sympathetic. Instead, More informs Norfolk of the plot, showing him to be patriotic and loyal to the King. This, along with More's refusal to speak out against the King, shows him to be a loyal subject, and thus Cromwell appears to prosecute him out of personal spite and because he disagrees with the King's divorce.\nBolt also establishes an anti-authoritarian theme which recurs throughout his works. All people in positions of power \u2013 King Henry, Cromwell, Wolsey, Cranmer, Chapuys, even Norfolk \u2013 are depicted as being either corrupt, evil, or at best expedient and power-hungry. Bolt's later plays and film screenplays also delve into this theme. The theme of corruption is also illustrated, in Rich's rise to power, the Common Man being drawn into the events of the storyline, and in the (deliberately) anachronistic portrayal of Henry as a younger, athletic man (in 1530 he would have been almost forty and already putting on weight).\nAlthough it is the law that eventually forces More's execution, the play also makes several powerful statements in support of the rule of law. At one point More's future son-in-law, Roper, urges him to arrest Richard Rich, whose perjury will eventually lead to More's execution. More answers that Rich has broken no law, \"And go he should if he were the Devil himself until he broke the law!\"  Roper is appalled at the idea of granting the Devil the benefit of law, but More is adamant.\n\n\"What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil? ... And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you \u2013 where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's, and if you cut them down \u2013 and you're just the man to do it \u2013 do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!\"The character of the Common Man serves as a narrator and framing device. A Brechtian character, he plays various small parts \u2013 More's servant, a publican, a boatman, More's jailer, jury foreman and executioner\u2014who appear throughout the play, both taking part in and commenting on the action. Several sequences involving this character break the fourth wall\u2014most notably, a sequence where the Common Man attempts to exit the stage and is addressed by Cromwell, who identifies him as a jury foreman. (Indeed, the \"jury\" consists of sticks or poles with the hats of the Common Man's various characters put on top.) The place of the Common Man in history is emphasized when he says in his opening speech,\n\n\"the sixteenth century was the century of the Common Man-like all the other centuries.\"Bolt created the Common Man for two main reasons: to illustrate the place and influence of the average person in history, even though they are usually overlooked, and to try to prevent the audience from sympathising with the more titled characters such as More, realising that the audience is more closely related to him\u2014a classic case of Brechtian alienation. The character's role in the story has been interpreted in many different ways by different critics, from being a positive to a negative character. Bolt's own view (expressed in the preface to the play) was that he was intended to draw the audience into the play and that \"common\" denoted \"that which is common to us all.\" Several of Bolt's subsequent works feature similar characters (e.g. The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew, State of Revolution)."

The original ending, performed during the show's preliminary run in England, had Cromwell and Chapuys confront each other after More's execution and then exit the stage, hand in hand, chuckling with \"the self-mocking, self-indulgent, rather rueful laughter of the men who know what the world is and how to be comfortable in it\".\nThis particular ending is exemplary of Bolt's notion of \"riding with the current\", as is demonstrated by \"men who know what the world is and how to be comfortable in it\", forsaking one's conscience in exchange of a life of \"convenience\". For the show's London production \u2013 and most, if not all, subsequent runs of the show \u2013 the Common Man sheds his executioner's garb and addresses the audience one final time:\n\n\"... It isn't difficult to keep alive, friends \u2013 just don't make trouble \u2013 or if you must make trouble, make the sort of trouble that's expected... If we should bump into one another, recognize me.\"The film version of the play ends with More's execution, followed by a narrator reading off the fates of the various characters involved (originally, this was dialogue spoken by the Common Man prior to the Tower of London Inquiry)."

At the 16th Annual Tony Awards, the production earned four nominations, winning in all four categories it was nominated, including Tonys for Bolt, Scofield, and Willman.Leo McKern played the Common Man in the West End version of the show, but was shifted to the role of Cromwell for the Broadway production \u2013 a role he later reprised in the film. While playing Cromwell, he appeared with one brown and one blue eye (McKern of course had lost an eye in an accident and wore a glass one) to accentuate his character's evil nature.\nCharlton Heston played More in several versions of the play-off-Broadway in the 1970s and 1980s, eventually playing it in the West End. The play was a success and the West End production was taken to Aberdeen, Scotland, for a week where it was staged at His Majesty's Theatre. Heston considered it among his favourite roles. He also produced, directed, and starred in a film version of it (see below). The production gained a sort of notoriety when Dustin Hoffman spread the story that Heston, who was bald, was so vain that he wore a wig over his hairpiece, rather than let the public view his actual bald pate.\nAnother famous graduate of the play is Ian McKellen, whose first theatrical role was as Will Roper in a revival production in the late 1960s. He would go on to play More in a later run of the show. Faye Dunaway also made her stage debut as a replacement Margaret in the original Broadway run.\nAn acclaimed Canadian production starring William Hutt and directed by Walter Learning was presented at the Vancouver Playhouse and the Stratford Festival in 1986. At Stratford the production was paired with a production of Shakespeare's Henry VIII, with both plays sharing many actors, and showing two perspectives on historical events.\nThe play was staged in London's West End at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket starring Martin Shaw and produced by Bill Kenwright. It closed on 1 April 2006.\nA Broadway revival of the show, produced by the Roundabout Theatre Company, starring Frank Langella as More and directed by Doug Hughes, played at the American Airlines Theatre through December 2008. In this production, the character of The Common Man was deleted by the director (as Bolt had done when adapting his play for the first film version).Jeremy Strong made his Broadway debut in this production as Richard Rich.\nIn 2008, Thomas More was also portrayed on stage in Hong Kong as an allegorical symbol of the Pan-democracy camp resisting Chinese Communism when Hardy Tsoi, after translating A Man for All Seasons, mainly into Cantonese, but also with some parts in Mandarin, Spanish, Latin, and English, produced it as a play within a play. Similarities were noted between More and contemporary pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong such as Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, with the Vatican being seen as representing British colonialism while Henry VIII and his regime were seen as representing Communist China \"suppressing democracy and freedom\" in Hong Kong. According to Chapman Chen, Hardy Tsoi's version of the play is one of a number of Hong Kong works that suggest that mainstream postcolonial theories which invariably portray European colonialism as oppressive need to be \"modified or balanced\" to reflect the different experience of places like Hong Kong."

        "content": "Il trovatore ('The Troubadour') is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto largely written by Salvadore Cammarano, based on the play El trovador (1836) by Antonio Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez. It was Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez's most successful play, one which Verdi scholar Julian Budden describes as \"a high flown, sprawling melodrama flamboyantly defiant of the Aristotelian unities, packed with all manner of fantastic and bizarre incident.\"The premiere took place at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 19 January 1853, where it \"began a victorious march throughout the operatic world\", a success due to Verdi's work over the previous three years. It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of Il trovatore. There followed, slowly and with interruptions, the preparation of the libretto, first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare, which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions, which were accomplished under his direction. These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora.\nFor Verdi, the three years were filled with musical activity; work on this opera did not proceed while the composer wrote and premiered Rigoletto in Venice in March 1851. His personal affairs also limited his professional work. In May 1851, an additional commission was offered by the Venice company after Rigoletto's success there. Another commission came from Paris while he was visiting that city from late 1851 to March 1852. Before the libretto for Il trovatore was completed, before it was scored, and before it premiered, Verdi had four operatic projects in various stages of development.\nToday, Il trovatore is performed frequently and is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire."

        "content": "How and when Verdi acquired a copy of the Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez play is uncertain, but Budden notes that it appears that Giuseppina Strepponi, with whom Verdi had been living in Busseto since September 1849, had translated the play, as evidenced in a letter from her two weeks before the premiere urging him to \"hurry up and give OUR Trovatore\".When considering setting Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez's play, Verdi turned to work with Cammarano, \"the born operatic poet\" (according to Budden). Their correspondence began as early as January 1850, well before Verdi had done anything to develop a libretto with Piave for what later became Rigoletto in Venice. At this time, it was also the first since Oberto that the composer was beginning to prepare an opera with a librettist but without a commission of any kind from an opera house. In his first letter to Cammarano, Verdi proposed El Trovador as the subject with \"two feminine roles. The first, the gypsy, a woman of unusual character after whom I want to name the opera.\"With regard to the chosen librettist's strength as a poet in preparing verse for opera, Budden also comments that his approach was very traditional, something which began to become clear during the preparation of the libretto and which appears in the correspondence between the two men."

        "content": "In Italian as Il trovatore \n\nThe opera's immense popularity \u2013 albeit a popular success rather than a critical one \u2013 came from some 229 productions worldwide in the three years following its premiere on 19 January 1853, and is illustrated by the fact that \"in Naples, for example, where the opera in its first three years had eleven stagings in six theaters, the performances totalled 190\".First given in Paris in Italian on 23 December 1854 by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour, the cast included Lodovico Graziani as Manrico and Adelaide Borghi-Mamo as Azucena.Il trovatore was first performed in the US by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company on 2 May 1855 at the then-recently opened Academy of Music in New York. The cast included Balbina Steffenone as Leonora, Pasquale Brignoli as Manrico, Felicita Vestvali as Azucena, and Alessandro Amodio as the Count di Luna. The work's UK premiere took place on 10 May 1855 at Covent Garden in London, with Jenny B\u00fcrde-Ney as Leonora, Enrico Tamberlik as Manrico, Pauline Viardot as Azucena and Francesco Graziani as the Conte di Luna.As the 19th century proceeded there was a decline in interest, but Il trovatore saw a revival of interest after Toscanini's 1902 revivals. From its performance at the Met on 26 October 1883 the opera has been a staple of its repertoire.Today, almost all performances use the Italian version and it is one of the world's most frequently performed operas.In French as Le trouv\u00e8re \nAfter the successful presentation of the opera in Italian in Paris, Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Crosnier, director of l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris, proposed that Verdi revise his opera for the Paris audience as a grand opera, which would include a ballet, to be presented on the stage of the major Paris house. While Verdi was in Paris with Giuseppina Strepponi from late July 1855, working on the completion of Aroldo and beginning to prepare a libretto with Piave for what would become Simon Boccanegra, he encountered some legal difficulties in dealing with Toribio Calzado, the impresario of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Italiens, and, with his contacts with the Op\u0117ra, agreed to prepare a French version of Trovatore on 22 September 1855.\nA translation of Cammarano's libretto was made by librettist \u00c9milien Pacini under the title of Le trouv\u00e8re and it was first performed at La Monnaie in Brussels on 20 May 1856. There followed the production at the Paris Opera's Salle Le Peletier on 12 January 1857 after which Verdi returned to Italy. Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eug\u00e9nie attended the latter performance.For the French premiere, Verdi made some changes to the score of Le trouv\u00e8re including the addition of music for the ballet in act 3 which followed the soldiers' chorus, where gypsies danced to entertain them. The quality of Verdi's ballet music has been noted by scholar Charles Osborne: \"He could have been the Tchaikovsky of Italian ballet\" he states, continuing to praise it as \"perfect ballet music\". In addition, he describes the unusual practice of Verdi having woven in themes from the gypsy chorus of act 2, ballet music for opera rarely connecting with the themes of the work. Several other revisions focused on Azucena's music, including an extended version of the finale of act 4, to accommodate the role's singer Adelaide Borghi-Mamo. Some of these changes have even been used in modern performances in Italian.In 1990 Tulsa Opera presented the first staging of Le trouv\u00e8re in the United States using a new critical edition by musicologist, conductor, and Verdi scholar David Lawton. Recorded live for broadcast on NPR, Lawton conducted the premiere with Margaret Jane Wray as Leonore, Craig Sirianni as Manrique, Greer Grimsley as Le Comte de Luna, Barbara Conrad as Azucena, and the Tulsa Philharmonic. This version was published by Ricordi and the University of Chicago Press in 2001. An updated version of this critical edition by Lawton was published by Ricordi in 2018, and given its premiere at the Festival Verdi in Parma that same year.Rarely given in French, it was presented as part of the 1998 Festival della Valle d'Itria and in 2002 Le trouv\u00e8re appeared as part of the Sarasota Opera's \"Verdi Cycle\" of all the composer's work."

        "content": "Today, most opera scholars recognize the expressive musical qualities of Verdi's writing. However, musicologist Roger Parker notes that \"the extreme formalism of the musical language has been seen as serving to concentrate and define the various stages of the drama, above all channeling them into those key confrontations that mark its inexorable progress\".Here he, like many other writers, notes the elements of musical form (then often described as \"closed forms\") which characterize the opera and make it appear to be something of a return to the language of earlier times, \"the veritable apotheosis of bel canto with its demands for vocal beauty, agility and range,\" notes Charles Osborne. Thus, the cantabile-cabaletta two-part arias, the use of the chorus, etc., which Verdi had originally asked Cammarano to ignore, are evident. But Verdi wanted something else: \"the freer the forms he presents me with, the better I shall do,\" he wrote to the librettist's friend in March 1851. It was not what he received from his librettist, but he certainly demonstrated his total mastery over this style. Osborne's take on 'Il trovatore is that \"it is as though Verdi had decided to do something which he had been perfecting over the years, and to do it so beautifully that he need never to do it again. Formally, it is a step backward after Rigoletto\".Budden describes one of the musical qualities as the relationship between the \"consistent dramatic impetus\" of the action being caused by the \"propulsive quality\" of the music which produces a \"sense of continuous forward motion\". Parker describes it as \"sheer musical energy apparent in all the numbers\". And Budden gives many examples which show Verdi as \"the equal of Bellini\" as a melodist.Verdi also clearly recognizes the importance of the role of Azucena. Remembering that the composer's initial suggestion to Cammarano was that he wanted to name the opera after her, Budden notes that this character \"is the first of a glorious line\" and he names Ulrica (from Ballo), Eboli (from Don Carlos), and Amneris (from Aida) as followers in the same vocal range and with the same expressive and distinct qualities which separate them from the other female role in the opera in which they feature. He quotes from a letter which Verdi wrote to Marianna Barbieri-Nini, the soprano who was due to sing the Leonora in Venice after the premiere, and who expressed reservations about her music. Here, Verdi emphasizes the importance of the role of Azucena:\n\n..it's a principal, the principal role; finer and more dramatic and more original than the other. If I were a prima donna (a fine thing that would be!), I would always rather sing the part of the Gypsy in Il trovatore.From this position, Budden comments on the distinct differences in an era where vocal registers were less defined and which extend into Leonora's and Azucena's music \"where greater verbal projection of the lower voice [can be] turned to advantage\" and where \"the polarity between the two female roles [extends] into every field of comparison.\" He then sums up the musical relationship which exists between the two female characters, the men having simply been defined as being representative of their own voice types, something evident and very striking in Verdi's significant use of voice types in Ernani of 1844. Regarding Leonora, Budden describes her music as \"mov[ing] in long phrases most characterized by a soaring 'aspiring' quality\" whereas \"Azucena's melodies evolve in short, often commonplace phrases based on the repetition of short rhythmic patterns\"."

On many occasions, this opera and its music have been featured in various forms of popular culture and entertainment. Scenes of comic chaos play out over a performance of Il trovatore in the Marx Brothers film A Night at the Opera (including a quotation, in the middle of the act 1 overture, of Take Me Out to the Ball Game). Luchino Visconti used a performance of Il trovatore at La Fenice opera house for the opening sequence of his 1954 film Senso. As Manrico sings his battle cry in \"Di quella pira\", the performance is interrupted by the answering cries of Italian nationalists on the upper balcony who shower the stalls area below with patriotic leaflets. In Italian Film in the Light of Neorealism, Millicent Marcus proposes that Visconti used this operatic paradigm throughout Senso, with parallels between the opera's protagonists, Manrico and Leonora, and the film's protagonists, Ussoni and Livia. A staging of act 1, scene 2, of Il trovatore is featured in Bernardo Bertolucci's 1979 film La Luna. Music from the opera was featured on Kijiji in Canada for commercials."

        "content": "While the story and most of the characters are fictitious, it is set towards the end of a real civil war in Aragon. Following the death of King Martin of Aragon in 1410, no fewer than six candidates staked a claim for the throne. A political meeting, the Compromise of Caspe, found in favour of Martin's sororal nephew Ferdinand. Count James II of Urgell, King Martin's brother-in-law and the closest relative through purely patrilineal line of descent, refused to accept the decision of the Compromise, believing (with some justification) that Martin had intended to adopt him as the heir by appointing him Governor-General after the death of his own son Martin the Younger, and rebelled. A third candidate was Frederic, Count of Luna, bastard son of Martin the Younger, whose legitimization had been sought from the Pope unsuccessfully. As part of the compromise for withdrawing his own claim in favour of Ferdinand, Frederic was granted the County of Luna, one of the lesser titles that his father had held.While neither of the two princes who actually took part in the war appears in the opera \u2013 neither is even referred to by name, and only Urgell is referred to by his title \u2013 the fortunes of their followers mirror those of their princes. Thus, with his military success, Ferdinand's side has the upper hand in the war and is effectively the Royalist party, with the backing of much of the nobility and the Dowager Queen, and he also has Di Luna as his chief henchman (Luna's own connection to the royal family is not mentioned, being not necessary to the drama): while Urgel, losing the war and on the back foot, is forced to recruit among outlaws and the dispossessed, effectively taking the part of a rebel despite having some legal right to his case. Thus the fact that the forces of Urgel, in the opera as in real life, lose every pitched battle: and on the single occasion that they capture a castle (named in the opera as \"Castellor\", a fairly generic name for a castle, there being many Castellars in the region), it proves a handicap to them because their only hope in battle lies in speed, mobility, surprise and ambush, all of which are lost when defending a fortress.\nThus it is that the fictitious troubadour Manrico can gain his rags-to-riches background, having risen from the obscurity of a Biscayan gypsy camp to become Urgel's chief general, a knight and a master swordsman in his own right, good enough to defeat Di Luna himself in a personal duel, or win a knightly tournament: only to lose it again on the military battlefield, where the odds are perpetually against him, and he is damned as an outlaw even before the opera begins, for no deed of his own but because his master is the rebel. And yet he gets to be a heroic, popular outlaw, who might just escape with his life in return for a vow of future loyalty, if put on trial in front of the Prince himself: a chance that Luna does not want to risk, given that his rivalry with Manrico is personal as well as political. Hence the challenge to the duel over the personal rivalry, instead of calling the guards and making the arrest political, in act 1: and hence also the decision to execute without trial in act 4 even though Luna knows he is abusing his position. Leonora and Azucena are, of course, as fictitious as Manrico, as is the story's conceit that the former Count of Luna had not one but two sons."

It tells the story of the \"mad\" knight Don Quixote as a play within a play, performed by Cervantes and his fellow prisoners as he awaits a hearing with the Spanish Inquisition. The work is not and does not pretend to be a faithful rendition of either Cervantes' life or Don Quixote. Wasserman complained repeatedly about people taking the work as a musical version of Don Quixote.The original 1965 Broadway production ran for 2,328 performances and won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical. The musical has been revived four times on Broadway, becoming one of the most enduring works of musical theatre.\"The Impossible Dream\", the principal song in the show, became a standard. The musical has played in many other countries around the world, with productions in Dutch, French (translation by Jacques Brel), German, Hebrew, Irish, Estonian, Japanese, Korean, Bengali, Gujarati, Uzbek, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Serbian, Slovenian, Swahili, Finnish, Chinese, Ukrainian, Turkish, and nine distinct dialects of the Spanish language.Man of La Mancha was first performed at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut, in 1965, and had its New York premiere on the thrust stage of the ANTA Washington Square Theatre in 1965."

The DuPont Corporation disliked the title Man of La Mancha, thinking that its viewing audience would not know what La Mancha actually meant, so a new title, I, Don Quixote, was chosen. The play was broadcast live on November 9, 1959, with an estimated audience of 20 million. The New York Public Library at Lincoln Center, Billy Rose Collection, has a rare tape of this broadcast.\nYears after this television broadcast and after the original teleplay had been unsuccessfully optioned as a non-musical Broadway play, director Albert Marre called Wasserman and suggested that he turn his play into a musical. Mitch Leigh was selected as composer, with orchestrations by Carlyle W. Hall. Unusually for the time, this show was scored for an orchestra with no violins or other traditional orchestral stringed instruments apart from a double bass, instead making heavier use of brass, woodwinds, percussion and utilizing flamenco guitars as the only stringed instruments of any sort.The original lyricist of the musical was poet W. H. Auden, but his lyrics were discarded, some of them considered too overtly satiric and biting, attacking the bourgeois audience at times. Auden's lyrics were replaced by those of Joe Darion."

They have been charged with foreclosing on a monastery. Their fellow prisoners attack them, eager to steal the contents of the large trunk Cervantes has brought with him. However, a sympathetic criminal known as \"the Governor\" suggests setting up a mock trial instead. Only if Cervantes is found guilty will he have to hand over his possessions. A cynical prisoner, known as \"the Duke,\" charges Cervantes with being an idealist and a bad poet. Cervantes pleads guilty, but then asks if he may offer a defense, in the form of a play, acted out by him and all the prisoners. The \"Governor\" agrees.\nCervantes takes out a makeup kit and costume from his trunk, and transforms himself into Alonso Quijano, an old gentleman who has read so many books of chivalry and thought so much about injustice that he has lost his mind and set out as a knight-errant. Quijano renames himself Don Quixote de La Mancha, and goes off to find adventures with his \"squire\", Sancho Panza. (\"Man of La Mancha (I, Don Quixote)\")\nDon Quixote warns Sancho that they are always in danger of being attacked by Quixote's mortal enemy, an evil magician known as the Enchanter. Suddenly he spots a windmill, mistakes it for a four-armed giant, attacks it, and receives a beating from the encounter. Quixote decides that he lost the battle because he was never properly knighted. He then mistakes a rundown inn for a castle and orders Sancho to announce their arrival by blowing his bugle.\nCervantes talks some prisoners into assuming the roles of the inn's serving wench and part-time prostitute Aldonza, and a group of muleteers who are propositioning her. Aldonza fends them off sarcastically (\"It's All The Same\"), but eventually deigns to accept their leader, Pedro, who pays in advance.\nDon Quixote enters with Sancho, asking for the lord of the castle. The Innkeeper (played by The Governor) humors Don Quixote as best he can. Quixote sees Aldonza and declares that she is his lady, Dulcinea, to whom he has sworn eternal loyalty (\"Dulcinea\"). Aldonza, used to rough treatment, is first flabbergasted and then annoyed at Quixote's kindness, and is further aggravated when the Muleteers turn Quixote's tender ballad into a mocking serenade.\nMeanwhile, Antonia, Don Quixote's niece, has gone with Quixote's housekeeper to seek advice from the local priest, who realizes that the two women are more concerned with the embarrassment Quixote's madness may bring them than with his actual welfare (\"I'm Only Thinking of Him\").\nCervantes chooses \"the Duke\" to play Dr. Sanson Carrasco, Antonia's fianc\u00e9, a man just as cynical and self-centered as the prisoner who is playing him. Carrasco is upset at the idea of marrying into the family of a madman, but the priest convinces Carrasco that it would be a worthy challenge to use his abilities to cure his prospective uncle-in-law. Carrasco and the priest set out to bring Don Quixote back home (\"I'm Only Thinking of Him [Reprise]\").\nBack at the inn, Sancho delivers a missive from Don Quixote to Aldonza courting her favor and asking for a token of her esteem. Aldonza provides the requested token: an old dishrag. She asks Sancho why he follows Quixote, but he can come up with no explanation other than \"I Really Like Him\". Alone, Aldonza ponders Quixote's behavior and her inability to laugh at him (\"What Do You Want of Me?\"). In the courtyard, the muleteers once again taunt Aldonza with a suggestive song (\"Little Bird, Little Bird\"). Pedro makes arrangements with her for an assignation later.\nThe priest and Dr. Carrasco arrive, but cannot reason with Don Quixote. Quixote becomes distracted by a barber who passes by the inn, wearing his shaving basin on his head to ward off the sun's heat (\"The Barber's Song\"). Quixote threatens the barber with a sword and snatches the basin, declaring it is the \"Golden Helmet of Mambrino\", which makes its wearer invulnerable. Dr. Carrasco and the priest leave, with the priest impressed by Don Quixote's view of life and wondering if curing him is really worthwhile (\"To Each His Dulcinea\").\nQuixote still wishes to be officially dubbed a knight: he plans to stand vigil all night over his armor in the inn's courtyard, and then have the Innkeeper (whom he mistakes for a nobleman) grant him knighthood the following morning. Aldonza encounters Quixote in the courtyard and confronts him; Quixote does his best to explain the ideals he follows and the quest he is on (\"The Impossible Dream\"). Pedro enters, furious at being kept waiting, and slaps Aldonza. Enraged, Don Quixote takes him and all the other muleteers on in a fight (\"The Combat\"). Don Quixote has no martial skill, but by luck and determination \u2013 and with the help of Aldonza and Sancho \u2013 he prevails, and the muleteers are all knocked unconscious. But the noise attracts the attention of the Innkeeper, who tells Quixote that he must leave. Quixote apologizes for the trouble but reminds the Innkeeper of his promise to dub him knight. The Innkeeper does so (\"Knight of the Woeful Countenance\").\nQuixote then declares that he must comfort the wounded muleteers, because chivalry requires kindness to one's enemies. Aldonza, impressed, says that she will help the muleteers instead. But when she comes to them with bandages, they beat her, rape her, and carry her off (\"The Abduction\"). Quixote, unaware of this, contemplates his recent victory and new knighthood (\"The Impossible Dream\" \u2013 first reprise).\nAt this point, the Don Quixote play is brutally interrupted when the Inquisition enters the dungeon and drags off an unwilling prisoner to be tried. The Duke taunts Cervantes for his look of fear, and accuses him of not facing reality. This prompts Cervantes to passionately defend his idealism.\nThe Don Quixote play resumes (\"Man of La Mancha\" \u2013 first reprise). Quixote and Sancho have left the inn and encounter a band of Gypsies (\"Moorish Dance\") who take advantage of Quixote's naivet\u00e9 and steal everything they own, including Quixote's horse Rocinante and Sancho's donkey Dapple. Quixote and Sancho are forced to return to the inn. Aldonza also shows up at the inn, bruised and ashamed. Quixote swears to avenge her, but she tells him off, flinging her real, pitiful history in his face and blaming him for allowing her a glimpse of a life she can never have. She begs him to see her as she really is but Quixote can only see her as his Dulcinea (\"Aldonza\").\nSuddenly, another knight enters. He announces himself as Don Quixote's mortal enemy, the Enchanter, in the form of the \"Knight of the Mirrors\". He insults Aldonza, so Quixote challenges him to combat. The Knight of the Mirrors and his attendants bear huge mirrored shields, and as they swing them at Quixote (\"Knight of the Mirrors\"), the glare blinds him. The Knight taunts Quixote, forcing him to see himself as the world sees him: a fool and a madman. Don Quixote collapses, weeping. The Knight of the Mirrors removes his helmet \u2013 he is really Dr. Carrasco, returned with his latest plan to cure Quixote.\nCervantes announces that the story is finished, but the prisoners are dissatisfied with the ending. They prepare to burn his manuscript when he asks for the chance to present one last scene. The governor agrees.\nQuixote is back at home, and has fallen into a coma. Sancho tries to cheer him up (\"A Little Gossip\"), and Alonso opens his eyes. He is now sane: he gives his name as Alonso Quijano and thinks his knightly career was just a dream. However, he feels close to death, and asks the priest to help him make out his will. Aldonza suddenly forces her way into the room. She has come to visit Quixote because she can no longer bear to be anyone but Dulcinea. When he does not recognize her, she sings a reprise of \"Dulcinea\" and tries to help him remember the words of \"The Impossible Dream.\" Suddenly, he remembers everything and rises from his bed, calling for his armor and sword so that he may set out again (\"Man of La Mancha\" \u2013 second reprise). But it is too late \u2013 in mid-song, he cries out and falls dead. The priest sings \"The Psalm\" (Psalm 130 in Latin) for the dead. Sancho is distraught at his friend's death. Aldonza tries to comfort him, saying that Alonso Quijano may be dead but Don Quixote lives on. When Sancho addresses her as Aldonza, she replies, \"My name is Dulcinea.\"\nThe Inquisition enters to take Cervantes to his trial, and the prisoners, finding him not guilty, return his manuscript. It is his (as yet) unfinished novel, Don Quixote. As Cervantes and his servant mount the staircase to go to their impending trial, the prisoners, led by the girl who played Dulcinea, sing \"The Impossible Dream\" in chorus."

It was her last work, first staged at the Royal Court's Jerwood Theatre Upstairs on 23 June 2000, directed by James Macdonald, nearly one and a half years after Kane's death on 20 February 1999. The play has no explicit characters or stage directions. Stage productions of the play vary greatly, therefore, with between one and several actors in performance; the original production featured three actors. According to Kane's friend and fellow playwright David Greig, the title of the play derives from the time, 4:48 a.m., when Kane, in her depressed state, often woke."

Berenice was not played often between the 17th and the 20th centuries.\nIt was premiered on 21 November 1670 by the Com\u00e9diens du Roi at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne. Racine seems to have chosen the subject in competition with Pierre Corneille, who was working on his drama Tite et B\u00e9r\u00e9nice at the same time.  The subject was taken from the Roman historian Suetonius, who recounts the story of the Roman emperor Titus and Berenice of Cilicia, the sister of Agrippa II.  Suetonius wrote a single sentence on the affair: \"Titus reginam Berenicen, cui etiam nuptias pollicitus ferebatur, statim ab Urbe dimisit invitus invitam.\"  In his preface, Racine translates this as \"Titus, who passionately loved Berenice and who was widely thought to have promised to marry her, sent her from Rome, in spite of himself and in spite of herself, in the early days of his empire.\""

The drama could have been based on events which conspire to separate the lovers, but Racine chose rather to eliminate all events that could overshadow the one action that he retains: the announcement by Titus that he is leaving her. He has in fact already made his decision before the play begins, and all that remains is for him to announce it to her and for her to accept it. Their love for each other is never in doubt, there is never any personal danger, nothing distracts the attention of the audience. The great art of Racine is to make something out of nothing, as he says himself in the preface to the play. The tension reaches its climax at the end of the fourth act, when Titus explains his dilemma, and Berenice refuses his decision. In the fifth act, they both come to terms with their duty; contrary to other plays by the same author, neither seeks escape through death."

Motown singer and actress Diana Ross asked Motown CEO Berry Gordy to cast her instead, but he declined, feeling that the then-33-year-old Ross was far too old for the part. However, she contacted Rob Cohen of Universal Pictures, who offered to have them finance the film if she were to play Dorothy, at which point he acquiesced.\nThe resulting film version of The Wiz also starred former Motown star Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow, Nipsey Russell as the Tin Man, Richard Pryor as the Wizard, jazz singer Thelma Carpenter as Miss One (the name \"Addapearle\" was not used for this production) and Lena Horne as Glinda. Ross and King reprised their roles of the Lion and Evillene from the Broadway production respectively. Sidney Lumet served as director, working with screenwriter Joel Schumacher (who used none of Brown's stage script) and music supervisor Quincy Jones. The film was a critical and commercial failure, performing poorly at the box office and severely panned by critics, who branded the casting of Ross instead of Mills as Dorothy a disastrous blunder.In 1998, following their TV-movie production of Cinderella (1997), producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron began pre-production on a TV-movie adaptation of The Wiz for The Wonderful World of Disney, which was to star a then-unknown Anika Noni Rose as Dorothy. The project fell through due to Universal still having the film rights to adaptations of The Wiz, and the production was shelved. The O.Z., a hip-hop re-adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz with an all-Black cast that was to use original music rather than adapt The Wiz, was then planned by FOX and director Chris Stokes in the early 2000s. With Brandy, Queen Latifah, Patti LaBelle, Busta Rhymes, and Little Richard among its planned cast, the telefilm ultimately went un-produced; FOX instead became a co-producer on The Muppets' Wizard of Oz (2005), starring Ashanti as Dorothy and Latifah as Aunt Em.\nEleven years later, following the production of two live musicals for NBC \u2013 The Sound of Music Live! (2013) and Peter Pan Live! (2014) \u2013 Zadan and Meron announced The Wiz Live! as their next production (NBC, by this point, having purchased Universal Studios). NBC's live performance of the stage show aired on December 3, 2015. Stephanie Mills, who originated the role of Dorothy on Broadway, played Aunt Em. An open casting call for the role of Dorothy took place on June 6, 2015. In July 2015, Queen Latifah was cast as the Wiz and Mary J. Blige was confirmed to play the role of Evillene.  In addition, Beyonc\u00e9 was offered to play Glinda, but no deal was made. The following month, David Alan Grier was cast as the Cowardly Lion, and newcomer Shanice Williams was chosen to play Dorothy. Uzo Aduba played Glinda and Amber Riley portrayed Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North. Other principal cast-members included Elijah Kelley as the Scarecrow, Ne-Yo as the Tin Man, and Common as the Bouncer, the gatekeeper of the entrance to Emerald City."

When Glinda, the good witch, musically instructed Dorothy to 'believe in herself,' she seemed to be delivering a broader inspirational message. The Wiz was hardly a great musical in 1975, but it had something to say, and it said it with verve and integrity. It's depressing to watch a once-fervent expression of Black self-respect and talent be spilled on the stage as if it were a trunkload of marked-down, damaged goods.\"In their review of the 2006 La Jolla production, Variety wrote: \"'The Wiz' remains a collage of contemporary slang and imagery, but La Jolla's is a multicultural collage in which Baum's themes speak to the broadest possible audience. Unquestionably, the humor and the heartbeat of the piece remain African-American at their source, but the overall effect is pluralistic and inclusive. In the truest and most positive sense of the phrase, McAnuff's show is color-blind. Every alteration from the 1975 original, inspired by the central multicultural concept, is salutary. Brown's almost wholly rewritten script is tart and funny at last. Smalls' score\u2014supervised by musical director Ron Melrose and original orchestrator Harold Wheeler\u2014sounds fresh and contemporary\".As critic Peter Filichia wrote in 2015, \"Arguably more impressive is Stephen Sondheim's opinion. Whenever he's asked for a favorite show that he didn't write, he immediately says The Wiz. What?! With all its false rhymes?! 'Because,' he always says, 'it's the one show which makes you feel better when you come out of it than you did when you walked in.'\""

        "content": "Described as a \"show for 17\", it is a setting of a libretto based on the poetry collection by the Chilean poet Gaston Salvatore, who had been prominent in the West German student movement of 1968 in Berlin. It features a baritone soloist, whose demanding role includes sprechstimme, screeches and spoken passages. He is accompanied by an organist, jazz band and a chamber ensemble akin to that used in Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire. Additionally, a large battery of percussion is used as well as voices and music on tape, representing street noises of Berlin, and brief extracts from Verdi's Aida and Mahler's Fifth Symphony.The work is an allegory: Natascha Ungeheuer (in English 'monster', 'ogre', but also a reference to the German painter Natascha Ungeheuer) is the \"siren of a false Utopia\" according to Salvatore. She lures the leftist intellectual into the cosy situation whereby they preach socialist values whilst essentially living the same bourgeois middle class lifestyle, identifying with the proletariat in words only. In a broadly analogous way to the temptation of Christ, Salvatore's hero resists the temptation to go all the way to Natascha's apartment, yet \"has not yet discovered his way to the revolution\".The work was premi\u00e8red and broadcast by RAI Radio at the Teatro Olimpico, Rome, on 17 May September 1971 with William Pearson as the soloist and the Gunter Hampel Free Jazz Ensemble, the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble and the Fires of London along with the percussionist Stomu Yamash'ta under Henze's direction. Recorded voices on tape were those of Dieter Schidor, Elfriede Irral, Gaston Salvatore and Henze. The first performance in Germany was at the Deutsche Oper Berlin later that year.It was met with boos from the audience, which, Henze reflected, \"was understandable [in] that our portrait of Berlin caused displeasure\" amongst the very intellectuals it savaged.The work was recorded soon after for Deutsche Grammophon with the same forces."

The composer himself penned the French libretto with contributions from Saint-Pol-Roux, a symbolist poet and the inspiration of the surrealists. It is an atmospheric story of working-class life in Paris, with the city itself invoked along the way: young Louise, a seamstress living with her parents, loves Julien, an artist; she desires freedom, associated in her mind with him and the city. (Charpentier would later write a sequel, the opera Julien, describing the artist's aspirations.) Musically the work is considered an example of verismo, and marks the beginning of naturalism in French opera."

        "content": "Saint Joan of the Stockyards (German: Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth\u00f6fe) is a play written by the German modernist playwright Bertolt Brecht between 1929 and 1931, after the success of his musical The Threepenny Opera and during the period of his radical experimental work with the Lehrst\u00fccke. It is based on the musical that he co-authored with Elisabeth Hauptmann, Happy End (1929). In this version of the story of Joan of Arc, Brecht transforms her into \"Joan Dark\", a member of the \"Black Straw Hats\" (a Salvation Army-like group) in 20th-century Chicago. The play charts Joan's battle with Pierpont Mauler, the unctuous owner of a meat-packing plant. Like her predecessor, Joan is a doomed woman, a martyr and (initially, at least) an innocent in a world of strike-breakers, fat cats, and penniless workers. Like many of Brecht's plays it is laced with humor and songs as part of its epic dramaturgical structure and deals with the theme of emancipation from material suffering and exploitation.The environment of the Chicago stockyards was well-known to left-wing activists worldwide due to Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel The Jungle. Sinclair had spent about six months investigating the Chicago meatpacking industry for the paper Appeal to Reason, the work which inspired his novel. Sinclair intended to \"set forth the breaking of human hearts by a system which exploits the labor of men and women for profit\".The play was broadcast on Berlin Radio on the 11 April 1932, with Carola Neher as Joan and Fritz Kortner as Mauler. The cast also included Helene Weigel, Ernst Busch, Peter Lorre, Paul Bildt and Friedrich Gna\u00df. The play did not receive its first theatrical production until the 30 April 1959, at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, after Brecht's death. Brecht had asked Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens to direct, with scenic design by Caspar Neher and music by Siegfried Franz. Brecht's daughter Hanne Hiob played Joan.Saint Joan of the Stockyards was given its New York City premiere by the Encompass New Opera Theatre in 1978 in a production which incorporated music, directed by Jan Eliasberg.Brecht wrote two other versions of the Joan of Arc story: The Visions of Simone Machard (1942) and The Trial of Joan of Arc at Rouen, 1431 (1952)."

Mauler confides in his colleague, Cridle, that, after visiting the stockyard for the first time, he wishes to sell his shares and \"become a decent man\". Another stock holder, Lennox, is rumored to have lost his shares. Mauler strikes a deal with Cridle, which advances his position while at the same time devastating the lives of the 50,000 workers whose livelihoods are in the stockyards.\nJoan enters just outside of the Black Straw Hats Mission, a Salvation Army-type organization whose events draw dozens of workers, but only as long as there is soup. Joan urges the workers to embrace God in light of life's injustices, but finds it difficult to distract them from hunger and the failing market. When the workers learn of Mauler's deal, they panic. Desperate to find a way to connect to them, Joan goes to the stockyards in order to find and confront Mauler.\nJoan and Martha, another Black Straw Hat, wait outside of the Livestock Exchange as Cridle, Graham, Lenox and Mauler discuss the market and Lennox's sad fate. Cridle insists that Mauler lower the asking price for his shares of the stockyard, arguing that the state of the market lessens their worth.\nJoan asks Mauler why he sold the slaughterhouses and he admits that he does not want to be involved with such a bloody business. Joan manages to stun Mauler with her simplicity and beauty. He forcibly takes money from the workers, gives it to Joan, and tells her to distribute it to the poor.\nMauler arranges for Joan to have a tour and see the \"wickedness\" of the poor workers whom she pities. She is stunned by the cruelty that she sees.\nWhen a worker offers her a dangerous position in order to advance himself, she takes it, and finds herself trapped among the workers. Joan begins to see the corruption in all the larger institutions, including her own Black Straw Hats. She disaffiliates from the mission.\nMauler sees the imminent downfall of the market and attributes his financial situation to his poor relationship with God. He embraces religion and warns his colleagues that their property will fail them, but turning to God could save them from destitution.\nBy the end of the play, Mauler preaches with the Black Straw Hats and Joan dies a bitter, cynical martyr in a world of heartless capitalists, strike-breakers, and penniless workers.\n\n\n== References =="

It is the longest opera commonly performed, taking nearly four and a half hours, not counting two breaks between acts, and is traditionally not cut. With Hans von B\u00fclow conducting, it was first performed on 21 June 1868 at the National Theater in Munich, today home of Bavarian State Opera.\nThe story is set in Nuremberg in the mid-16th century. At the time, Nuremberg was a free imperial city and one of the centers of the Renaissance in Northern Europe. The story revolves around the city's guild of Meistersinger (Master Singers), an association of amateur poets and musicians who were primarily master craftsmen of various trades. The master singers had developed a craftsmanlike approach to music-making, with an intricate system of rules for composing and performing songs. The work draws much of its atmosphere from its depiction of the Nuremberg of the era and the traditions of the master-singer guild. One of the main characters, the cobbler-poet Hans Sachs, is based on a historical figure, Hans Sachs (1494\u20131576), the most famous of the master-singers.\nDie Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg occupies a unique place in Wagner's oeuvre. It is the only comedy among his mature operas (he had come to reject his early Das Liebesverbot) and is also unusual among his works in being set in a historically well-defined time and place rather than in a mythical or legendary setting. It is the only mature Wagner opera based on an entirely original story, and in which no supernatural or magical powers or events feature. It incorporates many of the operatic conventions that Wagner had railed against in his essays on the theory of opera: rhymed verse, arias, choruses, a quintet, and even a ballet.\nThe autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum."

        "content": "Wagner's autobiography Mein Leben (My Life) described the genesis of Die Meistersinger. Taking the waters at Marienbad in 1845 he began reading Georg Gottfried Gervinus' Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung (History of German Poetry). This work included chapters on mastersong and on Hans Sachs.\nI had formed a particularly vivid picture of Hans Sachs and the mastersingers of Nuremberg. I was especially intrigued by the institution of the Marker and his function in rating master-songs ... I conceived during a walk a comic scene in which the popular artisan-poet, by hammering upon his cobbler's last, gives the Marker, who is obliged by circumstances to sing in his presence, his come-uppance for previous pedantic misdeeds during official singing contests, by inflicting upon him a lesson of his own.\nGervinus' book also mentions a poem by the real-life Hans Sachs on the subject of Protestant reformer Martin Luther, called \"Die Wittenbergisch Nachtigall\" (The Wittenberg Nightingale). The opening lines for this poem, addressing the Reformation, were later used by Wagner in Act III Scene 5 when the crowd acclaims Sachs: \"Wacht auf, es nahet gen den Tag; ich h\u00f6r' singen im gr\u00fcnen Hag ein wonnigliche Nachtigall.\" (Awake, the dawn is drawing near; I hear, singing in the green grove, a blissful nightingale)In addition to this, Wagner added a scene drawn from his own life, in which a case of mistaken identity led to a near-riot: this was to be the basis for the finale of Act II.\n\nOut of this situation evolved an uproar, which through the shouting and clamour and an inexplicable growth in the number of participants in the struggle soon assumed a truly demoniacal character. It looked to me as if the whole town would break out into a riot...Then suddenly I heard a heavy thump, and as if by magic the whole crowd dispersed in every direction...One of the regular patrons had felled one of the noisiest rioters ... And it was the effect of this which had scattered everybody so suddenly.\nThis first draft of the story was dated \"Marienbad 16 July 1845\". Wagner later said, in Eine Mitteilung an meine Freunde (1851) (A Communication to my Friends) that Meistersinger was to be a comic opera to follow a tragic opera, i.e. Tannh\u00e4user. Just as the Athenians had followed a tragedy with a comic satyr play, so Wagner would follow Tannh\u00e4user with Meistersinger: the link being that both operas included song-contests."

Eduard Hanslick wrote in Die Neue Freie Presse after the premiere: \"Dazzling scenes of colour and splendour, ensembles full of life and character unfold before the spectator's eyes, hardly allowing him the leisure to weigh how much and how little of these effects is of musical origin.\"\nWithin a year of the premiere the opera was performed across Germany at Dresden, Dessau, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Weimar, Hanover, and in Vienna, with Berlin following in 1870. It was one of the most popular and prominent German operas during the Unification of Germany in 1871, and in spite of the opera's overall warning against cultural self-centeredness, Die Meistersinger became a potent symbol of patriotic German art. Hans Sachs's final warning at the end of Act III on the need to preserve German art from foreign threats was a rallying point for German nationalism, particularly during the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nDie Meistersinger was soon performed outside Germany as well, spreading throughout Europe and around the world:\nBohemia: 26 April 1871, Prague\nLivonia: 4 January 1872, Riga\nDenmark: 23 March 1872, Copenhagen (in Danish)\nNetherlands: 12 March 1879, Rotterdam\nUnited Kingdom: 30 May 1882, London, Drury Lane Theatre under Hans Richter.\nHungary: 8 September 1883, Budapest (in Hungarian)\nSwitzerland: 20 February 1885, Basel\nBelgium: 7 March 1885, Brussels (in French)\nUnited States: 4 January 1886, New York, Metropolitan Opera House under Anton Seidl.\nSweden: 2 April 1887, Stockholm (in Swedish)\nItaly: 26 December 1889, Milan (in Italian)\nSpain: 6 March 1894, Madrid, under Juan Goula (in Italian)\nPoland: 3 March 1896, Poznan\nFrance: 30 December 1896, Lyon (in French), Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon\nRussia: 15 March 1898, St. Petersburg (in German)\nArgentina: 6 August 1898, Buenos Aires, Teatro de la Opera\nPortugal: January 1902, Lisbon\nBrazil: 3 August 1905, Rio de Janeiro\nSouth Africa: 1913, Johannesburg\nFinland: 17 November 1921, Helsinki\nMonaco: February 1928, Monte Carlo\nYugoslavia: 15 June 1929, Zagreb\nAustralia: March 1933, Melbourne\nRomania: December 1934, BucharestAt the reopening of the Bayreuth Festival in 1924 following its closure during World War I Die Meistersinger was performed. The audience rose to its feet during Hans Sachs's final oration, and sang \"Deutschland \u00fcber Alles\" after the opera had finished.Die Meistersinger was frequently used as part of Nazi propaganda. On 21 March 1933, the founding of the Third Reich was celebrated with a performance of the opera in the presence of Adolf Hitler. The prelude to Act III is played over shots of old Nuremberg at the beginning of Triumph of the Will, the 1935 film by Leni Riefenstahl depicting the Nazi party congress of 1934. During World War II, Die Meistersinger was the only opera presented at the Bayreuth festivals of 1943\u20131944.\nThe association of Die Meistersinger with Nazism led to one of the most controversial stage productions of the work. The first Bayreuth production of Die Meistersinger following World War II occurred in 1956, when Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson, attempted to distance the work from German nationalism by presenting it in almost abstract terms, by removing any reference to Nuremberg from the scenery. The production was dubbed Die Meistersinger ohne N\u00fcrnberg (The Mastersingers without Nuremberg)."

        "content": "Beckmesser has been widely criticized as an antisemitic stereotype, ever since the idea was put forward by Theodor Adorno. Wagner scholar Barry Millington advanced the idea that Beckmesser represents a Jewish stereotype, whose humiliation by the Aryan Walther is an onstage representation of Wagner's antisemitism. Millington argued in his 1991 \"Nuremberg Trial: Is There Anti-Semitism in Die Meistersinger?\" that common antisemitic stereotypes prevalent in 19th-century Germany were a part of the \"ideological fabric\" of Die Meistersinger and that Beckmesser embodied these unmistakable antisemitic characteristics. Millington's article spurred significant debate among Wagner scholars including Charles Rosen, Hans Rudolph Vaget, Paul Lawrence Rose, and Karl A. Zaenker.In a 2009 interview, Katharina Wagner, the composer's great-granddaughter and co-director of the Bayreuth Festival, was asked whether she believed Wagner relied on Jewish stereotypes in his operas. Her response was, \"With Beckmesser he probably did.\" Nike Wagner, another of the composer's great-granddaughters, contends that Beckmesser is principally the victim of sadism, \"which is inseparable from the syndrome that also produces violent fascism\".Scholars Dieter Borchmeyer, Udo Bermbach and Hermann Danuser support the thesis that with the character of Beckmesser, Wagner did not intend to allude to Jewish stereotypes, but rather to criticize (academic) pedantism in general. They point out similarities to the figure of Malvolio in Shakespeare's comedy Twelfth Night.Although the score calls for Beckmesser to rush off in a huff after his self-defeating attempt to sing Walther's song, in some productions he remains and listens to Walther's correct rendition of his song, and shakes hands with Sachs after the final monologue.A related view holds that Beckmesser was designed to parody the renowned critic Eduard Hanslick, who valorized the music of Brahms and held Wagner's music in low regard.  We know that the original name of the Beckmesser character was \"Veit Hanslich,\" and we know that Wagner invited Hanslick to his initial reading of the libretto, though whether then the character still had the \"Hanslich\" name when Hanslick heard it is unclear.  This second interpretation of Beckmesser may dovetail with the antisemitism interpretation above, as Wagner attacked Hanslick as \"of gracefully concealed Jewish origin\" in his revised edition of his essay Jewishness in Music."

It was a period of changes in society. Hindemith describes: \"the old world exploded\".Das Nusch-Nuschi is based on a 1904 play by Franz Blei, subtitled \"A Play for Burmese Marionettes\". Blei was a Wagner enthusiast when he was young, but turned to contributing to the satirical weekly Simplicissimus and wrote plays for the cabaret Die Elf Scharfrichter (The Eleven Executioners), founded in Munich and focused on puppet satire. He had his Nusch-Nuschi reprinted in 1913 in an issue of Die Aktion that was dedicated to his work.While M\u00f6rder, Hoffnung der Frauen deals with brutality between the sexes, Das Nusch-Nuschi is in a way even \"more subversive\" as it ridicules brutality and intense emotions."

        "content": "He composed the work in 1920 and finished it on 14 August of that year. It is playful with elements of slapstick comedy, in contrast with the other two pieces of the triptych. The opera is in the tradition of commedia dell'arte with its stereotype characters. It is a satire on European drama and opera. Hindemith uses traditional musical forms, often in parody. A quote from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, Marke's \"Mir dies!\", was regarded as a sacrilege by some of Hindemith's contemporaries. Hindemith comments the third dance: \"The following 'choral fugue' (with all mod cons: augmentation, diminutions, stretto and basso ostinato) simply thank their existence to an unfortunate coincidence: they were conceived by the composer. They have no further purpose than this: to incorporate themselves stylishly into the framework of this picture and provide all 'experts' with the opportunity to bark about the incredibly bad taste of their creator. Hallelujah! \u2013 It is essential that this piece be danced (or rather wobbled to) by two eunuchs with incredibly fat and naked bellies.\"Hindemith also quotes from Till Eulenspiegel by Richard Strauss, and parodies the exotic sounds of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde, using celesta, mandolin, harp and English horn. He contrasts tender music with \"the screeches of two trained monkeys\", and parodies the \"neo-Baroque\" style of Max Reger with a grotesque \"choral fugue\"."

The libretto was adapted by Giambattista Varesco from a French text by Antoine Danchet, based on a 1705 play by Cr\u00e9billion p\u00e8re, which had been set to music by Andr\u00e9 Campra as Idom\u00e9n\u00e9e in 1712. Mozart and Varesco were commissioned in 1780 by Karl Theodor, Elector of Bavaria for a court carnival. He probably chose the subject, though it may have been Mozart.

The style of the choruses, marches, and ballets is very French, and the shipwreck scene towards the end of act 1 is almost identical to the structure and dramatic working-out of a similar scene in Gluck's Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride. The sacrifice and oracle scenes are similar to Gluck's Iphig\u00e9nie en Aulide and Alceste.\nKurt Kramer has suggested that Varesco was familiar with Calzabigi and therefore the work of Gluck, especially the latter's Alceste; much of what we see in Varesco's most dramatic passages is the latest French style, mediated by Calzabigi. It is thanks to Mozart, though, that this mixture of French styles (apart from a few choruses) moves away from Gluck and France and returns to its more Italian (opera seria) roots; the singers were all trained in the classical Italian style, after all, and the recitatives are all classically Italian."

        "content": "As per French tradition, the opera uses ballet to its advantage. Mozart wrote one to be performed in the opera (K. 367) which he considered more of a Lullian divertissement. It is in several parts and lasts around fifteen minutes.\nThe structure is as follows. The first four dances transition into each other, while the last three are separate.\n\nChaconne (Allegro) in D major, 34\nAnnonce (Larghetto) in B-flat major, 34\nChaconne qui reprenda (Allegro, starts in D minor, then goes to D major), 34\nPas seul (Largo) in D major \u2014 Allegretto (attacca), 34 \u2014 Piu Allegro (attacca), 34 \u2014 Piu allegro (attacca), 34\nPassepied in B-flat, 38\nGavotte in G, 22\nPassacaille in E-flat major, 34 (unfinished)The ballet is scored for the opera's full orchestra of flutes, oboes, clarinets (only present in the passacaille), bassoons, horns, trumpets, timpani, and strings. It showcases the many famous techniques of the Mannheim orchestra, including stupefying crescendos and tutti passages. Throughout the manuscript, Mozart wrote the dancers who would be partaking in a specific section of the ballet; id est, \"Pas seul de Mad. Falgera\", or \"Pas seul de Mr. [Jean-Pierre] Le Grand\", who was the main choreographer for the opera's Munich premiere.\nIt is unclear exactly where Mozart had intended the divertissement to occur in the opera. In the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe, Harald Heckmann suggests that it was performed after the first act, but Daniel Heartz states that it must have been performed after the final chorus of the third and last act, citing the majesty and pomposity of the D major Pas seul, perfect for concluding an opera.\nAlong with the Chaconne up to the Pas seul, which form a consistent whole via attacca transitions, the manuscript is bound with three other dances; a passepied in B-flat, a gavotte in G (which is rather famous; Tchaikovsky conducted it at one of his Russian Musical Society concerts), and an unfinished passacaille in E-flat. Due to the separation from the first half of the ballet, as well as the incomplete status of them, Daniel Heartz speculates that they were simply never performed.Gluck's influence on Mozart is demonstrated as the Chaconne begins with a musical quotation from Gluck's ballet from Iphig\u00e9nie en Aulide."

        "content": "It was first performed at the Cuvilli\u00e9s Theatre of the Munich Residenz on 29 January 1781, under the musical direction of Christian Cannabich. The opera apparently owed much of its success at its first performance to the set designs: a notice in the Munich press did not mention Mozart by name but said (translation): \"The author, composer and translator are all natives of Salzburg; the decors, among which the view of the port and Neptune's temple were outstanding, were masterpieces by our renowned theatre designer, court Councillor Lorenzo Quaglio, and everyone admired them tremendously.\" Idomeneo was Mozart's first mature opera, in which he \u2013 unique among composers \u2013 for the first time and continuing this for all his subsequent operas, ended the work in the key of the overture. With Idomeneo, he demonstrated a mastery of orchestral color, accompanied recitatives, and melodic line. Mozart fought with the librettist, the court chaplain Varesco, making large cuts and changes, even down to specific words and vowels disliked by the singers (too many \"i\"s in \"rinvigorir\", which in Italian are pronounced as in bee).Idomeneo was performed three times in Munich. Later in 1781 Mozart considered (but did not put into effect) revisions that would have brought the work closer into line with Gluck's style; this would have meant a bass Idomeneo and a tenor Idamante.\nA concert performance was given in 1786 at the Palais Auersperg in Vienna. For this, Mozart wrote some new music, made some cuts, and changed Idamante from a castrato to a tenor.\nThe British premiere was given by the amateur Glasgow Grand Opera Society in 1934. The first performance in the United States was produced by Boris Goldovsky at the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood during the summer of 1947.Today Idomeneo is part of the standard operatic repertoire. There are several recordings of it (see below), and it is regularly performed.\nIn 2006 there was a controversy over the cancelling of a 2003 production directed by Hans Neuenfels at the Deutsche Oper Berlin (see 2006 Idomeneo controversy)."

I have used many of the Faroese melodies in it, but the introduction and ending are free composition.\" He then goes on to describe the voyage: \"I begin by describing the sea, as you feel it during the crossing \u2013 the monotonous mighty sea. It is quiet, but I think that it is precisely when the sea is calm that you most strongly sense its terrible depth... its depth and endlessness at the same time. During the voyage, we suddenly hear a bird cry that makes us think that we are near land. Of course, generally speaking, I am no great lover of programme music, but this time I think that the occasion called for a programme for the journey... some people on board now seem to see land, they get enthusiastic, a fanfare tells you, but the mist obscures the view, and it quietens down again. Then new bird cries rise up, and the land looms ahead. The music grows in volume and seriousness and breaks into a Faroese melody; on the shore many people are waiting to welcome us, and we hear them shouting and stamping. With no explanatory transition, I now place the traveller in the midst of a feast, with singing and dancing. I depict this feast in powerful music, where the ballad motifs play a role \u2013 and the depiction of the feast is interrupted by a Faroese folk tune. It calms down the music for a moment, creates a mood of gentleness amidst the dancing. But again, the feast livens up to dancing and merriment, until the end \u2013 then it all subsides in one long note, a very low clarinet note that quietly fades away...\nWhen asked how he became acquainted with Faroese tunes, Nielsen explained: \n\nThey have interested me for many years. I knew Hjalmar Thuren, who collected many of them out there, getting people to sing them for him, and I have studied Dr. Gr\u00fcner-Nielsen's large collection. Many of the songs are very beautiful, and they have a wealth of songs on the Faroe Islands. They are often closely related to the Danish ones, but with small variations \u2013 just as there are variants of the old texts that Svend Grundtvig collected. But some of the melodies also have their own tone. It\u2019s borne up by a certain quiet seriousness. It reminds me of people who go around quietly and yet have a strong effect on others because behind the calm you sense solid substance. You can\u2019t call Faroese song melancholy \u2013 rather, it gives the impression of a mind that is resigned to the will of Fate. It is these melodies that I have had as material... they have set the tone for my overture. I did not create so much of it myself through any spiritual experience, and yet the work has filled me with pleasure. I have tried to offer some of the same spirit that the painter or sculptor creates when he places his abilities at the service of applied art.\nThe programme for the concert listed the following subtitles for the work:\nThe Calm Sea\nThe Land on Arrival\nDancing and Singing\nFarewell\nCalm at SeaA typical performance lasts a little over ten minutes.\n\n\n== References =="

Events developed dramatically over the five-week period, and although broadly similar in themes, each speech addressed a different military and diplomatic context.\nIn this speech, Churchill had to describe a great military disaster, and warn of a possible invasion attempt by Nazi Germany, without casting doubt on eventual victory. He also had to prepare his domestic audience for France's falling out of the war without in any way releasing France to do so, and wished to reiterate a policy and an aim unchanged \u2013 despite the intervening events \u2013 from his speech of 13 May, in which he had declared the goal of \"victory, however long and hard the road may be\"."

        "content": "Winston Churchill took over as Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, eight months after the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He had done so as the head of a multiparty coalition government, which had replaced the previous government (led by Neville Chamberlain) as a result of dissatisfaction with the conduct of the war, demonstrated by the Norway debate on the Allied evacuation of Southern Norway.Coincidentally, the German Wehrmacht offensive in the Low Countries and France had begun on 10 May with the invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Churchill had spoken to the House of Commons as Prime Minister for the first time on 13 May, to announce the formation of the new administration:\n\nI would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined this Government: \"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.\" \nIn that speech, he mentioned nothing about the military situation in France and the Low Countries.\nExpecting that the German offensive would develop along much the same lines as it did in 1914, the lines of communication of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) did not run through the \"short crossing\" Channel ports \u2013 Boulogne, Calais, Dunkirk, etc. \u2013 but rather through Dieppe and Le Havre. On 13 May, the Wehrmacht's attack through the Ardennes had reached the Meuse River at Sedan and then crossed it, breaking through the defences of the French Army. By 20 May, Wehrmacht armoured divisions had reached the coast of the English Channel at Abbeville, splitting the BEF and the French First Army from the main French forces.The Wehrmacht next moved against the cut-off Allied forces, moving along the seacoast with only small Allied forces to resist them. After the capitulation of Belgium on 28 May, a gap had also appeared on the eastern flank of the Allied forces, which had been forced to retreat into a small pocket around the seaport of Dunkirk. From this pocket the bulk of the BEF and a considerable number of French troops had been evacuated in Operation Dynamo, but these troops had left behind virtually all of their heavy equipment (transport, tanks, artillery and ammunition). The French First Army had most of its units pocketed around Lille. Those of its units evacuated from Dunkirk were relanded in France, but saw no further action; they were still being reorganised in Brittany at the fall of France.Churchill had made a brief statement to the Commons on 28 May reporting the Belgian capitulation, and concluding: \n\nMeanwhile, the House should prepare itself for hard and heavy tidings. I have only to add that nothing which may happen in this battle can in any way relieve us of our duty to defend the world cause to which we have vowed ourselves; nor should it destroy our confidence in our power to make our way, as on former occasions in our history, through disaster and through grief to the ultimate defeat of our enemies.\nHe had promised a further statement of the military situation on 4 June, and indeed the major part of the speech is an account of military events \u2013 so far as they affected the BEF \u2013 since the German breakthrough at Sedan.\nThe German breakthrough had not been exploited southwards, and the French had improvised a relatively thinly held defensive line along the Aisne and the Somme. The British military evaluation was that this was unlikely to withstand any major attack by the Wehrmacht. In the air, the French were short of fighter planes, and the shortage was worsening due to their many losses in combat. The French military commanders had hence asked for additional British fighter squadrons to be sent into the fight in France. Politically, there were considerable doubts over the French willingness to continue the war, even in the absence of any further military catastrophes. Churchill had argued in favour of sending the fighter squadrons to France because he considered that that move would be vital to sustain French public morale, and also to give no excuse for the collapse of the French Army. That would possibly lead to a French government that would not only drop out of the war, but also become hostile to the United Kingdom. The British War Cabinet discussed this issue at meetings on 3 June and on the morning of 4 June, but it decided to take the advice of the Royal Air Force and the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, that the British priority must be to prepare its own defences. The three squadrons present in France would be kept up to fighting strength, but no further squadrons could be spared for the Battle of France.Despite relief that the bulk of the BEF had made it back to Britain, Mass-Observation reported civilian morale in many areas as zero, one observer claiming that everyone looked suicidal. Only half the population expected Britain to fight on, and the feelings of thousands were summed up as: \n\nThis is not our war \u2013 this is a war of the high-up people who use long words and have different feelings.\nTherefore, when talking about the future course and conduct of the war in this speech, Churchill had to describe a great military disaster, and warn of a possible German invasion attempt, without casting doubt on eventual victory. He needed to prepare his domestic audience for France's departure from the war without in any way releasing France to do so. In his subsequent speech of 18 June, immediately after the French had sued for peace, Churchill said:\n\nThe military events which have happened during the past fortnight have not come to me with any sense of surprise. Indeed, I indicated a fortnight ago as clearly as I could to the House that the worst possibilities were open, and I made it perfectly clear then that whatever happened in France would make no difference to the resolve of Britain and the British Empire to fight on, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.\nFinally, he needed to reiterate a policy and an aim unchanged \u2013 despite the intervening events \u2013 from his speech of 13 May, in which he had said:\n\nWe have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land, and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be."

In the days of Napoleon, of which I was speaking just now, the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous man\u0153uvre. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye. We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to air power if it can be locally exercised.\nI have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government \u2013 every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.\n\nEven though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender. And even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the Old.\nIt is often said that in the sentence that begins \"We shall fight on the beaches\" and ends in \"surrender\", only the last word \u2013 \"surrender\" \u2013 does not have Old English roots."

R. Knickerbocker wrote that its words \"deserve to be memorized by us all\", observing that \"With Churchill's picture these words are placarded in homes and offices throughout the British Empire.\"No audio record was made at the time of the original speech; Churchill only produced an audio recording in 1949, by repeating his previous oration. Despite this, many people after the war misremembered that they had heard Churchill speaking on the radio in 1940 when all there had been were BBC news reports that quoted his words. In 1984, English heavy metal band Iron Maiden mixed a section of this recording at the beginning of the video for their song \"Aces High\", which is inspired by the Battle of Britain, also using the recording as the introduction to the song when performed on stage, Iron Maiden also use this section as a beginning for many live shows namely during their 1984 World Slavery Tour.

The work was commissioned to celebrate the victory of the Republic of Venice over the Turks during the siege of Corfu: in July 1716, the Turks had landed on Corfu and set siege to the island. The population resisted the occupation and, in August, Venice signed an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor. On 18 August, under the leadership of Count Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg, the decisive battle was won and the Turks abandoned the island.\nAlthough widely reported to have been performed at the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 in November 1716, the victorious General Schulenburg could not have been in the audience of any performance prior to January 3, 1717."

Salvadore Cammarano wrote the Italian-language libretto loosely based upon Sir Walter Scott's 1819 historical novel The Bride of Lammermoor.Donizetti wrote Lucia di Lammermoor in 1835, when he was reaching the peak of his reputation as an opera composer. Gioachino Rossini had recently retired and Vincenzo Bellini had died shortly before the premiere of Lucia leaving Donizetti as \"the sole reigning genius of Italian opera\". Not only were conditions ripe for Donizetti's success as a composer, but there was also a widespread interest in the history and culture of Scotland. The perceived romance of its violent wars and feuds, as well as its folklore and mythology, intrigued 19th century readers and audiences. Walter Scott dramatized these elements in his novel The Bride of Lammermoor, which inspired several musical works including Lucia.The story concerns the emotionally fragile Lucy Ashton (Lucia) who is caught in a feud between her own family and that of the Ravenswoods. The setting is the Lammermuir Hills of Scotland (Lammermoor) in the 17th century."

        "content": "After Lucia di Lammermoor was produced in Paris, a French version in four acts was commissioned for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance in Paris. Donizetti was living there at the time, preparing the revision of Poliuto into its French version (which became Les Martyrs). Lucie opened on 6 August 1839 and this version toured extensively throughout France.  The libretto, written by Alphonse Royer and Gustave Va\u00ebz, is not simply a translation, as Donizetti altered some of the scenes and characters. One of the more notable changes is the disappearance of Alisa, Lucia's handmaid and confidante. This allows the French version to isolate Lucia, thus increasing the story's emotional impact. Furthermore, Lucia loses most of Raimondo's support; his role is dramatically diminished while Arturo's is increased. Donizetti also added a new character, Gilbert, who is loosely based on the huntsman in the Italian version. However, Gilbert is a more developed figure who serves both Edgardo and Enrico, divulging their secrets to the other for money.\nThe French version is performed far less frequently than the Italian, but it was revived to great acclaim by Natalie Dessay and Roberto Alagna at the Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon in 2002. It was co-produced by the Boston Lyric Opera and the Glimmerglass Opera. Sarah Coburn sang the title role as her first \"Lucia\" in this French version in 2005. In 2008 Lucie was produced by the Cincinnati Opera with Coburn again in the title role."

Among these, two of the French versions and one of the original Italian edition are translated into English. The earliest complete recording was made in 1929 with Lorenzo Molajoli conducting the La Scala Orchestra and Chorus and Mercedes Capsir in the title role. There are several recordings with Maria Callas in the title role, including two studio versions conducted by Tullio Serafin (1953 and 1959) and two live versions by Herbert von Karajan (1954 and 1955). Joan Sutherland, who was particularly noted for performances as Lucia, has also been recorded in the role several times including a 1971 Decca Records recording conducted by Richard Bonynge with Luciano Pavarotti as Edgardo. In 2002, Chandos Records released the English version with David Parry conducting and Elizabeth Futral as Lucia. Several video recordings have also been released, including one in French. Charles Mackerras returned to Donizetti's autograph score and prepared a new edition of the score. He returned to the original key structure and the Mad Scene is quite different. He recorded this version for Sony in 1997. Another noteworthy recording is Diana Damrau's along with Joseph Calleja in the role of Edgardo and Ludovic T\u00e9zier as Enrico."

The libretto is by Vittorio Amedeo Cigna-Santi, after Giuseppe Parini's Italian translation of Jean Racine's play Mithridate.\nMozart wrote Mitridate while touring Italy in 1770. The musicologist Daniel E. Freeman has demonstrated that it was composed with close reference to the opera La Nitteti by Josef Myslive\u010dek. The latter was the opera being prepared for production in Bologna when Mozart met Myslive\u010dek for the first time with his father in March 1770. Myslive\u010dek visited the Mozarts frequently in Bologna during the summer of 1770 while Wolfgang was working on Mitridate. Mozart gained expertise in composition from his older friend and also incorporated some of his musical motifs into his own operatic setting. The opera was first performed at the Teatro Regio Ducale, Milan, on 26 December 1770 (at the Milan Carnival). It was a success, performed 21 times despite doubts because of Mozart's extreme youth \u2013 he was 14 at the time. No revival took place until the 20th century. The opera features virtuoso arias for the principal roles, but only two ensemble numbers: the act 2 ending duet between Aspasia and Sifare (\"Se viver non degg\u2019io\"), and the brief quintet that ends the opera in a manner characteristic of standard baroque opera seria where the opera ends with a short coro or tutti number."

        "content": "The libretto is by Christian Lehnert and deals in an innovative way with the story of Phaedra, whose love for her stepson Hippolytus triggers catastrophe. The first part of the opera tells this legend much as previously retold by Euripides, Racine and Sarah Kane. The second part, however, follows a mythological tradition alluded to by Ovid. Hippolytus, fatally wounded, is brought back to life by the goddess Artemis, and is given a new life under the name of Virbius. In this new existence, however, he is only able to experience his own consciousness in a fragmentary, kaleidoscopic way.\nThe first act is rooted in Greece, and Greek myth. The second, composed after Henze's collapse and two-month coma, is set in Nemi, near Henze's home in Italy, and the location of the ancient cult and priesthood of Virbius (which inspired Sir James Frazer to write The Golden Bough). As the struggles of the goddesses and the identity of Hippolyt become gradually more and more abstract and remote, the wholeness of nature reasserts itself, and the Minotaur, in Henze's words, \"proclaims a kind of freedom, the spring comes... into the world and the woods.\" In its latter stages, the opera seems to abstract itself even from the stage, treading \"a metaphysical tightrope between this world and the next, effortlessly invoking a porous divide between the living and the dead. The opera's end is both transcendental and inconclusive: \"We are all born naked. We press towards mortality and dance,\" sings the Minotaur in his final hymn.\""

The role of the goddess Artemis was sung by the countertenor Axel K\u00f6hler, an interesting example both of Henze's fondness for and stylistic affinity with Baroque conventions (in this case that of the travesti) and of his blissfully unconventional approach to gender and sexuality (as its name implies, the tradition of the breeches role is for a woman to play the part of a man).\nThe concept of a 'concert opera' inspired Eliasson (in his first work for the operatic stage), Mussbach and Skodzig to seek to develop 'a new kind of theatrical evening, reflecting and profoundly questioning the actualities of our way of looking at the world'."

The play was originally commissioned by the Eureka Theatre Company, but premiered at Arena Stage on May 10, 1985.In the play, the trial itself is on trial in the court of theater, and is found guilty of a miscarriage of justice. In the actual trial, White was convicted only of a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, rather than two counts of first-degree murder; he was sentenced to less than eight years in prison. The dialogue mentions the urban legend that White's defense strategy was primarily the so-called \"Twinkie defense\"\u2014painting his junk food consumption as a significant factor in his capacity for murder.\nThe play's Broadway premiere was on March 13, 1986. John Spencer played the role of Dan White. Also among the cast were Wesley Snipes, Stanley Tucci, Mary McDonnell, and Earle Hyman. The set was designed by Ming Cho Lee, costumes by Jennifer von Mayrhauser, lighting by Pat Collins.Execution of Justice won the HBO New Plays USA award, the Helen Hayes Award, the Bay Area Critics Circle Award. It was nominated for a Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Award. In 1999, Showtime Networks aired a film adaptation of the play, directed by Leon Ichaso and adapted by screenwriter Michael Butler. In 2000, the film won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV Movie or Limited Series."

It was based on a libretto by Angelo Anelli for Stefano Pavesi's opera Ser Marcantonio written in 1810 but, on the published libretto, the author appears as \"M.A.\"\nDonizetti so dominated the preparation of the libretto that Ruffini refused to allow his name to be put on the score. This resulted in confusion over the identity of the librettist for more than half a century, but as Herbert Weinstock establishes, it was largely Ruffini's work and, in withholding his name from it as librettist, \"Donizetti or [his assistant] Accursi may have thought that, lacking Ruffini's name, the authorship might as well be assigned to Accursi's initials as to a pseudonym\".The opera was first performed on 3 January 1843 by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour in Paris with great success and it is generally regarded as being the high point of the 19th century opera buffa tradition and, in fact, marking its ending."

        "content": "Donizetti had just returned to Paris from Vienna in the autumn of 1842 and it was there that it was suggested to him by Jules Janin, the newly appointed director of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien, that he might compose a new opera for that house.  Janin prepared a formal proposal on 27 September, but while no specific subject nor title was mentioned, Janin suggested that it should be a new opera buffa tailored to the talents of some major singers including Giulia Grisi, Antonio Tamburini, and Luigi Lablache. At around the same time in September, the Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 librettist Giovanni Ruffini, who lived in Paris, was approached by Michele Accursi (who is described as \"Donizetti's Paris factotum, [an] Italian exile, and politically treacherous double agent\" ) with the suggestion that Ruffini offer his services to Donizetti as a librettist. This is confirmed by a letter from Ruffini to his mother of around 5 October in which the librettist tells her of Accursi's suggestion that the composer would use a story which was written in 1810 and that he would need \"a working stonemason of verses to remake the old libretto, to cut, change, add, plaster, and I don't know what.\"  In addition, it is clear from another letter on 11 October to his mother that Ruffini is hard at work: \"I've been eating up the paper, as they say.  It's not a question of doing it well or doing it badly, but of doing it fast.\"  By the end, Ruffini stated that so much of the refinement of the work had been done by Donizetti that he felt that \"my freedom of action having been paralyzed by the maestro, I don't, so to say, recognize it as mine\".  Therefore, he refused to have his name associated with the libretto, which was eventually published by Casa Ricordi as by \"M.A.\", since it was Accursi who officially ceded the rights to Ricordi so long as his name was never associated with the work.In the tradition of opera buffa, the opera makes reference to the stock characters of the commedia dell'arte. Pasquale is recognizable as the blustery Pantalone, Ernesto as the lovesick Pierrot, Malatesta as the scheming Scapino, and Norina as a wily Columbina. The false Notary echoes a long line of false officials as operatic devices.\nWith rehearsals in progress in December 1842, it appeared that there was general pessimism as to its success: \"the atmosphere during rehearsals was frigid\" states Weinstock and records the lack of interest from the management and the orchestra musicians. \"The work had been condemned, judged\", he concludes.  However, during the evening of the final dress rehearsal, Donizetti added a new piece which he had already written for the tenor, Com'\u00e8 gentil, which was designed for the third act. As for fears for the opera's success, the composer had none: \"Have no fear for me...My work will be a success\", he stated."

Its first performance in Vienna was at the K\u00e4rtnertortheater (in Italian) on 14 May 1843, a production in which Donizetti participated and added the comic baritone duet \"Cheti, cheti, immantinente\" from a discarded portion of his unperformed opera L'Ange de Nisida. In England it was first presented on 29 June 1843 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London (in Italian).The opera was translated into French by Gustave Va\u00ebz and Alphonse Royer and given in Brussels on 11 August 1843, Lille on 9 November 1843, and at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Orl\u00e9ans in New Orleans on 7 January 1845.

Kaufman and Marc Connelly.\nThe play is a parody of the expressionistic parables that were popular at the time; its title derives from the proverb \"Set a beggar on horseback, and he'll ride at a gallop,\" \"Set a beggar on horseback, and he'll ride to hell,\" or \"Set a beggar on horseback, and he will ride to the devil,\" meaning that if you give wealth to the undeserving, they will be the worse for it.  The play rails against the perils of trading one's artistic talents for commercial gain. At its core is Neil McRae, a poor, young classical composer. Concerned about how hard he is working at odd jobs to meet his financial obligations, his friends - a doctor visiting from back home and his neighbor, Cynthia Mason, in whom he has more than a passing interest - urge him to marry Gladys Cady, whose father is a wealthy industrialist. However, the man also favors the Tin Pan Alley school of musical composition, to which McRae is staunchly opposed. Conflict arises when he is offered a job making widgets at a substantial salary if he agrees to give up his \"foolish\" interest in the classics.\nThe original Broadway production opened on February 12, 1924 at the Broadhurst Theatre, where it ran for 223 performances. The cast included Roland Young, Osgood Perkins, Spring Byington, and Frederic Richard Sullivan.\nThe play was revived with most of the original cast a mere seven months later, opening on March 23, 1925, at the Shubert Theatre, where it ran for 16 performances.\nForty-five years later, after 13 previews, another revival opened on May 14, 1970, at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, where it ran for 52 performances. The cast included Leonard Frey and Susan Watson."

        "content": "K\u00f6nig Ottokars Gl\u00fcck und Ende is a tragedy in five acts written by Franz Grillparzer in 1823. Based on the historical events surrounding the life of Ottokar II of Bohemia, the play deals with the fall of the king from the height of his powers to his death, having lost most of his supporters and lands, largely through his own actions.\nGrillparzer had originally wanted to write a tragedy about Napoleon, however, fearing censorship from Austrian authorities, instead used King Ottokar II of Bohemia (1253\u20131278) as the central figure, as there were a number of parallels in personality traits and circumstances.\nThe play was completed in 1823, but publication was delayed by censorship issues, notably the \"unfortunate allusion to Napoleon's second marriage to Marie-Louise of Austria, and its unfavourable portrayal of Bohemia\". The wife of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, Caroline Augusta of Bavaria read the play and urged her husband to allow it to be publicly performed, which took place for the first time on February 19, 1825 in Vienna's Burgtheater.\nThe play's nationalistic themes in particular were criticised when first released, and remain controversial today. However the tight focus on the personal tragedy of Ottokar, at once the cause and the victim of events around him, as well as the elegance of the verse, has maintained the popularity of the play among students and audiences to the present."

        "content": "The tragedy begins in the year 1261. Ottokar is at the height of his powers, having recently defeated the Hungarians at the Battle of Kressenbrunn, and the play opens with news that Ottokar is divorcing from his wife Margarete, on the grounds that she cannot bear an heir, and that they are in any case distantly related. Instead, he is to marry Kunigunde, young relative of the Hungarian King Bela, news which breaks the heart of Berta, one of Margarete's most beautiful ladies-in-waiting who Ottokar had previously seduced, as well as alienating her family, the Rosenbergs. Despite revealing that she never loved Ottokar, and only married him after the death of her first husband out of a sense of duty, Margarete is nevertheless deeply upset by this rejection and betrayal, although still waives her rights to retain the lands of Austria and Styria inherited from her first marriage.\nOttokar then marries Kunigunde, who becomes his new queen, despite the age difference. Meanwhile, Zawisch Rosenberg is struck by her beauty, and sets out to seduce her behind Ottokar's back. Kunigunde, unimpressed by Ottokar's age and personality, is attracted by Zawisch and encourages his advances. Unaware of this, Ottokar is provisionally offered the crown of Holy Roman Emperor, however haughtily replies that he will take time to consider the offer. In this intervening period, a letter is rushed to an influential figure among the electors, the Archbishop of Mainz, outlining Ottokar's treatment of Margarete, and the crown is instead offered to the more worthy but lowly Duke Rudolf von Habsburg. In addition, it is announced that the states of Austria and Styria are deemed to have not been passed onto Ottokar following his divorce from Margarete.\nOttokar is enraged by both these decisions, and both sides draw up forces on the banks of the Danube. Ottokar's chancellor persuades him to meet with the Emperor on an island on the Danube to discuss reconciliation. During these discussions, Ottokar indicates he is prepared pay homage to the imperial crown in the interests of peace, but is not prepared to concede his lands. However it is made clear to him that he his behaviour towards Merenberg and Margerete has alienated both Austrian and Styrian subjects, who now transfer their support to Rudolf. As a result, Ottokar is forced to withdraw his claims and be content with retaining the regions of Moravia and Bohemia. The ceremony for this requires him to kneel before Rudolf, and in the interests of decorum this is performed in a tented area. However, the mischievous Zawisch cuts the ropes of the tent, revealing Ottokar on his knees before his enemy, to all in attendance, including his own army.\nOttokar then goes into hiding for two weeks, before returning to Prague weakened and in shame. On his return, representatives of the Emperor arrive demanding the release of a number of prisoners, one of the conditions of the peace treaty. At first Ottokar acquiesces, however on seeing Merenberg among the prisoners, his anger is piqued, and instead he tears up the treaty and demands that Merenberg be executed as a traitor, for his role in communicating the letter to the Archbishop of Mainz, and act which Ottokar considers to have been the starting point of all the subsequent betrayals. Merenberg is then executed by Ottokar's men, by flinging him from a tower.\nOttokar is then spurned by Kunigunde, who openly tells him she has no respect for a man who kneels before his enemies. This further humiliation, spurs Ottokar to raise an army against all who defy him, attempting to restore his lost lands, power, and dignity. Kunigunde then flees with Zawisch, to seek protection from the Emperor Rudolf.\nOn the eve of the battle with Rudolf's armies, Ottokar stumbles upon the deathbed of his former wife Margarete. Seeing her dead, having suffered at his hands, he regrets his treatment of her. As the battle draws up, Ottokar's remaining loyal lords urge him to act decisively to make the best of his strategic strengths, however he is by now hesitant and incapable of decisive action, as he begins to become aware of his tragic failings. Meanwhile, Emperor Rudolf, recognising with pity how so many of Ottokar's supporters have deserted him (including Kunigunde and Zawisch), orders that no one should kill Ottokar in battle other than in self-defence. However, when Seyfried von Merenberg encounters Ottokar on the battlefield, he seeks revenge for the death of his father, and forces Ottokar, lame through injury, into a fight, in which Ottokar is killed. On the battlefield, Rudolf, founder of the Habsburg dynasty, bequeaths the states of Styria and Austria to his children, and is hailed as a noble and gracious victor by all."

        "content": "The play is very much focused on the central character Ottokar, his personality, and how he becomes the victim of his own actions. At the start of the play, he is at the height of his powers. He has proven himself on the battlefield, and has been hailed by all as a hero. However he is incapable of moderating his emotions or actions, and feels beyond reproach in all that he does, and loses the ability to distinguish right from wrong, loyalty from treachery, and what is reasonable from what is unreasonable.\nWe do not see Ottokar during his rise to power, however the implications are that the same essential traits that propelled him forward are, when unmoderated, those that bring him down: his sense of greatness and historical importance in the world mark him out as a mighty leader, yet also lead him to see others as merely pawns in his personal game; his pride is clearly a strong motivating factor for him, but also clouds his judgement; he is a determined warrior, yet does not know when to fight and when to resort to diplomacy.\nInevitably, the other characters in the play are less fully examined, and are defined more by the reaction that they bring about in Ottokar than having real depth in themselves. Margerete, Berta, and Seyfried Merenberg are in their own ways loyal to Ottokar, however they are all turned against him when he does not return their loyalty. Zawisch and Kunigunde are duplicitous, and yet Ottokar places much faith in them, and is most hurt when they betray him as his star falls. Rudolf is everything a good leader should be, yet Ottokar is not: strong yet just, noble yet humble, peace-loving yet not afraid to fight when he needs to. Perhaps inevitably, given the context of when the play was written, his status is too simply that of a paragon of leadership, a thinly-veiled attempt to praise the Habsburg dynasty still ruling in Austria at the time."

        "content": "The plot of the play follows the decline in the fortunes of Ottokar, and points to the causal relationship between his behaviour towards others, and the consequences for himself: Ottokar's treatment of Margarete costs him the crown of Holy Roman Emperor; by spurning Berta, he alienates the Rosenbergs, who are then able to undermine him (particularly Zawisch) in numerous ways, none more so than by ensuring the letter to the Archbishop of Mainz reaches its destination; by executing Merenberg, he drives Seyfried to kill him in revenge; and by failing to respond rationally to the peace treaties of Rudolf, he instigates a war with disastrous consequences for him and his people. Grillparzer was keen to emphasise that in historical tragedy, man is not merely the victim of circumstances or fate, but has the power to carve out his own destiny.Grillparzer contrasts Ottokar actions with those of Rudolf, which show that by being a good and just leader, it is possible to create unity among rival factions, to inspire true loyalty, and to be victorious.\nHowever, for lesser characters, this causal relationship is less clear, for instance in the case of 'good' characters such as Margerete and 'innocent' ones such as Berta, both of whom are victims of Ottokar's egotism and self-interest, along with Merenberg and his son, who are turned away from Ottokar simply for standing up against his wrongdoings. Meanwhile, Zawisch and Kunigunde appear to benefit from following their own desires despite behaving in a thoroughly immoral fashion."

        "content": "Grillparzer felt that a true historical context was important to a tragedy's ability to create 'a certain consistency and appearance of reality, which in turn would evoke in the audience a greater sympathy with the tragic hero. However he also recognised that it was also necessary to depart from the facts in order to highlight the dramatic themes.\nAlthough we are not given an explicit timeline in the play, the insinuation is that the events unfold over a relatively short period (perhaps a few months, or even years). Historically, a full 22 years separates the aftermath of the Battle of Kressenbrunn in 1260 with Ottokar's death in 1278 and Rudolf von Habsburg bequeathing the lands of Austria and Styria to his sons in 1282.\nGrillparzer also embellishes historical sources in other ways, particularly in imbuing motives: in the play, Ottokar's desire for an heir,  merely cloaks his lust for Kunigunde. He had previously enticed away Berta, a young noblewoman, from Seyfried von Merenberg, whom he makes the son of Siegfried, who figures in the \"Chronicle.\" His desertion of Berta had arrayed against him the hostility of the three Rosenbergs, powerful and unscrupulous Bohemian nobles \u2013 Benesch, the father, Milota, the uncle, and Zawisch, the cousin, of Bertha. Zawisch, impelled mainly by desire to wreak vengeance upon the king, seeks to gain the affection of the queen. Ottokar's treatment of Margaret alienates from him the nobles of Austria and Styria. The indignities heaped upon them open the eyes of the delegates who have come to offer him the imperial crown. His overweening pride in ostensibly disdaining the title of emperor prepares the way for his final downfall."

        "content": "The context of the writing of the drama was very much shaped by Grillparzer's relationship with the Austrian state in which he lived. Inspired by the initial desire to write a tragedy about Napoleon, Grillparzer realised that the heavy-handed state censors of the Metternich regime would never allow him to use such a sensitive subject. By choosing a figure from the 13th century, whose rise and fall in many ways echoed that of Napoleon, Grillparzer hoped he would avoid censorial intervention. In addition, partly out of a sense of genuine patriotism, but also partly to make the play yet more favourable to Austrian authorities, Grillparzer includes various pro-Habsburg elements in his drama. These include: the character of Rudolf himself, founder of the Habsburg dynasty still ruling in the 19th century; the message that, under a just ruler, the disparate states of Austria-Hungary could successfully be part of a united empire (at a time when this empire was starting to creak at the joints); and not least in the monologue of Otto von Hornek in Act III, since known as the 'Praise of Austria' ('die Lobrede auf \u00d6sterreich'), which has been taught in isolation to many generations of Austrian schoolchildren since.In the context of subsequent historical events, notably the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of World War I, and the rise of German nationalism leading to World War II, such overt patriotism seems not only anachronistic and out of place but also potentially unpalatable to modern tastes.\nAt the time, these themes failed to achieve Grillparzer's aims of become the nation's favourite playwright. Not only did the censors suppress publication of the play for 2 years on the grounds of its 'unfavourable allusion to Napoleon's second marriage to Maria-Louise of Austria and unfavourable portrayal of Bohemia', but critical reception was mixed after its eventual public performance (a result of the direct intervention of Caroline Auguste of Bavaria). Pro-Habsburg critics pointed out that Rudolf had only a minor role compared to Ottokar, while in turn the Czechs disapproved that the play depicts their national hero in a negative light"

        "content": "Euridice was created for the marriage of King Henry IV of France and Maria de Medici. The composition is typically considered to be the second work of modern opera, and the first such musical drama to survive to the present day. (The first, Dafne, was written by the same authors in 1597.)\nSince both the libretto and score were dedicated to the new Queen of France, Marie de' Medici, some scholars have recognized a possible parallel between Euridice and Orfeo and the Queen and King of France.  While the comparison is readily made, some scholars argue that the traits of King Henry IV are different from Orfeo, especially with respect to Orfeo's most famous deed. Orfeo loved Euridice so much that he journeyed to Hell and back, quite literally, to unite once more with his beloved wife while King Henry IV wouldn't travel as far as Florence to retrieve Medici.At the premiere, many of the other roles were filled by members of Caccini's entourage, including his daughter Francesca Caccini. Peri composed all of the music for the first production, but owing to the integral involvement of Caccini and his performers, some of Peri's music was finally replaced by that of Caccini. When Caccini discovered that Peri intended to publish the opera with the added Caccini pieces,  he rushed to finish his own version of Euridice using the same libretto, and managed to have his published before Peri's. In his preface, Peri notes that all of the music was completed by the date of the first performance earning his efforts the designation Prima Euridice.\nIn creating the music for Euridice, Peri envisioned a vocal style that is half sung and half spoken. For less dramatic parts he created vocal lines close to the style of spoken language set over a sustained accompaniment. For impassioned scenes he explored stronger and more rapid melodies with steadily changing harmonies. Peri's critics have observed that within the score of Euridice, he created no musically remarkable examples of either. However, he did use ranges and widths of register, as well as frequency and power of cadences, to distinguish different characters and dramatic moods. The voice and accompaniment are carefully paced to emphasize the tension and release in the text. Rhythmic and melodic inflections in the vocal lines closely, almost scientifically, imitate dramatic speech. In addition, impassioned exclamations are set with unprepared dissonances and unexpected movements in the bass.\nAll qualitative judgments aside, even his greater detractors admit that with Euridice Peri managed to establish sound principles for operatic composition. The work establishes in opera the dual resource of aria and recitative, and it explores the use of solo, ensemble and choral singing."

        "content": "During the early 1980s, Jewish-American writer and gay activist Ned Weeks struggles to pull together an organization focused on raising awareness about the fact that an unidentified disease is killing off a specific group of people: gay men, largely in New York City. Dr. Emma Brookner, a physician and survivor of polio (as a consequence of which she is using a wheelchair), has the most experience with this strange new disease. She bemoans the lack of medical knowledge about the illness, and encourages gay men to practice abstinence for their own safety, since it is still unknown how the disease is spread. Ned, a patient and friend of Brookner's, calls upon his lawyer brother, Ben, to help fund his crisis organization; however, Ben's attitude toward his brother is one of merely passive support, which ultimately exposes his homophobia. For the first time in his life, meanwhile, Ned falls in love, beginning a relationship with New York Times writer Felix Turner.\nThe increasing death toll raises the unknown illness, by this time correctly believed to be caused by a virus, to the status of an epidemic, though the press remains largely silent on the issue. A sense of urgency guides Ned, who realizes that Ben is more interested in buying a two-million-dollar house than in backing Ned's activism. Ned explosively breaks off ties with his brother, not wanting further interaction until Ben can fully accept Ned's homosexuality. Ned next looks to Mayor Ed Koch's administration for help in financing research about the epidemic, which has now killed hundreds of gay men, including some of Ned's personal friends.\nNed's organization elects as its president Bruce Niles, who is described as the \"good cop\" of gay activism in implicit comparison to Ned: while Bruce is cautious, polite, deferential, and closeted, Ned is vociferous, confrontational, incendiary, openly gay, and supportive only of direct action. Tensions between the two are clear, though they must work together to effectively promote their organization. Felix, meanwhile, reveals to Ned his belief that he is now infected with the mysterious virus.\nAlthough he continues to try to strengthen interactions with the mayor, Ned ruins his chances when his relentless and fiery personality appalls a representative sent by the mayor. Dr. Brookner gradually takes on the role of activist herself, and notes the epidemic's appearance in other countries and among heterosexuals. Although she desperately seeks government funding for further research, her request is denied; the rejection prompts her to unleash a passionate tirade against those who allow the persistence of an epidemic that is taking the lives of homosexuals, who are already marginalized by the government. In the meantime, Ned's conflict with Bruce comes to a head, and their organization's board of directors ultimately expels Ned from the group, believing his unstable vehemence to be a threat to the group's attempts to engage in calmer diplomacy.\nAs Felix's condition worsens, he visits Ben in order to make his will, and in the hope of effecting a reconciliation between Ben and his brother. All of them, along with Emma, meet at Felix's deathbed. Emma unofficially weds Felix and Ned, and Felix dies immediately after. Ned blames himself for his lover's death, lamenting that he did not fight hard enough to make his voice heard. The play ends with Ned and Ben embracing. As the stage fades to black, the rate of mortality from HIV/AIDS is shown to be continuing to increase."

        "content": "In his review in The New York Times, Frank Rich observed, \"In this fiercely polemical drama ... the playwright starts off angry, soon gets furious and then skyrockets into sheer rage. Although Mr. Kramer's theatrical talents are not always as highly developed as his conscience, there can be little doubt that The Normal Heart is the most outspoken play around \u2013  or that it speaks up about a subject that justifies its author's unflagging, at times even hysterical, sense of urgency. ... Mr. Kramer has few good words to say about Mayor Koch, various prominent medical organizations, The New York Times or, for that matter, most of the leadership of an unnamed organization apparently patterned after the Gay Men's Health Crisis. Some of the author's specific accusations are questionable, and, needless to say, we often hear only one side of inflammatory debates. But there are also occasions when the stage seethes with the conflict of impassioned, literally life-and-death argument. ... The writing's pamphleteering tone is accentuated by Mr. Kramer's insistence on repetition - nearly every scene seems to end twice - and on regurgitating facts and figures in lengthy tirades. Some of the supporting players ... are too flatly written to emerge as more than thematic or narrative pawns. The characters often speak in the same bland journalistic voice - so much so that lines could be reassigned from one to another without the audience detecting the difference. If these drawbacks ... blunt the play's effectiveness, there are still many powerful vignettes sprinkled throughout.\"Jack Kroll of Newsweek called it \"extraordinary\" and added, \"It is bracing and exciting to hear so much passion and intelligence. Kramer produces a cross fire of life-and-death energies that create a fierce and moving human drama.\" In the New York Daily News, Liz Smith said, \"An astounding drama . . . a damning indictment of a nation in the middle of an epidemic with its head in the sand. It will make your hair stand on end even as the tears spurt from your eyes.\" Rex Reed stated, \"No one who cares about the future of the human race can afford to miss The Normal Heart,\" while director Harold Prince commented, \"I haven't been this involved \u2013  upset \u2013  in too damn long. Kramer honors us with this stormy, articulate theatrical work.\"On the day The Normal Heart opened, a spokesman for The New York Times addressed statements in the play about the newspaper's failure to give the disease adequate coverage. He said that as soon as The Times became aware of AIDS, it assigned a member of the science staff to cover the story, and his article appeared on July 3, 1981, making The Times \"one of the first \u2013  if not the first \u2013  national news media to alert the public to the scientific recognition and spread of the disease.\" He also cited a later full-length report in The New York Times Magazine about recent discoveries made by researchers.  When asked about his negative portrayal in The Normal Heart, former New York City Mayor Ed Koch said through a spokesman, \"I haven't seen the play. But I hope it's as good as As Is, which is superb.\"In 2000, the Royal National Theatre named The Normal Heart one of the 100 greatest plays of the 20th century.  In his 2004 book, How to Do the History of Homosexuality, David Halperin criticized the character of Ned Weeks for surrendering to \"gay chauvinism\" and \"homosexual essentialism\" through \"various strategies of elitism and exclusion\" when he lists renowned homosexuals he considers part of his culture.Of the 2011 Broadway revival of the play, Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times:\n\"What this interpretation makes clear, though, is that Mr. Kramer is truly a playwright as well as a pamphleteer (and, some might add, a self-promoter). Seen some 25 years on, The Normal Heart turns out to be about much more than the one-man stand of Ned Weeks, the writer who takes it upon himself to warn gay men about AIDS (before it was even identified as such) and alienates virtually everyone he comes across. Ned Weeks \u2014 need I say? \u2014 is Larry Kramer, with a thoroughness that few onstage alter-egos can claim.\"After the 2011 Broadway production, Patrick Healy from The New York Times interviewed young, gay men that had attended the show to see their reaction to the subject matter. Most of the young men that Healy interviewed talked about how the HIV/AIDS Epidemic is almost never brought up in textbooks or discussed in class by teachers. The Broadway revival became a \"heart-tugging lesson\", according to Healy's interviews, for those who weren\u2019t alive during the events that unfolded in the gay community in the 1980s.\nOn June 12, 2011, Ellen Barkin and John Benjamin Hickey won the Tony Awards for Best Performance by a Featured Actress and Actor, respectively, for its Broadway debut, while the production won Best Revival of a Play.\nIn his review of the 2021 historic reading of the play presented by the One Archives Foundation, Los Angeles Times chief theatre critic Charles McNulty praised cast member Sterling K. Brown noting that he \"captured so brilliantly\" the role of Ned Weeks. He added: \"the choice of Brown was inspired. Not only is he an exceptional, Emmy-winning actor, but his performance represented an act of coalition building, a recognition of shared struggle and a refusal to let the walls of identity serve as a prison.\""

        "content": "The Tate family is a lower middle class, rural California family, trying to hold on to the last shreds of a family bond and traditional living.\nWesley Tate is the son of the family. Feeling strong ties to his family and to the land, Wesley maintains the farm after the others have given up. The prospect of selling the land to real estate developers has a significance far greater than the loss of a mere house, but his family. At times, Wesley loses patience with his family members, as evidenced by his lack of sympathy for his sister's ruined 4-H project, to which he responds by urinating on her charts and suggesting that his sister do something truly useful with her time.\nElla Tate is the mother of the family. As the play opens, she and Wesley are both looking through the chunks of the broken door that her husband, Weston, broke in a fit of rage. Ella is a highly dysfunctional individual with no capacity to cope with her husband's alcoholism. She often changes topics when she feels it in her best interest and tries to ignore the things going on immediately around her. Ella decides to take matters into her own hands and puts the house up for sale without consulting her husband.\nEmma Tate is the daughter of Ella and Weston Tate. She has just started her first period, and has several mood swings during the play. Emma hates living with her family and repeatedly announces plans to leave home. She first tries to run away by taking the family horse, but it throws her off and drags her through the mud, so she comes back. Later, she becomes so angry about Ellis buying their house, she rides the family horse into his bar and shoots the place full of holes. Once she is arrested she says that she gains her freedom by offering sexual bribes to the sheriff. She then decides to steal her mother's car and take up a life of crime, claiming that it is the only way to make a real living in this world. In her attempt to steal the car, she is blown up with the car by the bomb that Slater puts in it.\nEllis is the owner of a bar, the Alibi Club, where Weston spends his time when he is not at home. Ellis is a greedy charlatan who tries to cheat the family out of their house. Ellis represents the greed and controlling nature of business owners and the tendency of these people to take unfair advantage of each other and people below them.\nEmerson is a minor character who represents the men that Weston is in debt to. He and Slater, another minor character, only appear at the end of the production when they blow up Weston's car for compensation. He is a wicked man, a villain in the story.\nWeston Tate is the father of the family and an abusive alcoholic. Incapable of driving or holding a job, he is a profoundly unstable man controlled by the alcohol that runs in his system. His violent nature and utter lack of accountability are the crux of many of the family's issues. He is easily taken advantage of and when his debts are not paid, it takes an even more terrifying toll on the people close to him.\nSergeant Malcom is the police officer who arrives at the house to inform Ella that Emma has been arrested for riding a horse into the \u201cAlibi Club\u201d and shooting it up. He is uninterested in the other crimes that Wesley and Ella accuse Taylor and Ellis of, stating that he is only there to tell Ella about Emma.\nTaylor is a lawyer who is involved in real estate and is looking to buy the property from Ella. He is the representative for several large corporations that are looking to buy up land. He is also the same man who swindled Weston into buying the useless desert property.\nSlater is Emerson's accomplice. He is the one who actually put the bomb in the car that kills Emma. He and Emerson represent the men that Weston owes money to, and have come to serve as a warning. Slater also brings the dead lamb's carcass into the house."

Although the five-act comedy was published in 1524 and first performed in the carnival season of 1526, Machiavelli likely wrote The Mandrake in 1518 as a distraction from his bitterness at having been excluded from the diplomatic and political life of Florence following the 1512 reversion to Medici rule. Some scholars read the play as an overt critique of the House of Medici; and some scholars assert that the play is a mirror to his political treatises. However, Machiavelli set the action in 1504 during the period of the Florentine Republic in order to express his frustrations without fear of censure from patrons already ill-disposed towards him and his writing."

Nicia above all else desires a son and heir, but still has none. Conspiring with both Ligurio, a rascally marriage broker, and a corrupt priest named Friar Timoteo, Callimaco masquerades as a doctor. He convinces Nicia to drug Lucrezia with mandrake, claiming it will increase her fertility. He adds, however, the dire warning that the mandrake will undoubtedly kill the first man to have intercourse with her. Ligurio helpfully suggests to Nicia that an unwitting fool be found for this purpose. A reluctant Lucrezia is eventually convinced by her mother and the priest to comply with her husband's wishes. She allows a disguised Callimaco into her bed and, believing that the events which caused her to break her marriage vows were due to divine providence, thereafter accepts him as her lover on a more permanent basis.\nThe play is mentioned in the 16th Letter of Amabed in Voltaire's Les Lettres d'Amabed (1769) stating that \"the piece mocks the religion which Europe preaches, of which Rome is the centre, and the throne of which is the Papal See\". Other critics like John Najemy have interpreted scenes with the priest as Machiavelli pointing out \"the social and political necessity of interpreting religion\"."

It balances the agony of her seclusion with the brief bright moments when she was able to experience some joy.\nAfter one preview, the original Broadway production, directed by Charles Nelson Reilly and starring Julie Harris, opened on April 28, 1976, at the Longacre Theatre, where it ran for 116 performances. The Wall Street Journal reviewer wrote \"With her technical ability and her emotional range, Miss Harris can convey profound inner turmoil at the same time that she displays irrepressible gaiety of spirit.\"Harris, who portrayed 15 different characters in the play, won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, earned a Drama Desk Award nomination for Unique Theatrical Experience, and won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Recording. She appeared in a televised PBS production and extensively toured the country with the play for a number of years.Dickinson biographer Lyndall Gordon criticized the play for perpetuating Mabel Loomis Todd's chaste, hermit-like image of Dickinson, as opposed to the lively, witty, provocative, and sometimes erotic Dickinson present in her work and known to those who knew her more personally.The Spanish translation of the play was done by Argentinean poet Silvina Ocampo for the Buenos Aires premiere starring China Zorrilla in January 1981. The production ran for more than 500 performances and Zorrilla embarked on a Latin American tour that ended at New York's Hunter College in 1983 and Washington's Kennedy Center. With Emily, the Uruguayan actress made a triumphant comeback to her country after 10 years of proscription for political reasons.In 1999, the play was presented by Cesear's Forum at Playhouse Square, Cleveland, Ohio.  The production presented Dickinson in the attic of her home as a kind of apparition.  Keith Joseph of Cleveland Scene found the work bizarre, mysterious and poignant.  Of Cleveland actress Sheila E. Maloney, he writes: \"Her\npoetess, instead of suggesting the usual fragility of one of the world's most famous recluses, has the mad glee of Arsenic and Old Lace's Brewster Sisters.

As Jos\u00e9 Feliciano became Demis Roussos, so Elvis Presley gave way to Tom Jones. Other music used in the BBC production included \"Love to Love You Baby\" by Donna Summer (sung here by Clare Torry) and a piece of library music by Robert Farnon entitled \"Blue Theme\".\nThe BBC version was a film of a play, rather than a film in its own right, about which Leigh commented:\n\nThe first thing I\u2019d say is, this is not a film. And not only that: for a film-maker, it\u2019s a work of deep embarrassment and pain. There is no piece of work for which I have been responsible as director by which I\u2019m embarrassed, apart from Abigail\u2019s Party.

        "content": "Beverly Moss\nAn ex-department store cosmetics demonstrator, \"a quondam beautician\", she has failed her driving test three times. During the play, she flirts with Tony and is always trying to impress her guests. She considers her taste in music (Jose Feliciano/Demis Roussos, Tom Jones) and art (kitsch erotica) to be every bit as good as that of her husband. Immensely proud of her home, she nonetheless admits that she cannot use the gadgets in her kitchen. Throughout the evening, Beverly offers her guests drinks and cigarettes (despite the fact that Tony and Angela have recently given up), which they usually refuse but end up taking due to her being unable to take no for an answer. Beverly effectively forces her guests to agree with her on most topics, for instance on the music they should listen to, or whether olives should be served, in each instance using their apparent consensus to score points with her husband. Despite her \"sophisticated\" tastes and carefully groomed appearance, she was described by Alan Bennett as having \"shoulders like a lifeguard, and a walk to match.\" According to the critic Michael Coveney, \"Beverly is undoubtedly a monster. But she is also a deeply sad and vulnerable monster\u2026 The whole point about Beverly is that she is childless, and there is a sense in which that grotesque exterior carapace is a mask of inner desolation.\"Interviewed in 2012, Steadman said of the play, \"Overnight, that piece was incredibly powerful. ... They were very strong, identifiable characters. We laugh at them because we say, 'Oh my God, I know that person, thank goodness I'm not like that', and you cringe, but you know they're true. We can safely sit in the comfort of our living rooms or theatre seats and laugh our heads off. But we've perhaps all got a bit of Beverly in us.\" In a 2017 piece written for The Guardian, Leigh described Beverly as \"an aspirational working class girl who is totally preoccupied with appearances and received notions of behaviour and taste. A bundle of contradictions, she espouses the idea of people freely enjoying themselves, yet endlessly bullies everybody into doing what she wrongly thinks they'll enjoy, or what is good for them. But, while she may be perceived as monstrous, she is in fact vulnerable, insecure and sad\".\nLaurence Moss\nEstate agent with \"Wibley Webb\". Laurence is Beverly's husband, and the pair frequently argue. He aspires to the finer things in life: leather-bound Shakespeare (which he thinks \"can't be read\"), prints of Van Gogh and Lowry paintings, and Beethoven, which he forces on his guests at unfortunate moments. He seems powerless to compete with Beverly's more flamboyant persona, and compensates by working too much, as his wife points out on several occasions. He considers a brisk handshake to be correct etiquette after a dance. While Laurence starts off behaving normally during the party, as he becomes increasingly hen-pecked by his wife, he begins to act in a more neurotic manner, to the point where he too becomes an annoyance to his guests. While Beverly embraces the increasing \"cosmopolitanism\" of the area, Laurence does not.\nTony Cooper\nTony works in computing\u2014merely as a computer operator, his wife twice points out\u2014and used to play professional football for Crystal Palace but it \"didn't work out\". Tony is quiet throughout most of the play, usually appearing uneasy and giving one-word answers, but towards the end he becomes somewhat irate and quick-tempered, particularly with his wife. Beverly flirts with him in the second half of the play, much to Laurence's annoyance. At one point, Beverly asks Angela if he is violent. \"No, he's not violent. Just a bit nasty. Like, the other day, he said to me, he'd like to sellotape my mouth. And that's not very nice, is it?\" \"It certainly isn't, Ange!\" replies Beverly. Leigh later attributed Tony's aggression to an underlying shyness and self-consciousness. The surname Cooper was not mentioned in the original script or teleplay, and is taken from a picture on the Mike Leigh at the BBC DVD box set.\nAngela Cooper\nTony's wife. A nurse, Angela appears very meek and somewhat childlike, unintelligent and tactless (much like Steadman's character in a previous Leigh play, Nuts in May). She cannot drive; Tony does not wish her to do so. Interested in the mundane and commonplace, much to her husband's annoyance, she comes into her own when Sue feels queasy and after Laurence suffers a heart attack. Leigh noted that \"underneath Angela's apparent silliness is the tough, practical reliability of an experienced working nurse\".\nSusan Lawson\nSue was getting divorced at the same time the other characters were getting married, as pointed out by Angela. A quiet character who does not really have the courage to say no, she is the only woman visibly not \"dressed-up\" for the gathering; clearly, she would rather be elsewhere. Throughout the play, Laurence attempts to find common ground with her. As originally cast, she towers over the diminutive Laurence, and Beverly's exhortations for her to dance with him only compound her awkwardness. Sue's 15-year-old daughter Abigail is holding the party from which the play's title is derived. Her 11-year-old son Jeremy has gone to stay elsewhere. Sue appears to be anxious about the party, and at one point is sick in the bathroom."

She has also invited her neighbour Susan (Sue), divorced for three years, whose fifteen-year-old daughter Abigail is holding a party at home. Beverly's husband Laurence comes home late from work, just before the guests arrive. The gathering starts off in a stiff fashion as the virtual strangers tentatively gather, until Beverly and Laurence start sniping at each other. As Beverly serves more drinks and the alcohol takes effect, Beverly flirts more and more overtly with Tony, as Laurence sits impotently by. After a tirade when Beverly insists on showing off her kitsch print Wings of Love, Laurence suffers a fatal heart attack."

She also brings a bottle of wine, and has not yet eaten, indicating that she is expecting dinner, as opposed to an extended evening of drinks. The others present have already had their \"tea\". Beverly and Laurence represent the aspirational lower middle class, and Tony and Angela\u2014the \"new arrivals\"\u2014are also lower middle class, but Tony is less successful than Laurence.\nDespite their similar background, Laurence seeks to differentiate between himself and Tony by highlighting the differences in their general level of culture, and makes a couple of condescending comments directed at him, and/or for Sue's benefit. For example, Laurence shows off a leather-bound collected works of Shakespeare to Sue (which we know are unread), after pointedly asking Tony if he reads, insinuating that he does not."

It also appeared in a Radio Times poll to find the top 40 greatest TV shows on British television, published in August 2003.\nSome critics, such as Tom Paulin, have responded more negatively, saying that Abigail's Party appears to represent a middle-class schadenfreude, with the only true middle-class character, Sue, looking on at the antics of the couples with disdain. Likewise, Dennis Potter wrote a critical review of the play in The Sunday Times, saying it was \"based on nothing more edifying than rancid disdain, for it is a prolonged jeer, twitching with genuine hatred, about the dreadful suburban tastes of the dreadful lower middle classes\". Leigh has rejected this, describing it as a tragi-comedy which is \"sympathetic to all the characters, whatever their foibles, not least Beverly... The play is a lamentation, not a sneer\". He has also argued that the characters (Beverly and Laurence in particular) reflected the real-life behaviour of aspiring couples in mid-1970s suburbia.\nWriting in The Independent in 2002, David Thomson noted that Beverley's gauche storing of the beaujolais in the refrigerator had become standard practice; \"the gaffe has turned suave.\""

The French libretto was by the composer with Charles-Louis-\u00c9tienne Nuitter and Paul Ferrier.The sub-title was La femme \u00e0 deux maris; the working title during the preparation of the libretto and composition had been Frimouskino, which Offenbach had drafted in the late 1860s. Composed in Nice, Offenbach asked Nuitter and Ferrier to help him with the song lyrics as his regular collaborators, Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy had distanced themselves in order to concentrate on other projects, including work with Charles Lecocq.Premiered at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes Parisiens, the piece was taken off after less than two months, and Le timbale d\u2019argent returned to the Bouffes. Reflecting on his many previous successes, when the opera failed to run more than 50 performances, Offenbach wrote to Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy that \u2018Offenbach\u2019 was not to be found on the billboards for the 1878 Exhibition.The work is one of several by Offenbach with Spanish connections: P\u00e9pito, La Duchesse d\u2019Albe and Les bavards. The malague\u00f1a was inserted as an additional song for Fiorella in the Christmas Day revival of Les brigands at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9 in 1878.Two lawsuits concerning the subject of the opera were brought - against Offenbach and after his death against the theatre manager Charles Comte - alleging that the subject matter had been plagiarized from a stage work by Oswald and L\u00e9vy."

This in turn drew on the popular character of Don C\u00e9sar de Bazan, in the 1838 drama Ruy Blas by Victor Hugo, though it has little connection with the plot of Hugo's drama. Massenet's opera was first performed at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 30 November 1872.\nIt was the first full-length opera by Massenet to be produced, the one-act La grand'tante having been mounted five years earlier by the same company.  Don C\u00e9sar de Bazan was not a success and it would be another five years, with the premiere of Le roi de Lahore in 1877, before Massenet rose to his place among the most prominent composers of his time.\nDon C\u00e9sar de Bazan was initially performed 13 times at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. After the fire at the Salle Favart when the parts were lost, Massenet constructed a new version from the vocal score, and this was performed in Geneva in 1888, then Antwerp, Brussels, the French provinces and the Ga\u00eet\u00e9-Lyrique in 1912, and the Hague in 1925. The orchestral Entr'acte to Act 3, entitled \"S\u00e9villana\", was in 1895 adapted as a showpiece for solo coloratura soprano, to words specially written by Jules Ruelle (\"\u00c0 S\u00e9ville, Belles Se\u00f1oras\"). Though this song is still regularly performed, it does not form part of the operatic score.In 1901, two different plays based on Don C\u00e9sar were staged in London. Gerald du Maurier adapted the story with simplified dialogue as A Royal Rival, which was produced by William Faversham. Victor Mapes expanded the plot and added more natural-sounding dialogue in his version, titled Don Caesar's Return, which starred James K. Hackett.A modern revival took place in several French cities in 2016, when the Frivolit\u00e9s Parisiennes staged a new production including an appearance at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte Saint-Martin, conducted by Mathieu Romano."

        "content": "After Zaira\nFollowing the poor reception which Zaira received in Parma, Bellini returned to Milan by the end of June 1829 with no contract for another opera in sight. Giovanni Pacini, another Catanese composer, was still in Milan after the well-received premiere of his Il Talismano, and he received offers to compose an opera for both Turin and Venice for the following Carnival season. He accepted both offers, but the La Fenice impresario, Alessandro Lanari, included a proviso that if he were to be unable to fulfill the Venice contract, then it would be transferred to Bellini.\nA firm offer of a contract for a new opera for Venice appeared in the autumn, a contract which also included a provision that Il pirata would also be given during the 1830 Carnival season. By mid-December Bellini was in Venice where he heard the same singers who were to perform in Pirata: they were Giuditta Grisi, the tenor Lorenzo Bonfigli, and Giulio Pellegrini.\nBellini in Venice\n\nWith rehearsals for Pirata underway in late December, Bellini was given notice by Lanari that it was doubtful whether Pacini would be present in time to stage an opera and that a contract was to be prepared for Bellini to provide a new opera but with the proviso that it would only become effective on 14 January. Accepting the offer on 5 January, Bellini stated that he would set Romani's libretto for Giulietta Capellio, that he required 45 days between receipt of the libretto and the first performance, and that he would accept 325 napoleoni d'oro (about 8,000 lire).The tentative contract deadline was extended until 20 January, but by that date Romani was in Venice, having already re-worked much of his earlier libretto which he had written for Nicola Vaccai's 1825 opera, Giulietta e Romeo, the source for which was the play of the same name by Luigi Scevola in 1818. The two men set to work, but with the winter weather in Venice becoming increasingly bad, Bellini fell ill; however, he had to continue to work under great pressure within a now-limited timetable. Eventually, revisions to Romani's libretto were agreed to, a new title was given to the work, and Bellini reviewed his score of Zaira to see how some of the music could be set to the new text, but composing the part of Romeo for Grisi. He also took Giulietta's \"Oh quante volte\" and Nelly's romanza from Adelson e Salvini. The Giulietta was to be sung by Rosalbina Caradori-Allan."

The music that had failed so completely in Parma was acclaimed in Venice in its new guise, probably more because the Venice audience was inherently better disposed to Bellini's style than because of any aesthetic improvement. But if we can take Bellini at his word, the extensive self-borrowing involved in recasting Zaira as I Capuleti was no lazy response to a looming deadline: although he was indeed forced to compose faster than he liked, he remarked repeatedly on how hard he was working, on one occasion complaining that the act 1 finale of Capuleti\u2014one of the numbers copied almost literally from Zaira had nearly \"driven him crazy.\" The sheer volume of common material in these two operas ensures that dramatic resemblance between the recycled melodies in I Capuleti and their original incarnations in Zaira will be the exception rather than the rule.\nSmart then provides one specific example whereby word metering (the number of syllables for each line, traditionally written in a specific meter by the poet\u2014the librettist\u2014of from five to eight or more to each line of verse) is changed to work in the new context:\nWhat are we to make of Bellini's decision to bring back the cabaletta for the prima donna soprano in Zaira, a number whose prevailing sentiment is giddy anticipation of an imminent wedding, as Romeo's lamenting slow movement in the last act of I Capuleti, sung over Juliet's inanimate body? Not only is one of Bellini's most frivolous soprano cabalettas pressed into service as a monologue confronting death, but the number is transferred from the female to the male lead (although both roles are sung by female voices, since the role of Romeo is written for a mezzo-soprano). And as if to emphasize the violence of the transformation, the poetic texts are in different verse meters\u2014Zaira's cabaletta in settenari, Romeo's in the less common quinari The means by which Bellini and Romani stretched Romeo's quinari lines to fit a melody originally conceived for settenari is ingenious, achieved simply by inserting word repetitions between the second and third syllables of each line."

The new head of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Alfred Beaumont, took up post in June 1860 and hoped to deploy Offenbach's burgeoning fame by coupling him with the famous librettist Eugene Scribe. The latter had a libretto sketched out on the subject which was intended for Clapisson, as a vehicle for Delphine Ugalde, and Scribe's younger collaborator Boisseaux set to work to complete the elder man's plan. By mid-August the Paris papers had announced that the work (at that point called Le Sultan Barkouf) had been cast and rehearsals had begun. Some of the principals were outraged that Offenbach had been allowed to compose for France's second most important stage, and Ugalde led the criticism. There followed problems with the censor, which while noting that the \"strange\" piece took place in a land of fantasy and make-believe, objected to the reference that the vice-roys of Lahore were being defenestrated and banned the opera. Beaumont interceded with the censor and managed to get away with changing references to terms such as 'sovereign' and 'master' to less specific descriptions. With these and other minor changes and swayed by Beaumont insistence that cancellation would cost his new administration too much, the censor passed the work. The withdrawal of Ugalde, to be replaced as Ma\u00efma first by Mlle de Saint-Urbain, then when she became ill, by Mlle Marimon, all of which delayed rehearsals further. The work was eventually performed at the second Salle Favart, the home of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, on 24, 26, 28, 31 December 1860, 2, 10, 12, and 16 January 1861, with several changes of cast. Yon feels that the audience reaction was good and the lack of commitment from the cast should not be over-estimated; it was the violence of the critical reaction which prevented a lasting success for Barkouf.Along with Scudo and Duchene, Berlioz was especially critical, attacking Offenbach's craftsmanship and questioning the 'twisted' minds of 'certain musicians', and the introduction of 'bouffe' elements at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique while stating that he never set foot in such theatres. In his Dictionnaire des op\u00e9ras of 1869, F\u00e9lix Cl\u00e9ment noted the light and ingenious construction of two or three choral movements, but was otherwise disappointed by the lack of originality shown by the composer. Modern views have tended to challenge this view; the conductor of the Strasbourg revival claims that Barkouf is \"an important work... an opera to be counted among the greatest successes of its composer\" and that the 100 minutes of music in Barkouf are worthy of enthusiastic support. \nSome of the music was re-used in Boule-de-neige of 1871, substituting a bear for the dog in the title-role.After closing in early 1861 the work was not revived until December 2018, when the Op\u00e9ra du Rhin staged it in Strasbourg on the 7th of December, conducted by Jacques Lacombe and directed by Mariame Cl\u00e9ment, who rewrote much of the spoken dialogue.Most of Offenbach's manuscript survived within a branch of his descendants, and the missing pages were tracked down by Jean-Christophe Keck in other collections. The surviving libretti, however, did not correspond to the score. While allowing for the constant changes during the rehearsal period, orchestral and repetiteur materials were probably destroyed in the fire at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1887. Offenbach had gained certain respect from his peers, so long as he stayed in the genre of the Bouffes-Parisiens, but in the score of Barkouf he wrote in a more complex vein, with modern harmonies and complicated part-writing while remaining with the spirit of op\u00e9ra-bouffe. Keck notes the striking numbers of the lyrical duet which closes the first act, surprising harmonies in the conspiracy scene, and the drinking song in Act 3. Given the experimental nature of parts of the music, the reaction of the critics is understandable, with sophisticated modulations, even short polytonal passages, and demanding and unusual vocal writing; Keck writes that the composer had never pushed his musical language so far, and would not go further \u2013 until Les Contes d'Hoffmann."

In 1832 a com\u00e9die-vaudeville was mounted by Virginie D\u00e9jazet at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Palais-Royal with some success and it was this which then led to the op\u00e9ra-comique of 1869; while the libretto is credited to Meilhac and Nuitter, Hal\u00e9vy, Leuven and Pittaud de Forges also had a hand in it, the latter two having created the vaudeville over 30 years before.Although contemporary critics were not complimentary, a more recent one commended the \u201cdelightful music, including a Key Duet as catchy as the Watch Duet in Fledermaus, the exquisite Barcarolle in which Vert-Vert describes his first erotic awakenings, a brilliant number for a tenor who has lost his voice (most comically orchestrated), a scrumptious love duet, and a Figaro-style sextet in a garden at night\u201d.All these lyric works were inspired by the Gresset poem of 1734 \u2013 A pious parrot kept by the Visitandines Sisters of Nevers, Vert-Vert speaks like a good Christian. Sought by the curious nuns from Nantes, he was sent there with a Loire boatman and en route naturally acquires some of the sea-faring vocabulary. On arrival in Nantes the bird swears like a sailor and the nuns, horrified, send the parrot back to Nevers where it is almost impossible to make it relearn Latin. Nonetheless, the bird ends his days embraced in solicitude to the extent of expiring of indigestion.The librettists cite one passage in its entirety in the first scene:\n\nThe subject was also used in 1851 for a ballet-pantomime in three acts with music by \u00c9douard Deldevez and Jean-Baptiste Tolbecque and choreography by Joseph Mazilier, performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Op\u00e9ra-Le Peletier, with de Leuven contributing to the scenario."

        "content": "Miller wrote All My Sons after his first play The Man Who Had All the Luck failed on Broadway, lasting only four performances. Miller wrote All My Sons as a final attempt at writing a commercially successful play; he vowed to \"find some other line of work\" if the play did not find an audience.\nAll My Sons is based upon a true story, which Miller's then-mother-in-law pointed out in an Ohio newspaper. The news story described how in 1941\u201343 the Wright Aeronautical Corporation based in Ohio had conspired with army inspection officers to approve defective aircraft engines destined for military use.  The story of defective engines had reached investigators working for Sen. Harry Truman's congressional investigative board after several Wright aircraft assembly workers informed on the company; they later testified under oath before Congress.  In 1944, three Army Air Force officers, Lt. Col. Frank C. Greulich, Major Walter A. Ryan, and Major William Bruckmann were relieved of duty and later convicted of neglect of duty.Henrik Ibsen's influence on Miller is evidenced from the Ibsen play The Wild Duck, from where Miller took the idea of two partners in a business where one is forced to take moral and legal responsibility for the other. This is mirrored in All My Sons. He also borrowed the idea of a character's idealism being the source of a problem.The criticism of the American Dream, which lies at the heart of All My Sons, was one reason why Miller was called to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee during the 1950s, when America was gripped by anti-communist sentiment. Miller sent a copy of the play to Elia Kazan who directed the original stage version of All My Sons. Kazan was a former member of the Communist Party who shared Miller's left-wing views. However, their relationship was destroyed when Kazan gave names of suspected Communists to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the Red Scare."

For over three years he has placed the blame on his partner and former neighbor, Steve Deever, although he himself committed the crime.  When the truth comes out, Joe justifies his actions by claiming that he did it for his family.\nKate Keller (Mother) \u2014 Kate, 50, knows that Joe is guilty but lives in denial while mourning for her elder son Larry, who has been \"missing in action\" for three years. She refuses to believe that Larry is dead and maintains that Ann Deever \u2014 who returns for a visit at the request of Larry's brother Chris \u2014 is still \"Larry's girl\" and also believes that he is coming back.\nChris Keller \u2014 Chris, 32, returned home from World War II two years before the play begins, disturbed by the realization that the world was continuing as if nothing had happened. He has summoned Ann Deever to the Keller house in order to ask her hand for marriage, but they're faced with the obstacle of Kate's unreasonable conviction that Larry will someday return.  Chris idolizes his father, not knowing initially what he has done.\nAnn Deever \u2014 Ann, 26, arrives at the Keller home having shunned her \"guilty\" father since his imprisonment. Throughout the play, Ann is often referred to as pretty, beautiful, and intelligent-looking and as \"Annie\". She had a relationship with Larry Keller before his\ndisappearance and has since moved on because she knows the truth of his fate. She hopes that the Kellers will consent to her marriage to Larry's brother, Chris, with whom she has had corresponded by mail for two years. Ann is the truth-bearer in the play.\nGeorge Deever \u2014 George, 31, is Ann's older brother: a successful New York lawyer, WWII veteran, and a childhood friend of Chris's.  He initially believed in his father's guilt, but upon visiting Steve in jail, realizes his innocence and becomes enraged at the Kellers for deceiving him. He returns to save his sister from her marriage to Chris, creating the catalyzing final events.\nDr. Jim Bayliss \u2014 Jim, 40, is a successful doctor, but is frustrated with the stifling domesticity of his life. He wants to become a medical researcher, but continues in his job as it pays the bills. He is a close friend to the Keller family and spends a lot of time in their backyard.\nSue Bayliss \u2014 Sue, 40, is Jim's wife: needling and dangerous, but affectionate.  She too is a friend of the Keller family, but is secretly resentful of what she sees as Chris's bad idealistic influence on Jim. Sue confronts Ann about her resentment of Chris in a particularly volatile scene.\nFrank Lubey \u2014 Frank, 33, was always one year ahead of the draft, so he never served in World War II, instead staying home to marry George's former sweetheart, Lydia.  He draws up Larry's horoscope and tells Kate that Larry must still be alive, because the day he died was meant to be his \"favorable day\".  This strengthens Kate's faith and makes it much harder for Ann to  move on.\nLydia Lubey \u2014 Lydia, 27, was George's love interest before the war; after he went away, she married Frank and they soon had three children. She is a model of peaceful domesticity and lends a much-needed cheerful air to several moments of the play.\nBert \u2014 Bert, 8, is a little boy who lives in the neighborhood; he is friends with the Bayliss' son Tommy and frequently visits the Kellers' yard to play \"jail\" with Joe. He appears only twice in the play: the first time, his part seems relatively unimportant, but the second time his character is more important as he sparks a verbal attack from mother when mentioning \"jail\", which highlights Joe's secret."

She starred in four of his operettas, beginning with Babette (1903).  Mlle. Modiste was the most successful of these.  During the curtain calls of Babette, she pulled Herbert on stage and planted a big, sexy kiss on his cheek.  \"The Kiss\" generated considerable comment, and when Herbert wrote Mlle. Modiste, two years later, he wrote one of his most famous melodies for her, \"Kiss Me Again\".  After Modiste closed, Scheff toured it for years.Henry Blossom and Herbert collaborated on several more operettas, including The Red Mill (1906), The Princess Pat (1915), and Eileen (1917).  Modiste is typical of their proto-feminist plotlines involving an orphaned young woman, exploited by her employer, but whose feisty spirit leads her to success.After the original production, the piece returned to Broadway at the Knickerbocker briefly in 1906, and, in between national tours, at both the original Academy of Music and the Knickerbocker in 1907, at the Globe Theatre in 1913 and at Jolson's 59th Street Theatre in 1929, among many other revivals and tours through the early 20th century.

In addition, Fifi and French army Captain Etienne de Bouvray, Viscount de St. Mar, are in love.

The Count, impressed by Fifi's sincerity and her new position, as well as by Etienne's behavior, allows Fifi to sing, and ultimately to marry Etienne."

        "content": "Act I\nVernon Hines, the efficiency expert at the Sleep-Tite Pajama Factory in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, breaks the fourth wall to introduce the story (\"The Pajama Game Opening\"). Inside the factory, workers churn out pajamas at a backbreaking pace (\"Racing with the Clock\"). In the middle of this, Sid Sorokin, has come from out of town to work in the factory as the new superintendent (\"A New Town Is a Blue Town\"). The union, led by Prez, is seeking a wage raise of seven-and-a-half cents an hour, though the company president, Myron Hasler, refuses to give way. Katherine \"Babe\" Williams is the leader of the Union Grievance Committee. Sid and Babe are in opposite camps, yet romantic interest is sparked at their first encounter. Despite cajoling from her fellow garment workers, Babe appears to reject Sid (\"I'm Not At All in Love\"). Meanwhile, Hines is in love with Gladys Hotchkiss, the company president's secretary, but is pushing her away with his jealous behavior. After witnessing a fight between the couple, Sid's secretary, Mabel, tries to help Hines break from his jealous ways (\"I'll Never Be Jealous Again\"). Meanwhile, Sid, rejected again by Babe, is forced to confide his feelings to a dictaphone (\"Hey There\").\nDuring the annual company picnic, kicked off with the official Sleep-Tite Company Anthem (\"Sleep-Tite\"), Hines demonstrates his knife throwing act while intoxicated, almost striking Babe while attempting to knock an apple off her head. Prez chases after Gladys, who rejects his advances (\"Her Is\"). Babe warms up to Sid, and they turn the entire picnic into a celebratory dance (\"Once a Year Day\"). As the picnic-goers head home, Prez turns his attentions to Mae, who responds in the positive far more quickly and aggressively than he'd expected (\"Her Is (Reprise)\"). At Babe's home, Sid's romantic overtures are deflected by Babe, who makes casual conversation on tangential subjects (\"Small Talk\"). Eventually the walls come down between the two, who admit their love for one another (\"There Once Was a Man\"), but their estrangement is reinforced when they return to the factory. A slow-down is staged by the union, strongly supported by Babe (\"Racing with the Clock (Reprise)\"). Sid, as factory superintendent, demands an \"honest day's work\" and threatens to fire slackers. Babe, however, is still determined to fight for their cause, and intentionally jams the factory line, causing a breakdown, and Sid reluctantly fires her. As she leaves, he begins to wonder again whether a romance with her is a mistake (\"Hey There (Reprise)\").\nAct II\nAt the Union meeting, after a rallying speech by Prez, Gladys (Mae in the 2006 revival) performs for the rest of the union, with \"the boys from the cutting room floor\" (\"Steam Heat\"). After the main meeting, the Grievance Committee meets at Babe's house, to discuss further tactics, such as mismatching sizes of pajamas and sewing the fly-buttons onto the bottoms such that they are likely to come off and leave their wearer pants-less. At the meeting, as Prez and Mae's relationship is waning, Sid arrives and tries to smooth things over with Babe. Despite her feelings for Sid, she pushes him away (\"Hey There (Reprise)\").\nBack at the factory, the girls reassure Hines, who is personally offended by the slow down, that he is doing nothing wrong (\"Think of the Time I Save\"). Hasler has a meeting in his office with Max, one of the company's traveling salesmen, about an incident that occurred in Peoria, Illinois. Hines is called in to try on pajama pants, which fall down in front of everybody just as Gladys walks in. Believing that he is fooling around, she angrily dismisses him. Sid, now convinced that Babe's championship of the union is justified, takes Gladys out for the evening to a night club, Hernando's Hideaway (\"Hernando's Hideaway\"), where he wheedles the key to the company's books from her. Hines and Babe each discover the pair and assume they are becoming romantically involved. Babe storms out, and Hines believes his jealous imaginings have come true (\"I'll Never Be Jealous Again Ballet\").\nUsing Gladys' key, Sid accesses the firm's books and discovers that Hasler, has already tacked on the extra seven and one-half cents to the production cost, but has kept all the extra profits for himself. Hines, still jealous out of his mind, has broken into Gladys' office, and flings knives past Sid and Gladys, narrowly missing an increasingly paranoid Mr. Hasler. After detaining Hines, Sid then brings about Hasler's consent to a pay raise and rushes to bring the news to the Union Rally, already in progress (\"7\u00bd Cents\"). This news brings peace to the factory and to his love life, allowing him to reconnect with Babe (\"There Once Was a Man (Reprise)\"). Everyone goes out to celebrate at Hernando's Hideaway clothed in company brand pajamas (\"The Pajama Game Finale\")."

        "content": "Cristina, regina di Svezia was Jacopo Foroni's second opera. His first, Margherita, had premiered in Milan in 1848. However, his involvement with the Five Days of Milan uprising had made life dangerous in the city and led him to seek work abroad. He became the conductor of Vincenzo Galli's Italian opera company which by the autumn of 1848 had taken up residence in Stockholm's Mindre Theatre. Foroni composed Cristina to introduce himself to Swedish audiences. The librettist, Giovanni Carlo Casanova, was also a basso cantante singer in Galli's company. The opera premiered at the Mindre Theatre on 22 May 1849 and was dedicated to Oscar I of Sweden, the reigning monarch at the time. Hans Christian Andersen was at the premiere and wrote enthusiastically about it. The success of the opera led to Foroni being appointed as the chief conductor at the Royal Swedish Opera later that year.In the autumn of 1850 the opera was given its Italian premiere when Foroni himself conducted its performance at the Gran Teatro Civico in Trieste. Over the next 8 years he continued in his post at the Royal Swedish Opera and composed music for royal occasions and concerts. Foroni wrote only two more operas before his death from cholera at the age of 33. Although the overture to Cristina was heard occasionally in 19th century concerts, both the composer and the work itself fell into obscurity.\nHowever, it was revived at the 2007 Vadstena Summer Opera Festival, and in 2010 it was recorded for the first time with a performance by the G\u00f6teborg Opera conducted by Tobias Ringborg. It was performed again at Wexford Festival Opera in October and November 2013 with Helena Dix in the title role. The Wexford production, directed by Stephen Medcalf, updated the action to the 1930s and drew explicit parallels to the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936. The UK premiere of the work was performed in concert version by Chelsea Opera Group at London's Cadogan Hall on 8 November 2014."

The latter, who has been officially reported dead, has locked himself up, since his return from the front, and refuses to see anyone except his younger sister Leni. In order to save Werner, Johanna determines to investigate the mystery of Franz's seclusion. In doing so, she unwittingly serves her father-in-law's ends.

        "content": "Throughout the play, Sartre characteristically colors the text of the plot with his philosophic concepts, especially the notions of responsibility and freedom and the contrast between bad faith and authenticity. Some of these comments serve a functional or descriptive role in the plot while simultaneously carrying a philosophic aside. Others are closer to the typical philosophic dialogue, elaborating the characters as they address an issue.\n\nIn Act One, Father and Werner discuss the power to command others. Werner: When I look a man in the eyes I become incapable of giving him orders... I feel that he is my equal.  Father: To obey and to command is the same thing. In both cases you transmit orders you have received.  Werner: You receive orders?  Father: Up to quite recently, I did.  Werner: From whom? Father: I don't know. Myself, perhaps. (Smiling.. I'll give you the formula. If you want to command, think of yourself as someone else...  Werner: I'm lucky, in fact. [Gelber] will give the orders.  Father: Gelber? You're mad! He is your employee. You pay him to let you know what orders to give. Here Sartre shows Father's power to stem from a self-deception Werner does not possess: Father claims his ability to command comes from his receiving of orders, despite the fact they are his own. Yet he opposes Werner's proposition, despite its being practically and essentially the same thing: he employs Gelber to employ himself. Similar examples occur in Being and Nothingness, where Sartre shows two groups to be in bad faith for different reasons. The choice of the name Gelber here is a possible pun: Gelb is German for the color \"yellow\", which in English can also mean \"cowardly\".\nAlso in Act One, Sartre's ideas of freedom and \"existence precedes essence\" are illustrated in Johanna's outburst to Father von Gerlach: \"... I declare that I will not make any confessions for the simple reason that I have none to make. I am alone, with out strength and completely aware of my powerlessness.\"\nIn the second act, Leni asks Franz why he has not conceded to the crabs every right but the right to condemn him. He claims his exemption as a witness for the defense. Leni objects: \"Challenge their competence, I beg you; it's your only weakness. Tell them \"You are not my judges,: and you'll have no one to fear - either in this world or the next.\" Leni later addresses the crabs directly: \"...you will condemn us outright, but I couldn't care less.\" \"...I forbid [Franz] to plead my cause. I have only one judge - myself - and I acquit myself. Oh, witness for the defense, testify before yourself. You will be invulnerable if you dare to state: \"I have done what I wanted, and I want what I have done.\"\n\nLater, Franz describes Johanna's beauty as a nothingness to his crabs: \"What calm! She is quiet. It's all there, comrades: \"Be beautiful and keep quiet!\" A vision. Is it inscribed on your window? Oh, no! What could be inscribed on it? Nothing has changed; nothing has happened. The trick brought nothing into the room, that's all. Emptiness, a diamond that cuts no glass, an absence, beauty. You'll see nothing but the blaze there, poor Crustaceans. You took our eyes to examine what exists, while we, living in man's epoch, have seen with those same eyes what does not exist.\" Franz's words imply that the crabs cannot see a nothingness, a term Sartre uses to describe value- and structure-/role- judgments which are not inherent to an object's being, but rather given to them by consciousness.\nAnother conversation depicts Sartre's \"Man is a useless passion\":  \"Franz (ironic admiration): [A] Star! And you didn't succeed? What did you want?\" Johanna: \"What does one want? Everything.\" F (slowly): \"Everything, yes. Nothing else. All or nothing.\" (Laughing) \"Turned out badly, eh?\"  J: \"Always does.\"\nSartre considers the possibility that the German soldiers themselves were guilty of enabling Nazi war crimes: \"[Klages, a German lieutenant] was the champion of mental reservation. He condemned the Nazis in spirit to hide the fact that he was serving them in the flesh... He said to God: \"I don't like what I'm doing.\" But he did it.\" This motif of universal responsibility is repeated by Franz and other characters in different forms throughout the play, notably by the dying woman in the flashback of Act Four."

The famously outlandish New York City radio wit Sheridan Whiteside ('Sherry' to his friends) is invited to dine at the house of the well-to-do factory owner Ernest W. Stanley and his family. But before Whiteside can enter the house, he slips on a patch of ice outside the Stanleys' front door and injures his hip. Confined to the Stanleys' home, Whiteside is looked after by several professionals: Dr. Bradley, the absent-minded town physician, Miss Preen, his frantic nurse, and Maggie Cutler, his faithful secretary. \nConfined to the house for a month, Whiteside drives his hosts mad by viciously insulting them, monopolizing their house and staff, running up large phone bills, and receiving many bizarre guests, including paroled convicts, and the eccentric Professor Metz, who brings him a glass-encased cockroach colony.  Although he earns the intense dislike of Mr. Stanley, Whiteside manages to befriend his adult children, June and Richard, as well as his wildly eccentric older sister, Harriet Stanley.\nHe also befriends local newspaperman and aspiring playwright Bert Jefferson but soon learns that Maggie has fallen in love with Bert, and plans to leave her job to marry him.  Unable to bear the thought of losing his secretary, Whiteside invites his friend, the glamorous and loose-living actress Lorraine Sheldon, to Mesalia to look at Bert's new play, hoping she can break up the marriage plans.  Dr. Bradley tells Whiteside he was mistaken in his diagnosis, and Whiteside is well enough to leave.  Whiteside buys the doctor's silence by pretending to want to work on a book with him, and for the rest of the play keeps brushing him off.\nWhiteside encourages June Stanley to elope with a young union organizer whom her father disapproves of, and Richard to run away and pursue his dream of becoming a photographer. Lorraine arrives, and Maggie instantly suspects Whiteside's efforts to interfere with her and Bert.  Whiteside and Maggie then receive a visit from their friend, noted British actor and playwright Beverly Carlton.  Maggie learns Beverly can do a great impression of Lord Bottomley, an English lord whom Lorraine is desperate to marry.  She gets Beverly to call Lorraine from the train station and pretend to be Lord Bottomley proposing, to get Lorraine to leave.  However, Lorraine soon sees through the ruse.  When Lorraine realizes Maggie's involvement she starts to seduce Bert as revenge.\nThe next day, Christmas, Bert is enthralled with Lorraine, and Maggie, hurt by Whiteside's betrayal, tells him she is quitting.  Feeling guilty, Sherry tries to think of a way to get Lorraine out of Mesalia.  He gets help from an unexpected visit by his friend, movie comedian Banjo.  Mr. Stanley, however, furious at Whiteside's interference with his family, has now ordered Sherry's eviction from the house and gives him fifteen minutes to leave.  All looks hopeless until an Egyptian mummy case is delivered to Whiteside (a Christmas gift from the Khedive of Egypt).  Whiteside and Banjo manage to trick Lorraine into the mummy case and shut her inside.  Sherry then sees a photo of Harriet Stanley when she was younger, and recognizes her as a famous axe murderer.  Using this information, he blackmails Mr. Stanley into helping them get the case onto Banjo's plane.\nWhiteside now stands, telling Maggie she is free to marry Bert and prepares to return to New York by train.  Unfortunately, as he is leaving the house, he slips on another patch of ice, injuring himself again.  He is carried back inside the house screaming as the curtain falls."

At the time the play was written Woollcott was famous both as the theater critic who helped re-launch the career of the Marx Brothers and as the star of the national radio show The Town Crier. He was well liked by both Kaufman and Hart, but that did not stop him from displaying the obnoxious characteristics displayed by Whiteside in the play. Kaufman and Hart had promised a vehicle for Woollcott but had been unable to find a plot that suited them until one day Woollcott showed up, unannounced, at Hart's Bucks County estate, and proceeded to take over the house. He slept in the master bedroom, terrorized Hart's staff, and generally acted like Sheridan Whiteside.  On his way out he wrote in Hart's guest book, \"This is to certify that I had one of the most unpleasant times I ever spent.\" Hart related the story to Kaufman soon afterwards. As they were both laughing about it, Hart remarked that he was lucky that Woollcott had not broken his leg and become stuck there. Kaufman looked at Hart and the idea was born.\nA plot point mentions actress and Broadway producer Katharine Cornell. The character Bert Jefferson writes a play, and Whiteside promises to give it to Cornell for her to star in. The character of Professor Metz is after Gustav Eckstein, MD, a physician writer from Cincinnati who studied animal behavior and was a long-time friend of Alexander Woollcott.\nWoollcott was delighted with The Man Who Came to Dinner and was offered the role for its Broadway debut. With his busy schedule of radio broadcasts and lectures, he declined, and Monty Woolley played the part on stage and in the subsequent film adaptation. Woollcott did subsequently play Whiteside in a West Coast touring production of the play.The printed edition of the play starts with the inscription \"To Alexander Woollcott, for reasons that are nobody's business.\""

Variety, The Advocate and Talkin' Broadway reviewed it positively, and Entertainment Weekly gave the production a B+, calling it \"as fresh a send-up as an SNL sketch and [with] an even more inspired plot\" and singling out Smart's \"swanning demonstration of ultimate showbiz phoniness\" for praise.  In The New York Times, however, Ben Brantley disliked the production, writing that \"What should be a buoyant balloon of an evening [is] more often an exercise in deflation.\" Brantley praised Stadlen but found most of the acting to be \"a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes and epigrams without being anchored to character.\"Smart was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play and Stadlen was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play, though neither won. The production was filmed and televised by Great Performances on PBS."

The librettist was Pierre-Joseph-Justin Bernard, whose reputation as a salon poet it made. This was the third opera by Rameau and his second in the form of the trag\u00e9die en musique (if the lost Samson is discounted). Rameau made substantial cuts, alterations and added new material to the opera for its revival in 1754. Experts still dispute which of the two versions is superior. Whatever the case, Castor et Pollux has always been regarded as one of Rameau's finest works."

        "content": "Charles Dill proposes that Rameau had composed the 1737 opera just after working with Voltaire on the opera \"Samson\" that was never completed, after which he composed \"Castor et Pollux\" implementing Voltaire's aesthetics. For example, Voltaire sought the presentation of static tableaus that expressed emotion, as in the first act of the 1737 version which begins at the scene of Castor's tomb with a Chorus of Spartans singing \"Que tout gemisse\", followed by a recitative between Telaire and Phoebe in which the former is grieving the loss of her lover Castor, and culminating in Telaire's lament aria \"Tristes apprets\". Dill notes that in contrast, the 1754 version begins with much more background behind the story of Telaire's love for Castor and depicts his death at the end. The events in Act I of the 1737 version appear in Act II of the 1754 version. Dill claims that Voltaire was more interested in music than action in opera. Moreover, Dill notes a difference in the plots between in the two versions. In the 1737 version, the main concern is for the moral dilemma between love and duty that Pollux faces: should he pursue his love of Telaira or rescue his brother? Of course, he chooses the latter. In the 1754 version, Dill remarks that that plot is more concerned with the tests that Pollux must face: he must kill Lynceus, persuade Jupiter not to oppose his journey into the Underworld, and persuade Castor not to accept the gift of immortality. \nWhile some scholars (such as Cuthbert Girdlestone, Paul-Marie Masson, and Graham Sadler) have assumed that the 1754 version was superior, Dill argues that Rameau made the changes of 1754 at a different point in his career. In 1737, he was testing the limits of tragedie lyrique; where in 1754, he had done more work with ballet-oriented genres in which he included striking musical compositions that delighted audiences. Thus, Dill proposes that there may have been some commercial concerns behind the change in aesthetic in 1754, as the revised version conformed more to the traditional Lullian aesthetic. He comments that while many see the revision as more innovative, in actuality the 1737 version was the more daring."

        "content": "Castor et Pollux appeared in 1737 while the controversy ignited by Rameau's first opera Hippolyte et Aricie was still raging. Conservative critics held the works of the \"father of French opera\", Jean-Baptiste Lully, to be unsurpassable. They saw Rameau's radical musical innovations as an attack on all they held dear and a war of words broke out between these Lullistes and the supporters of the new composer, the so-called Rameauneurs (or Ramistes). This controversy ensured that the premiere of Castor would be a noteworthy event.\nRameau had not altered the dramatic structure of Lully's trag\u00e9die lyrique genre: he retained the same five-act format with the same types of musical numbers (overture, recitative, air, chorus, and dance suites). He had simply expanded the musical resources available to French opera composers. While some welcomed Rameau's new idiom, more conservative listeners found it unappealing. On the one hand, Rameau's supporter Diderot (who later turned his loyalty elsewhere) remarked: \"Old Lulli is simple, natural, even, too even sometimes, and this is a defect. Young Rameau is singular, brilliant, complex, learned, too learned sometimes; but this is perhaps a defect on the listeners.\" On the other hand, the complaint of the Lullistes was that Rameau's musical idiom was far more expressive that Lully's and went so far as to call it distastefully \"Italianate\" (by French standard).  For example, where Lully has contained musical expression, Rameau's recitative style included much wider melodic leaps in contrast to Lully's more declamatory style. This can be heard clearly, for example, in the opening recitative between Phoebe and Cleone (Phoebe's servant) in Act I, scene 1 of the 1754 revised version.  Additionally, he added a richer harmonic vocabulary that included ninth chords. Rameau's more demanding vocal style led to the remark (thought to be made by Rameau himself) that while Lully's operas required actors, his required singers. Over time, these changes became more and more acceptable to the French audience.\nAs it turned out, the opera was a success. It received twenty performances in late 1737 but did not reappear until the substantially revised version took to the stage in 1754. This time there were thirty performances and ten in 1755. Graham Sadler writes that \"It was ... Castor et Pollux that was regarded as Rameau's crowning achievement, at least from the time of its first revival (1754) onwards.\"Revivals followed in 1764, 1765, 1772, 1773, 1778, 1779 and 1780. The taste for Rameau's operas did not long outlive the French Revolution but extracts from Castor et Pollux were still being performed in Paris as late as 1792. During the nineteenth century, the work did not appear on the French stage, though its fame survived the general obscurity into which Rameau's works had sunk; Hector Berlioz admiringly mentioned the aria Tristes appr\u00eats.The first modern revival took place at the Schola Cantorum in Paris in 1903. Among the audience was Claude Debussy. The first UK performance, organised by Ronald Crichton, was given by the Oxford University Opera Club in the early 1930s at Magdalen College in November 1934."

        "content": "The story takes place in the aftermath of the death of Alexander the Great, who left a vast empire, stretching from Macedonia through Persia to the Indian Ocean. His surviving generals fought for control of the empire and divided it up. Two of the historical characters in Voltaire's play and Spontini's opera, Cassander and Antigonus, were among the rivals competing for parts of the empire. Antigonus was one of Alexander's generals, while Cassander was the son of another of Alexander's generals, Antipater. Alexander's widow, Statira was supposedly killed by Alexander's first wife Roxana shortly after his death, but in Voltaire's play and Spontini's opera, she survives incognito, as a priestess of Diana in Ephesus. The title character Olimpie, daughter of Statira and Alexander, is likely entirely fictional.\nIt wasn't long after the death of Alexander that people began to glorify and mythologize his life. By the 3rd century it was believed by many that he was a mortal who had been selected by the gods to perform his heroic deeds. Although it is now thought that Alexander died from a fever, for many centuries it was believed he was murdered. The 'Alexander Romance', which first appeared at that time, obscured the true explanation of his death: \"the speaking trees of the Amazons were said to have told him of his early death during his last battle. Alexander would die after drinking a poisonous mixture served to him by his valet Iolus upon his return.\" It is not surprising, that Voltaire and Spontini's librettists Dieulafoy and Brifaut also assume that Alexander was murdered. Cassander's father Antipater was often designated as the leader of a poisoning plot, and Cassander himself was well known for his hostility to the memory of Alexander."

In it, he \"combined the psychologically exact character-drawing of La vestale [of 1807] with the massive choral style of his Fernand Cortez [of 1809] and wrote a work stripped of spectacular effects. In its grandiose conception, it appears the musical equivalent of neoclassical architecture.\" The Parisian premiere received mixed reviews, and Spontini withdrew it after the seventh performance (on 12 January 1820), so he could revise the finale with a happy rather than tragic ending.The first revised version was given in German as Olimpia in Berlin, where it was conducted by Spontini, who had been invited there by Frederick William III to become the Prussian General Musikdirector. E. T. A. Hoffmann provided the German translation of the libretto. This version was first staged on 14 May 1821 at the K\u00f6nigliches Opernhaus, where it was a success. After 78 performances in Berlin, it was given productions in Dresden (12 November 1825, with additions by Carl Maria von Weber), Kassel, Cologne, and Darmstadt (26 December 1858).Olimpie calls for huge orchestral forces (including the first use of the ophicleide). The finale of the Berlin version included spectacular effects, in which Cassandre rode in on a live elephant. Thus, like La vestale and Fernand Cortez, the work prefigures later French Grand Opera.\nSpontini revised the opera a second time, retaining the happy ending for its revival by the Op\u00e9ra at the Salle Le Peletier on 27 February 1826. Adolphe Nourrit replaced his father Louis in the role of Cassandre, and an aria composed by Weber was also included. Even in its fully revised form, the opera failed to hold the stage. Audiences found its libretto too old-fashioned, and it could not compete with the operas of Rossini.The opera was given in Italian in concert form in Rome on 12 December 1885 and revived more recently in Florence in 1930, at La Scala in Milan in 1966 (for which a sound recording is available), and at the Perugia Festival in 1979."

During the Russian Civil War, Ordzhonikidze, by birth (like Stalin) a Georgian, was a commissar for Ukraine, fighting the White Army under Anton Denikin. The opera, which is set during Ordzhonikidze's campaign against Denikin, appeared in the 1941 workplan of the Bolshoi Theatre with Muradeli named as composer; it was at that time named The Special Commissar (\u0427\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0432\u044b\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0440).Muradeli, who had himself been present at a meeting with Ordzhonikidze in Gori in 1921, had himself proposed the idea of the opera, the storyline of which also drew from Ordzhonikidze's account of his campaign in the Caucasus in his book The Path of a Bolshevik. On 22 January 1947 the opera, under the name of The Special Commissar, appeared in Order no. 40 published by the Arts Committee of  the Council of People's Commissars in the list of works intended to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution (7 November 1917) The title of the opera was changed in May 1947, (possibly at the suggestion of the censorship authorities) to The Great Friendship, referring to the friendship between the many peoples of the Soviet Union.The opera's premiere was at Stalino (now Donetsk), Ukraine, on 28 September 1947.

The first two performances at the Bolshoi were well received by the audiences. On 5 January 1948, however, Stalin visited the third performance at the Bolshoi in the company of other Politburo members.\nAndrei Zhdanov, Stalin's adviser on cultural policy, saw this as an opportunity to launch an attack on Russian musical culture similar to the attacks he had already undertaken on literature, cinema and the theatre. Zhdanov began questioning the performers of the opera, trying to persuade them to dissociate themselves from the work.A Resolution by the Politburo, \"On Muradeli's Opera The Great Friendship\", condemning formalism in music was issued on 10 February 1948, claiming that \"[i]n his desire to achieve a falsely conceived \u2018originality\u2019, Muradeli ignored and disregarded the finest traditions and experience of classical opera, and particularly of Russian classical opera.\" Muradeli had acknowledged his 'errors' and blamed them on the influence of Shostakovich.The Resolution named six composers (Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Nikolai Miaskovsky, Aram Khachaturian, Vissarion Shebalin and Gavriil Popov) as 'formalists', damaging their careers and effectively preventing their music being programmed until they 'repented'. Many dismissals were made at the Composers Union and purges continued under the newly-appointed General Secretary of the Union, Zhdanov's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Tikhon Khrennikov.It was not until two years after the death of Stalin that the 1948 Resolution was rescinded. A new decree was issued on 28 March 1958 by the Central Committee, entitled \"On the Correction of Errors in the Evaluation of The Great Friendship, Bogdan Khmelnitsky and  From All My Heart\" (two other works which had fallen foul of Zhdanov's campaigns). The singer Galina Vishnevskaya recalled attending a private party given by Shostakovich to celebrate the new decree, at which the composer \"proposed a toast to the great historical Decree \"On Abrogating the Great Historical Decree\"\", and sang Zhdanov's words \"There must be beautiful music; there must be refined music\" to the melody of Stalin's favourite lezginka.A revised version of the opera was prepared by Muradeli in 1960 and this was premiered in the town of Ordzhonikidze (today Vladikavkaz) in 1970."

Unknown to anyone, T\u00f6rek is in fact the impoverished Count Tassilo, who is seeking to earn a living and set aside some cash for the dowry of his sister Lisa. The Countess Maritza, a young widow, unexpectedly arrives at the estate to celebrate her engagement. This 'engagement' is however quite fictitious, an invention intended to put off her numerous followers.  The name she has chosen for her suitor, based on her recollection of Strauss' operetta, The Gypsy Baron, is Baron Koloman Zsup\u00e1n. However, amongst Maritza's guests, to Tassilo's horror, is Lisa, who he instructs to keep their relationship and his identity strictly secret. Maritza is also embarrassed when a genuine Koloman Zsup\u00e1n materialises, having seen an announcement of his 'engagement' in the press.\nTassilo is heard by the guests singing an air \"Komm, Zig\u00e1ny\" (\"Come, gypsies!\"), which he ends with a czardas. Maritza orders him to repeat it; he refuses, and the angry countess announces that he is fired. Manja predicts that The Countess will be very happy in love. \"One moon will pass over this Earth and Maritza will find her happiness\", she sings. Maritza therefore decides to remain on her estate. She stops Tassilo from leaving and apologises.\nZsupan has meanwhile decided that he prefers Lisa to Maritza, whilst Maritza is increasingly attracted to Tassilo. However, the ageing Lothario Populescu reveals to Maritza Tassilo's identity, and moreover alleges that Lisa is his girlfriend. Maritza in a high temper insults Tassilo, who declares that he will leave. However, before he goes, the repentant Maritza writes him a 'reference' which is in fact a proposal of marriage. The operetta ends with Maritza and Tassilo, and Zsupan and Lisa, engaged."

It was adapted from John Oxenford's A Day Well Spent (1835), and first performed at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna on 10 March 1842. The music was by Adolf M\u00fcller.\nAlthough about half of Nestroy's works have been revived for the modern German-speaking audience and many are part and parcel of today's Viennese repertoire, few have ever been translated into English, because Nestroy's language is not only stylized and finely graduated Viennese dialect, but also full of multiple puns and local allusions.\nEinen Jux will er sich machen is the only one that has become well known to English-speaking theatre-goers. It has become a classic more than once. It was adapted twice by Thornton Wilder, first as The Merchant of Yonkers (1938), then as The Matchmaker (1955), which later became the musical Hello, Dolly!. It also achieved success as the comic masterpiece On the Razzle, which was adapted by Tom Stoppard in 1981. Stoppard claims in his introduction that in most of the dialogues he did not even attempt to translate what Nestroy wrote."

The music was composed by Hungarian composer Emmerich K\u00e1lm\u00e1n with a libretto by Julius Brammer and Alfred Gr\u00fcnwald. It premiered in Vienna at the Theater an der Wien on April 5, 1928, and played for 372 performances. The work was presented in out-of-town tryouts in Newark, New Jersey and Springfield, Massachusetts by the Shuberts in 1929, but it did not make it to Broadway. The piece was forgotten until 1997, when the Lubo Opera Company performed it in concert in New York, after which Light Opera Works of Illinois performed the work in 1998 in a fully staged version with a new translation by Philip Kraus and Gregory Opelka. In 1999, Richard Bonynge made a recording of the work, which revived international interest in it.\nThe operetta mingles jazz elements and other contemporary dance music with musical elements traditionally associated with Viennese waltz-opera and anticipates such works as White Horse Inn and Paul Abraham's Victoria and Her Hussar. The score also incorporates traditions from K\u00e1lm\u00e1n's native Hungary. The libretto has a relatively modern satirical edge and draws on the political Kabarett that was a feature of radical Vienna, Berlin and Munich at the time. The piece directly addresses the impact of America and its social revolution, with its commentary on current affairs as seen in the jazz scene in Chicago. The piece reveals much about early 20th century European culture and European intellectual attitudes toward Americans, and American culture. The setting and score call for 1920s flapper costumes, jazz and the Charleston."

Meanwhile, back in the bankrupt state of Sylvaria, Prince S\u00e1ndor Boris and his ministers are trying to keep the natives happy while the king is off to Monte Carlo. Then, as now, there is nothing like a royal wedding to please the locals. The prince makes a marriage pact with his old pal, Princess Rosemarie of Morenia, but there is no love between them.\nMary arrives in Budapest, where she meets who she thinks is the prince, while the real prince has been pretending to be an aide-de-camp. She, of course, prefers the aide, and there is chemistry between them at the nightclub, though the prince prefers Viennese waltzes, and Mary prefers the Charleston. Later, in Sylvaria, Mary arranges to buy the royal palace, and is shocked to learn the true identity of her friend the \"aide\". She decides that, having bought the palace, she must also have \"the prince that goes with it\".\nBondy and the prince's promised bride fall in love and, despite themselves, Mary and the prince do so, too, though they still debate the relative merits of their favorite dances. But when the prince reads a letter that Mary wrote to her father, he gets the impression that she is merely buying him, and goes back to his older engagement.\nBack in Budapest, we learn that Bondy and Princess Rosemarie have eloped. The King of Sylvaria arrives with two Parisian floozies and tries to romance Mary (Sylvaria needs her money), but she, though amused, is not interested. But everything is saved when an American producer announces that he wants to make a movie about Mary and the prince, but cannot do so until the story has a genuine, American-style happy ending. The two compromise on a slow foxtrot."

It is a fervent plea for religious tolerance. It was never performed during Lessing's lifetime and was first performed in 1783 at the D\u00f6bbelinsches Theater in Berlin.Set in Jerusalem during the Third Crusade, it describes how the wise Jewish merchant Nathan, the enlightened sultan Saladin, and the (initially anonymous) Templar, bridge their gaps between Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. Its major themes are friendship, tolerance, relativism of God, a rejection of miracles and a need for communication."

        "content": "The events take place during the Third Crusade (1189\u20131192) during an armistice in Jerusalem.\nWhen Nathan, a wealthy Jew, returns home from business travel, he learns that his foster daughter Recha was saved from a house fire by a young Christian Templar. The knight, in turn, owes his life to the Muslim ruler of Jerusalem, Sultan Saladin, who pardoned him as the only one of twenty prisoners because he looks like Saladin's late brother Assad. Despite these fortunate circumstances, the rational-thinking Nathan is unwilling to believe the events to be a miracle and also convinces Recha that believing in the work of guardian angels is harmful.\nSaladin, somewhat indifferent in terms of money, is currently in financial trouble. That is why, on the advice of his more calculating sister Sittah, he has the wealthy Nathan brought to him to test his generosity, which is praised throughout Jerusalem: Instead of asking him directly for a loan, Saladin pretends that he wants to test Nathan's famous wisdom and asks him about the \"true religion\". Nathan, who had already been informed about Saladin's financial troubles by his friend Al-Hafi and warned of his financial recklessness, recognizes the trap. He decides to answer Saladin's question with a \"fairy tale\", the so-called \"ring parable\". Deeply impressed, Saladin immediately understands this parable as a message about the equality of the three major monotheistic religions. Moved by Nathan's humanity, he asks him to be his friend from now on. Nathan willingly agrees and, on top of that, grants Saladin a generous loan without being asked.\nThe Templar, who had saved Recha from the flames, but, until now, was not willing to meet her, is united with her by Nathan. He falls head over heels in love with her and wants to marry her on the spot. However, his name makes Nathan hesitate to give his consent, which insults the Templar. When he finds out from Recha's companion Daja, a Christian, that Recha is not Nathan's biological daughter, but is only adopted, and that her biological parents were Christians, he turns to the patriarch of Jerusalem for advice. Although the Templar frames his request as a hypothetical case, the fanatical head of the church guesses what this is about and wants to search for \"this Jew\" immediately and have him burned at the stake for temptation to apostasy. He does not consider Nathan's noble motives and the fact that Nathan did not raise the Christian child as a Jew, but on the contrary in no belief, does not soften the patriarch's stance, but aggravates him: \"That\u2019s nothing! Still the Jew is to be burnt\u2014 / And for this very reason would deserve / To be thrice burnt.\"\nRecords of the friar who once brought Recha to Nathan as a toddler finally reveal that the Christian Templar and Recha are not only brother and sister \u2013 hence Nathan's reservations about marriage \u2013 but also the children of Saladin's brother Assad. These connections are revealed to everyone in the final scene at Saladin's palace, which ends with all main characters repeatedly embracing each other in silence."

        "content": "The centerpiece of the work is the \"Ring Parable\", narrated by Nathan when asked by Saladin which religion is true: an heirloom ring with the magical ability to render its owner pleasing in the eyes of God and mankind had been passed down from father to son. For generations, each father had bequeathed the ring to the son he loved most. When it came to a father with three sons whom he loved equally, he promised it (in \"pious weakness\") to each of them. Looking for a way to keep his promise, he had two replicas made, which were indistinguishable from the original, and gave on his deathbed a ring to each of them.The brothers quarreled over who owned the real ring. A wise judge admonished them that it was impossible to tell at that time \u2013 that it even could not be discounted that all three rings were replicas, the original one having been lost at some point in the past; that to find out whether one of them had the real ring it was up to them to live in such a way that their ring's powers could be proven true, to live a life that is pleasant in the eyes of God and mankind rather than expecting the ring's miraculous powers to do so. Nathan compares this to religion, saying that each of us lives by the religion we have learned from those we respect.An older rendition of the Ring Parable and its surrounding narrative involving Saladin and a wealthy Jew can be found in the 73\u00b0 story of Il Novellino, in the third tale of the first day in Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron, and in the story Ansalon Giudeo from Bosone da Gubbio's novel Fortunatus Siculus: ossia L'avventuroso Ciciliano.Even earlier versions can be found in the Tractatus de diversis materiis praedicabilibus by \u00c9tienne de Bourbon, in Li dis dou vrai aniel and in the Gesta Romanorum."

The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet, the courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and the main setting is Denmark.\nThe action of Stoppard's play takes place mainly \"in the wings\" of Shakespeare's Hamlet, with brief appearances of major characters from Hamlet who enact fragments of the original's scenes. Between these episodes, the two protagonists voice their confusion at the progress of events occurring onstage without them in Hamlet, of which they have no direct knowledge.\nComparisons have also been drawn with Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, for the presence of two central characters who almost appear to be two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time."

The play is structured as the inverse of Hamlet, in which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two minor characters who were childhood friends of the Prince; instead, the duo remains the focus and Hamlet himself is a minor role whose actions occur largely offstage, with the exception of a few short scenes in which the dramatic plays converge.\nIn Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern operate under the King's command in an attempt to discover Hamlet's motives and plot against him. Hamlet, however, derisively mocks and outwits them, so that they, rather than he, are sentenced to death in the end. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead explores these events from the perspective of the duo; their actions seem largely nonsensical because they are superseded and, therefore, determined by Hamlet's plot.\nAfter witnessing a performance of The Murder of Gonzago \u2013 the play within the play in Hamlet \u2013 they find themselves on a ship, transporting Prince Hamlet to the King in England, with the troupe that staged the performance also on board as stowaways. They are supposed to give the King a letter with an instruction to execute Hamlet, who discovers this and replaces the letter with another one. During the voyage, the ship is hijacked by pirates, after which it is discovered that Hamlet has disappeared and the letter now instructs the English monarch to execute them instead.\nThe troupe recreates the duel scene from Hamlet with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, at the end, accepting quo fata ferunt (\"whither the fates carry [us]\"). The play concludes with the final scene from Hamlet in which the English Ambassador arrives and announces that \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead\"."

The first important commission Pergolesi received on leaving the school was linked to this religious order and on 19 March 1731 his oratorio La fenice sul rogo, o vero La morte di San Giuseppe (The Phoenix on the Pyre, or The Death of Saint Joseph) was performed in the atrium of their church, today known as the Chiesa dei Girolamini, the home of the Congregazione di San Giuseppe. \"The following summer Pergolesi was asked to set to music, as the final exercise of his studies, a dramma sacro in three acts by Ignazio Mancini, Li prodigi della divina grazia nella conversione e morte di san Guglielmo duca d\u2019Aquitania [\"The Miracles of Divine Grace in the Conversion and Death of Saint William, Duke of Aquitaine\"]. The performance took place in the cloisters of the monastery of Sant'Agnello Maggiore, the home of the Canons Regular of the Most Holy Saviour.\" The libretto was supplied by a lawyer, Ignazio Maria Mancini, \"who indulged in poetical sins as a member of the Arcadian Academy under the name Echione Cinerario. [...] The audience was made up of habitu\u00e9s of the Congregation of the Oratorians, in other words 'the cream of Naples' ...and its success was such that the Prince Colonna di Stigliano, equerry to the Viceroy of Naples, and Duke Carafa di Maddaloni \u2013 both of them present \u2013 promised the 'little maestro' their protection and opened the doors of the Teatro San Bartolomeo to him, then one of the most popular and important theatres in Naples,\" where Pergolesi was soon commissioned to write his first opera seria, La Salustia.The autograph score of San Guglielmo has not survived but the various manuscripts which have been rediscovered show that the drama enjoyed widespread popularity for several years, and not only in Naples: in 1742 it was even revived in Rome, although only as an oratorio with the comic elements of the original removed. The libretto of this version was published.\nThe work was brought to public attention again in 1942, during World War II: it was staged at the Teatro dei Rozzi, Siena, on 19 September, in a reworking by Corrado Pavolini and Riccardo Nielsen, and was later mounted, apparently in a different stage production, on 18 October at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. The work was revived again in 1986 in a critical edition by Gabriele Catalucci and Fabro Maestri based on the oldest of the manuscripts, the one to be found at the Conservatorio San Pietro a Majella in Naples, the only manuscript which also contained the comic element represented by Captain Cu\u00f2semo. The music was also performed at the Teatro Sociale of Amelia, conducted by Fabio Maestri himself, and a live recording was made. Three years later, in the summer of 1989, it was revived in another concert performance at the Festival della Valle d'Itria in Martina Franca, with Marcello Panni as conductor. In 2016, at the Festival Pergolesi Spontini in Jesi, Pergolesi's opera saw its latest major staging, in the critical revision by Livio Aragona, conducted by Christophe Rousset and directed by Francesco Nappa."

        "content": "La Wally is an opera in four acts by composer Alfredo Catalani, to a libretto by Luigi Illica, first performed at La Scala, Milan, on 20 January 1892. It was Catalani's last opera.The libretto is based on a hugely successful Heimatroman by Wilhelmine von Hillern (1836\u20131916), Die Geier-Wally, Eine Geschichte aus den Tyroler Alpen (The Vulture Wally: A Story from the Tyrolean Alps). Wally, short for Walburga, is a girl with some heroic attributes. The story is based on an episode in the life of Tyrolean painter Anna Stainer-Knittel, whom von Hillern met. She got her epithet \"Geier\" (vulture, the local name for eagle) from having gutted a bearded vulture's nest going down a rope; this dangerous task, aimed at protecting the sheep in the Alpine village, was typically performed by a man.\nVon Hillern's piece was originally serialized in Deutsche Rundschau and was reproduced in English as \"A German Peasant Romance\" in the Cornhill Magazine in 1875.\nThe opera is best known for its aria \"Ebben? Ne andr\u00f2 lontana\" (\"Well, then? I'll go far away,\" act 1, sung when Wally decides to leave her home forever). American soprano Wilhelmenia Fernandez sang this aria in Jean-Jacques Beineix's 1981 movie Diva \u2013 a performance at the heart of the thriller. Catalani had composed this aria independently as \"Chanson Gro\u00ebnlandaise\" in 1878 and later incorporated it into his opera.\nThe opera features a memorable operatic death in which the heroine throws herself into an avalanche. It is seldom performed, partly because of the difficulty of staging this scene, but Wally's principal aria is still sung frequently."

        "content": "The House of Bernarda Alba (Spanish: La casa de Bernarda Alba) is a play by the Spanish dramatist Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca.  Commentators have often grouped it with Blood Wedding and Yerma as a \"rural trilogy\". Garcia Lorca did not include it in his plan for a \"trilogy of the Spanish land\" (which remained unfinished at the time of his murder).Garcia Lorca described the play in its subtitle as a drama of women in the villages of Spain. The House of Bernarda Alba was Garcia Lorca's last play, completed on 19 June 1936, two months before his assassination during the Spanish Civil War. The play was first performed on 8 March 1945 at the Avenida Theatre in Buenos Aires. The play centers on the events of a house in Andalusia during a period of mourning, in which Bernarda Alba (aged 60) wields total control over her five daughters Angustias (39 years old), Magdalena (30), Amelia (27), Martirio (24), and Adela (20). The housekeeper (La Poncia) and Bernarda's elderly mother (Mar\u00eda Josefa) also live there.\nThe deliberate exclusion of any male character from the action helps build up the high level of sexual tension that is present throughout the play. Pepe \"el Romano\", the love interest of Bernarda's daughters and suitor of Angustias, never appears on stage. The play explores themes of repression, passion, and conformity, and inspects the effects of men upon women."

        "content": "Upon her second husband's death, domineering matriarch Bernarda Alba imposes an eight-year mourning period on her household in accordance with her family tradition. Bernarda has five daughters, aged between 20 and 39, whom she has rigidly controlled and prohibited from any form of relationship. The mourning period further isolates them and tension mounts within the household.\nAfter a mourning ritual at the family home, eldest daughter Angustias enters, having been absent while the guests were there. Bernarda fumes, assuming she had been listening to the men's conversation on the patio. Angustias inherited a large sum of money from Bernarda's first husband, while Bernarda's second husband has left only small sums to his four daughters. Angustias' wealth attracts a young, attractive suitor from the village, Pepe el Romano. Her sisters are jealous, believing it unfair that plain, sickly Angustias should receive both the majority of the inheritance and the freedom to marry and escape their suffocating home.\n\nYoungest sister Adela, stricken with sudden spirit and jubilation after her father's funeral, defies her mother's orders and dons a green dress instead of remaining in mourning black. Her brief taste of youthful joy shatters when she discovers that Angustias will be marrying Pepe. Poncia, Bernarda's maid, advises Adela to bide her time: Angustias will probably die delivering her first child. Distressed, Adela threatens to run into the streets in her green dress, but her sisters manage to stop her. Suddenly they see Pepe coming down the street. Adela stays behind while her sisters rush to get a look, until a maid hints that she could get a better look from her bedroom window.\nAs Poncia and Bernarda discuss the daughters' inheritances upstairs, Bernarda sees Angustias wearing makeup. Appalled that Angustias would defy her orders to remain in a state of mourning, Bernarda violently scrubs the makeup off her face. The other daughters enter, followed by Bernarda's elderly mother, Maria Josefa, who is usually locked away in her room. Maria Josefa announces that she wants to get married; she also warns Bernarda that she'll turn her daughters' hearts to dust if they cannot be free. Bernarda forces her back into her room.\nIt is revealed that Adela and Pepe are having a secret affair. Adela becomes increasingly volatile, defying her mother and quarreling with her sisters, particularly Martirio, who reveals her own feelings for Pepe. Adela shows the most horror when the family hears the latest gossip about how the townspeople recently tortured a young woman who had delivered and killed an illegitimate baby.\nTension explodes as family members confront one another, leading to Bernarda pursuing Pepe with a gun. A gunshot is heard outside the home. Martirio and Bernarda return and imply that Pepe has been killed. Adela flees into another room. With Adela out of earshot, Martirio tells everyone else that Pepe actually fled on his pony. Bernarda remarks that as a woman she can't be blamed for poor aim. A loud noise is heard; Bernarda immediately calls for Adela, who has locked herself into a room. When she doesn't respond, Bernarda and Poncia force the door open. Poncia's shriek is heard. She returns with her hands clasped around her neck and warns the family not to enter the room. Adela, not knowing that Pepe survived, has hanged herself.\n\nThe closing lines of the play show Bernarda characteristically preoccupied with the family's reputation, not registering that Adela and Pepe had an affair due to her moral code. She insists that Adela has died a virgin and demands that this be made known to the whole town. Bernarda forbids her daughters to cry."

Alexander has become the director of a travelling circus and calls himself Obolski; he has much with which to regale.

He and his MI6 opposite number Simon Craig liaise with the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence to supply weapons to Afghan warlords fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The Pakistanis insist on retaining control of the weapons supply and on prioritising Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a right-wing Islamist warlord unpalatable to both Warnock and Craig, though they both acquiesce to the deal. Warnock and the CIA have been banned from setting foot in Afghanistan personally, so he goes to a refugee camp on the Pakistan side of the border to meet with a relatively secular, non-right-wing warlord Abdullah and his western-pop-music-loving right-hand-man Saeed. He agrees to supply them both with weapons in return for information on the situation in Afghanistan. Warnock is also troubled by his absence from his wife and what he sees as his betrayal of his contacts in Iran after the Islamic Revolution there.\nAfter four years, Warnock returns to the USA, where his wife miscarries a long-hoped-for daughter before giving birth to a son. Warnock also coordinates a US visit and speech by Abdullah which convinces a wealthy senator to donate to the cause. Against the wishes of Warnock's superior Walter Barnes, who believes such a move might backfire in the future and removes all trace of deniability, a US committee votes to supply the Afghan warlords with Stinger missiles. Warnock returns to Afghanistan where he refuses Gromov's plea to let the Soviets retreat with dignity and alienates Craig by continuing to support Pakistan's backing of Hekmatyar. He meets Gromov as he departs Peshawar and then has a final meeting with Abdullah (this time in Afghanistan) before going back to the USA. He learns from Abdullah that Saeed has been killed by the Soviets and that Saeed was in fact Abdullah's son, a fact he had not previously revealed to Warnock. Warnock asks to buy back the Stinger missiles but learns Abdullah has sold them to Iran and allied himself with Hekmatyar until the Soviets are finally defeated. Abdullah then closes the play with a warning that the Mujahadeen will defeat the Soviets then \"cross oceans\" to spread Islamism."

        "content": "Nielsen first considered writing an opera based on Holberg's play Maskarade around the turn of the 20th century. He contacted Vilhelm Andersen (1864\u20131953) whom he knew from his student days, hoping to persuade him to write a libretto. Andersen initially refused but finally agreed, allowing Nielsen to start composing in May 1904. The Royal Theatre scheduled the opera even before it was finished. In fact, Nielsen completed the overture only on 3 November, a week before the opera's premiere.\nThe world premiere of Maskarade took place at Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen on 11 November 1906. It was a resounding success from the start with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Reviews in the press were however mixed, the consensus being that the first act was the best, the second was rather weak and the third lacked theatrical clarity although the music was brilliant. Announcement of plans to turn Holberg's classical comedy into an opera buffa had met with dismay in Danish literary circles, but the opera was immediately popular, more so than the play itself. Now considered to be Denmark's national opera, it has enjoyed lasting success in the country, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \"old Copenhagen\" atmosphere. In 2006, Denmark's Ministry of Culture named it one of Denmark's twelve greatest musical works.The opera did not premiere in the United States until 1972 when it was performed by the St. Paul Opera in Minnesota with conductor Igor Buketoff, Mary Beth Peil as Leonora,  and Clinton Ware as Leander. The first reported New York performance was by the Bronx Opera Company in 1983. It was performed in the US again in 2014, when it had its Chicago premiere on 18 January at the Vittum Theater performed by the Vox3 Collective. Maskarade received a major international revival in 2005 in a new production by David Pountney which was performed at the Bregenz Festival in August of that year and travelled to the Royal Opera House the following month for its first performance by the company. The opera had been previously performed in the UK at London's Morley College in 1983 and in Leeds by Opera North in 1990.Despite its popularity in his home country, Nielsen was not entirely satisfied with the work, citing structural weakness in the final two acts; but he never got around to revising the work. The overture and the ballet from the third act (\"Dance of the Cockerels\") are performed frequently, as noted by the Carl Nielsen Society, which states that the overture is one of Nielsen's most widely performed works at concerts in Europe and North America."

        "content": "It is most likely that the play was written for the child actors at Blackfriars Theatre, where John Marston had previously had plays produced. In addition to the textual history testifying to a Blackfriars origin, there are multiple references within the text to Marston, to the actors as children (notably from the Citizen's Wife, who seems to recognise the actors from their school), and other indications that the performance took place in a house known for biting satire and sexual innuendo. Blackfriars specialised in satire, according to Andrew Gurr (quoted in Hattaway, ix), and Michael Hattaway suggests that the dissonance of the youth of the players and the gravity of their roles combined with the multiple internal references to holiday revels because the play had a Shrovetide or midsummer's day first production (Hattaway xxi and xiii). The play is certainly carnivalesque, but the date of the first performance is purely speculative. The second quarto publication came in 1635, with a third the same year. The play was omitted from the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647 but included in the second folio of 1679. The play was later widely thought to be the joint work of Beaumont and John Fletcher."

        "content": "Scene: London and the neighbouring Country, except for Act IV Scene ii which is set in Moldavia.\nAs a play called The London Merchant is about to be performed, a Citizen and his Wife 'in the audience' interrupt to complain that the play will misrepresent the middle-class citizens of the city. The Citizen, who identifies himself as a grocer, climbs onto the stage, bringing his Wife up to sit with him. They demand that the players put on a play of their own choosing and suggest that the Citizen's own apprentice, Rafe, should be given a part.  Rafe demonstrates his dramatic skills by quoting Shakespeare, and a part is created for him as a knight errant. He refers to himself as a 'Grocer Errant' and has a burning pestle on his shield as a heraldic device.\nThis meta-plot is intercut with the main plot of the interrupted play, The London Merchant, in which Jasper Merrythought, the merchant's apprentice, is in love with his master's daughter, Luce, and must elope with her to save her from marriage to Humphrey, a City man of fashion. Luce pretends to Humphrey that she has made an unusual vow: she will only marry a man who has the spirit to run away with her. She knows that Humphrey will immediately inform her father. She intends to fake an elopement with Humphrey, knowing that her father will allow this to happen, but then to drop him and meet up with Jasper.\nMeanwhile, Jasper's mother has decided to leave her husband, Old Merrythought, who has spent all his savings in drinking and partying. When Jasper seeks his mother's help, she rejects him in favour of his younger brother Michael. She tells Michael that she has jewellery that she can sell to live on while he learns a trade. They leave Merrythought, and lose themselves in a wood where she misplaces her jewellery. Jasper arrives to meet Luce and finds the jewels. Luce and Humphrey appear. Jasper, as planned, knocks over Humphrey and escapes with Luce. The Grocer Errant arrives, believing when he sees the distraught Mrs Merrythought that he has met a damsel in distress.  He takes the Merrythoughts to an inn, expecting the host to accommodate them chivalrously without charge. When the host demands payment, the Grocer Errant is perplexed. The host tells him there are people in distress he must save from an evil barber named Barbaroso (a barber surgeon who is attempting cures on people with venereal diseases). He effects a daring rescue of Barbaroso's patients.\nThe Citizen and his Wife demand more chivalric and exotic adventures for Rafe, and a scene is created in which the Grocer Errant must go to Moldavia where he meets a princess who falls in love with him. But he says that he has already plighted his troth to Susan, a cobbler's maid in Milk Street. The princess reluctantly lets him go, lamenting that she cannot come to England, as she has always dreamed of tasting English beer.\nJasper tests Luce's love by pretending he intends to kill her because of the way her father has treated him. She is shocked, but declares her devotion to him. Humphrey and her father arrive with other men. They attack Jasper and drag Luce away. The merchant locks Luce in her room. Jasper feigns death and writes a letter to the merchant with a pretend dying apology for his behaviour. The coffin, with Jasper hiding within, is carried to the merchant's house, where Luce laments his demise. Jasper rises and explains his plan to save her from marriage to Humphrey: Luce is to take Jasper's place in the coffin while Jasper remains hidden in the house. When the merchant enters, Jasper pretends to be his own ghost and scares the merchant into expelling Humphrey. A chastened Mrs Merrythought returns to her husband. Jasper reveals he is still alive. The merchant asks for Old Merrythought's forgiveness and consents to Jasper's match with Luce.\nThe Citizen and his Wife demand that Rafe's part in the drama should also have an appropriate ending, and he is given a heroic death scene. Everyone is satisfied."

        "content": "The play hits a number of satirical and parodic points. The audience is satirised, with the interrupting grocer, but the domineering and demanding merchant class is also satirised in the main plot. Beaumont makes fun of the new demand for stories of the middle classes for the middle classes, even as he makes fun of that class's actual taste for an exoticism and a chivalry that is entirely hyperbolic. The Citizen and his Wife are bombastic, sure of themselves, and certain that their prosperity carries with it mercantile advantages (the ability to demand a different play for their admission fee than the one the actors have prepared).\nThe broader humour of the play derives from innuendo and sexual jokes, as well as joking references to other dramatists. The players, for example, plant a winking joke at the Citizen's expense, as the pestle of Rafe's herald is a phallic metaphor, and a burning pestle/penis implies syphilis, on the one hand, and sexual bravado, on the other. The inability of the Citizen and Wife to comprehend how they are satirised, or to understand the main plot, allows the audience to laugh at itself, even as it admits its complicity with the Citizen's boorish tastes."

However, the private theatres were first to introduce the practice of having audience members seated on the stage proper (according to Gurr, op cit. in Hattaway ix), which is a framing device for this play's action. Additionally, the higher cost of a private theatre (sixpence, compared to a penny at some public theatres) changed the composition of the audience and would have suggested a more critically aware (and demanding) crowd. The play makes use of several \"interludes,\" which would have been spare entertainments between the acts (but which are integrated into the performance in this case), again emphasising the smallness and spareness of the initial staging (as interludes would have allowed for technicians to arrange the lights and scenery and to put actors in place).\nRevivals of the play are largely undocumented, but some are attested. Hattaway suggests that it was performed in the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane in 1635, at court the next year, and then after the Restoration at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in 1662 and again in 1665 and 1667 (Hattaway xxix). The play \"has proved popular with amateur and university groups,\" according to Hattaway, but not with professional troupes."

Karandyshev is a silly, obnoxious and vain person, but Larisa doesn't much care about that, wishing only to get away from it all and to live in the country. Suddenly, Paratov arrives and causes a stir both in the local community and in the girl's heart. It turns out he's about to marry a rich woman and now enjoys his last bachelor spree, selling ships he owns to get money to burn. He finds out Larisa still loves him and realizes that his own feelings for her are also still strong.\nKarandyshev, just to show off, throws a party, inviting among others a young man Vozhevatov (Larisa's childhood friend), local millionaire Knurov (who'd earlier told Larisa's mother he'd be willing to become her daughter's 'sponsor' and take her to Paris should she feel inclined that way; the mother is quite receptive to the offer) and Paratov himself. Paratov, to punish Karandyshev for being impolite and to make Larisa see him for what he was, stages a kind of practical joke. Using his alcoholic actor friend's drinking prowess he makes the young man get drunk and make a fool of himself, prompting laugher and ridicule from the other guests. Leaving Karandyshev behind, Paratov, Knurov and Vozhevatov take Larisa out for an impromptu nighttime picnic.\nAs the party ends, Larisa approaches Paratov and proposes marriage. She gets a straight answer: no, he won't marry her after all, for he is betrothed to that other woman. Larisa feels humiliated, betrayed and compromised. Feeling unable to return home and face her fianc\u00e9, whom she now hates, she contemplates suicide. Knurov and Vozhevatov discuss her position among themselves too; they end up tossing a coin to decide which of them will be lucky enough to take her on to a romantic trip to Paris. The older man wins, but Larisa rejects his offer. Drunk Karandyshev appears brandishing one of the Turkish pistols from his collection and implores Larisa to return home. Full of contempt, she refuses. In a fit of desperation, he draws the pistol and shoots her. Mortally wounded, she reaches for the pistol, trying to make it appear as if she shot herself, and even thanks her murderer. \"You all are... good people and... I love you all,\" are her last words."

I intend to finish it this year and am going to polish it with the utmost care for it will be my 40th original work.\" The play's manuscript has been marked by the author as \"Opus 40\".Next time Ostrovsky mentioned it in his 15 February [O.S. 3 February] 1878, in a letter to Burdin: \"Now I am busy working on a large original play.

Ostrovsky wrote back: \"I've read the play in Moscow five times, among the audiences there were people whom I'd hardly call my friends, but all unanimously agreed that Without a Dowry was my best play to date. The idea of cutting anything in the text hasn't crossed anyone's mind. But you there, do cut whatever you will, I won't dispute it\"."

Several days later the play was performed for the second time, as a benefit for Prov Sadovsky, with Maria Yermolova as Larisa. Ostrovsky in a letter informed Burdin of the \"great success\" these two shows had. In Saint Petersburg Without a Dowry was performed for the first time on 4 December [O.S. 22 November], in the Alexandrinsky Theatre, as a benefit for Burdin. Maria Savina played Larisa and it was her inspired performance that drew all the attention. Otherwise the critical response was lukewarm.\nIn the early 1890s, Without a Dowry was successfully revived on stage by Vera Komissarzhevskaya, who created her own, unique version of the Larisa character. Konstantin Stanislavski directed production for his Society of Art and Literature (an organisation that aimed to bring together amateur and professional performers) that opened on 31 December [O.S. 19 December] 1896. In the Soviet era, the play was staged regularly in numerous theaters and in 1948 made a return to the Maly Theater's repertoire.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "\"I am now working upon a new large play which will be finished in November,\" Ostrovsky wrote to his friend, the Alexandrinka actor Fyodor Burdin in October 1869. Once it was over, the dramatist sent the copy to Otechestvennye Zapisky magazine which published it in the No.1, January 1869 issue.\nBurdin, as usual, has taken it upon himself to see the play through the censorship routine. To play it safe, he's left his own inscription upon the title page: \"The action here takes place 30 years ago.\" On January 4, 1869, the comedy was licensed by the Imperial Theatres of Russia. On January 15 it premiered at the Maly Theatre, as a benefit for Prov Sadovsky, who played Kuroslepov. It also featured Sofia Akimova (as Matryona Kharitonovna), Glikeriya Fedotova (Parasha), Aleksandr Fedotov (Silan), Vasily Zhivokini (Gradoboyev), Vladimir Dmitrevsky (Khlynov), Sergey Shumsky (Aristarkh), Dmitry Zhivokini (Narkis), Nikolai Muzil (Gavrila), Mikhail Tretyakov-Strelsky (Vasya the Quick One), Konstantin Konstantinov (Landlord), Nikolai Nikiforov (Sidorenko).There were conflicting reports as to the play's reception at Maly. According to several Moscow newspapers (among them Sovremennaya Letopis), it flopped. Several years later Ostrovsky wrote: \"Newspapers reported that... An Ardent Heart had no success in Moscow but those reports were obviously false. The play was getting more and more successful crescendo-like with each and every. Being ill, I could see only the 12th or 13th performance, don't remember exactly which, and how did the public react? Actors Sadovsky, Fedotova, Muzil, Zhivokini, Dmitrevsky, Shuysky, Akimova were being called up after each act and occasionally even after certain scenes. After the curtain the whole cast come up on stage several times to be greeted by the audience. What sort of 'flop' that was?\" Leo Tolstoy who saw the performance on January 17, in a letter back home called it 'excellent'.On 15 January 1869 An Ardent Heart was performed in Saint Petersburg's Alexandrinsky Theatre, as Yulia Linskaya's benefit (she played Matryona Kharitonovna), featuring Pavel Vasilyev (Kuroslepov), Yelena Struyskaya (Parasha), Pyotr Zubrov (Silan), Vasily Samoylov (Gradoboyev), Fyodor Burdin (Khlynov), Nikolai Zubov (Aristarkh), Ivan Gorbunov (Narkis), Nikolai Sazonov (Vasya the Quick One). Ostrovsky was greatly upset with this performance. \"For someone who's never known what failure was, experiencing it for the first time is tragedy. This grievance hit me for the first time in 1869 in Saint Petersburg, where An Ardent Heart premiered... Now I think it would have been much better for this play never to appear on the Petersburg stage... They proved to be completely ignorant there about what the 'folk drama' genre was about, and the production... was so negligent and incompetent, it wouldn't have been recognized at all by those who'd seen the play [in Moscow],\" he later wrote.\nAccording to The Society of Russian Dramatists, in 1874-1886 the play was missing from the two major cities theatres' respective repertoires but enjoyed more than 30 productions in the province. In 1887-1917 it was produced all in all 196 times. In 1893 the Alexandrinsky Theatre revived the play and this time had success with it. In 1948 actor Yury Yuriev wrote in his memoirs: I left the theatre positively shaken. Whichever character you'd take, presented an open book of human life, and this time the actors' ensemble was exemplary. Sanina, Varlamov, Davydov, Medvedev, Shapovalenko all together reconstructed this 'realm of darkness', a brutal force of despotism which made us all wince with horror. Everyday routines, stale customs, this whole way of life hung like a dark heavy cloud over an ardent heart, smothering rays of light, making it impossible for a living being to break through this web of harsh reality. The play had enormous success. Even now our theatre's veterans remember it as something close to perfection, the finest moment in the Aleksandrinka's history. The Tchaikovskys were present too. During the break Pyotr Ilych, passing by, said to me: \"Isn't it lovely? What a performance. Ostrovsky's every work is pure gold.\"\nAn Ardent Heart was successfully revived by several Soviet theatres. The 1926 Moscow Art Theatre's production was considered to be one of the best, with actors like Ivan Moskvin (Khlynov), Mikhail Tarkhanov (Gradoboyev), Vladimir Gribunin (Kuroslepov), Boris Dobronravov (Narkis), Nikolai Khmelyov (Silan) and Faina Shevchenko (Matryona) involved.\n\n\n== References =="

The play was published in 1781 and premiered on 13 January 1782 in Mannheim, Germany, and was inspired by Leisewitz' earlier play Julius of Taranto. It was written towards the end of the German Sturm und Drang (\"Storm and Stress\") movement, and many critics, such as Peter Brooks, consider it very influential in the development of European melodrama. The play astounded its Mannheim audience and made Schiller an overnight sensation. It later became the basis for Verdi's opera of the same name, I masnadieri."

        "content": "The plot revolves around the conflict between two aristocratic brothers, Karl and Franz Moor. The charismatic but rebellious student Karl is deeply loved by his father. The younger brother, Franz, who appears as a cold, calculating villain, plots to wrest away Karl's inheritance. As the play unfolds, both Franz's motives and Karl's innocence and heroism are revealed to be complex.\nSchiller's highly emotional language and his depiction of physical violence mark the play as a quintessential Sturm und Drang work. At the same time, the play utilizes a traditional five-act structure, with each act containing two to five scenes. The play uses alternating scenes to pit the brothers against each other, as one quests for money and power, while the other attempts to create a revolutionary anarchy in the Bohemian Forest.\nSchiller raises many disturbing issues in the play. For instance, he questions the dividing lines between personal liberty and the law and probes the psychology of power, the nature of masculinity and the essential differences between good and evil. He strongly criticizes both the hypocrisies of class and religion and the economic inequities of German society. He also conducts a complicated inquiry into the nature of evil.\nSchiller was inspired by the play Julius of Taranto (1774) by Johann Anton Leisewitz, a play Friedrich Schiller considered a favourite."

He is a good person at heart, but also weak, and has failed to raise his two sons properly. He bears responsibility for the perversion of the Moor family, which has caused the family's values to become invalidated. The Moor family acts as an analogy of state, a typical political criticism of Schiller's.\nKarl (Charles) Moor, his older son, is a self-confident idealist. He is good-looking and well liked by all. He holds feelings of deep love for Amalia. After his father, misled by brother Franz, curses Karl and banishes him from his home, Karl becomes a disgraceful criminal and murderous arsonist. While he exudes a general spirit of melancholy about the promising life he has left behind, Karl, together with his gang of robbers, fights against the unfairness and corruption of the feudal authorities (his character follows the literary archetype of the noble outlaw). His despair leads him to express and discover new goals and directions, and to realize his ideals and dreams of heroism. He does not shrink from breaking the law, for, as he says, \"the end justifies the means\". He develops a close connection with his robbers, especially Roller and Schweizer, but he recognizes the unscrupulousness and dishonor of Spiegelberg and his other associates. Amalia creates a deep internal twist in the plot and in Karl's persona. He swore allegiance to the robbers after Schweizer and Roller died for his sake, and he promised that he would never separate from his men, so cannot return to Amalia. In deep desperation due to the death of his father, he eventually kills his true love and decides to turn himself in to the law.\nFranz Moor, the count's younger son, is an egoistic rationalist and materialist. He is cold-hearted and callous. He is rather ugly and unpopular, in contrast to his brother Karl, but quite intelligent and cunning. However, since his father loved only his brother and not him, he developed a lack of feeling, which made the \"sinful world\" intolerable for his passions. Consequently, he fixed himself to a rationalistic way of thinking. In the character of Franz, Schiller demonstrates what could happen if the moral way of thinking were replaced by pure rationalization. Franz strives for power in order to be able to implement his interests.\nAmalia von Edelreich, the count's niece, is Karl's love, and a faithful and reliable person (to learn more of their relationship see \"Hektorlied\" (de)). She spends most of the play avoiding the advances of the jealous Franz and hopes to be rejoined with her beloved Karl.\nSpiegelberg acts as an opponent of Karl Moor and is driven by crime. Additionally, he self-nominated himself to be captain in Karl's robber band, yet was passed up in favor of Karl. Spiegelberg tries to portray Karl negatively among the robbers in order to become the captain, but does not succeed.Other characters"

The older good brother Ernst Carl and the evil younger brother Hans Hermann Wilhelm. This was one of the greatest social and legal scandals in early eighteen century Franconia.\nMajor Wilhelm von Buttlar married Eva Eleonora von Lentersheim at Obersteinbach castle (Obersteinbach website refers to him as Franz). Her father Erhard von Lentersheim was an epileptic and alcoholic. He was put under a guardianship. As the son-in-law, Wilhelm exercised the right of disposing of his goods to himself. Additionally, to further benefit Wilhelm because Wilhelm's mother-in-law, Louisa von Lentersheim (n\u00e9e von Eyb), had property of her own, Wilhelm had her strangled on December 7, 1727, by a servant. While the trial lasted for years, it did not end in conviction. Schiller also went to school with Wilhelm Philipp Johann Ludwig von Bibra (Adelsdorf) (1765\u20131794) at the Carlsakademie. As a close relative of the murdered mother-in-law, Wilhelm von Bibra may have spurred Schiller's interest in the incident."

In contrast, Robert MacDonald's 1995 translation, written for a performance by the Citizen's Company at the Edinburgh Festival, includes some of Schiller's own revisions, modernizes the language trying to find equivalences to reach his British target audiences. While Lamport directs his translation toward an audience expecting classics as authentic as possible modelled on the original, McDonald opts for a performance translation cutting the text and interpreting many of the emotional moments that are left less clear in a more literal translation.\"Michael Billington wrote in 2005 that Robert MacDonald \"did more than anyone to rescue Schiller from British neglect.\""

It has seventeen scenes and no interval with the play lasting approximately two hours in performance.\nAlthough two of Ridley's previous plays The Fastest Clock in the Universe and Ghost from a Perfect Place each had two acts with a space for an interval, each act retained the same location with a very small time gap between each.\nCommenting on the structure of Leaves of Glass, Ridley has said the following:\n\n\"the initial draft perhaps was sort of more real-time, one location. [...]  I love doing that, I mean, I think that's what theatre does best and... It always amazes me that people are surprised that I should be drawn to that kind of form of telling a play because that's one of the things that theatre does so well, is real-time. Where else can you experience that? Certainly not in film now. But then what happened was that I really got into this idea of \u2014 which is what the play has ended up doing \u2014 of sort of like coming into scenes at very jagged angles. [In the play] you get kind of like layers of these scenes, like kind of little pieces of broken glass that come in. The scenes begin when they are already up and moving; the action is already happening and they don't kind of finish on a kind of particular comforting way; there is no kind of dying fall at the end. You're just in and out of these scenes almost like cinematic cuts. [...] And I quite liked that kind of oblique way of telling of what is, in a way, a very oblique story. I thought that was part of the theatrical experience for me of this kind of [...] circular descent that [the character of] Steve is on of memory and morality.\""

        "content": "Tancredi is a melodramma eroico (opera seria or heroic opera) in two acts by composer Gioachino Rossini and librettist Gaetano Rossi (who was also to write Semiramide ten years later), based on Voltaire's play Tancr\u00e8de (1760). The opera made its first appearance at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice on 6 February 1813, less than a month after the premiere of his previous opera Il signor Bruschino. The overture, borrowed from La pietra del paragone, is a popular example of Rossini's characteristic style and is regularly performed in concert and recorded.\nConsidered by Stendhal, Rossini's earliest biographer, to be \"high amongst the composer's masterworks\", and describing it as \"a genuine thunderbolt out of a clear, blue sky for the Italian lyric theatre,\" his librettist Gaetano Rossi notes that, with it, \"Rossini rose to glory\". Richard Osborne proclaims it to be \"his fully fledged opera seria and it established him, more or less instantly, as Italy's leading composer of contemporary opera.\"Although the original version had a happy ending (as required by the opera seria tradition), soon after the Venice premiere, Rossini\u2014who was more of a Neo-classicist than a Romantic, notes Servadio\u2014had the poet Luigi Lechi rework the libretto to emulate the original tragic ending by Voltaire. In this new ending, presented at the Teatro Comunale in Ferrara on 21 March 1813, Tancredi wins the battle but is mortally wounded, and only then does he learn that Amenaide never betrayed him. Argirio marries the lovers in time for Tancredi to die in his wife's arms.\nAs has been stated by Philip Gossett and Patricia Brauner, it was the rediscovery of the score of this ending in 1974 (although elsewhere Gossett provides evidence that it was 1976) that resulted in the version which is usually performed today."

        "content": "By the time he was twenty years old, Rossini's reputation had grown such that  he was regarded as \"'a maestro di cartello', a composer whose name alone guarantees a public\". Success with La pietra del paragone for Milan in September was great, but delays caused him to be late in Venice for his next commission at the Teatro San Mois\u00e8, L'occasione fa il ladro. Other comedies had preceded L'occasione, but its success ensured a fifth opera for that house. This was Il Signor Bruschino, which was presented on 27 January 1813 and which the composer wrote more-or-less parallel to preparing Tancredi, a commission for this opera having been accepted from Venice's most prestigious house, La Fenice, the previous autumn.\nOther treatments of the Tancredi story had been prepared, the most recent being that of Stefano Pavesi in 1812. However, many of Rossini's formal inventions, seen in his earlier one-act operas, are here incorporated with great effect and formalism. As Gossett notes: \"The opera established a new formal synthesis, new compositional models, with, through, and in spite of which Italian composers were to operate.\"The revised ending for Ferrara, March, 1813\nThis revised version of the opera, presented a month after its Venice premiere, incorporates Voltaire's original ending. The music for this ending was withdrawn, it disappeared, and was not discovered until 1976.\n\nAct 1: The duet L'aura che interno spiri / \"The air you breathe brings mortal danger\" from act 1 (the first encounter between the couple) was removed and replaced with Lasciami: non t'ascolto from act 2, something which Richard Osborne regards \"as introducing a not entirely plausible note of confrontation into the lovers' first encounter\".Act 2 finale: Having come to find Tancredi, the knights of Syracuse enter along with Argirio and Amenaide. Angrily, Tancredi orders Amenaide to go to Solamir's camp, upset that she has come to disturb him. He leaves to go into battle, and shortly Argirio returns to report that the Syracusans have been victorious but that Tancredi has been severely wounded.  He is carried in and learns from Argirio the truth about Amenaide just in time for Argirio to marry them. He then dies in her arms.According to Richard Osborne, the 1813 re-workings for Ferrara were not a success and \"Rossini withdrew the revision and, as was his habit, redistributed some of the music in later work\". In Divas and Scholars, musicologist Philip Gossett recounts how this ending was rediscovered: \n\nUntil the mid-1970s, no musical score was known to exist..[..]..The late Count Giacomo Lechi of Brecia ...[whose predecessor was the writer Luigi Lechi who had prepared the text for Ferrara]...was reviewing the family's papers in 1976, came across several musical manuscripts [one of which] bore the ..[..]..attestation [by Rossini]: \"I declare (and not without shame) that this is an autograph of mine from 1813!!\" (It was dated 22 November 1867).Following the discovery, the preparation of the critical edition for the Fondazione Rossini by Philip Gossett and others at the University of Chicago began in 1976.December 1813 revision for Milan\nIn addition to restoring the happy ending, by the end of 1813 and in time for the Milan premiere in December at the new Teatro R\u00e9, Rossini had also restored the cut second duet and had re-written and restored Argirio's cut aria. Other changes included Roggiero becoming a tenor with a new aria Torni d'amor la face, two different arias being composed for Argirio, and both duets for Tancredi and Amenaide being restored to their original locations.While Tancredi and Amenaide are happily reunited, he is given \"an entirely new rondo in lieu of the more elaborate gran scena of the original score after Tancredi learns from Argirio that her letter was written for him, and not for Solamir (rather than there being a denial from Solamir)."

        "content": "19th century\nTancredi premiered in February 1813 at La Fenice in Venice with Adelaide Malanotte in the title role. The first two performances suffered because of vocal problems from its two female principals, but its success was assured over six performances into the following month.\nIt was quickly re-mounted in a revised version in Ferrara in March of that year which reverted to Voltaire's tragic ending, but audiences disliked it and subsequent performances there reverted to the Venice ending, with a further revision appearing in Milan in December. Gossett established in 1971 that, later, Rossini also participated in other revisions for performances elsewhere in Italy, including those at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in 1814 and the Naples premiere given at the Teatro del Fondo in 1816 and again in 1818.However, Heather Hadlock notes that it was the Milanese version of December 1813 which became \"something like a definitive form, and in this form it took Italy by storm\".  Other Italian houses presented the Venice version, including the Teatro Apollo in Rome (1814), the Teatro Regio di Torino (1814 and 1829), La Fenice again (1815, 1823 and 1833), and the Teatro San Mois\u00e8 in Venice in March 1816 when, in another revision, it is the dying Solamir who professes Amenaide's innocence, and Tancredi returns home in triumph.\nPhilip Gossett's research in 1971 states that \"until about 1825 the musical text was rather fluid. The first Ricordi edition (1829), which differs significantly from the later ones, corresponds to the Milanese version\",  \nbut many other Italian cities saw the opera, including Florence (in 1814, 1816, and 1825), Padua (1814), Livorno (1815), Vicenza (1816), Macerata (1817), Camerino (1828), Viterbo (1828), Milan (1829), and Trieste (1830).\nOutside of Italy, it was given in Corf\u00f9 (1822), Lisbon (as Tacredo) (1826), and Geneva (1828). The opera was first performed in England at the King's Theatre in London on 4 May 1820 with Fanny Corri-Paltoni as Amenaide. Its French premiere was given by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Lyrique Italien at the Salle Louvois in Paris on 23 April 1822 with Giuditta Pasta in the title role. It was seen in Portugal for the first time at the Teatro Nacional de S\u00e3o Carlos on 18 September 1822 (as Tancredo) and was given its La Scala premiere on 8 November 1823 with Brigida Lorenzani as Tancredi.The United States premiere occurred on 31 December 1825 at the Park Theatre in New York City using the revised Ferrara version by Lechi. The Paris Op\u00e9ra mounted the work for the first time with Maria Malibran in the title role on 30 March 1829. After an 1833 revival at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna, Tancredi was not mounted again until almost 120 years later.\n20th century and beyond \nThe Maggio Musicale Fiorentino revived the work on 17 May 1952 with Giulietta Simionato in the title role, Teresa Stich-Randall as Amenaide, Francesco Albanese as Argirio, Mario Petri as Orbazzano, and Tullio Serafin conducting. The opera was given at the Collegiate Theatre as part of the Camden Festival in April 1971 by the Basilica Opera.With the discovery of the long-lost music for the March 1813 Ferrara revision and the resulting preparation and completion of the critical edition, the work was revived when mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who had expressed interest as early as 1972 in performing the Ferrara edition if it ever came to light took on the title role at the Houston Grand Opera on 13 October 1977. Horne, who quickly became strongly associated with that role, insisted on the tragic Ferrara ending, citing that it is more consistent with the overall tone of the opera and that she \"did not find the happy ending convincing\". Indeed, most of the recordings of this opera today use the Ferrara conclusion, while some include the Venice finale as an extra track.\nHorne's triumphant performances as Tancredi in Houston soon led to invitations from other opera houses to sing the role, and it is largely through her efforts that the opera enjoyed a surge of revivals during the latter half of the 20th century. She sang the part for performances at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma (1977), the San Francisco Opera (1979), the Aix-en-Provence Festival (1981), La Fenice (1981, 1983), and the Lyric Opera of Chicago (1989) among others.\nContralto Ewa Podle\u015b achieved recognition in the title role, performing it at the Vlaamse Opera (1991), La Scala (1993), the Berlin State Opera (1996), Polish National Opera at Warsaw (2000), the Canadian Opera Company (2005), the Caramoor International Music Festival (2006), the Teatro Real (2007), and Opera Boston (2009) among others. She also recorded the role in 1995. Bulgarian mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova has also been praised in the role, singing it at the Salzburg Festival (1992), with the Opera Orchestra of New York (1997), and on a 1996 recording with the Bavarian Radio Chorus and Munich Radio Orchestra.\nPier Luigi Pizzi staged a new production of Tancredi for the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro in 1982\nwhich originally utilised both the tragic and happy endings \u2013 the former being interpolated as a \"dream sequence\" for Amenaide. He also designed both costumes and scenery. The production was conducted by Gianluigi Gelmetti and featured Lucia Valentini Terrani in the title role, as well as Dalmacio Gonzales as Argirio, Katia Ricciarelli as Amenaide, Giancarlo Luccardi as Orbazzano and, as Isaura, Bernadette Manca di Nissa \u2013 who later went on to perform the title role for the 1992 live DVD recording. The production was also revived at Pesaro in 1991, 1999, and 2004.\nTancredi was staged at 2003 at Polish National Opera at Warsaw, in the performance directed by Tomasz Konina and conducted by Alberto Zedda, the title role was sung by Ewa Podle\u015b, with original tragic ending. The second production in Poland took place in Warsaw Chamber Opera in 2008.\nIn 2005 the production went to Rome and Florence (where it was filmed for DVD with Daniela Barcellona in the title role), and then it was presented by the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 2011, with Alberto Zedda conducting. Barcellona sang Tancredi again in a new staging of the opera at the Teatro Regio di Torino in November 2009 after reprising the part in February 2009 at the Teatro de la Maestranza. The Theater an der Wien mounted the work for the first time in October 2009 with Vivica Genaux in the title role and Ren\u00e9 Jacobs conducting.\nTancredi was presented in concert by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris in December 2009 with Nora Gubisch as Tancredi.  In addition, as part of its Rossini revivals series, it presented a fully staged production in May 2014 with Marie-Nicole Lemieux in the title role and Patrizia Ciofi as Amenaide.  The production used the \"unhappy\" Ferrara ending, but incorporated many of the changes and reversions found in the December 1813 version for Milan.In 2018 Teatro Nuovo presented alternating performances of the original Venetian score (including the portions that have been replaced in most modern productions) and a version they called Tancredi rifatto, incorporating every known substitute piece by Rossini (including the aria written to replace \"Di tanti palpiti\")."

With self-assurance and guts, he introduced changes now often taken for granted: the recitatives are short and linked to the context of the arias; there is a new and masterful balance between the dramatic, the lyrical, and the musical; and the chorus makes its first appearance in an opera seriaBut it is in the innovations which move away from accepted formulas and which are seen in the finale of the opera in its Ferrara edition that Philip Gossett finds the most striking in Tancredi: \"the 'Cavatina Finale' as Rossini called the concluding moments of the opera, depart so completely from typical finale designs of the period that we can easily comprehend their failure to gain popular approval. Gone are the coloratura flourishes; gone is a more elaborate orchestration; gone are requirements of phrase construction and cadential repetition; gone, in short, are the conventions that usually rule Italian opera.  Instead, the concluding moments of the opera mirror each word of the dying hero, supported essentially by strings alone.\"Additionally, we find in Gossett and Brauner an explanation of another aspect of Rossini's compositional style: in his vocal writing, although the opera continues to use \"closed numbers separated by secco recitatives, a flexibility of style makes possible extensive dramatic activity within numbers.\" They continue stating that it is in the duets that a sectional form is employed so that \"the opening section allows dramatic confrontation between the characters, who express their often differing emotions in parallel stanzas.\"  There follows a lyrical section \u2013 \"with further dramatic interaction\" \u2013 and then the cabaletta which allows for greater confrontation or accord, thus reflecting any changes in the dramatic configuration."

When the team from Sister Act got together with the team from Barnardos it was decided a Nun Run would be a great way to promote the new musical as well as raise money for a great cause.\nDespite it being a brand new charity run, almost 1000 people got dressed up as nuns to run the streets of London, and altogether they raised over \u00a330,000, and on the back of its success it was decided that this 4 mile run was to be an annual event.\nIn late 2009 it was announced that the 2010 run was again to take place in May, but this time taking a different route, passing some of London's greatest landmarks such as The Tower of London, Tate Modern, and St. Paul's Cathedral.\nTo link the run with Sister Act the Musical (other than the fact everyone is dressed as nuns), some of the cast as well as Barnardo's Children's Choir give performances at the start line. This not only helps to fuse the link between Barnardo's and the show, but makes it a fun event, as it is designed as a charity event rather than for competitive runners.\nThe 2010 run sets this as an annual event which the organizers hope will grow year after year.The 2011 run took place in September 2011 to coincide with the UK national tour."

The middle sister (Anna Madeley) is heavily pregnant and growing increasingly depressed about the uncertain future her child is being born into. The youngest sister is a rebellious teenager and frequent nuisance to her career-minded eldest sister. As the three women attempt, in their own different ways, to come to terms with the fact that their father's pessimistic forecasts may be right, Freya, the middle sister, contemplates suicide to avoid bringing her child into an apocalyptic future and an opportunity presents itself for reconciliation with their estranged misanthropic father."

Russell B Parker, a former vaudeville hoofer, is a man of big dreams but small ambitions. He hardly works at all in fact, often spending the time incessantly playing checkers with his friend, William Jenkins. Parker lives with Theopolis and Bobby, his two unemployed sons, and Adele, his hard-working daughter. The ghost of his dead wife, a woman who drove herself into an early grave working to support the family, nags at his conscience.\nAdele deeply resents that she is carrying the entire family financially. She announces that she's done supporting her father's failing shop and freeloading brothers. If they do not find paying jobs immediately, she'll shutter the barbershop and kick them out on the street. Theo proposes they go into business selling \"black lightning,\" his homemade corn whiskey, and convinces his father to meet Harlem crime boss Blue Haven. Blue gets them started and receives a cut of the profits in exchange for protection from police raids or rival criminals.\nWhen the operation proves successful, Theo becomes the household's new breadwinner, but the family becomes divided. Adele blinds herself to their criminal activities through a romantic distraction. Bobby conspicuously spends time away from the shop and is rumored to be involved in a rash of city burglaries. And Parker often steals money from the operation's till, so he may entertain a Young Girl that has become the object of his affection.\nWhile the family disintegrates and the retribution of Parker's choices threatens everything, he retreats into atmospheric tales of his life in vaudeville. In the final stages of the play, he even attempts to summon dance steps of his youth to little avail. Parker and his family's dreams of a better life cannot shake the spectre of a racist society, bringing their story to a tragic conclusion."

        "content": "The play concerns the ceremonies acted out by African American men. Parker is kept afloat by the fact that his daughter Adele works, which gives the family enough of an income to survive.  Jenkins, the other \"Dark Old Man\" of the title, finds a sanctuary in Parker's barbershop, where he trades insults with Parker and plays checkers. This part exemplifies the \"ceremonies\" of the title, the game. The barbershop provides a place where the two dark old men can be insulated from a society in which they have failed under the norms of the capitalist, racist society of the 1960s. According to the Oxford Companion to African American Literature:\n\nThe play is a dramatization of rituals\u2014of survival, of friendship, of deception and manipulation, of self-deception, of black male friendship, of shifting intrafamilial allegiances, and of black manhood. As Elder presents the ineffectual lives of a Harlem family entrapped by rituals of economic and spiritual dependence, he urges African Americans and African American communities to become aware of and to break free of \u201cceremonies\u201d that assuredly lead to personal loss and tragedy. Echoing Douglas Turner Ward's warning to black Americans whose \u201chappiness\u201d and survival are predicated upon white America's relationship to black America in Happy Ending (1966), Ceremonies challenges the myth that the social, political, and economic plight of black America rests in white people's hands. Through layers of ritual, Elder demonstrates the futility, corruption, and internal disruptions that result from efforts to undermine a capitalist system that seeks to determine and define African Americans\u2019 worth and selfhood."

        "content": "Il templario is an Italian-language opera by the German composer Otto Nicolai from a libretto written by Girolamo Maria Marini based on Walter Scott's 1819 novel Ivanhoe. \nIt has been noted that Nicolai's work for the opera stage, which followed the successful Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor (The Merry Wives of Windsor) (his only German opera), included three others, all of which were in Italian (two being Gildippe ed Odoardo and Il proscritto) and all \"are all firmly cast in the bel canto style, with gracefully flowing melodies in the manner of Bellini\". Marini was a part-time poet when not employed by the government tobacco monopoly, and is best remembered today for being called in to rewrite the third act of Donizetti's Adelia.Il templario received its premiere performances at the Teatro Regio, Turin in February 11, 1840, and continued on a successful run through Italy, rivaling Pacini's Saffo.  However, it disappeared for over 160 years until it was reconstructed in 2006 and performed in 2008.\nThe success of Nicolai's opera had an unintended contributing indirect effect on the failure of Verdi's early attempt at the opera buffa genre, Un giorno di regno, in 1840. The Teatro alla Scala impresario Merelli insisted on using the opera seria singers previously assembled for Nicolai's opera, which had toured in Milan, thus contributing to the disaster experienced by Verdi."

No fewer than seventeen productions were given in 1842, and the opera retained its popularity through the late 1860s, making it \u2013 alongside Mercadante's La vestale and Pacini's Saffo (both given in Naples, also in 1840) \u2013 one of the most lasting and well received Italian operas from this period.After its original highly successful run in Italy, Il templario was forgotten, as fashion moved on and Nicolai's early death reduced interest in his work outside Germany. His father sold his autographs to Bote & Bock, who then filed and forgot them until 1937 when Joseph Goebbels was seeking pure-German operas to replace the removal of works by composers such as Meyerbeer from the German stage. Goebels was attracted to the story of Ivanhoe but sought to have Nicolai's opera rewritten to remove the flattering elements around the Jewish heroine Rebecca. However, the Second World War intervened before such a version could be made.The rediscovered opera was again \"lost\" when the archives of both Bote & Bock in Berlin and Casa Ricordi in Milan were destroyed during World War II.\nRe-discovery and reconstruction\nHowever interest in Nicolai renewed in the 1990s and the music historian Michael Wittmann was finally able to reconstruct Il templario from various versions. These included a revision originally deposited with the local censor in Naples but found in the Conservatorio di Musica under the title Teodosia, a German language edition, and also a French piano-vocal score, which allowed for the complete reconstruction in 2006.Following Wittmann's reconstruction, Il templario was then performed at the Chemnitz Opera in March 2008 conducted by Frank Beermann, with the American tenor Stanley Jackson as Ivanhoe. A live recording of the 7 March performance was later issued."

Rebecca is in turn loved by Briano, the templar of the opera's title. \nAct I \nScene I. A Tournament Field at Ashby\nAn unknown knight-errant has won the tournament. He will not remove his visor and his shield declares his mission - to fight injustice and the oppressed. He indicates that Ravena, ward of Cedrico, may place the laurel crown on his helmet As for himself he reveals he has sworn an oath of anonymity; all he will say is that he is a Saxon. A tournament feast closes the event and Cedric invites the knight to his castle as all depart the field. Briano, who lost the contest against the unknown knight, enters. Feeling the sting of his first defeat, his thoughts turn to his beloved Rebecca and his retinue urge him to abduct her. \nScene 4.

Cedrico refuses, fighting breaks out and Vilfredo rushes in.

Briano enters and declares his love, saying he will renounce everything for her but she curtly rejects his offers, threatening to throw herself from the tower balcony if he dares to touch her. At that moment trumpets announcing the arrival of the Grand Preceptor, Luca di Beaumanoir; if Briano and Rebecca are caught together it will mean death for both of them. \nScene 3. The Armoury\nA procession in honor of The Grand Master of the Templars, Luca is taking place. Isacco disrupts the celebration to beg for the release of his daughter, accusing Briano of the abduction. Luca furiously demands an explanation but Briano when brought before him, stays silent. The other knights condemn Briano but Luca learns that Rebecca learned her healing arts from a woman condemned as a witch and, anxious to deflect shame from one of his Templars, Luca declares that Rebecca must die by cleansing fire unless Briano accepts the challenge \u2013 a divine duel to the death between Briano and a champion.

The opera tells the tale of Canio, actor and leader of a commedia dell'arte theatrical company, who murders his wife Nedda and her lover Silvio on stage during a performance. Pagliacci premiered at the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan on 21 May 1892, conducted by Arturo Toscanini, with Adelina Stehle as Nedda, Fiorello Giraud as Canio, Victor Maurel as Tonio, and Mario Ancona as Silvio. Soon after its Italian premiere, the opera played in London (with Nellie Melba as Nedda) and in New York (on 15 June 1893, with Agostino Montegriffo as Canio). Pagliacci is the best-known of Leoncavallo's ten operas and remains a staple of the repertoire.Pagliacci is often staged with Cavalleria rusticana by Pietro Mascagni, a double bill known colloquially as \"Cav/Pag\"."

        "content": "Leoncavallo was a little-known composer when Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana premiered around 1890. After seeing Mascagni's success, Leoncavallo decided to write an opera in response: one act composed in the verismo style.\nLeoncavallo based the story of Pagliacci on an incident from his childhood: the 1865 murder of a Leoncavallo family servant, Gaetano Scavello, killed by Gaetano D'Alessandro, with brother Luigi acting as accomplice. The incident stemmed from a series of perceived romantic entanglements involving Scavello, Luigi D'Alessandro, and a village girl with whom both men were infatuated. Leoncavallo's father, a judge, presided as magistrate over the criminal investigation.Leoncavallo originally titled his story Il pagliaccio (The Clown). The baritone Victor Maurel, who was cast as the first Tonio, requested that Leoncavallo change the title from the singular Il pagliaccio to the plural I Pagliacci, to broaden dramatic interest from Canio alone to include Tonio (his own role).The French author Catulle Mend\u00e8s sued Leoncavallo for plagiarism after learning of the plot of Leoncavallo's libretto from an 1894 French translation. Mend\u00e8s thought it resembled his 1887 play La Femme de Tabarin, which was structured as a play-within-the-play and featured a clown murdering his wife. Leoncavallo pleaded ignorance of Mend\u00e8s's play. Later, there were counter-accusations that Mend\u00e8s's play resembled Don Manuel Tamayo y Baus's Un Drama Nuevo (1867). Mend\u00e8s dropped his lawsuit. Scholar Matteo Sansone has suggested that Leoncavallo had ample opportunity to be exposed to new French art and musical works while living in Paris from 1882 to 1888, including potentially Mend\u00e8s's play, another version of La femme de Tabarin by Paul Ferrier, and Tabarin, an opera composed by \u00c9mile Pessard that was based on Ferrier's play."

It is not only, in our opinion, the most finished composition for which we are indebted to [Sullivan's] pen but an honour to English art.\"  Sullivan was \"uproariously cheered\" at the premiere.The first section begins with a reference to the hymn tune St. Anne, which is repeated in the final section, suggesting that divine intervention played a part in the recovery of the Prince.  Handel's influence is heard throughout the piece, including in the fugues, and Sullivan uses key selection to emphasize sacred and secular sections of the piece.  Soprano solo or choral sections alternate in a broad dynamic range to illustrate the text.  The piece, in keeping with the spirit of the occasion, is often upbeat, even exuberant in places.While Sullivan was writing the Festival Te Deum, his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, Thespis, was still being performed.  Sullivan was also busy composing The Light of the World (an oratorio for the Birmingham festival), and a cantata for the opening of a London exhibition.The BBC broadcast the piece in 1988 and later the recording was released on CD."

Author Nancy Reynolds commented that the ballet \"offers a chance  for virtuoso display and is at the same time 'dancey' and flowing\". She added that while the tempo of the score made the ballet seem \"impossibly difficult\", Balanchine strategically placed exits for the performers so most dancers find their roles easier.\nThe lead ballerina, according to Balanchine, \"follows the piano in the cadenza\", while her partner and the corps de ballet play the supporting role in conveying \"what I hope is the spirit of the work.\" Dancer Violette Verdy described the lead role,There's a lot of strong, broad dancing spaced in very little time. The gestures have to be big, ample, spacious, and they have to look free. Under all that freedom has to be control \u2013 the pirouettes, exactness, beats and turns, and, as always with him, the fast work. But if the ballerina is afraid that it will not produce enough of an effect by itself, if she feels she has to compensate by telling the audience that it is hard, a false drama is created. It should be left alone, and one should dance it with passion but with happiness. It's quintessentially Russian in its best possible meaning \u2013 a great, romantic, beautiful plastic piece."

Lavinia, Ezra's daughter, like her mother Christine, has just returned from a trip to New York. Seth, the gardener, takes Lavinia aside. He warns her against her would-be beau, Captain Brant. Before Seth can continue, Lavinia's friend Peter Niles and his sister, Hazel, arrive. If Peter is proposing marriage to Lavinia again, he must realize she cannot marry anyone because her father needs her. Seth asks Lavinia if she has noticed that Brant resembles members of the Mannon family. Seth believes Brant is the child of David Mannon (Ezra's uncle, who later hanged himself) and Marie Brant\u00f4me (a French Canadian nurse), a couple expelled from the house due to fear of scandal and public disgrace.\nSuddenly Brant himself enters from the drive. Calculatingly, Lavinia derides the memory of Brant's mother, who died of starvation as Ezra never replied to a message she sent for help. Brant explodes and reveals his heritage. He tells Lavinia that her own grandfather (Ezra's father) also craved his mother and thus cast David out of the family. Brant has sworn vengeance.\nAct II\nLavinia appears inside her father's study. Christine enters indignantly, wondering why Lavinia has summoned her. Lavinia reveals that she followed her to New York and saw her kissing Adam Brant. Christine defiantly tells Lavinia that she has long hated Ezra and that Lavinia was born of her disgust for him. She loves Lavinia's brother Orin because he always seemed to be hers alone, and never Ezra's. Lavinia says that she will keep her mother's adultery a secret for Ezra's sake but Christine must promise to never see Brant again. Christine accuses her daughter of wanting Brant for herself. Christine then appears to agree to Lavinia's terms but proposes to Brant that they poison Ezra and attribute his death to his heart trouble.\nAct III\nOne week later, Lavinia stands at the top of the front stairs with Christine waiting for Ezra. When he arrives, Lavinia rushes forward and embraces him. Once Ezra is alone with his wife, he impulsively kisses her hand. The war has made him realize that they must put aside their differences. Christine agrees. They kiss and, for the first time in many years, share a bed.\nAct IV\nToward daybreak in Ezra's bedroom, Christine slips out. Ezra, waking, bitterly rebukes her. He believes Christine awaits his death. Later, she deliberately taunts him that she is Brant's mistress. Ezra rises in fury, threatening to kill her but falls back, clutching his heart and begging for his medicine. Christine gives him poison instead. After taking it, Ezra realizes her treachery and calls out to Lavinia. Lavinia rushes into the room. With his dying breath, Ezra indicts his wife: \"She's guilty \u2014 not medicine!\", he gasps, and then dies. Christine collapses in a faint, and Lavinia falls to her knees in anguish.\n\nThe HuntedAct I\nPeter, Lavinia, and Orin arrive at the house. Orin complains of his mother's absence. He jealously asks Lavinia about Christine and Brant. Lavinia warns him against believing their mother to be innocent of an affair. Suddenly, Christine appears and  embraces her son jubilantly.\nAct II\nOrin asks his mother about Brant. Christine explains that Lavinia has gone mad. Orin sits at Christine's feet and recounts his wonderful dreams about the two of them in the South Sea Islands. The islands represent everything the war was not: peace, warmth, and security, or Christine herself. Lavinia reappears in the room and coldly calls Orin to view their father's body.\nAct III\nIn the study, Orin tells Lavinia that Christine has already warned him of her madness. Lavinia insists that Orin certainly cannot let their mother's lover escape. She proposes that they watch Christine until she goes to meet Brant as this should convince Orin of her treachery. Orin agrees.\nAct IV\nThe night after Ezra's funeral, Brant's clipper ship appears at a wharf in East Boston. Christine sneaks out to meet Brant on the deck, and they retire to the cabin. Lavinia and an enraged Orin (who followed their mother from the house) listen from the deck. Brant and Christine decide to flee east and seek out their Blessed Islands. they painfully bid each other farewell. When Brant returns, Orin shoots him and ransacks the room to make it seem that Brant has been robbed.\nAct V\nThe following night Christine paces the drive before the Mannon house. Orin and Lavinia appear, revealing that they killed Brant. Christine collapses. Orin kneels beside her promising he will make her happy, that they can leave Lavinia at home and go abroad together. Lavinia orders Orin into the house. He obeys. Lavinia tells her mother she can still live. Christine glares at her daughter then enters the house. Lavinia remains outside. A gunshot is heard from Ezra's study. Lavinia stammers: \"It is justice!\"\n\nThe HauntedAct I, scene 1\nA year later, Lavinia and Orin return from their trip abroad. Lavinia now resembles her mother, even wearing a green dress like the one her mother was wearing at the start of the play. Orin has grown dreadfully thin and bears the statue-like attitude of his father.\nAct I, scene 2\nIn the sitting room, Orin grimly remarks that Lavinia has stolen Christine's soul. Peter enters from the rear and gasps, thinking he has seen Christine's ghost. Lavinia approaches him eagerly. Orin jealously mocks his sister's warmth toward Peter, accusing her of becoming a true romantic during their time in the South Seas.\nAct II\nA month later, Orin is working intently at a manuscript in the Mannon study. Lavinia enters and asks what he is doing. Orin says they must atone for their mother's death. As the last male Mannon, he has written a history of the family crimes. He then observes that Lavinia only became pretty like their mother on the islands they visited. Orin angrily accuses her of sleeping with one of the men on that island and Lavinia assumes Christine's taunting voice. Reacting like Ezra, Orin grasps her throat, threatening to kill her. It becomes apparent that Orin has taken Ezra's place as Lavinia has taken Christine's.\nAct III\nA moment later, the scene switches to Hazel and Peter in the sitting room. Orin enters, insisting that he see Hazel alone. He gives her a sealed envelope, warning her to keep it away from Lavinia. She should only open it, (a) if something happens to him, or (b) if Lavinia tries to marry Peter. Lavinia enters from the hall. Hazel tries to keep Orin's envelope hidden behind her back, but Lavinia rushes to Orin, beseeching him to let her see it. After Lavinia says she loves him, and agrees to do whatever he wants, Orin gives her the envelope. Orin then tells Hazel to leave.\nOrin forbids Lavinia from ever seeing Peter again. He tells her he loves her. Lavinia stares at him in horror, saying, \"For God's sake\u2014! No! You're insane! You can't mean\u2014!\" Lavinia wishes his death. Startled, Orin realizes that his death would be another act of justice. He thinks Christine is speaking through Lavinia.\nPeter appears in the doorway in the midst of the argument. Orin remarks that he was about to go clean his pistol and exits. Lavinia throws herself into Peter's arms. A muffled shot is heard, as Orin commits suicide in the other room.\nAct IV\nThree days later, Lavinia appears dressed in deep mourning. A resolute Hazel arrives and insists that Lavinia not marry Peter. Hazel admits she has told Peter of Orin's envelope. Peter arrives, and he and Lavinia pledge their love anew. Surprised by the bitterness in his voice, Lavinia desperately flings herself into his arms crying, \"Take me, Adam!\" Then, horrified, she breaks off their engagement and sends Peter away. \nShe realizes she is forever bound to the Mannon dead. As there is no one left to punish her, she must punish herself. She decides to live alone in the old house with the ghosts of her ancestors. She orders Seth to board up the windows and throw out all the flowers \u2013 then she enters the dark house alone and shuts the door."

        "content": "There are literary readings that classify Mourning Becomes Electra in the naturalism movement. This is based on O'Neill's focus on violent emotional states of men to emphasize the subconscious and inner spiritual forces as well as man's inability to escape the cyclical pattern and outcomes of human action. Like the Oresteia, the play explored the theme of revenge, where the crime of the past determines the actions and the suffering of the protagonist in the present. For this theme, some observers note that O'Neill's approach is more similar to William Shakespeare's outlook in Hamlet than Aeschylus' in Oresteia.O'Neill also differed with Aeschylus on the theme of fate and the role of the gods in the lives of men. In Oresteia, as was the case in the classical Greek tragedies, the divine is part of the environmental forces that humans cannot control but determine their fate. In O'Neill's interpretation, these forces are eliminated in favor of Freudian and Jungian psychology."

While Maureen is out, the Folan home is visited by Ray Dooley, a young man, who invites both women to a farewell party for his visiting American uncle. When it seems Mag is incapable of remembering this message, Ray writes it down for Maureen. As soon as he leaves, Mag destroys the note in the furnace. Upon Maureen's return, she admonishes her mother for depending on her as if she were an invalid; despite her bad back and burnt hand, Maureen thinks Mag is capable of doing more for herself. Maureen has already learnt of the party from Ray, whom she passed on her way in, so she punishes Mag for her dishonesty by forcing her to drink lumpy Complan.\nMaureen, a virgin who has only ever kissed two men, buys a new dress and attends the party. She brings Ray's older brother, Pato, home with her. Pato is a construction worker who lives primarily in London, though he is unhappy both there and in Leenane. He reveals that, although he has barely spoken to Maureen in 20 years of acquaintance, he has secretly thought of her as \"the beauty queen of Leenane\" for a long time. She brings him to her bedroom.\nIn the morning, Mag empties her bedpan into the kitchen sink, a daily habit that disgusts Maureen. Pato emerges from the bedroom and prepares breakfast for a shocked Mag, revealing that Maureen insisted he not sneak out. Maureen then emerges, dressed only in her underwear, and flaunts her intimacy with Pato in front of Mag. Incensed, Mag accuses Maureen of having deliberately burnt her hand by pouring hot oil over it, and then reveals that it is actually she who is legally responsible for Maureen after having signed her out of an English \"loony bin.\" After Mag goes to find the papers that prove this, Maureen tells Pato that Mag burnt herself trying to cook unsupervised, but she admits that she truly did suffer a nervous breakdown while working as a cleaner in England, 15 years earlier, when she was unable to endure the teasing of her English coworkers. She claims Mag sometimes tries to tell lies about the past, thinking Maureen is unable to discern them from reality. Pato is sympathetic, telling her that his opinion of her is unchanged. However, when he urges her to dress herself for warmth, she becomes insecure about her appearance and throws a tantrum. Mag returns with the documents, but Pato ignores her, departing after telling an upset Maureen that he will write to her.\nSome time later, Pato writes from London, telling Maureen that he is going to work for his American uncle in Boston, and he wants Maureen to come with him as soon as she can. The letter also reveals that he was unable to perform sexually when they were together, but he tells her that it was only because he had drunk too much. He also tells her that there will be a going away party for him. He sends the letter to Ray, with explicit instructions to put it directly into Maureen's hands. However, when Ray comes to the house, Maureen is out and Mag persuades him to leave the letter with her, playing on his resentment of Maureen for failing to return his swingball that fell in the Folan yard when he was a child and for snubbing him recently in the street. After Ray leaves, Mag reads and burns the letter.\nOn the night of Pato's farewell party, Maureen is aware of Pato's plans but assumes he is uninterested in pursuing a relationship. However, she tells Mag that it was she who ended things with him. When she continues to talk about the sexual encounter, Mag teases her and accidentally lets slip that she is aware of Pato's impotence. Seizing on it, Maureen tortures Mag with hot oil until she confesses the letter's existence and contents. Leaving Mag writhing on the floor, Maureen quickly puts on her dress and rushes out to the party.\nShe returns home after midnight, telling an unmoving Mag that she caught Pato at the train station before he left, and they recommitted themselves to one another. At the end of the scene, Mag slumps to the floor, dead. Maureen has bashed her head in with the poker.\nA month later, Mag's funeral is held following an inquest that exonerated Maureen. Ray visits, bringing word from Pato. However, it soon becomes clear that Maureen imagined her reunion with Pato; he actually left by taxi without ever seeing Maureen, and is now engaged to a woman with whom he danced at the party. Maureen asks Ray to send Pato a message, \"The beauty queen of Leenane says 'Goodbye.'\" Ray leaves after discovering and seizing his lost swingball. Left alone in the house, Maureen puts on Mag's sweater, sits in her rocking chair, and adopts her mannerisms."

Ephraim is just returning from his work as a trolleybus conductor, and converses with Esther Adams, left home alone with her newborn brother. Esther, a very intelligent and studious girl, discusses how her family cannot afford for her to go to high school. Ephraim, secretly envious of her youth and opportunity to make a better life for herself than he has, encourages her. Esther's mother, Sophia comes home. Later, while Ephraim is sleeping, Rosa, Ephraim's lover, returns to the yard with their landowner and her employer, Old Mack. She is wearing solid gold earrings and other things that Old Mack has given her. Old Mack forces himself on Rosa despite her protests and struggles. Sophia, overhearing all this, interrupts him, and he leaves. Sophia tells Rosa that because she is proudly wearing his gifts \"he is right to seek his rights\". She then asks Rosa if she has \"told\" Ephraim yet, to which she responds that she has not. Rosa goes and wakes Ephraim. After kissing and her asking him if he would like to sleep with her, Ephraim rolls over and tells her to leave.\nThe next morning, policemen are investigating the caf\u00e9 at which Rosa works. While Ephraim secretly listens, Rosa tells Sophia that it was robbed and that she also intends to \"tell\" Ephraim later that night. Rosa leaves with a policeman who makes her return to the caf\u00e9. Ephraim goes into the yard, and Sophia suspects that Ephraim is \"up to something\". Charlie, Sophia's husband, comes home drunk. When Rosa returns and sees Charlie, she immediately goes to her room.\nThat evening, Rosa tries to seduce Ephraim, but he will not sleep with her. Rosa discloses that she found Charlie's hat at the caf\u00e9, so she knows that he robbed the caf\u00e9. Due to this and the police's questioning, she fears that they will arrest Charlie. Ephraim yells at her endangering the Adams family when the wealthy, stingy Old Mack \"could well afford to lose\" the money stolen, and for accepting and wearing his expensive gifts. Ephraim tells her he is leaving for Liverpool the following day. Rosa reveals that she is pregnant with his child, which does not sway his decision to leave. Rosa, furious, leaves.\nThe next day, Charlie, fearful that Old Mack's employee, Stephen, is going to be arrested for his crime, confides to Sophia that he robbed the caf\u00e9, and then went drinking. As Sophia suggests that they have Rosa speak to Old Mack and return the remaining money, Ephraim, overhearing the conversation, and demands that Sophia give him the money so he return it without Charlie being implicated. At this moment, the police show up, and, seeing this exchange, arrest Charlie.\nLater that afternoon, Esther returns to an empty home. Sophia, unable to pay bail, comes home and tells Esther what has occurred. Distraught, Esther blames her mother and runs off. Rosa informs Sophia that Old Mack said \"the matter was out of his hands\", and that she has given up on Ephraim\u2014despite knowing that he is the father because she has slept with no one else.\nIn the evening, Ephraim is packing, and Sophia returns home after futilely searching for Esther. In spite of Sophia confronting him about abandoning a pregnant Rosa, Ephraim leaves the yard in a taxi. Sophia tries to comfort Rosa that she will be supported, but her words are interrupted by the sound of Old Mack calling from Rosa's room. The play ends with Esther's return, warmly calling for her mother."

Robert le diable is regarded as one of the first grand operas at the Paris Op\u00e9ra.  It has only a superficial connection to the medieval legend of Robert the Devil.\nThe opera was immediately successful from its first night on 21 November 1831 at the Op\u00e9ra; the dramatic music, harmony and orchestration, its melodramatic plot, its star singers and its sensational stage effects compelled Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, who was in the audience, to say, \"If ever magnificence was seen in the theatre, I doubt that it reached the level of splendour shown in Robert...It is a masterpiece...Meyerbeer has made himself immortal\". Robert initiated the European fame of its composer, consolidated the fame of its librettist, Scribe, and launched the reputation of the new director of the Op\u00e9ra, Louis-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 V\u00e9ron, as a purveyor of a new genre of opera. It also had influence on development of the ballet, and was frequently mentioned and discussed in contemporary French literature.\nRobert continued as a favourite in opera houses all over the world throughout the nineteenth century.

        "content": "Giacomo Meyerbeer's early studies had been in Germany, but from 1816 to 1825 he worked in Italy. There he studied opera, then dominated by Gioachino Rossini, and wrote his own Italian operas, which were moderately successful and also had some performances in other European countries. The success of Il crociato in Egitto (1824) throughout Europe, including at Paris in 1825, persuaded Meyerbeer, who was already thirty-three years old, to fulfil at last his ambition to base himself in Paris and to seek a suitable libretto for an opera to be launched there.Meyerbeer first mentions Robert le diable in his diaries in February 1827. The Journal de Paris announced on 19 April 1827 that the libretto of Scribe and Delavigne had been passed by the censor and that 'the music is to be entrusted to a composer, M. Meyer-Beer, who, having acquired a brilliant reputation in Germany and Italy, is extending it to our country, where several of his works have been already successfully represented.'The libretto was fabricated on the basis of old legends about Duke Robert the Magnificent of Normandy, the father of William the Conqueror, alleged in some versions to have been the son of the Devil. The librettists padded out this outline with a variety of melodramatic incidents. The plot reflected 'the fantastic legendary elements which fascinated the opera public of 1830', a taste which had evolved from the 1824 Paris production of Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freisch\u00fctz (in its French version Robin des bois), which also features a doubtful hero befriended by a demon promising him success.The libretto was originally planned as a three-act op\u00e9ra comique for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique theatre. Meyerbeer stopped work on the opera in 1827 when the theatre underwent financial difficulties. In August 1829, the composer and librettists agreed to refashion the work in a five-act form to meet the requirements of the Paris Op\u00e9ra. This entailed some significant rewriting of the storyline, reducing the essentially comic role of Raimbaut (who vanishes after Act 3 in the final version, but whose antics \u2013 including the spending of Bertram's money \u2013 continued throughout in the earlier libretto). It also meant that the traditional 'pairing' of lovers in op\u00e9ra comique (Robert/Isabelle paralleled throughout by the 'lower-class' Raimbaut/Alice) was swept aside in favour of concentration on the more sensational story-line of Robert's diabolic ancestry.The contract for the opera, specifying it as a \"grand opera in five acts and seven scenes\", was signed by the then director of the Op\u00e9ra, \u00c9mile Lubbert, on 29 December 1829. Meyerbeer completed the composition of the work in Spa, Belgium in June and July 1830. Its characterisation as a \"French grand opera\" placed it in succession to Auber's La muette de Portici (1828) and Rossini's William Tell (1829) in this new genre. The composer undertook further work on the opera in early 1831, converting spoken passages to recitatives and adding ballet episodes, including, in Act 3, the \"Ballet of the Nuns\", which was to prove one of the opera's great sensations, and which Henri Duponchel had suggested to replace the original humdrum scenario set in Olympus. He also rewrote the two major male roles of Bertrand and Robert to suit the talents of Nicolas Levasseur and Adolphe Nourrit, respectively."

        "content": "A number of factors influenced the opera's very favourable reception. The initial cast contained leading singers of the period and, as it changed, equally brilliant stars (e.g. Falcon) were introduced as replacements. The sensational plot and the notoriety of the Nuns' ballet ensured that the opera was a hot topic in journals and reviews. This was assisted by the marketing skills of the director V\u00e9ron and the publisher Schlesinger. The scenery was of exceptional quality: \"This was as much an opera to see as to hear, and it has been argued that the real hero behind Robert le diable was Cic\u00e9ri, the designer.\" Meyerbeer was keen to keep influential persons on his side. For example, he sent free tickets for 'a good box' to Heinrich Heine. And of course the businessman V\u00e9ron knew how to use (and pay) the claque and its leader Augustin Levasseur.But undoubtedly the novelty and colour of the music of Meyerbeer deserves major credit. The alliance of his German musical training, along with his study of opera for many years in Italy, was highly attractive to a Parisian audience which 'asked only to be astonished and surprised.' The critic Ortigue wrote that Meyerbeer 'straight away [took] his position at the crossroads where Italian song and German orchestration have to meet.' Meyerbeer paid close attention to unusual combinations and textures and original orchestration, examples being the use of low brass and woodwind playing chromatic passages associated with Bertram; the use of a brass band and male choir to characterise the demons in Act 3; and so on. Hector Berlioz was particularly impressed; he wrote an entire article in the Revue et gazette musicale, entitled 'On the Orchestration of Robert le diable ', which concluded:\n\nRobert le Diable provides the most astonishing example of the power of instrumentation when applied to dramatic music; ... a power of recent introduction which has achieved its fullest development in the hands of M. Meyerbeer; a conquest of modern art which even the Italians will have to acknowledge in order to prop up as best they can their miserable system which is collapsing in ruins.The opera was perceived to have weaknesses of characterization. For example, Robert's dithering behaviour led to one comment that \"what is least diabolical in Robert le diable is Robert himself.\" But the critic F\u00e9tis gave the consensus opinion: \"Robert le diable is not only a masterpiece; it is also a remarkable work within the history of music ...[it] seems to me to unite all the qualities needed to establish a composer's reputation unshakeably.\"The success of the opera led to Meyerbeer himself becoming a celebrity. King Frederick William III of Prussia, who attended the second performance of Robert, swiftly invited him to compose a German opera, and Meyerbeer was invited to stage Robert in Berlin. In January 1832 he was awarded membership of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. This success \u2013 coupled with Meyerbeer's known family wealth \u2013 inevitably also precipitated envy amongst his peers. Berlioz wrote \"I can't forget that Meyerbeer was only able to persuade [the Op\u00e9ra] to put on Robert le diable ... by paying the administration sixty thousand francs of his own money\"; and Chopin lamented \"Meyerbeer had to work for three years and pay his own expenses for his stay in Paris before Robert le diable could be staged ... Three years, that's a lot \u2013 it's too much.\""

        "content": "The success of Robert had profound consequences, for the institution of the Paris Op\u00e9ra itself, for the music, staging and popularity of nineteenth century opera as a whole, and for ballet.\n\nThe fortuitous timing of the opera's premiere, not long after the July Revolution, and its sensational and novel effects, meant that it was widely identified with the new, liberal, ideas of the July Monarchy. As Berlioz commented, Meyerbeer had \"not only the luck to be talented, but the talent to be lucky.\" Honor\u00e9 de Balzac (in his novella Gambara) and Heinrich Heine (in his poem Ang\u00e9lique) are just two of the contemporary writers to express their fascination with the opera. Alexandre Dumas set a chapter of The Count of Monte Cristo between two acts of Robert; and George Sand wrote about it at length in her Lettres d'un voyageur. It is the only nineteenth-century opera to have a rose named after it.Also, the absence of starchy historical content in Robert doubtless played a part in attracting the bourgeoisie to the opera, until then regarded as primarily an aristocratic entertainment. The success of the opera also justified the government's policy of 'privatization' in selling the management to V\u00e9ron, and this was a landmark in the dilution of state control and patronage in the fine arts. Although V\u00e9ron had not commissioned it (having taken control only after the Revolution), Robert was his first new production as manager of the Op\u00e9ra, and its success underwrote his policy of commissioning similar works. These were to include Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, Fromental Hal\u00e9vy's La Juive, and Daniel Auber's Gustave III. However, while they used 'the same dazzling theatrical rhetoric' as Robert, they led to 'uniformly horrific d\u00e9nouements' with 'gripping moral urgency', their more sophisticated plot-lines reflecting the changes in taste of the new opera clientele. They established Paris as Europe's opera capital, with the Op\u00e9ra itself as its centre, in the period 1830 until 1850.\nThe Act 3 ballet is regarded by some as the first of the ballets blancs (whereby the principal ballerina and the corps de ballet are all clothed in white) which became a favourite of the nineteenth-century repertoire. Later examples include La Sylphide (1832) (also choreographed by Filippo Taglioni and danced by his daughter), Giselle (1841), Pas de Quatre (1845) and Les Sylphides (1909).Music from the opera became the subject of numerous virtuoso works of the time. The brilliant transcription of its themes (Reminiscences de Robert le diable) made by the composer and virtuoso Franz Liszt was so popular that it became his calling card: on more than one occasion he was forced to interrupt his programmed concerts to play it because of the demands of the audience. On the day of its publication by Maurice Schlesinger, the edition of 500 was completely sold out and it had to be immediately reprinted. Indeed, the success of Robert, whose score was also published by Schlesinger, was said to have saved him from bankruptcy. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and Auguste Franchomme jointly composed a Grand duo concertant on themes from the opera, for cello and piano, in 1832, and the Italian pianist and composer Adolfo Fumagalli composed an elaborate fantasy on the opera for left hand alone as his Op. 106.Other pieces based on the opera included works by Adolf von Henselt and Jean-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e M\u00e9reaux.\nEdgar Degas painted the scene of the Nuns' ballet twice. The earlier version (1871) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In 1876 Degas painted a larger version for the singer Jean-Baptiste Faure (who had sung the part of Bertram); this version is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.The work's popularity spawned many parodies and pastiches including one by W. S. Gilbert, Robert the Devil, which opened at the Gaiety Theatre, London in 1868.  It is referenced in the opening scene of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, where one of the items being auctioned off is described as \"Lot 664: a wooden pistol and three human skulls from the 1831 production of Robert le diable by Meyerbeer.\""

The story is based on a play by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe, La Xacarilla (1839). The opera is a result of a new attempt to create a full-composed national opera in Spain, to end the prevalence of zarzuela present at that moment. It is composed in a Rossinian style, reminding also of works by Paisiello and Cimarosa.The genre of the composition presented a difficulty. Chap\u00ed himself acknowledged its modest character. He explained the problem thus. La serenata doesn't contain mighty passions, as was usual for a serious opera. It also couldn't be called a comic opera, because an op\u00e9ra comique is the French analogue of Spanish zarzuela. Estremera's subtitle was operetta (as printed in the libretto), an inappropriate label, because an operetta has to contain spoken parts, which are not present here. It could be named a lyric comedy (comedia l\u00edrica), but this title was used by Verdi for his grandiose Falstaff.La serenata was performed on 5 November at the season opening of the Teatro Apolo. It formed the second part of that night, while the first one consisted of the overture to Chap\u00ed's Roger de Flor (1878) and an opera \u00a1Tierra! by Antonio Llanos (1873). The orchestra was conducted by Chap\u00ed. It was praised by the press, but didn't gain much success. After its failure Chap\u00ed rejected his attempts in the opera genre dedicating himself to zarzuelas foe many years.La serenata was performed at the Teatro de Zarzuela together with the 2-act Marina. After Chap\u00ed was engaged by the Teatro Eslava, he arranged the score for smaller orchestral forces."

The opening chorus of passengers thanks the corregidor for ending their quarantine: now they can proceed to the town. A young man Ventura is also on this ship, and is given a pass. The crowd disperses, leaving him alone to tell his story: he went to the sea to find glory and riches, but met only storms and pirates. Now he comes back, without a penny, and looks forward to seeing his beloved one. The night approaches. Some muffled persons appear and sing a mysterious serenade about a hunter trying in vain to catch an eagl. The door of the neighbour house opens, and they go in. Ventura tries to fall asleep on a stone bench, but another company steps in and the situation repeats. Tortured by hunger, he decides to sing this song too. The host of the house, Camacho, appears and leads him inwards.\n\nIn the second tableau the action takes place in a room inside of Camacho's house. The host tells his daughter Rita that tomorrow she will marry the corregidor, who adores her. She refuses this, as she promised to wait her beloved sailor. Camacho has much to do and does not continue the conversation. When he leaves, Rita sings of her sufferings and wishes the lover were here. Straight after this enters Ventura, who is actually the one she loves. They are full of joy to see each other. Suddenly Camacho comes in. He is about to beat Ventura, but the young man takes a guitar and sings the serenade. Camacho apologizes and gives him a burse of money. Ventura is astonished with such a change of his fortune and suggests to count the money. Instead, Camacho gives him another burse, apparently because he had cheated with the distribution of it. Before he sends Rita away, she appoints Ventura a date at ten sharp.\nThe room gets filled by the chorus of contrabandists praising the night and valour. During the farewell dinner Camacho recommends Ventura to his friends as a captain of a ship that will take them away from C\u00e1diz and the corregidor, this night at ten sharp. Somebody asks Ventura to make a toast, and he sings two couplets about enjoying the delights of life. The chorus catches up his words. After this, the serenade is heard from the outside. Everybody rises intending to go to the boat, and Ventura manages to hide in an adjoint room. A man knocks at the door. It is corregidor: Camacho invited him to give information about the contrabandists. The chorus leaves through a secret door, and the host presents the corregidor with a document. The magistrate triumphs believing he will catch the contradandists now. Camacho's plan worked out well: while his friends are already safe in the sea, he is clear of any suspicion.\nThe clock strikes ten, and Ventura comes out of another room. The corregidor asks who is it, Camacho answers he had never seen him before. Ventura hopes to relief himself from this situation with the serenade, that used to help him already twice. But this time it turns a disaster: the corregidor recognizes the contrabandists' signal and orders two alguaciles to bring some soldiers to take Ventura to the prison. The latter understands nothing, but after the corregidor tells him about the contradandists, he shows the pass given to him by the same magistrate some hours before. The soldiers come with a crowd of people. Ventura forces Camacho to tell everyone he is Rita's fianc\u00e9, threatening him with the story of this night he is able to tell the corregidor. The magistrate resigns himself from the girl and puts the hands of the young together."

        "content": "The Bartered Bride (Czech: Prodan\u00e1 nev\u011bsta, The Sold Bride) is a comic opera in three acts by the Czech composer Bed\u0159ich Smetana, to a libretto by Karel Sabina. The work is generally regarded as a major contribution towards the development of Czech music. It was composed during the period 1863 to 1866, and first performed at the Provisional Theatre, Prague, on 30 May 1866 in a two-act format with spoken dialogue. Set in a country village and with realistic characters, it tells the story of how, after a late surprise revelation, true love prevails over the combined efforts of ambitious parents and a scheming marriage broker.\nThe opera was not immediately successful, and was revised and extended in the following four years. In its final version, premiered in 1870, it rapidly gained popularity and eventually became a worldwide success. Until this time, the Czech national opera had only been represented by minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana's second, was part of his quest to create a truly Czech operatic genre. Smetana's musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms, such as the polka and furiant, and, although he largely avoided the direct quotation of folksong, he nevertheless created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech in spirit. The overture, often played as a concert piece independently from the opera, was, unusually, composed before almost any of the other music had been written. \nAfter a performance at the Vienna Music and Theatre Exhibition of 1892, the opera achieved international recognition. It was performed in Chicago in 1893, London in 1895 and reached New York in 1909, subsequently becoming the first, and for many years the only, Czech opera in the general repertory. Many of these early international performances were in German, under the title Die verkaufte Braut, and the German-language version continues to be played and recorded. A German film of the opera was made in 1932 by Max Oph\u00fcls."

        "content": "Until the middle 1850s Bed\u0159ich Smetana was known in Prague principally as a teacher, pianist and composer of salon pieces. His failure to achieve wider recognition in the Bohemian capital led him to depart in 1856 for Sweden, where he spent the next five years. During this period he extended his compositional range to large-scale orchestral works in the descriptive style championed by Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. Liszt was Smetana's long-time mentor; he had accepted a dedication of the latter's Opus 1: Six Characteristic Pieces for Piano in 1848, and had encouraged the younger composer's career since then. In September 1857 Smetana visited Liszt in Weimar, where he met Peter Cornelius, a follower of Liszt's who was working on a comic opera, Der Barbier von Bagdad. Their discussions centred on the need to create a modern style of comic opera, as a counterbalance to Wagner's new form of music drama. A comment was made by the Viennese conductor Johann von Herbeck to the effect that Czechs were incapable of making music of their own, a remark which Smetana took to heart: \"I swore there and then that no other than I should beget a native Czech music.\"Smetana did not act immediately on this aspiration. The announcement that a Provisional Theatre was to be opened in Prague, as a home for Czech opera and drama pending the building of a permanent National Theatre, influenced his decision to return permanently to his homeland in 1861. He was then spurred to creative action by the announcement of a prize competition, sponsored by the Czech patriot Jan von Harrach, to provide suitable operas for the Provisional Theatre. By 1863 he had written The Brandenburgers in Bohemia to a libretto by the Czech nationalist poet Karel Sabina, whom Smetana had met briefly in 1848. The Brandenburgers, which was awarded the opera prize, was a serious historical drama, but even before its completion Smetana was noting down themes for use in a future comic opera. By this time he had heard the music of Cornelius's Der Barbier, and was ready to try his own hand at the comic genre."

        "content": "Although much of the music of The Bartered Bride is folk-like, the only significant use of authentic folk material is in the act 2 furiant, with a few other occasional glimpses of basic Czech folk melodies. The \"Czechness\" of the music is further illustrated by the closeness to Czech dance rhythms of many individual numbers. Smetana's diary indicates that he was trying to give the music \"a popular character, because the plot [...] is taken from village life and demands a national treatment.\" According to his biographer John Clapham, Smetana \"certainly felt the pulse of the peasantry and knew how to express this in music, yet inevitably he added something of himself.\" Historian Harold Schonberg argues that \"the exoticisms of the Bohemian musical language were not in the Western musical consciousness until Smetana appeared.\" Smetana's musical language is, on the whole, one of happiness, expressing joy, dancing and festivals.\n\nThe mood of the entire opera is set by the overture, a concert piece in its own right, which Tyrrell describes as \"a tour de force of the genre, wonderfully spirited & wonderfully crafted.\" Tyrrell draws attention to several of its striking features \u2013 its extended string fugato, climactic tutti and prominent syncopations. The overture does not contain many of the opera's later themes: biographer Brian Large compares it to Mozart's overtures to The Marriage of Figaro and The Magic Flute, in establishing a general mood. It is followed immediately by an extended orchestral prelude, for which Smetana adapted part of his 1849 piano work Wedding Scenes, adding special effects such as bagpipe imitations.Schonberg has suggested that Bohemian composers express melancholy in a delicate, elegiac manner \"without the crushing world-weariness and pessimism of the Russians.\" Thus, Ma\u0159enka's unhappiness is illustrated in the opening chorus by a brief switch to the minor key; likewise, the inherent pathos of Va\u0161ek's character is demonstrated by the dark minor key music of his act 3 solo. Smetana also uses the technique of musical reminiscence, where particular themes are used as reminders of other parts of the action; the lilting clarinet theme of \"faithful love\" is an example, though it and other instances fall short of being full-blown Wagnerian leading themes or Leitmotifs.Large has commented that despite the colour and vigour of the music, there is little by way of characterisation, except in the cases of Kecal and, to a lesser extent, the loving pair and the unfortunate Va\u0161ek. The two sets of parents and the various circus folk are all conventional and \"penny-plain\" figures. In contrast, Kecal's character \u2013 that of a self-important, pig-headed, loquacious bungler \u2013 is instantly established by his rapid-patter music. Large suggests that the character may have been modelled on that of the boastful Baron in Cimarosa's opera Il matrimonio segreto. Ma\u0159enka's temperament is shown in vocal flourishes which include coloratura passages and sustained high notes, while Jen\u00edk's good nature is reflected in the warmth of his music, generally in the G minor key. For Va\u0161ek's dual image, comic and pathetic, Smetana uses the major key to depict comedy, the minor for sorrow. Large suggests that Va\u0161ek's musical stammer, portrayed especially in his opening act 2 song, was taken from Mozart's character Don Curzio in The Marriage of Figaro."

A German-language version of the opera, Die verkaufte Braut, was filmed in 1932 by Max Oph\u00fcls, the celebrated German director then at the beginning of his film-making career. The screenplay was drawn from Sabina's libretto by Curt Alexander, and Smetana's music was adapted by the German composer of film music, Theo Mackeben. The film starred the leading Czech opera singer Jarmila Novotn\u00e1 in the role of Ma\u0159enka (\"Marie\" in the film), and the German baritone Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender as Jen\u00edk (\"Hans\").Ophuls constructed an entire Czech village in the studio to provide an authentic background.

Opera-lovers, the review suggested, should not expect too much, but the work nevertheless gave an attractive portrait of Bohemian village life in the mid-19th century. The reviewer found most of the acting first-rate, but commented that \"the photography and sound reproduction are none too clear at times.\" Other film adaptations of the opera were made in 1922 directed by Oldrich Kminek (Atropos), in 1933, directed by Jaroslav Kvapil, Svatopluk Innemann and Emil Pollert (Espofilm), and in 1976, directed by V\u00e1clav Ka\u0161l\u00edk (Barrandov).

In the original tale, however, the protagonist sorceress is called \"Melior\"; Esclarmonde's name was borrowed from another chanson de geste of the 13th century: Huon de Bordeaux. Although the Esclarmonde who appears in Huon is completely different from her operatic counterpart, Huon clearly served as the basis of at least part of the opera's libretto. Alfred Blau discovered Parth\u00e9nop\u00e9us in 1871 in the library of Blois, where he took refuge during the time of the Paris Commune. The libretto was originally called Pertinax; it was first drafted in prose and later versified by Blau's collaborator, Louis de Gramont. In that form \u2013 a romantic melodrama in five acts \u2013 it was offered in 1882 to the Belgian composer Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Gevaert, who, however, declined to set it. Soon the libretto found its way into Massenet's hands, though the precise circumstances in which this occurred remain a mystery.\nOn 1 August 1886, Massenet and his publisher Georges Hartmann attended a performance of Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival, an event which deeply impressed the composer and had a significant influence on his music. He had already seen the entire Ring cycle when it was produced in Brussels in 1883.\nIn his Memoirs, which were compiled in 1911 near the end of his life, Massenet ascribes the creation of the role of Esclarmonde to a chance meeting with Sibyl Sanderson sometime in the spring of 1887. He recounts how he was astonished by the range and capacity of her voice, realizing at once that she was the perfect choice for the heroine of his new opera, which he had begun to compose at the end of 1886. It is almost certain, however, that he had received the libretto to Esclarmonde much earlier than that, and the meeting with Sybil Sanderson served rather as an additional catalyst \u2013 a stimulus to complete the opera. The work was commissioned as a spectacular event to open the Paris Exposition of 1889. During the most intensive period of creation in the summer of 1887, Massenet moved into the Grand Hotel in Vevey, where Miss Sanderson was also staying; there he rehearsed with her each evening the various sections of his new opera as he composed them. The opera was completed by the end of 1888, and stage rehearsals started at Op\u00e9ra-Comique. Massenet dedicated the work to Sybil Sanderson in gratitude, allowing her signature to stand alongside his own in the manuscript of the score. Rodney Milnes suggests that Massenet's \"passion for his leading lady resulted in some of his most chromatically tortuous erotic writing\" while observing that the operatic events are \"dispatched in just over two hours of music\". Crichton notes also the skill of Massenet in writing for male voices - both the tenors Roland and \u00c9n\u00e9as, but also for the Bishop, the Emperor Phorcas and the King. He also points to the scoring of low instruments, where the bass clarinet and tuba show \"an individual application of lessons well learned from the later parts of The Ring, used with a discretion unlikely to upset the general public of the day\".Seven black and white projections for the scenes of sorcery, using the magic lantern technology, were created by Eug\u00e8ne Grasset, who also illustrated the original vocal score.After a very successful initial run, however, the opera disappeared from the repertoire and fell into almost complete oblivion. Soon afterwards Sybil Sanderson fell ill. When she died around the start of the 20th century, it seems that Massenet himself lost interest in the opera he had written for her and he discouraged any further productions. The work was not revived until 1923, well after the composer's death. Some short-lived revivals then followed, either staged or in concert performance. It was only in the 1970s that the efforts of Richard Bonynge and Joan Sutherland brought Esclarmonde back to life. Since then the work has been performed more frequently."

        "content": "The story is based on a medieval legend and revolves around Esclarmonde, an empress and sorceress of Byzantium.  Sequestered by her emperor father, Phorcas, who has recently abdicated the throne to her, she bemoans her love for Roland, a knight and Count of Blois, believing she will never be allowed to be with him.  Following a suggestion from her sister, Pars\u00e9\u00efs, Esclarmonde uses her magic powers to transfer Roland to the magic island where she joins him and continues to do so on a nightly basis and, hiding behind a veil, never reveals her identity. She reveals to him also that his country is in danger, attacked and besieged by the Saracens, and grants him a magic sword with which he will be capable of defeating the enemy. It will serve him well as long as he remains faithful to her.\nRoland then goes to help the besieged Blois and wins the battle with the leader of the Saracens. In reward, he is granted by the king of France the hand of his royal daughter. But Roland refuses to accept that offer, not disclosing the reason.  When he finally confesses his nightly tryst to the Bishop of Blois, the bishop and a group of monks intervene on Esclarmonde's arrival, performing an exorcism and in a crucial moment manage to tear off her veil and thus reveal her identity. Feeling betrayed, Esclarmonde, in her bravura aria O Roland, tu m'as trahie, et me voil\u00e0... Regarde-les ces yeux, rebukes Roland for his faithlessness. The confrontation scene proceeds with Roland trying at the last moment to use his sword to defend her from the monks. Suddenly, the magic sword shatters to pieces, and Esclarmonde, surrounding herself with a ring of fire and demons, curses Roland and disappears.\nThe ex-emperor, Phorcas, upon hearing of Esclarmonde's disobedience, summons her to him and insists she renounce Roland. He threatens to remove her magic powers and to execute Roland.  Reluctantly, she submits and when Roland is brought before her she implores him to forget her.  A tournament takes place to award the victor with Esclarmonde's hand in marriage.  When the winner, clad all in black, is asked his name, he replies \"despair\", and refuses the hand of Esclarmonde.  Esclarmonde recognizes the voice immediately, however, as that of Roland, and when her veil is lifted he recognizes her as well and all hail the new empress and her valiant consort."

        "content": "Il giuramento (The Oath) is an opera in three acts by Italian composer Saverio Mercadante. The libretto, by Gaetano Rossi, is based on Victor Hugo's 1835 play Angelo, Tyrant of Padua. (This is the same source as Arrigo Boito, under the pseudonym of Tobia Gorrio, was to use for his libretto for Amilcare Ponchielli's La Gioconda).The opera was first performed at La Scala, Milan, on 11 March 1837 and was \"quickly taken up by other theatres throughout Italy\". Within a year, it was staged in Vienna (April 1838) and later appeared in many European cities including London (Her Majesty's Theatre 27 June 1840) and Paris (1858) and in New York (February 1848).\nAs has been noted by Colleen Fay, there were aspects of this work which moved Italian opera in a new direction:\n\nIts taut dramatic structure and vivid musical scene-painting set it apart from the operas of his day ... Not only do we hear in its music a reliable Italian lyricism, but also the early moves away from ornamentation for its own sake. Mercadante uses the orchestra not as a pale accompaniment to dramatic action, but as a full partner in the drama."

He was encouraged to have the opera performed by Jos\u00e9 Amat, the first administrator of the Imperial Academy of Music and Opera Lyrica Nacional. In 1860, Gomes wrote a letter from Rio de Janeiro to his father, inviting him to the opening night which would take place the following year:\n\n\"Meu bom pai.

I write you this so that I do not delay any longer some good news to you. Finally, I have a libretto. It has been taken from a poem by Castilho - A Noite do Castelo. Today, I started working on the composition for the opera. Get yourself ready, then, to come to Rio de Janeiro in 1861. Send my longing love to my sisters and brothers, specially to Juca, bless me as your very thankful son, Carlos.\")\nThe first performance of A noite do castelo by the Opera Lyrica Nacional at the Theatro Lyrico Fluminense on September 4, 1861, was loudly applauded, with contemporary accounts describing the audience as being \"in delirium\". Gomes conducted the performance, which coincided with the wedding anniversary of Emperor Pedro II, to whom the work was dedicated. Gomes was made a Cavalier of the Imperial Order of the Rose on the stage that night with Pedro II himself pinning the medal on the composer.A noite do castelo never entered the operatic repertory outside of Brazil and in modern times it is very rarely performed even there. However, there is a 1978 live recording of a performance by the Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica da Campinas, the Coral da Universidade Estadual de Campinas and the Coral da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo."

Beck suggests moving out of her apartment and changing her name. Despite all her efforts to avoid him by hiding in her work and opening up to her colleagues, she eventually realizes that he has and will always have control over her life.  She eventually loses everything, including her identity, humanity, and will, as she changes her name and moves out of New York City to Denver, a shadow of the woman she once was."

The world premiere was staged on 31 January 1891 at the Residenztheater in Munich. Ibsen himself was in attendance, although he remained back-stage. The play has been canonized as a masterpiece within the genres of literary realism, nineteenth century theatre, and world drama.  Ibsen mainly wrote realistic plays until his forays into modern drama. Hedda Gabler dramatizes the experiences of the title character, Hedda, the daughter of a general, who is trapped in a marriage and a house that she does not want. Overall, the title character for Hedda Gabler is considered one of the great dramatic roles in theater. The year following its publication, the play received negative feedback and reviews. Hedda Gabler has been described as a female variation of Hamlet.Hedda's married name is Hedda Tesman; Gabler is her maiden name. On the subject of the title, Ibsen wrote: \"My intention in giving it this name was to indicate that Hedda as a personality is to be regarded rather as her father's daughter than her husband's wife.\""

        "content": "Hedda, the daughter of a general, has just returned to her villa in Kristiania (now Oslo) from her honeymoon. Her husband is George Tesman, a young, aspiring, and reliable academic who continued his research during their honeymoon. It becomes clear in the course of the play that she never loved him, but married him because she thinks her years of youthful abandon are over. \nThe reappearance of George's academic rival, Eilert L\u00f8vborg, throws their lives into disarray. Eilert, a writer, is also a recovered alcoholic who has wasted his talent until now. Thanks to a relationship with Hedda's old schoolmate, Thea Elvsted (who has left her husband for him), Eilert shows signs of rehabilitation and has just published a bestseller in the same field as George's. When Hedda and Eilert talk privately together, it becomes apparent that they are former lovers.\nThe critical success of his recently published work makes Eilert a threat to George, as Eilert is now a competitor for the university professorship George had been anticipating. George and Hedda are financially overstretched, and George tells Hedda that he will not be able to finance the regular entertaining or luxurious housekeeping that she had been expecting. Upon meeting Eilert, however, the couple discovers that he has no intention of competing for the professorship, but rather has spent the last few years working on what he considers to be his masterpiece, the \"sequel\" to his recently published work.\nApparently jealous of Thea's influence over Eilert, Hedda hopes to come between them. Despite his drinking problem, she encourages Eilert to accompany George and his associate, Judge Brack, to a party. George returns home from the party and reveals that he found the complete manuscript (the only copy) of Eilert's great work, which the latter lost while drunk. George is then called away to his aunt's house, leaving the manuscript in Hedda's possession. When Eilert next sees Hedda and Thea, he tells them that he has deliberately destroyed the manuscript. Thea is horrified, and it is revealed that it was the joint work of Eilert and herself. Hedda says nothing to contradict Eilert or to reassure Thea. After Thea has left, Hedda encourages Eilert to commit suicide, giving him a pistol that had belonged to her father. She then burns the manuscript and tells George she has destroyed it to secure their future.\nWhen the news comes that Eilert did indeed kill himself, George and Thea are determined to try to reconstruct his book from Eilert's notes, which Thea has kept. Hedda is shocked to discover from Judge Brack that Eilert's death, in a brothel, was messy and probably accidental; this \"ridiculous and vile\" death contrasts with the \"beautiful and free\" one that Hedda had imagined for him. Worse, Brack knows the origins of the pistol. He tells Hedda that if he reveals what he knows, a scandal will likely arise around her. Hedda realizes that this places Brack in a position of power over her. Leaving the others, she goes into her smaller room and shoots herself in the head. The others in the room assume that Hedda is simply firing shots, and they follow the sound to investigate. The play ends with George, Brack, and Thea discovering her body."

        "content": "Joseph Wood Krutch makes a connection between Hedda Gabler and Freud, whose first work on psychoanalysis was published almost a decade later. In Krutch's analysis, Gabler is one of the first fully developed neurotic female protagonists of literature. By that, Krutch means that Hedda is neither logical nor insane in the old sense of being random and unaccountable. Her aims and her motives have a secret personal logic of their own. She gets what she wants, but what she wants is not anything that normal people would acknowledge (at least, not publicly) to be desirable. One of the significant things that such a character implies is the premise that there is a secret, sometimes unconscious, world of aims and methods \u2014 one might almost say a secret system of values \u2014 that is often much more important than the rational one. It is regarded as a deep and emotional play, due to Ibsen's portrayal of an anti-heroine.Ibsen was interested in the then-embryonic science of mental illness and had a poor understanding of it by present-day standards. His Ghosts is another example of this. Examples of the troubled 19th-century female might include oppressed, but \"normal\", willful characters; women in abusive or loveless relationships; and those with some type of organic brain disease. Ibsen is content to leave such explanations unsettled. Bernard Paris interprets Gabler's actions as stemming from her \"need for freedom [which is] as compensatory as her craving for power... her desire to shape a man's destiny.\""

Ibsen's work had an international following so that translations and productions in various countries appeared very soon after the publication in Copenhagen and the premiere in Munich.  In February 1891 there were productions in Berlin and Copenhagen. On 20 April 1891, the first British performance of the play occurred, at the Vaudeville Theatre, London, starring Elizabeth Robins, who directed it with Marion Lea, who played Thea. Robins also played Hedda in the first US production, which opened on 30 March 1898 at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, New York City. In February 1899 it was produced as part of The Moscow Art Theatre's first season with Maria F. Andreeva as Hedda.A 1902 production starring Minnie Maddern Fiske was a major sensation on Broadway, and following its initial limited run was revived with the same actress the next year. \nMany prominent actresses have played the role of Hedda: Vera Komissarzhevskaya, Eleonora Duse, Alla Nazimova, Asta Nielsen, Johanne Louise Schmidt, Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Eva Le Gallienne, Elizabeth Robins, Anne Meacham, Ingrid Bergman, Peggy Ashcroft, Fenella Fielding, Jill Bennett, Janet Suzman, Diana Rigg, Isabelle Huppert, Claire Bloom, June Brown, Kate Burton, Geraldine James, Kate Mulgrew, Kelly McGillis, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Jane Fonda, Annette Bening, Amanda Donohoe, Judy Davis, Emmanuelle Seigner, Mary-Louise Parker, Harriet Walter, Rosamund Pike and Cate Blanchett. \nIn 1970 the Royal National Theatre in London staged a production of the play directed by Ingmar Bergman, starring Maggie Smith, who gained much critical acclaim and won a Best Actress Evening Standard Theatre Award for her performance. Also in the early 1970s, Irene Worth played Hedda at Stratford, Ontario, prompting New York Times critic Walter Kerr to write, \"Miss Worth is just possibly the best actress in the world.\" \nOn 26 February 1972, Hedda Gabler was played at the Theatre in the Round, New Vic, Hartshill, Stoke on Trent.A 1973/4 Royal Shakespeare Company world tour of the play was directed and translated by Trevor Nunn, and starred Pam St Clement as Bertha, Patrick Stewart as Eilert Lovborg, Peter Eyre as George Tesman, Glenda Jackson as Hedda Tesman, Timothy West as Judge Brack, Constance Chapman as Juliana Tesman, and Jennie Linden as Mrs. Elvsted.\nIn 1975, a film version directed by Nunn and starring Jackson was released as Hedda, for which Jackson was nominated for an Oscar.\nBritish playwright John Osborne prepared an adaptation in 1972, and in 1991 the Canadian playwright Judith Thompson presented her version at the Shaw Festival. Thompson adapted the play a second time in 2005 at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre in Toronto, setting the first half of the play in the nineteenth century, and the second half during the present day. Early in 2006, the play gained critical success at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds and the Liverpool Playhouse, directed by Matthew Lloyd with Gillian Kearney in the lead role. A revival opened in January 2009 on Broadway, starring Mary-Louise Parker as the title character and Michael Cerveris as J\u00f8rgen Tesman, at the American Airlines Theatre, to mixed critical reviews.\nIn 2005, a production by Richard Eyre, starring Eve Best, at the Almeida Theatre in London was well-received and later transferred for an 11\u00bd week run at the Duke of York's on St Martin's Lane. The play was staged at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater starring actress Martha Plimpton.\nIn April 2009, a modernized New Zealand adaptation by The Wild Duck starring Clare Kerrison in the title role, opened at BATS Theatre in Wellington. It was lauded as \"extraordinarily accessible without compromising Ibsen's genius at all.\"In 2011, the performance of a production of the play as translated and directed by Vahid Rahbani was stopped in Tehran, Iran. Vahid Rahbani was summoned to court for inquiry after an Iranian news agency blasted the classic drama in a review and described it as \"vulgar\" and \"hedonistic\" with symbols of \"sexual slavery cult.\"In February 2011, a Serbian production premiered at the National Theatre in Belgrade.A 2012 Brian Friel adaptation of the play staged at London's The Old Vic theatre received mixed reviews, especially for Sheridan Smith in the lead role.The play was staged in 2015 at Madrid's Mar\u00eda Guerrero. The production, which received mixed reviews, was directed by Eduardo Vasco and presented a text that was adapted by the Spanish playwright Yolanda Pall\u00edn with Cayetana Guill\u00e9n Cuervo playing the lead role.Tony Award-winning director Ivo van Hove made his National Theatre debut in London with a period-less production of Ibsen's masterpiece.

The first of Britten's three 'Parables for Church Performance', the work is based on the Japanese noh play Sumidagawa (Sumida River) by Kanze J\u016br\u014d (1395\u20131431), which Britten saw during a visit to Japan and the Far East in early 1956. Beyond the noh source dramatic material, Britten incorporated elements of noh treatment of theatrical time into this composition. Curlew River marked a departure in style for the remainder of the composer's creative life, paving the way for such works as Owen Wingrave, Death in Venice and the Third String Quartet.\nPlomer translated the setting of the original into a Christian parable, set in early medieval times near the fictional Curlew River, in the fenlands of East Anglia. Peter F. Alexander has investigated in detail the librettist's contribution to the work, through study of the letters between Plomer and Britten. Mikiko Ishi has done a comparative study of the 'weeping mother' figures in Sumidagawa, Curlew River, and various religious plays from medieval Europe. Daniel Albright has examined Britten's and Plomer's adaptations of aspects of the Sumidagawa original into the context of their own cultural and religious backgrounds in the creation of Curlew River.Under Colin Graham's direction, the work was premiered on 13 June 1964 at St Bartholomew's Church, Orford, Suffolk, England, by the English Opera Group. The original cast included Britten regulars Peter Pears and Bryan Drake. The United States premiere was presented at the Caramoor Summer Music Festival on 26 June 1966, with Andrea Velis as the Madwoman."

At a cue from the organ, the Abbot, who acts as a narrator, introduces the \"mystery\" to be presented. The monks who depict the principal players don their costumes to stately instrumental accompaniment after which the play commences.\nThe Ferryman sings of a memorial service that will be held that day at a shrine across the river. A Traveller approaches, wishing to cross the Curlew River. The Ferryman delays his departure when they hear the Madwoman approaching. She has gone mad because of grief for her son, who disappeared a year ago. Though the Ferryman is initially reluctant to carry the Madwoman, the other characters take pity on her and persuade him to give her passage. As they cross the river, the Ferryman tells the story of the shrine: it is the burial place of a boy who arrived the year before with a cruel master who had kidnapped him from his home near the Black Mountains. The boy was sick, and his master abandoned him by the river. Despite being cared for by the locals, the boy died. The Ferryman recounts the boy's words:\n\nI know I am dying... Please bury me here, by the path to this chapel. Then, if travellers from my dear country pass this way, their shadows will fall on my grave, and plant a yew tree in memory of me.The river people believe that the boy's grave is sacred, that:\n\n...some special grace is there, to heal the sick in body and in soulAs the Ferryman tells his story, it becomes clear that the boy he describes is the child of the Madwoman. Grief-stricken, she joins the rest of the cast in praying at the boy's graveside. At the climactic moment when all the men are chanting together, the voice of the boy (a treble) is heard echoing them, and his spirit appears above the tomb to reassure his mother:\n\nGo your way in peace, mother. The dead shall rise again, And in that blessed day, We shall meet in heav'nAt this point, the Madwoman is redeemed and her madness lifts. Britten depicts the moment with the Madwoman letting out a joyful, melismatic \"Amen\", the final note of which resolves onto a long-delayed unison with the full cast \u2013 a signal of return and acceptance.\nHere the robing ceremony music returns, as at the start, and the players resume their normal dress. The Abbot reiterates the moral, and bids the audience farewell. The full cast then recess to the same plainsong with which the work began."

        "content": "At the premiere performance the instrumentalists included flutist Richard Adeney, horn player Neill Sanders, violist Cecil Aronowitz, double bass player Stuart Knussen, harpist Osian Ellis, organist Philip Ledger and percussionist James Blades.The singers are accompanied by a small group of instrumentalists, dressed as lay brothers. The work is scored for:\n\nFlute (doubling piccolo)\nHorn\nViola\nDouble Bass\nHarp\nPercussion (5 small untuned drums, 5 small bells, 1 large tuned gong)\nChamber OrganUnusually, there is no conductor in the work\u2014instead, the instrumental performers lead among themselves; the places at which each instrument is to lead are marked in the score. The lack of a conductor allows Britten to dispense with a universal tempo, the performers often instead playing in two or more separate groups at separate tempi, comparable to the sound of the music of a Nobayashi ensemble in Noh plays. This leads to another unusual notational device, the 'Curlew sign', which is used to 'resynchronise' previously separate groups of musicians by instructing one to sustain or repeat notes 'ad lib' until a given point has been reached in the music of another group. The harp part is heavily influenced by music for the koto and the chamber organ part features extensive use of tone clusters, which are derived from the sh\u014d, an ancient Japanese free-reed mouth organ used in gagaku court music. (Britten had become acquainted with this instrument while in Japan for two weeks in February 1956.)\nBritten's chief compositional technique in Curlew River is heterophony, which he uses to extraordinary dramatic effect. It permeates all aspects of the work's composition, with textures derived from short, decorative couplings, or long, unsynchronised layers of melody. The opening plainsong ('Te lucis ante terminum') suggests many of the melodic shapes throughout the Parable.\nAs in many of Britten's other dramatic works, individual instruments are used to symbolise particular characters. In Curlew River, the flute and horn are used most clearly for this purpose, symbolising the Madwoman and Ferryman respectively. With such a small orchestra, Britten does not use the 'sound worlds' that are clearly demonstrated in his War Requiem and A Midsummer Night's Dream, nor the dramatic change in orchestral timbre (with the entry of the celesta and vibraphone, respectively) that accompanies the appearances of Quint in The Turn of the Screw or Tadzio in Death in Venice."

        "content": "In his introduction to the score, Reich mentions that although the piece is named Music for 18 Musicians, it is not necessarily advisable to perform the piece with that few players due to the extensive need for musicians to perform on multiple instruments.\nThe piece is based on a cycle of eleven chords. A small piece of music is based on each chord, and the piece returns to the original cycle at the end. The sections are named \"Pulses\", and Section I\u2013XI. This was Reich's first attempt at writing for larger ensembles, and the extension of performers resulted in a growth of psychoacoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to \"explore this idea further\". A prominent factor in this work is the augmentation of the harmonies and melodies and the way that they develop this piece. Another important factor in the piece is the use of human breath, used in the clarinets and voices, which help structure and bring a pulse to the piece. The player plays the pulsing note for as long as they can hold it, while each chord is melodically deconstructed by the ensemble, along with augmentation of the notes held. The metallophone (unplugged vibraphone), is used to cue the ensemble to change patterns or sections.\nSome sections of the piece have a chiastic ABCDCBA structure, and Reich noted that this one work contained more harmonic movement in the first five minutes than any other work he had previously written."

After confirming that it could take the form of a comic opera with no spoken dialogue in the style of Der Rosenkavalier, \"only more entertaining and more organic,\" he agreed. The work proceeded for two years, sometimes intensely, sometimes with great difficulty, and in spring 1916 the opera was finished. The originally intended Viennese premi\u00e8re was impeded by the outbreak of World War I and the entrance of Italy in the Alliance against Austria-Hungary, hence the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo was chosen as the location to present it, with Gilda dalla Rizza and Tito Schipa in the leading roles. A feature of the music is Puccini's use of modern dance rhythms, such as the tango, to denote the various characters.In Italy, Puccini offered the work to his editor Tito Ricordi, who declined to buy it, dismissing it as \"Bad Leh\u00e1r\"; thus Ricordi's rival, Lorenzo Sonzogno, obtained the right to give the first performance outside Austria-Hungary and moved the premiere to Mon\u00e9gasque neutral territory. At the premiere in Monte Carlo in 1917 the initial reception by the public and press was warm. However, despite the artistic value of the score, La rondine has been one of Puccini's less successful works; \"In box office terms, [it] was the poor cousin to the other great hits.\" There is no established final version of it, Puccini being dissatisfied, as often, with the result of his work; he revised it many times to the point of making three versions (1917, 1920, 1921), with two completely different endings, but died before clearly deciding on a final version."

        "content": "Valentine d'Aubigny was first and only time that Hal\u00e9vy used a libretto by Barbier and Carr\u00e9, who went on to co-write several libretti for operas by other composers including Gounod and Ambroise Thomas. It was also the last op\u00e9ra comique composed by Hal\u00e9vy. He completed only one more stage work before his death in 1862, the five-act grand opera La magicienne. Cl\u00e9ment and Larousse wrote in their 1869 Dictionnaire lyrique that the \"bizarre\" plot of Valentine d'Aubigny detracted somewhat from the score which had several distinguished pieces and singled out Gilbert's aria \"Comme deux oiseaux\", Sylvia's bolero, and Chevalier Boisrobert's aria \"Un amoureux\". Their assessment that Hal\u00e9vy's music for Valentine was superior to Barbier and Carr\u00e9's libretto echoed that of the critic Paul Scudo in his review of the 1856 premiere for Revue des deux Mondes. He described the libretto as a \"mediocre fable\" and compared Barbier and Carr\u00e9's work unfavorably to that of Eug\u00e8ne Scribe in the op\u00e9ra comique genre. (Scribe had written the libretti for several of Hal\u00e9vy's earlier works in the genre, including Le sh\u00e9rif and Le nabab.) The assessments from other critics excerpted in the 8 May 1856 edition of Le Guide Musicale were much in the same vein. The critic from La Presse th\u00e9\u00e2trale described the libretto as a \"monster\" which defied all logic, but concluded:\nThank God, M. Hal\u00e9vy's music has enough power and charm to almost make us forget the nonsense of the piece. \nHector Berlioz wrote in the Journal des d\u00e9bats\n\nThe score is one of M. Halevy's best. It is written with care and a remarkable delicacy. We warmly applauded many pieces. There's nothing in there that is banal, petty, 'Parisian'. It is the music of a master.\nThe Parisian music publisher Jules Heinz brought out several adaptations and extracts from the score, including its overture and 13 of its arias arranged for solo voice and piano by Auguste Charlot. However, despite its success with the audience on the opening night when Hal\u00e9vy was called to the stage by their applause, the opera does not appear to have been revived after its initial run."

He plans to marry Valentine d'Aubigny whom he has not seen in the ten years since their engagement at the age of fifteen. He believes she is now an orphan living in Paris with her uncle. Unbeknownst to him, Valentine is also staying at the inn. Her uncle has died, and she is travelling from Paris to stay with other relatives.At the inn, Gilbert encounters a half-crazed adventurer, the Chevalier de Boisrobert, who begins by ridiculing Gilbert's horse and then Gilbert himself. Gilbert challenges him to duel, but as the fight is about to begin, breakfast is served and Boisrobert suggests they postpone it until after they have had their coffee. Over breakfast, he recounts to Gilbert that he has run away from Paris to escape marrying Sylvia, a popular actress at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien, to whom he has unwisely become engaged. Sylvia had bet 1000 Louis with her comrades at the theatre that she would be married within the month and is now demanding that Boisrobert either marry her or pay up.\nMeanwhile, ignorant of who she really is, Boisrobert had fallen in love with Valentine the previous day. When she appears at breakfast, he makes advances to her. Gilbert has no idea who she is either but rushes to her defense. As the men are about to draw swords, Sylvia arrives in pursuit of Boisrobert. He takes her aside and tells her Gilbert's story. Sylvia exclaims that she had bought the house of Valentine's uncle after his death. Boisrobert then proposes a plan. Sylvia is to pose as Valentine and marry Gilbert, thus winning her bet and letting Boisrobert off the hook. She agrees to the ruse, and the Baron de Corisandre agrees to pose as her uncle despite the fact that he is desperately in love with Sylvia himself. Boisrobert introduces Sylvia as Valentine to Gilbert who falls at her feet professing his undying love. Boisrobert, still ignorant of who she is, then suggests to the real Valentine that she become the paid companion of Sylvia and go to Paris with her. Amazed by this turn of events and determined to get to the bottom of it, Valentine agrees to Boisrobert's suggestion and tells him that her name is \"Henriette\".After the first act, the action shifts to Paris where Sylvia has fallen in love with Gilbert. He too is in love with her primarily because of the wonderful letters she sends him daily. Unbeknownst to him, the letters are actually written by the real Valentine. He has a difficult time reconciling the \"Valentine\" of the letters with the gaiety and flirtatiousness of Sylvia, the woman he believes to be Valentine. She does not behave at all like a well-bred orphan recently bereft of her uncle. Sylvia eventually realizes that despite her love for him, she is not the right woman for Gilbert and decides to reveal the ruse. However, the real Valentine reveals it to Gilbert before Sylvia can, and she and Gilbert marry.In the final scene, Gilbert and the real Valentine return to Sylvia's house, where Gilbert announces their marriage to her. He bids farewell to Sylvia and looks back at her one last time before leaving with Valentine. Baron de Corisandre rubs his hands in glee while Sylvia collapses in a chair weeping for her lost love. Boisrobert opens a door to the garden and tells Sylvia to listen. A group of actors from the theatre are heard singing:\nWe must not believe in long-lasting love! We must laugh and drink and sing all day!"

It was Ridley's second stage play and premiered at the Hampstead Theatre, London on 14 May 1992 and featured Jude Law in his first paid theatre role, playing the part of Foxtrot Darling. The production was the second collaboration between Ridley and director Matthew Lloyd, who would go on to direct the original productions for the majority of Ridley's plays until the year 2001.Like Ridley's previous play The Pitchfork Disney, The Fastest Clock was considered by some critics as shocking for its time.  Nevertheless the play was a major success, winning a variety of awards.The play is the second entry in Ridley's unofficially titled \"East End Gothic Trilogy\", preceded by The Pitchfork Disney and followed by Ghost from a Perfect Place. Although initially receiving a generally divisive response from critics these plays have grown in reputation and have been recognised as major works in the development of In-yer-face theatre which radically characterised new writing in British theatre during the 1990s."

He lives with his partner Captain Tock who he often makes wait on him, much to the Captain's dismay. As Cougar has an intense fear of ageing he regularly holds birthday parties where he pretends to be only nineteen years of age. He also uses these parties to invite young people whom he has falsely befriended to his flat, to seduce (and possibly even murder) them for his own pleasure. The victim of today's party is Foxtrot Darling, a 15 year-old schoolchild who Cougar has manipulated by becoming a new role model for him in wake of his brother's death. However, when Foxtrot arrives he has unexpectedly brought along Sherbet Gravel, a streetwise 17 year-old girl who is planning to become Foxtrot's wife and claims to be pregnant with his child. As the play progresses the atmosphere gradually intensifies as Sherbet takes control of the party, aware that Cougar is not what he appears to be."

        "content": "Ridley has stated that he had already started formulating ideas for The Fastest Clock in the Universe during the original production of his previous play The Pitchfork Disney.\nRidley has said that he was partially inspired in writing the play by what he felt at the time was \"[a new] kind of male vanity that was really coming to the foreground... where men were beginning to... promote themselves as sexual objects... Men were kind of almost like saying \u2018We can have it all now... We can have the girls fancying us and we can have men fancying us. We can have just whatever we like.\u2019 There was this kind of strange... polysexuality that was kind of running through everything... That as a kind of character thing fascinated me... This kind of cult of physical perfection was something that I thought had... something that was really theatrical.\" Ridley particularly was intrigued by how this new form of masculinity he observed contrasted to how his father\u2019s generation perceived masculinity.\nRidley has acknowledged that the play was partially influenced by the work of Joe Orton. Another influence was Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, with a stage version of Wilde\u2019s story being the last production that Ridley had directed while a student at St Martins School of Art. In 2013 Ridley stated that he initially was \"not conscious\" of these influences while composing the play but that \"looking back and reading the play now, I can see Dorian Gray and Orton running through it like\u2026 Brighton through a stick of rock. It\u2019s kind of there all the way through.\" He also has stated that the recurring imagery of birds was influenced by the artist Max Ernst, particularly \"those kind of Victorian collages that he did with kind of women with bird\u2019s heads. And he was using birds there as a symbol of sexual suppression, of showing no sexual emotion at all.\"  Other influences were Alfred Hitchcock, Francis Bacon, Jacobean theatre, and Brian De Palma's film adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s Carrie, with Ridley saying \"what [the play] shares with Carrie... is that you sort of know where it\u2019s heading. You know... that it\u2019s going to end with blood... So how it\u2019s going to end is not really what this play is about. It\u2019s the journey it\u2019s going to take to get there\".\nRegarding the play\u2019s numerous influences Ridley has said \"It\u2019s the only play in which I\u2019ve done... [where] the play itself is like this junk shop... in which all the kind of scrapbook ideas I\u2019ve been playing around with have been thrown in... It\u2019s almost like I could do an annotated version of the script [where] every line would have a little asterisk by it... connecting it to something else... of where this idea came from... It\u2019s the only play in which I\u2019ve consciously done that, but all these references [and] allusions to other things it\u2019s making... is part of that kind of shimmering kaleidoscop[ic] idea on top of idea world that it is.\"Ridley dedicated the play to his friend and fellow visual artist Dominic Vianney Murphy who studied with him at St Martins School of Art."

It was first performed on 28 May 1660 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Petit-Bourbon in Paris to great success. Moli\u00e8re himself played the role of Sganarelle at the premiere and continued to perform it throughout his career.

        "content": "Although there are no direct literary sources for the play, The Imaginary Cuckold was influenced by both the French farce and the Italian commedia dell'arte traditions with the story unfolding over 24 scenes written in alexandrine verse. Moli\u00e8re wrote the character of Sganarelle as a vehicle for himself and played him in the premiere. The Sganarelle character first appeared in his 1645 play Le M\u00e9decin volant and would later re-appear in multiple Moli\u00e8re plays, each time with a different aspect of the character's personality developed or emphasised.The play was an instant success at its premiere, playing throughout 1660 with several further private performances for Cardinal Mazarin and King Louis XIV. It was to become the most frequently performed of Moli\u00e8re's plays during his lifetime and was offered every year by his company. Moli\u00e8re refused to have the play published to protect his company's exclusive performing rights. However, one enthusiastic spectator, \"La Neufvillenaine\" (pseudonym of the Parisian publisher Jean Ribou), saw the play so many times during its first run that he was able to write it down from memory. The text (with his added commentary) was published in a \"pirate\" edition by Ribou in late 1660.Although Moli\u00e8re intended the play to be performed in one act without interruptions (as documented by La Grange in 1682), some 18th-century editors divided the play into three acts with the breaks coming after Scenes 6 and 17. The Imaginary Cuckold continues to be performed today in its original one-act version both in France and in other countries (often in translation). A performance of the play by the actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise with stage direction by Thierry Hancisse was broadcast on France 3 television in 2002 and released on DVD in 2008."

He and Beth's mother begin to flirt, and after getting caught, Simon lights the family's front yard on fire. Meanwhile, track athletes Derrick and Brandon bully the young and awkward Patty, who goes to work at a pet store before returning home. She eats dinner with her parents, Norman and Connie, and brother Kevin, and is unsuccessful in asking for permission to go to a rock show with her friends, Sissy and Karen. For the past two years, Patty has been sending postcards containing nude photos and lyrics to her original music to John Q, the lead singer of her favorite band PSYOPS, who will be playing next week with the Alliance. She is unaware that John Q is Simon, who performs wearing a ski mask.\nThe following morning, Simon begins to sell drugs around town. A police officer spots him and gives chase but fails to find him. Simon crosses paths with Patty, who recognizes him from a college course on music appreciation. She tells him that she was just fired from the pet store by the owner, Mr. Hanley. She takes him back to her place, where they flirt. Simon and Patty later eat dinner with the rest of her family. Simon convinces Norman and Connie into giving him a place to stay for the week and tells Kevin he is adopted. Patty tells Simon about her fascination for John Q. Simon runs away and confronts his band members for setting up the rock show without his knowledge. He returns to Patty's house and smokes weed with Kevin.\nThe next day, Simon and Patty make plans to demand an overdue paycheck from Mr. Hanley. Derrick and Brandon come across them and beat up Simon. In a rage, Simon convinces a friend to lend him his truck. He goes home to retrieve a dead cat from Patty's front yard before tracking Derrick and Brandon down. Patty acts provocatively to throw them off as Simon knocks them unconscious, strips them, burns their tracksuits, and places the dead cat on their bodies. The smoke alerts the other track athletes, who find them as Simon and Patty make their escape and drive away. They get the check from Mr. Hanley and eat lunch at a fast food restaurant. There, they kiss passionately. Simon and Patty spend the rest of the day on a date at an arcade. Simon breaks into a ticket machine to win Patty a desired stuffed teddy bear. They return home and find the rest of Patty's family completely stoned.\nThe following day, Simon prevents Patty from going to a job interview to be a dish cleaner and instead takes her to the basement of his mother's house. He tells her that he is John Q and proves it by giving her back her postcards. He praises her songwriting abilities. They have sex and later perform one of her songs. Her singing brings him to tears. Simon's family arrives home and invites the pair to dinner. When the family starts to criticize Simon and accuse him of being a drug addict, Patty confronts them, but they mistake her awkwardness for drug use. The family kicks them both out. When Patty asks Simon if he thinks she is retarded, he tells her to stop undervaluing herself because she is a \"total punk rocker.\" When Simon tells his music manager that he refuses to play with the Alliance, his band members decide to call the police and turn him in for a reward. Simon takes Patty on another date to a \"secret\" rock show. He sings one of her favorite songs, \"Dinner in America,\" and dedicates the performance to her, cementing their relationship. The police arrest Simon as Sissy and Karen notice Patty kissing him before he goes. The trio decides to start a riot girl band. Sometime later, Patty reads a letter from Simon that includes a nude photo of his. She punches a bully that calls her a retard, walks away, puts on a ski mask, and listens to the song she recorded with Simon."

        "content": "The concept for the film originated from two sketches by writer-director Adam Carter Rehmeier. The first sketch, Kicks (2006), centered entirely around Simon's time volunteering for clinical trials to pay for his punk records. Rehmeier wrote the second sketch, Dinner in America, around 2009, and took a more comedic approach that focused on Patty's family as they ate dinner. When he saw they were not working independently, he combined the stories together sometime between 2013 and 2014, and the idea for the film came to fruition. Rehmeier said the film drew inspiration from the characters of Dawn Wiener in Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995) and the title character in Napoleon Dynamite (2004): \"I wouldn't say they were really direct [influences]. I think really it came down to writing things that weren't going anywhere and just having like a lot of marinating over a long period of time.\"The screenplay was noticed by filmmaker Danny Leiner who, initially interested in directing, noticed Rehmeier's vision and came on board the project as a producer. The ensemble cast, including leads Kyle Gallner and Emily Skeggs, was announced in September 2018. Filming took place in Detroit, Michigan. Leiner died by the time production had concluded in 2018; the film is dedicated to his memory. Ben Stiller and Nicky Weinstock are credited in the end credits as producers as well. Leiner said he was thankful for their guidance, especially since Weinstock was on set the entire time. Skeggs, who plays Patty, said musician Ezra Furman was a major inspiration for her performance. Original songs for the film were constructed ahead of filming during pre-production. The score was composed by John Swihart."

        "content": "for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf is a 1976 work by Ntozake Shange. It consists of a series of poetic monologues to be accompanied by dance movements and music, a form which Shange coined the word choreopoem to describe. It tells the stories of seven women who have suffered oppression in a racist and sexist society.As a choreopoem, the piece is a series of 20 separate poems choreographed to music that weaves interconnected stories of love, empowerment, struggle and loss into a complex representation of sisterhood. The cast consists of seven nameless African-American women only identified by the colors they are assigned. They are the lady in red, lady in orange, lady in yellow, lady in green, lady in blue, lady in brown, and lady in purple.  Subjects from rape, abandonment, abortion and domestic violence are tackled. Shange originally wrote the monologues as separate poems in 1974. Her writing style is idiosyncratic and she often uses vernacular language, unique structure, and unorthodox punctuation to emphasize syncopation. Shange wanted to write for colored girls... in a way that mimicked how real women speak so she could draw her readers' focus to the experience of reading and listening.In December 1974, Shange performed the first incarnation of her choreopoem with four other artists at a women's bar outside Berkeley, California. After moving to New York City, she continued work on for colored girls..., which went on to open at the Booth Theatre in 1976, becoming the second play by a black woman to reach Broadway, preceded by Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun in 1959. Shange updated the original choreopoem in 2010, by adding the poem \"positive\" and referencing the Iraq War and PTSD.\nfor colored girls... has been performed Off-Broadway as well as on Broadway, and was adapted as a book (first published in 1976 by Shameless Hussy Press), a 1982 television film, and a 2010 theatrical film. The 1976 Broadway production was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play and the 2022 Broadway production was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play."

        "content": "for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf is inspired by events in Shange's life. Shange admitted publicly to having attempted suicide on four occasions. In a phone interview conducted with CNN, she explained how she came to the title of her choreopoem: \"I was driving the No. 1 Highway in northern California and I was overcome by the appearance of two parallel rainbows. I had a feeling of near death or near catastrophe. Then I drove through the rainbow and I went away. Then I put that together to form the title.\"  The colors of the rainbow then became the essence of the women in the choreopoem.\nShange also explains that she chose to use the word \"colored\" in the title of her choreopoem so that her grandmother would be able to understand it."

        "content": "Structurally, for colored girls is a series of 20-22 poems, depending on whether \"my love is too\" and \"positive\" are included in the list, collectively called a \"choreopoem.\" Shange's poetry expresses many struggles and obstacles that African-American women may face throughout their lives and is a representation of sisterhood and coming of age as an African-American woman. The poems are choreographed to music that weaves together interconnected stories. The choreopoem is performed by a cast of seven nameless women only identified by the colors they are assigned. They are the lady in red, lady in orange, lady in yellow, lady in green, lady in blue, lady in brown, and lady in purple.  Subjects from rape, abandonment, abortion, and domestic violence are tackled. By the end of the play these women come together in a circle, symbolizing the unity they have found sharing their stories.\n\n\"dark phrases\" \u2013 Lady in Brown with Ladies in Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow and PurpleThe prologue of the choreopoem \"dark phrases\" begins with the lady in brown describing the \"dark phrases of womanhood\".  All she hears are screams and promises. Each woman states where she is from, by stating they are outside their respective cities. The lady in brown proclaims that this piece is all for \"colored girls who have considered suicide / but moved to the ends of their own rainbows\". The women then begin to sing children's nursery rhymes, \"mama's little baby likes shortnin, shortnin\". Then all the ladies start to dance to the song \"Dancing in the Street\".\n\n\"graduation nite\" \u2013 Lady in Yellow with Ladies in Blue, Green and RedThe lady in yellow says it was graduation night and she was the only virgin. She was out driving around with her male friends who she has known since the seventh grade in a black Buick, laughing about graduation. After a fight breaks out, the lady in yellow and Bobby leave and end up having sex in the back of the Buick. The other ladies start talking about their sexual preferences.\n\n\"now i love somebody more than\" \u2013 Lady in Blue with Ladies in Yellow, Blue, and GreenThe lady in blue talks about how she used to participate in dance marathons frequently. One night she refused to dance with anyone that only spoke English. Throughout the monologue she intertwines English and Spanish.  During this time she discovered blues clubs. She says she became possessed by the music. She ends her monologue by calling it her poem \"thank-you for music,\" to which she states: \"I love you more than poem\". She repeats \"te amo mas que,\" and the other women join her, softly chanting.\n\n\"no assistance\" \u2013 Lady in RedThe lady in red addresses an ambiguous \"you\" throughout the monologue. She has loved this \"you\" strongly and passionately \"for 8 months, 2 wks, & a day\" without any encouragement. She decides to end this affair and leaves a note attached to a plant that she has watered every day since she met this person.\n\n\"i'm a poet who does not like you\" \u2013 Lady in Orange with Ladies in Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple and BrownThe lady in orange begins by saying she does not want to write in neither English nor Spanish, but she only wants to dance. She forgets all about words when she starts to dance. She says \"we gotta dance to keep form cryin and dyin\" and the other ladies repeat her words. The lady in orange then claims that she is a poet \"who writes in english / come to share the worlds witchu\".\n\"latent rapists'\" \u2013 Ladies in Red, Blue, PurpleThe lady in blue talks about how hard it is to press charges against a friend. The other women begin to ponder and ask questions. They say that maybe it was a misunderstanding, or the woman caused it, and they ask her if she was drinking. The lady in red states that society only believes someone is a rapist if they are a perverted stranger. The women talk about male friends of theirs who have nice smiles and buy them dinner but end up raping women. The women all share the experience of having been violated by a man they knew while being on the lookout for \"the stranger we always thot it wd be\". The lady in red states that the \"nature of rape has changed.\" The lights change, the women react to an imaginary slap.\n\n\"abortion cycle #1\" \u2013 Lady in BlueThe lady in blue sets the scene with tubes, tables, white washed windows, and her legs spread open. She could not bear to have people looking at her while she got an abortion so she is all alone.\n\n\"sechita\" \u2013 Lady in Purple with Lady in GreenThe lady in purple describes Sechita's life in the bayou, while lady in green dances out Sechita's life. She is dressed up for the Creole carnival celebration. She embodies the spirit of her namesake, Sechita, the Egyptian goddess of creativity, love, beauty and filth from the 2nd millennium.\n\n\"toussaint\" \u2013 Lady in BrownThe lady in brown describes falling in love with Toussaint L'Ouverture finding Toussaint in the library near the train tracks. The lady in brown talks about entering a contest to see which \"colored child\" could read 15 books in three weeks and the lady in brown won, but she was disqualified because she went into the adult reading room and read about Toussaint instead of reading the children's books. The lady in brown became obsessed with Toussaint despite the fact that he was dead. He was her \"secret lover at age 8\". The lady in brown wanted to run away to go to Haiti with Toussaint. On her journey the lady in brown meets a young boy whose name is Toussaint Jones. The lady in brown feels likes she has met her real-life Toussaint and she leaves with him.\n\n\"one\" \u2013 Lady in RedThe lady in red enters begins by describing a beautiful woman wearing orange butterflies, silk roses, and aqua sequins. This woman is deliberate in all her actions. Although she walked slowly to allow men to gaze at her, she never returned their interest with a smile or acknowledging their catcalls. She was \"hot / a deliberate coquette\". Her goal was to be unforgettable. She takes \"those especially schemin/ tactful suitors\" to go home with her. In the morning, she becomes her ordinary self by washing off the glitter and the grime from the night before. She asks her lovers to leave. The men would leave in a hurry, and then she cleaned up and put her roses away. She would write about her exploits in her diary and then, cry herself to sleep.\n\n\"i usedta to live in the world\" \u2013 Lady in BlueThe lady in blue begins her monologue by explaining that she used to live in the world but now only lives in Harlem, and her universe is only six blocks. She used to walk all over the world and now her world is small and dirty. The lady in blue says that when she used to live in the world where she was nice and sweet but now, now she cannot bring herself to be nice to anyone in this \"six blocks of cruelty / piled up on itself\".\n\"pyramid\" \u2013 Lady in PurpleThe lady in purple joins the ladies in blue, yellow, and orange. She starts by describing them as three friends who shared every aspect of their lives. They remember a time when they all were attracted to the same man, but he only could choose one of them. The one who he chose loved him, but worried if her friends could hold out. One day she found the rose she left on his pillow on her friend's desk. The friend said she did not know what was going on, because the man said he was free. The three friends did not want to hurt one another but they know how wonderful this man could be. The friends hug and cry and go to confront the man, whom they find with another woman. The women cry and comfort each other like sisters.\n\n\"no more love poems #1\" \u2013 Lady in OrangeThe lady in orange discusses a relationship that left her heartbroken. She says that ever since she realized that someone would call a \"colored girl an evil woman a bitch or a nag\" (56) she has tried not to be that person. She tries to not only give joy, but to receive it as well. She finds herself in what she believes to be a real and honest relationship. Yet, the guy keeps going back to his ex-lover. The lady in orange tried to move on by finding another lover, but she was not satisfied. She tried to avoid sadness, but she found herself heartbroken by this man. She could not stand being \"sorry & colored at the same time / it's so redundant in the modern world\".\n\"no more love poems #2\" \u2013 Lady in PurpleThe lady in purple speaks about her relationship to dance and men. She deliberately chooses to dance with men who do not speak English, pops pills, and uses dance as an escape from reality. Then she meets a man who she gave everything: dance, fear, hope and scars. She admits she was ready to die, but now is ready to be herself and accept love. She pleads, \"lemme love you just like i am / a colored girl/ i'm finally bein real\".\n\"no more love poems #3\" \u2013 Lady in BlueThe lady in blue proclaims that they all deal with too much emotion and that it might be easier to be white. That way they could make everything \"dry & abstract wit no rhythm & no / reelin for sheer sensual pleasure\". The lady in blue states that they should try to control their feelings and she is going to take the first step by masturbating. However, she finds that this makes her feel lonely and does not know where to look to feel whole.\n\n\"no more love poems #4\" \u2013 Lady in YellowThe lady in yellow claims to have lost touch with reality because she used to think she was immune to emotional pain, but she realized she is not. She gave her dance, but her dance was not enough. She says \"bein alive & bein a woman & bein colored is a metaphysical / dilemma / i haven't conquered yet\".\n\"my love is too\" \u2013 Ladies in Yellow, Brown, Purple, Blue, Orange, Red, GreenThe other women come and each repeats, \"my love is too...delicate/beautiful/sanctified/magic/saturday nite/complicated/music to have thrown back in my face.\" The ladies begin dancing and chanting together.\n\n\"somebody almost walked off wid alla my stuff\" \u2013 Lady in GreenThe lady in green says that someone has taken all of her \"stuff\". She feels that she is the only one that knows and can appreciate the value of her stuff. She describes her stuff as the way she sits with her legs open sometimes, her chewed up fingernails, her rhythm, her voice, her talk, her \"delicate leg and whimsical kiss\".  The person who stole her stuff is a man. She made too much room for this man who has run off with her stuff, especially because he does not even know that he has it. By the end of the monologue she demands her stuff back from this man.\n\n\"sorry\" \u2013 Ladies in Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, PurpleThe ladies start talking about all the apologies they have received from men. Some examples include: he is sorry because he does not know how she got your number, sorry because he was high, sorry because he is only human, and sorry because he thought she could handle it. The lady in blue then declares that she does not need any more apologies. She goes on to say that men should keep their apologies for themselves, because she does not need them to soothe her soul and she cannot use them. Rather than accepting apologies, she is going to do whatever she wants: yell, scream, and break things. And she will not apologize for any of it.\n\n\"positive\" \u2013 Ladies in Red, Yellow, Purple, BrownLady in yellow, purple, brown, red participate in reciting the next poem about contracting HIV/AIDS; they share the lines and all speak to one woman's experience. The ladies argue about suspicions of cheating in the relationship. The lady in yellow tells her friends how happy she is in her relationship, and her friend tells her they have seen her lover outside the gay bars. The lady in yellow protests, but her friend tells her to get tested. The lady in yellow goes to get tested to put the whole issue to bed. Two weeks later, the doctor calls the lady in yellow with her patient number (#7QYG9) to inform her that she is HIV positive. The lady in yellow confronts her lover who furiously tells her he is not gay and accuses her of cheating on him. She tells him to get tested but he gets angrier and violent. He throws her to the ground and when she wakes up he is gone and she says, \"& i was positive / & not positive at all\".\n\"a nite with beau willie brown\" \u2013 Lady in Red, OrangeThe lady in orange begins the story of Willie Brown by saying there is no air. Beau Willie is all tied up in the sheets, wishing a friend would come over and bring him some blow or any other kind of drug. The lady in red continues the story, saying that Beau Willie claims there is nothing wrong with him. Beau Willie tried to get veterans' benefits but he cannot read, so he starts driving a cab around the city but the cops always give him a hard time and he is not making any money. The lady in orange and red say that Crystal is pregnant again and Beau beats Crystal almost to death when he hears about her pregnancy. Beau Willie has wanted to marry Crystal since she was 14, but now she laughs in his face saying she will never marry him. She has the baby and there are now two kids, Naomi and Kwame. Crystal ends up getting a court order to keep Beau away from her and the children. Beau Willie comes to the house despite the court order and while he is there he becomes apologetic saying he just wants to marry her and give her things. The two children run to their father as Crystal watches. Suddenly, he grabs the kids and pushes the screen out of the window. Beau Willie tells Crystal she has to agree to marry him. Naomi and Kwame scream and Crystal, at the moment, can only whisper. Beau Willie drops the kids out of the window and they die.\n\n\"a laying on of hands\" \u2013 Ladies in Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, BrownThe ladies begin the last poem saying that they are missing something: a \"layin on of hands\". The hands are strong, cool, moving, and make them whole and pure. The lady in blue says she feels the gods coming into her, laying her open to herself. She goes on to say that she knows about laying her body open for a man, but still she was missing something. Finally, all the ladies repeat the lines she says, \"i found god in myself / & i loved her / I loved her fiercely\". They sing to each other and then the audience, and close into a tight circle with each other. The choreopoem ends with lady in brown modifying her earlier statement: \"& this is for colored girls who have considered suicide/ but are movin to the ends of their own rainbows.\""

        "content": "for colored girls... was first performed by Shange with four other artists at the Bacchanal, a women's bar, outside Berkeley, California. About six months after performing the work in California, Shange and her collaborator, Paula Moss, decided to move across the country determined to perform it in New York City's downtown alternative spaces. At the age of 27, Shange moved to New York, where, in July 1975, the reworked for colored girls was professionally produced in New York City at Studio Rivbea in 1975. East coast audiences were soon able to experience Shange's performance piece at other venues including the Old Reliable, and DeMonte's beginning in July 1975 and then starting in March 1976 at the Henry Street Settlement's New Federal Theatre. The show grew increasingly popular, especially among African-American and Latino audiences. As a result, for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf opened at The Public Theater in June 1976. Three months later, in September, the show was performed at the Booth Theater on Broadway, where it was continued until July 1978 and ran for 742 shows. Shange performed as the \"lady in orange\" at the Broadway opening. It was also published in book form in 1977 by Macmillan Publishing, followed by a Literary Guild edition in October 1977 and Bantam Books editions beginning in 1980. A cast recording was also released by Buddah Records.From February to July 1978 the production, presented by the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust and several American entrepreneurs, toured Australia. It was staged first at Her Majesty's in Adelaide, South Australia, as part of the 10th Adelaide Festival of Arts, before touring to Melbourne, Sydney, Townsville, Cairns, and Brisbane, for two- to four-week runs. Original cast members Alfre Woodard, Aku Kadogo, Carol Maillard, and Lynn Whitfield featured in the show, while it was directed by Oz Scott.In 1982 for colored girls... was adapted for television on WNET-TV, PBS, as part of The American Playhouse series.  Although for colored girls went from a play production to television one, this production was dubbed a \"telefilm\" instead of a teleplay as the performance on WNET-TV was seen as a serious departure from the Broadway production.In 2009 Tyler Perry announced that he would produce Shange's for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf.  The film was the first project for 34th Street Films, Perry's new production company housed in Lionsgate The cast included Loretta Devine, Kimberly Elise, Whoopi Goldberg, Janet Jackson, Phylicia Rash\u0101d, Anika Noni Rose, Kerry Washington and Thandiwe Newton. Originally using the play's full title, the film's title was shortened to For Colored Girls in September 2010.In the fall of 2019, The Public Theater revived the play.  The production was directed by Leah C. Gardiner, with choreography by Camille A. Brown and featured a Deaf actress in the role of \"Lady in Purple.\" On July 29, 2021, it was announced the Public Theater's staging of the play would be produced on Broadway in 2022. It was later announced that the production would be directed and choreographed by Brown. It began previews on April 1, 2022 and officially opened on April 20 at the Booth Theatre. On May 3, it was confirmed that the revival would close on May 22, several months ahead of schedule; it was subsequently extended to June 5. The cast features D. Woods, Amara Granderson, Tendayi Kuumba, Kenita R. Miller, Okwui Okpokwasili, Stacey Sargeant, and Alexandria Wailes."

The adaptation, directed by Oz Scott, was seen as a serious departure from the Broadway production.  A review by The New York Times states: \"What Miss Shange prefers to call a choreopoem has been expanded into realistic settings that too often resemble the sanitized atmosphere of an episode of Good Times. The net result has been a considerable reduction in the work's emotional impact.\" As a result, the televised production is often seen as a diluted version of the original choreopoem."

        "content": "On March 25, 2009, the film industry magazine Variety reported that Nzingha Stewart, a black female director, had acquired the feature film rights to for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf from Shange and that Lionsgate had signed Stewart to create a screenplay adaptation and direct the film version of the play.Stewart, at Lionsgate's direction, approached Tyler Perry about producing the film. However, Perry told Lionsgate that if he produced it, he also wanted to write and direct it. Perry then usurped the project from Stewart and scrapped her script. The shift prompted controversy over whether Perry had the skill and consciousness to properly depict an iconic feminist work. Stewart remained on in the token position of executive producer of the film. Among those critics were Oprah Winfrey, who expressed doubts over whether the book should be made into a film at all. Others had reservations based on Perry's position at the helm of such an important book in African American literature, particularly considering the controversies raised by Precious, a film he lent his name to.On September 3, 2009, Lionsgate announced it had acquired the distribution rights to Tyler Perry's 34th Street Films adaptation of the play, with principal photography originally scheduled to take place in Atlanta, Georgia, in November and December 2009. The film, which was retitled For Colored Girls, was released on November 5, 2010, and was written, directed and produced by Perry. The cast includes Thandiwe Newton, Loretta Devine, Kimberly Elise, Whoopi Goldberg, Janet Jackson, Phylicia Rashad, Anika Noni Rose, Kerry Washington, Tessa Thompson, Michael Ealy, Macy Gray and Omari Hardwick. Mariah Carey had also been cast, but pulled out in May 2010, citing medical reasons.When asked if she held reservations about Perry's adaptation of her work, Shange responded: \"I had a lot of qualms. I worried about his characterizations of women as plastic.\" In reference to the film post-production, she stated that \"I think he did a very fine job, although I'm not sure I would call it a finished film.\""

Shange's work has also been transformed using different forms of media. It has been continually performed in colleges and universities, art spaces, and theaters throughout the world. It has been set in beauty shops, prisons, and other historical time periods. A Brazilian production dropped the word \"color\" in the title, and a group of women in Kentucky made it about class instead of race. In a Season Four episode of A Different World, Freddie (Cree Summer) performs a segment from the play during an audition for the fictionalized Hillman College theater production, where show director Whitley (Jasmine Guy) rejects the piece, sarcastically commenting, \"Now I know why colored girls consider suicide.\""

It is shocking with little surface meaning but is addictive and, to some, inexplicably attractive.\u201d Aleks Sierz for The Stage praised the play, writing that \u201calthough the imaginary element of the play is often outrageously cruel and breathtakingly audacious, it is always firmly grounded in the emotional truth of character\u201d and that \u201cit really feels as if Ridley has single-handedly brought white-knuckle excitement and appalling truth back to the new [play]writing scene.\u201dThe Guardian critic Lyn Gardner, though giving a mostly positive review, only awarded the play three stars, saying that it is \u201cnot a show for everyone and definitely not for the faint-hearted.\u201d Time Out London gave a mostly positive review remarking that \u201cthere is some fine writing here, combined with moments of knuckle-whitening tension\u201d and that the play \u201cevokes the all too recognisable violence and madness of modern Britain.\u201d However, the magazine criticised elements of Ridley's writing, saying that the \u201cscript never quite decides whether it's a farce or magical realism\u201d and also added that \u201c[it is] a bit of a mess structurally \u2013 as if three separate plays are fighting for attention.\u201dOn seeing the original production actor Ben Whishaw, who had starred in two of Ridley's previous adult plays (Mercury Fur and Leaves of Glass), remarked that It was \"extraordinary and very moving. It put me in a kind of trance. I love the way he [Philip Ridley] writes about fantasy, truth, honesty and lies with such courage, passion, humour and poetry. I think he's a true original\"However, the play was not greeted with praise from all reviewers.

However, with characters like these, whose emotions and motivations are as random as the movements in a game of pinball, it's impossible to give two hoots about any of it.\"Ian Shuttleworth in his prompt corner column for Theatre Record took a dislike to Ridley's use of Lilly's character speaking most of the play in a made-up Middle-Eastern type language, stating that \u201ca character spouting vaguely Middle-Eastern gibberish which is meant to be Arabic prayer is going to be seen with some justification as insulting \u2013 not because we're living in sensitive times and need to be politically correct or whatever, but simply because it has all the unsubtlety and laziness of those 1970s TV sitcoms where Europeans or Mexicans were inherently funny simply because they sounded different, and any stereotypical different sounds would do.\u201d He, however, wrote, explaining that he understood that the \u201ccharacter has a point inside the play\u201d but stated that the character \u201chas implications beyond [outside the play\u2019s context]; and I think it's too easy to give the writer a free pass because of claims that he's being bold or challenging\u201d adding that \u201coften [Ridley] doesn't know when to stop.\u201d\n\n\n== References =="

Ponchielli began composing the work in 1874, but at the time of his death in 1886, only the piano score for the first three acts and part of the fourth had been completed. The opera was later revised by Ponchielli's son Annibale and the orchestration and fourth act were completed by Arturo Cadore. It premiered on 17 March 1914 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Casino in Monaco and ran for three performances.The story is set in Valencia in the early 17th century when Philip III decreed the expulsion of the Moriscos (the descendants of the Moors) from Spain. Ghislanzoni's libretto was based on Piquillo Alliaga, a novel by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe.Following the world premiere in Monaco, the opera was performed the following July at the Arena di Milano conducted by Antonio Guarneri, and received further performances in January 1915 at the Teatro Ponchielli in Cremona. Although warmly received by the audiences in Monaco, Milan and Cremona, I Mori di Valenza has never been revived.

Osborne continues: \"while parts of Verdi's earlier operas had frequently been taken up by the fighters of the Risorgimento [...] this time the composer had given the movement its own opera\".While still writing I masnadieri and with his obligation to complete an opera for the publisher,  \nFrancesco Lucca, Verdi had been admonished by the poet Giuseppe Giusti for turning away from patriotic subjects when he composed Macbeth; the poet pleaded with him to \"do what you can to nourish the [sorrow of the Italian people], to strengthen it, and direct it to its goal.\"  Verdi replied encouragingly. With his other obligations out of the way, he was hesitant in committing to anything that was not a genuinely patriotic subject, but he despaired that librettists were incapable to providing them until Salvadore Cammarano (who supplied  the libretto for the 1845 Alzira) came up with the idea of adapting Joseph M\u00e9ry's 1828 play La Bataille de Toulouse, a well-known and well-liked play in Italy at that time. \"A story like that should stir every man with an Italian soul in his breast\" was how the librettist described it.\"Conceived in the springtime of Italian hopes\" (as Budden describes the initial enthusiasm for the work), by the time Cammarano produced a final libretto it was early 1849 and it was also clear that the Austrians had not been permanently routed from Lombardy. The premiere was set for late January 1849, some last-minute adjustments were made, and Verdi traveled to Rome before the end of 1848.  At this point in the rise of Italian nationalism, Rome under Pope Pius IX was in turmoil and the Pope was held prisoner (without his Swiss guards), but he managed to escape to the south, hoping to negotiate his return. Within days of Battaglia's totally sold-out premiere, Rome had become a republic, accelerated by the passions inflamed amongst its inhabitants by (amongst other things) the opera's final chorus of freedom: \"Italia risorge vestita di Gloria, invitta e regina qual'era sar\u00e0\" / \"Italy rises again robed in glory!, Unconquered and a queen she shall be as once she was!\"."

Sacro un patto / Tutti stringe I figli suoi / \"Long live Italy!.

It was presented in Genoa, Corfu, Turin, and Piacenza between 1850 and 1859 and revived in Milan and Naples in 1861.In the 1880s it was re-styled in French as Pour la Patrie for a projected production at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Ch\u00e2teau-d'Eau in Paris which did not happen. However, as Emanuele Muzio reports by letter to Verdi, this adaptation was later successfully performed in the French provinces.20th century and beyond\nIn Italy, the opera was seen in 1959 in Florence and Venice to commemorate the centenary of the Second Italian War of Independence, and in Trieste in 1963 (on each occasion starring Leyla Gencer). La Scala has mounted the piece twice in the last century: once in 1916 and once in 1961. The 1961 cast was recorded and includes performances by Franco Corelli, Antonietta Stella, and Ettore Bastianini.\nThe Rome Opera presented Battaglia in December 1983, a performance of which was recorded.  In the 1990s, it was staged in Piacenza in January 1999 with Lida sung by Fiorenza Cedolins. Additionally, it was presented in the Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania in December 2001 under Nello Santi. A video recording was made of the production.\nBattaglia was not performed in the United Kingdom until 31 October 1960 when it was given its UK premi\u00e8re by the Welsh Opera Company in London at Sadler's Wells. The Royal Opera House company (during the period when the house was closed) gave a concert performance at the Royal Festival Hall in July 2000 with a cast which included Pl\u00e1cido Domingo (as Arrigo) and Anthony Michaels-Moore singing Rolando. Ver\u00f3nica Villarroel sang Lida. \nIt was only on 28 February 1976 that this opera was given its US premiere by the Amato Opera in New York City. Two concert performances have been presented by the Opera Orchestra of New York; the first was in January 1987 with Matteo Manuguerra, Aprile Millo and Jerome Hines while the second was given on 19 November 2001.  The Pittsburgh Opera presented the work with June Anderson on 20 September 1985.In Rome in 2011, as part of the 150th anniversary of Italian Unification, Battaglia was presented by the Rome Opera.Companies which plan to present all of Verdi's operas include the ABAO in Bilbao which presented it in 2007, and it was given by Sarasota Opera as part of its \"Verdi Cycle\" in 2016.\nAs the Verdi bicentennial year was approaching, it was staged by the Teatro Regio di Parma in October 2012 (as part of its \"Festival Verdi\" series) and was directed by David Alden. The Parma production was repeated in Trieste.Hamburg State Opera presented performances in October/November 2013 along with two other early Verdi operas, all directed by Alden."

Roger Parker is impressed by the opera's \"inner working and its sheer scale [which] far outstrip any of Verdi's previous efforts\", largely agreeing with Budden in this account.\nSince Baldini notes that Italian critics and writers were far less enthusiastic about this opera than the English ones (and  maybe because he is Italian), he notes that there are only three of the \"young Verdi's best-constructed, most thoughtful pages, but these saving graces are infrequent\":  he then names these as  the overture, the Chorus of the Knights of Death [act 3], and the whole of act 4.\" But he does mention one other important thing which has come up in the earlier operas as well, especially I due Foscari, the difference between the \"public\" and the \"private\" aspects of the opera."

The novel had already been adapted into a straight theatrical stage play by Bontemps and poet Countee Cullen in the early 1930s. Gross wanted a musical for the talents of Lena Horne and thought that a musical version of Bontemps' novel would be a powerful vehicle for her. He approached Cullen to write the book and Arlen and Mercer to write the music for the project. All of them accepted.\nAlthough Arlen and Mercer created what some consider to be their best score, the musical suffered from many misfortunes during production. First, the book suffered several serious problems. The show was not really a comedy and did not lend itself to standard Broadway musical treatment of its themes. Throughout the drama, any happiness the characters attain is offset by the deepest feeling of gloom. The correct balance for a musical comedy was never achieved, and a book that could have become an opera was treated neither humorously nor dramatically. These problems were compounded by the fact that Cullen died before rehearsals even began, and Ayers and Rouben Mamoulian, who came in after to work on the show's narrative, could not fix the show's sprawling plot. Secondly, the NAACP criticised the musical for \"offering roles that detract from the dignity of our race\". Lena Horne agreed with this assessment and refused to star in the show saying she had no intention of portraying \"a flashy lady of easy virtue\". When the show eventually opened there were several protests by African Americans outside the theatre, which negatively affected sales. Finally, the show suffered several staffing problems. The choreographer was replaced midway through production and the show's leading lady, Ruby Hill, was replaced after its pre-Broadway tryout in Boston. Hill returned to the show after only three performances in New York at the insistence of the show's cast, in particular Pearl Bailey. The show opened at the Martin Beck Theater on March 30, 1946, and lasted for only 113 performances."

The opera was first broadcast by the Italian radio station RAI on 1 December 1949. The work is based on the short story La torture par l'esp\u00e9rance (\"Torture by Hope\") from the collection Nouveaux contes cruels by the French writer Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam and from La L\u00e9gende d'Ulenspiegel et de Lamme Goedzak by Charles De Coster. Some of the musical material is based on Dallapiccola's earlier choral work on a similar theme, Canti di prigionia (1938). Dallapiccola composed Il prigioniero in the period of 1944\u20131948. The work contains seven parts and lasts about 50 minutes. The musical idiom is serialism, and it is one of the first completed operas using that compositional method."

The first was an opera in three acts by Tomaso Benvenuti (premiered in Milan in 1857). The next two were lyric dramas in 4 acts by Edoardo Vera (to a libretto by Achille de Lauzi\u00e8res) which premiered in Lisbon in 1858, and by Ettore Perosio (to a libretto by his father), premiered in Genoa in 1889. After Cilea created his own Adriana, however, none of those by others were performed anymore and they remain largely unknown today.The opera is based on the life of the French actress Adrienne Lecouvreur (1692\u20131730). While there are some actual historical figures in the opera, the episode it recounts is largely fictional; its death-by-poisoned-violets plot device is often signalled as verismo opera's least realistic. It is often condemned as being among the most confusing texts ever written for the stage, and cuts that have often been made in performance only make the story harder to follow. The running time of a typical modern performance is about 135 minutes (excluding intervals)."

        "content": "The opera premiered at the Teatro Lirico, Milan, on 6 November 1902, with the well-known verismo soprano Angelica Pandolfini in the title role, Enrico Caruso in the role of Maurizio, and the lyric baritone Giuseppe De Luca as Michonnet.\nThe opera was first performed in the United States by the San Carlo Opera Company on January 5, 1907, at the French Opera House in New Orleans with Tarquinia Tarquini in the title role. It gained its Metropolitan Opera premiere on 18 November 1907 (in a performance starring Lina Cavalieri and Caruso). It had a run of only three performances that season, however, due in large part to Caruso's ill-health. The opera was not performed again at the Met until a new production was mounted in 1963, with Renata Tebaldi in the title role. That 1963 production continued to be remounted at the same theatre, with differing casts, for the next few decades. It was in the lead role of this opera that the Spanish tenor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo made his Met debut in 1968, alongside Renata Tebaldi. He sang again in Adriana Lecouvreur in February 2009.The title role in Adriana Lecouvreur has always been a favorite of sopranos with large voices, which tend to sit less at the very top of their range. This part has a relatively low tessitura, going no higher than Bb, and only a few times at that, but requires great vocal power, and is a meaty and challenging one to tackle on a dramatic level \u2013 especially during the work's so-called \"Recitation\" and death scene. Famous Adrianas of the past 75 years have included Claudia Muzio, Clara Petrella, Magda Olivero, Renata Tebaldi, Carla Gavazzi, Leyla Gencer, Montserrat Caball\u00e9, Raina Kabaivanska, Renata Scotto, Mirella Freni, and Joan Sutherland. Angela Gheorghiu tackled the role at the Royal Opera, London, in 2010 with Jonas Kaufmann as Maurizio. It was the first new production (directed by David McVicar) at the Royal Opera House since 1906. Angela Gheorghiu has reprised the role with great critical acclaim, in the same production, at the Vienna State Opera, when the opera was presented for the very first time on its stage (2014), Paris (2015)  and again in London, when she celebrated 25 years on the stage of the Royal Opera House and 150 performances with the company (2017)  The Met presented a production new to that house by David McVicar on 31 December 2018, with Anna Netrebko in the title role, Piotr Becza\u0142a as Maurizio and Anita Rachvelishvili as the Princess de Bouillon.A recording of part of the opera's last act duet \"No, pi\u00f9 nobile\", rearranged into a self-contained tenor aria, was made by Caruso as early as 1902 for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company in Milan and its affiliates, with Cilea at the piano."

It was partly based on the opening of the Greek tragedy of Prometheus Bound. The first performance at Ar\u00e8nes de B\u00e9ziers on 27 August 1900 involved almost 800 performers (including two wind bands and 15 harps) and was watched by an audience of 10,000. Between 1914 and 1916, Jean Roger-Ducasse reworked the score for a reduced orchestra. This version (which was later revised by Faur\u00e9) made its debut at the Paris Op\u00e9ra on 17 May 1917 but never became popular.\nDesignated as a trag\u00e9die lyrique, the work resists easy categorisation. It was intended to be on a large-scale with spoken and musical sections. Warrack and West call it a grand cantata, arguing that since \"only some of the characters participate in the stage action it is scarcely an opera, though Faur\u00e9's conception of the work is at times more operatic than merely choral ...

At the close of act 1 \"she falls as if dead\" and act 2 accordingly opens with the powerful funeral procession carrying her body. Illogically, but necessarily because of her balancing role, she revives later in the act and continues to take part in the action.\n\nAct 1\nA musical prelude is followed by a massed choral scene, in which Andros leads the men and Aeno\u00eb leads the women in rejoicing at the gift of fire. Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e praises its benefits but Pandore opposes his action in defying Zeus. Then Gaia appears to warn the Titan of the consequences of his action. She is followed by Kratos (power) and Bia (violence), sent by Zeus to punish him; with them is the divine smith Hephaestus, who is a friend of Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e. The three tell Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e his sentence: he will be chained forever to a rock and every day a black eagle shall drink from his veins.Act 2\nThe female choir enters carrying Pandore on a bier of leafy branches, after which Aeno\u00eb makes the funeral oration. Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e returns with the executioners from Olympus. Though Hephaestus laments for his friend, Bia and Kratos are there to ensure that he make the chains to bind Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e to the rock. Having slit his veins, they leave and the revived Pandore enters again to lament his fate.Act 3\nA chorus of Oceanids comforts Pandore. Bia and Kratos return to threaten her and Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e, followed by Hermes with the gift of a box from Zeus. Despite being warned by Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e to refuse, Pandore insists on taking it. She discovers that her tears have been miraculously transformed there to a balsam.

In the opera, the ballet divertissement was performed in honour of Queen Elizabeth of Spain, who was absent and in her place her lady-in-waiting Princess Eboli, donning a mask, presided over the festivities. The ballet divertissement is set in a grotto and depicts a fisherman discovering the La Peregrina pearl.Balanchine had choreographed for several Verdi operas early in his career, and told his biographer Bernard Taper, \"From Verdi's way of dealing with the chorus, I have learned how to handle the corps de ballet, the ensemble, the soloists, how to make the soloists stand out against the corps, and when to give them a rest.\" Balanchine made the piano reduction of the music himself as none existed. Aware that the music would be uninteresting for the orchestra, Balanchine apologised to the orchestra and hinted he would use more challenging music for his next ballet, which would be Kammermusik No. 2.:\u200a296\u200a\nFor the lead roles, Balanchine chose Merrill Ashley, recently promoted to principal dancer, and Robert Weiss. Balanchine had spoken to Ashley about a virtuoso role, but she was unaware he was planning for a role for her. She then returned from vacation to find out about her promotion and casting in Ballo della Regina. Debra Austin, Bonita Borne, Stephanie Saland and Sheryl Ware originated the soloist roles. Balanchine choreographed the ballet in a week.:\u200a296\u200a Ashley described her experience working on the ballet, Balanchine was in very good spirits, and I think it was inevitable that he would do something fast for me. He wanted to push me and see how far I could go. He didn't say that to me, but to other people. 'I kept giving her harder things to do, and I couldn't believe she could do it.' There were some things I couldn't do which eventually got changed, but when he makes a ballet for you it's comfortable. He knows how to make one step flow into the next. They're difficult, but you're not forcing your body into an unnatural pattern.\nThe costumes and lighting, designed by Ben Benson and Ronald Bates respectively, along with the sea-blue backcloth used in the ballet, evoke the grotto setting of the ballet divertissement in Don Carlos. In his will, Balanchine bequeathed the rights to the ballet to Ashley.:\u200a318"

Balanchine's biographer Bernard Taper described the ballet as \"essentially a display piece, spotlighting the bravura talent of Merrill Ashley.\" Another Balanchine biographer, Jennifer Homans, described the role, In Ballo [Balanchine] gave [Ashley] some of the most difficult feats ever devised in the classical repertory, yet it wasn't bravura that emerged. It was a kind of muscular physics. The squareness and tension through her shoulders and face dissolved in her mercurial speed, legs slicing, as her torso and hips peeled open with ever extreme torque and an \u00e9paulement that spiraled through her limbs and brought her once-studied anatomy to life.\"\nNew York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff noted the choreography was also tailored to Weiss' virtuosity, and Weiss said Balanchine took advantage of his speed and jumps. He added, \"The qualities that work best in that ballet were qualities that he saw in [Ashley and I].\"Kisselgoff also found that in addition to ballet divertissement from Don Carlos, Balanchine took inspiration from \"underwater\u2010pearl\" ballets that he became familiar with as a child, such as Saint-L\u00e9on's The Little Humpbacked Horse and Petipa's La Perle. According to her, the Verdi score's structure and mood \"has given [Balanchine] his cue\", and the two lead roles of Ballo della Regina evoke the fisherman and pearl of the opera divertissement."

She married the composer following their collaboration.\nSet in Haiti in 1791, Troubled Island portrays Jean Jacques Dessalines (1758\u20131806) and the corruption of his leadership in the Haitian revolution.  He declared himself as emperor of an independent Haiti but was assassinated by opponents. The opera premiered at the New York City Opera on March 31, 1949, notably making it the first grand opera composed by an African American to be produced by a major company."

        "content": "Still and Hughes began writing Troubled Island in 1936, but Hughes left the project the following year to cover the Spanish Civil War for the Baltimore Afro-American.  Arvey, a pianist and writer who never wrote a libretto before, completed the project in Hughes\u2019 absence.Troubled Island was completed in 1939, but Still faced problems in arranging for a production. Planned premieres in 1945 and 1948 at the New York City Opera were withdrawn, but the company presented the world premiere of  Troubled Island on March 31, 1949. It was the first time that the work of an African-American composer was presented by a major American opera company.Although the leading roles of Dessalines and his wife Azelia were based on black Haitians, the opera company cast white opera stars Robert Weede and Marie Powers, who wore dark make-up for the 1949 premiere. African-American bass-baritone Lawrence Winters took over the role of Dessalines from Weede for the second performance of the opera and continued in the role for the remainder of the production's run.The premiere performance was greeted with 22 curtain calls. Critical reaction to the work ranged from mixed-to-negative. Time Magazine said, \u201cComposer Still's music, sometimes lusciously scored, sometimes naively melodic, often had more prettiness than power. In all, Troubled Island had more of the souffle of operetta than the soup bone of opera.\u201d John Briggs of the New York Post opined, \u201cone was never sure one was hearing a first-rate performance of an inferior work or a second-rate performance of a good one,\u201d while Miles Kastendieck, writing for both the New York Journal-American and the Christian Science Monitor, said of Still\u2019s music: \u201cthe result is a mixture of styles signifying talent and a feel for opera but achieving little more than a suggestion of it.\u201dYears later, Judith Still, the daughter of Still and Arvey, said that the New York critics intentionally panned Troubled Island due to racism. \u201cHoward Taubman (a critic and friend of Still) came to my father and said \u2018Billy, because I\u2019m your friend I think that I should tell you this \u2013 the critics have had a meeting to decide what to do about your opera. They think the colored boy has gone far enough and they have voted to pan your opera.\u2019 And that was it. In those days, critics had that kind of influence.\u201d Following its premiere, New York City Opera staged two additional presentations, on April 1 and May 1 of 1949. To date, New York City Opera has never revived the work in full; however, a 60th-anniversary concert production of excerpts was presented by the company in March 2009 at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.  The opera has not been seen widely outside these two productions until October 19, 2013 when the South Shore Opera Company of Chicago presented the opera in full with a black cast, black chorus and black conductor. The opera was held at the Paul Robeson Theatre of the South Shore Cultural Center."

The people solved this by electing a king of their own nation, who would be only the first magistrate of the republic and preferable to laws imposed on them.

Therefore, fearing revolution in a conquered land, after sacrificing most of the royal families, taken hostage four of the kingdom's main lords, including young Gustav, son of Henry, of the illustrious Vasa family, which had often held the throne, and imprisoned them in Denmark.

The premiere of Il curioso indiscreto took place during the Carnival season of 1777 at Rome's Teatro delle Dame, where Anfossi's La vera costanza had premiered the previous year. Since women were not allowed to perform on stage in the Papal States at that time, the opera premiered with an all-male cast. The stage design was by Gabriele Montarenzi with costumes by Carlo Brogi and Vincenzo D'Amora. The performance included two untitled ballets choreographed by Giacomo Romolo.The opera proved very popular and was subsequently performed in many Italian and European cities, including Vienna in 1783. For the Vienna performance, Mozart added two of his own arias, \"Vorrei spiegarvi, oh Dio! (K. 418) and \"No, no che non sei capace\" (K. 419) at the request of Aloysia Weber who was singing the lead soprano role of Clorinda.

The score was finished in 1924. The opera received its world premiere on 19 June 1926 at the Grand Theatre, Warsaw, with the cast including the composer's sister, the soprano Stanis\u0142awa Korwin-Szymanowska, as Roxana.\nThe \"Sicilian drama\", as he called it, originated from Szymanowski's enthusiasm for Mediterranean culture as a melting pot of different peoples and religions. He spent much time travelling in that area in 1911 and in 1914, and shared his love of the region with Iwaszkiewicz. In the summer of 1918 at Odessa, Szymanowski and Iwaszkiewicz conceived the project, and composed the opera over the period of 1918 to 1924. Szymanowski's lost novel Efebos dealt with mystical themes similar to those that inspired this work; Szymanowski labelled it a \"Misterium\".Jim Samson has placed King Roger in a musico-psychological analysis of Szymanowski's compositional struggles. Alistair Wightman has briefly discussed Szymanowski's stylised treatment of Arabic musical idioms in the score. Stephen Downes has analysed in detail the themes of \"duality\" and \"transformation\" expressed in the music of the opera."

Two productions followed closely, the first at Theater Duisburg, Germany, in October 1928, and the second in October 1932 at the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed divadlo in Prague. The first post-World War II presentation took place in Palermo in 1949 in the presence of its librettist, conducted by Mieczys\u0142aw Mierzejewski, set design by Renato Guttuso, Giovanni Inghilleri sang Roger, Clara Petrella sang Roxana, Antonio Annaloro the Shepherd. After that some years passed before the opera was staged again.\nIn 1975, the New Opera Company in London produced the work under the baton of Charles Mackerras. In the USA the opera was first seen in 1981, in a concert version given by the St. Louis Symphony in St. Louis, conducted by Leonard Slatkin. That same year it was presented at the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires, conducted by Stanis\u0142aw Wis\u0142ocki.\nSince the late 1980s and into the present century, King Roger seems to have enjoyed something of a revival with about thirteen productions in many different locations. In 1988, the Long Beach Opera in California, known for its innovative approach to the repertoire, had Murry Sidlin as conductor and James Johnson as King Roger, Nancy Shade as Roxana, and Jonathan Mack as Edrisi. A concert performance was given on 3 March 1990 at the Royal Festival Hall by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Andrew Davis. This was the opening concert of a festival of Szymanowski's works given by the South Bank Arts Centre. David Wilson-Johnson took the title role, with Wieslaw Ochman as the Shepherd, Eilene Hannan as Roxana, Martyn Hill as Edrisi, Matthew Best as the Archbishop and Anne Collins as the Archdeaconess. Sydney Dance Company used the opera as a recorded soundtrack for its ballet of King Roger in the Sydney Opera House in 1990. Palermo presented King Roger again in 1992. Four concert versions were given by the end of the 1990s: the first by Orchestre National de France in Paris, conducted by Charles Dutoit in 1996 and at the London Proms by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra under Simon Rattle in 1998, while the third and fourth performances were presented in Montreal and subsequently, on October 17, 1999, at Carnegie Hall for the New York Premiere with Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.\nIn the 21st century, King Roger was given by the Polish National Opera in 2000 and in the same year also in Amsterdam by the Netherlands Opera, conducted by Hartmut Haenchen. In 2002, Charles Dutoit conducted the Japanese premiere of the work in a concert version with the NHK Symphony Orchestra in Tokyo, as well as in Prague with the Czech Philharmonic in 2007. The Mariinsky Opera Company brought the work to the Edinburgh Festival in 2008 under Valery Gergiev and directed by Mariusz Treli\u0144ski.It was presented in Palermo in 2005 and also by the Wroc\u0142aw Opera in 2007. A subsequent US performance was at the Bard SummerScape festival in 2008.Both the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona and the Op\u00e9ra National de Paris in Paris, conducted by Kazushi Ono presented it in 2009. In 2011, King Roger appeared at the Staatstheater Mainz. A new production of the opera was staged in Polish at The Santa Fe Opera on 21 July 2012 with Mariusz Kwiecie\u0144 in the title role. In 2013, King Roger was presented at the 17th Festival Amazonas de \u00d3pera in Manaus, Brazil, with Marcin Bronikowski in the title role. In June 2014, a new production was staged at the Wuppertal Opera House in Germany. Two performances took place in Boston in March 2015 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Charles Dutoit. The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, introduced a new co-production with Opera Australia, conducted by Antonio Pappano, in May 2015. The first performance in Australia was shown by Opera Australia in 2017 in Sydney and Melbourne, conducted by Andrea Molino, with Saimir Pirgu as Shepherd."

In order to win her hand in marriage, a suitor must solve three riddles, with a wrong answer resulting in their execution. Calaf passes the test, but Turandot refuses to marry him.

Turan is a region of Central Asia that was once part of the Persian Empire. Dokht is a contraction of dokhtar (daughter); the kh and t are both pronounced.Standard Italian pronunciation prescribes pronouncing the final t. However, according to Puccini scholar Patrick Vincent Casali, the t is silent in the name of the opera and of its title character, thus [turan\u02c8do]. Soprano Rosa Raisa, who created the title role, said that neither Puccini nor Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the first performances, ever pronounced the final t. Similarly, prominent Turandot Eva Turner did not pronounce the final t in television interviews. Casali maintains that the musical setting of many of Calaf's utterances of the name makes sounding the final t all but impossible. On the other hand, Simonetta Puccini, the composer's granddaughter and keeper of the Villa Puccini and Mausoleum, has said that the final t must be pronounced."

        "content": "The beginnings of Turandot can likely be found in Haft Peykar, a twelfth-century epic by the Persian poet Nizami. One of the stories in Haft Peykar features a Russian princess. In 1722, Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9tis de la Croix published his Les Mille et un jours (The Thousand and One Days), a collection of stories which were purportedly taken from Middle Eastern folklore and mythologies. One of these stories, believed to be inspired by Nizami, features a cold princess named Turandokht. However, it has been speculated that many of de la Croix's 'translated' stories were his own original creations, with no actual basis in Middle Eastern cultures. De la Croix's story was adapted into a play, Turandot, by the Italian playwright Carlo Gozzi in 1762, which was then adapted by Friedrich Schiller into another play in 1801. It was Schiller's version that inspired Puccini to write the opera.\nPuccini began working on Turandot in March 1920 after meeting with librettists Giuseppe Adami and Renato Simoni. In his impatience, he began composition in January 1921, before Adami and Simoni had produced the text for the libretto. As with Madama Butterfly, Puccini strove for a semblance of authenticity by using music from the region, even commissioning a set of thirteen custom-made gongs. Baron Edoardo Fassini-Camossi, the former Italian diplomat to China, gave Puccini a music box that played 4 Chinese melodies. Puccini incorporated three of these melodies into his opera, the most memorable of which is the folk melody \"M\u00f2 Li H\u016ba (\u8309\u8389\u82b1)\" ('Jasmine Flower'). M\u00f2 Li H\u016ba serves as a leitmotif for Princess Turandot. In total, eight of the themes from Turandot appear to be based on traditional Chinese music and anthems.By March 1924, Puccini had completed the opera up to the final duet. However, he was dissatisfied with the text of the final duet, and did not continue until 8 October, when he chose Adami's fourth version of the duet text. Two days later, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. Puccini seems to have had some inkling of the seriousness of his condition: before leaving for Brussels for treatment, he visited Arturo Toscanini and begged him, \"Don't let my Turandot die.\" He died of a heart attack on 29 November 1924."

        "content": "Turandot premiered at the La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, on 25 April 1926, a year and five months after Puccini's death. Rosa Raisa played Turandot. Tenors Miguel Fleta and Franco Lo Giudice alternated in the role of Prince Calaf, with Fleta singing the role on opening night. It was conducted by Arturo Toscanini. In the middle of Act III, the orchestra stopped playing. Toscanini turned to the audience and announced, \"Qui finisce l'opera, perch\u00e9 a questo punto il maestro \u00e8 morto\" (\"Here the opera ends, because at this point the maestro died\"). The curtain was then lowered. A reporter for La Stampa recorded the words slightly differently: \"Qui finisce l'opera, rimasta incompiuta per la morte del povero Puccini\" (\"Here the opera ends, left incomplete by the death of the poor Puccini\"). Others have reported that Toscanini said \"Here, the Maestro laid down his pen.\" A newspaper report from 1926 states that Puccini asked Toscanini to stop the opera performance in the middle of Act III. The second and subsequent performances of the 1926 La Scala season included Alfano's ending.Soon after its premiere in Milan, Turandot spread to other cities.\n\nFor many years, the government of the People's Republic of China forbade performance of Turandot because they said it portrayed China and the Chinese unfavorably. Instead of a single nationwide decree against it, any attempts to produce it were not approved. In the late 1990s they relented, and in September 1998 the opera was performed for eight nights as Turandot at the Forbidden City, complete with opulent sets and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army as extras. It was an international collaboration, with director Zhang Yimou as choreographer and Zubin Mehta as conductor. The singing roles saw Giovanna Casolla, Audrey Stottler, and Sharon Sweet as Princess Turandot; Sergej Larin and Lando Bartolini as Calaf; and Barbara Frittoli, Cristina Gallardo-Dom\u00e2s, and Barbara Hendricks as Li\u00f9.\nThe aria \"Nessun dorma\" has long been a staple of operatic recitals. Luciano Pavarotti popularized the piece beyond the opera world in the 1990s with his performance of it for the 1990 World Cup, which received a global audience. Both Pavarotti and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo released singles of the aria, with Pavarotti's reaching number 2 in the UK. The Three Tenors performed the aria at three subsequent World Cup Finals, in 1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama. Many crossover and pop artists have performed and recorded it and the aria has been used in the soundtracks of numerous films. Turandot is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire and it appears as number 17 on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide."

        "content": "While long recognised as the most tonally adventurous of Puccini's operas, Turandot has also been considered a flawed masterpiece, and some critics have been hostile. Joseph Kerman states that \"Nobody would deny that dramatic potential can be found in this tale. Puccini, however, did not find it; his music does nothing to rationalize the legend or illuminate the characters.\" Kerman also wrote that while Turandot is more \"suave\" musically than Puccini's earlier opera, Tosca, \"dramatically it is a good deal more depraved.\" However, Sir Thomas Beecham once remarked that anything that Joseph Kerman said about Puccini \"can safely be ignored\".Some of this criticism is possibly due to the standard Alfano ending (Alfano II), in which Li\u00f9's death is followed almost immediately by Calaf's \"rough wooing\" of Turandot, and the \"bombastic\" end to the opera. A later attempt at completing the opera was made, with the co-operation of the publishers, Ricordi, in 2002 by Luciano Berio. The Berio version is considered to overcome some of these criticisms, but critics such as Michael Tanner have failed to be wholly convinced by the new ending, noting that the criticism by the Puccini advocate Julian Budden still applies: \"Nothing in the text of the final duet suggests that Calaf's love for Turandot amounts to anything more than a physical obsession: nor can the ingenuities of Simoni and Adami's text for 'Del primo pianto' convince us that the Princess's submission is any less hormonal.\"Ashbrook and Powers consider it was an awareness of this problem \u2013 an inadequate buildup for Turandot's change of heart, combined with an overly successful treatment of the secondary character (Li\u00f9) \u2013 which contributed to Puccini's inability to complete the opera. Another alternative ending, written by Chinese composer Hao Wei Ya, has Calaf pursue Turandot but kiss her tenderly, not forcefully; and the lines beginning \"Del primo pianto\" (Of the first tears) are expanded into an aria where Turandot tells Calaf more fully about her change of heart.Concerning the compelling believability of the self-sacrificial Li\u00f9 character in contrast to the two mythic protagonists, biographers note echoes in Puccini's own life. He had had a servant named Doria, whom his wife accused of sexual relations with Puccini. The accusations escalated until Doria killed herself. In Turandot, Puccini lavished his attention on the familiar sufferings of Li\u00f9, as he had on his many previous suffering heroines. However, in the opinion of Father Owen Lee, Puccini was out of his element when it came to resolving the tale of his two allegorical protagonists. Finding himself completely outside his normal genre of verismo, he was incapable of completely grasping and resolving the necessary elements of the mythic, unable to \"feel his way into the new, forbidding areas the myth opened up to him\" \u2013 and thus unable to finish the opera in the two years before his unexpected death."

Long's version was dramatized by David Belasco as the one-act play Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan, which, after premiering in New York in 1900, moved to London, where Puccini saw it in the summer of that year.The original version of the opera, in two acts, had its premiere on 17 February 1904 at La Scala in Milan. It was poorly received, despite having such notable singers as soprano Rosina Storchio, tenor Giovanni Zenatello and baritone Giuseppe De Luca in lead roles. This was due in part to a late completion by Puccini, which gave inadequate time for rehearsals. Puccini revised the opera, splitting the second act in two, with the Humming Chorus as a bridge to what became Act III, and making other changes.

It was this second version that premiered in the United States in 1906, first in Washington, D.C., in October, and then in New York in November, performed by Henry Savage's New English Opera Company (so named because it performed in English-language translations).In 1906, Puccini wrote a third version, which was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 11 February 1907. Later that year, Puccini made several changes in the orchestral and vocal scores, and this became the fourth version.Again in 1907, Puccini made his final revisions to the opera in a fifth version, which has become known as the \"Standard Version\" and is the one which is most often performed today. However, the original 1904 version is occasionally performed, such as for the opening of La Scala's 2016\u201317 season, on 7 December 2016, with Riccardo Chailly conducting."

Its first performance in Britain was in London on 10 July 1905 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, while the first US performance was presented in English on 15 October 1906, in Washington, D.C., at the Columbia Theater. The first performance in New York took place on 12 November of the same year at the Garden Theatre. The Metropolitan Opera first performed the opera on 11 February 1907 under the supervision of the composer with Geraldine Farrar as Cio-Cio-San, Enrico Caruso as Pinkerton, Louise Homer as Suzuki, Antonio Scotti as Sharpless, with Arturo Vigna conducting;Madama Butterfly has since been heard virtually every season at the Met except for a hiatus during World War II from 1942 through 1945 due to the hostilities between the United States and Japan. The first Australian performance was presented at the Theatre Royal in Sydney on 26 March 1910, starring Amy Eliza Castles.Between 1915 and 1920, Japan's best-known opera singer Tamaki Miura won international fame for her performances as Cio-Cio-San. A memorial to this singer, along with one to Puccini, can be found in the Glover Garden in the port city of Nagasaki, where the opera is set."

Giacomo, poor thing, we never saw him because we couldn't go on the stage. We got to the end of it and I don't know how. The second act I didn't hear at all, and before the opera was over, we ran out of the theater.\nCalled \"one of the most terrible flops in Italian opera history\", the premiere was beset by several bad staging decisions, including the lack of an intermission during the second act. Worst of all was the idea to give audience plants nightingale whistles to deepen the sense of sunrise in the final scene. The audience took the noise as a cue to make their own animal noises.Madama Butterfly has been criticized by some American intellectuals for orientalism. Despite these opinions, Madama Butterfly has been successfully performed in Japan in various adaptions from 1914.Today Madama Butterfly is the sixth most performed opera in the world and considered a masterpiece, with Puccini's orchestration praised as limpid, fluent and refined."

The French libretto was adapted from Maurice Maeterlinck's symbolist play of the same name. It premiered at the Salle Favart in Paris by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on 30 April 1902; Jean P\u00e9rier was Pell\u00e9as and Mary Garden was M\u00e9lisande, conducted by Andr\u00e9 Messager, who was instrumental in getting the Op\u00e9ra-Comique to stage the work. The only opera Debussy ever completed, it is considered a landmark in 20th-century music.\nThe plot concerns a love triangle. Prince Golaud finds M\u00e9lisande, a mysterious young woman, lost in a forest. He marries her and brings her back to the castle of his grandfather, King Arkel of Allemonde. Here M\u00e9lisande becomes increasingly attached to Golaud's younger half-brother Pell\u00e9as, arousing Golaud's jealousy. Golaud goes to excessive lengths to find out the truth about Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande's relationship, even forcing his own child, Yniold, to spy on the couple. Pell\u00e9as decides to leave the castle but arranges to meet M\u00e9lisande one last time and the two finally confess their love for one another. Golaud, who has been eavesdropping, rushes out and kills Pell\u00e9as. M\u00e9lisande dies shortly after, having given birth to a daughter, with Golaud still begging her to tell him \u201cthe truth.\u201d\nDespite its initial controversy, Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande has remained regularly staged and recorded throughout the 20th- and into the 21st-century."

        "content": "The initial run lasted for 14 performances, making a profit for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. It became a staple part in the repertory of the theatre, reaching its hundredth performance there on 25 January 1913. In 1908, Maggie Teyte took over the role of M\u00e9lisande from Mary Garden. She described Debussy's reaction on learning her nationality: \"Une autre anglaise\u2014Mon Dieu\" (Another Englishwoman\u2014my God). Teyte also wrote about the composer's perfectionist character and his relations with the cast:\n\nAs a teacher he was pedantic\u2014that's the only word. Really pedantic ... There was a core of anger and bitterness in him\u2014I often think he was rather like Golaud in Pell\u00e9as and yet he wasn't. He was\u2014it's in all his music\u2014a very sensual man. No one seemed to like him. Jean P\u00e9rier, who played Pell\u00e9as to my M\u00e9lisande, went white with anger if you mentioned the name of Debussy...\nDebussy's perfectionism\u2014plus his dislike of the attendant publicity\u2014was one of the reasons why he rarely attended performances of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande. However, he did supervise the first foreign production of the opera, which appeared at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, Brussels on 9 January 1907. This was followed by foreign premieres in Frankfurt on 19 April of the same year, New York City at the Manhattan Opera House on 19 February 1908, and at La Scala, Milan, with Arturo Toscanini conducting on 2 April 1908. It first appeared in the United Kingdom at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 21 May 1909.In the years following World War I, the popularity of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande began to fade somewhat. As Roger Nichols writes, \"[The] two qualities of being escapist and easily caricatured meant that in the brittle, post-war Parisian climate Pell\u00e9as could be written off as no longer relevant.\" The situation was the same abroad and in 1940 the English critic Edward J. Dent observed that \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande seems to have fallen completely into oblivion.\" However, the Canadian premiere was given that same year at the Montreal Festivals under the baton of Wilfrid Pelletier. Interest was further revived by the famous production which debuted at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on 22 May 1942 under the baton of Roger D\u00e9sormi\u00e8re with Jacques Jansen and Ir\u00e8ne Joachim in the title roles. The couple became \"the Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande for a whole generation of opera-goers, last appearing together at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1955.\"\nThe Australian premiere was a student production at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music in June 1950, conducted by Eugene Goossens, with Renee Goossens (no relation) as M\u00e9lisande. The first professional staging in Australia was in June 1977, with the Victorian State Opera under Richard Divall.In December 1962 (for the Debussy birth centenary) the Op\u00e9ra-Comique gave several performances conducted by Manuel Rosenthal and directed by Pierre Bertin using the original Jusseaume-Ronsin sets from the 1902 premiere production. Notable later productions include those with set designs by Jean Cocteau (first performed in Metz in 1963), and the 1969 Covent Garden production conducted by Pierre Boulez. Boulez's rejection of the tradition of Pell\u00e9as conducting caused controversy among critics who accused him of \"Wagnerising\" Debussy, to which Boulez responded that the work was indeed heavily influenced by Wagner's Parsifal. Boulez returned to conduct Pell\u00e9as in an acclaimed production by the German director Peter Stein for the Welsh National Opera in 1992. Modern productions have frequently re-imagined Maeterlinck's setting, often moving the time period to the present day or other time period; for instance, the 1985 Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon production set the opera during the Edwardian era. This production was considered a launching point for French baritone Fran\u00e7ois Le Roux, whom critics have called the \"finest Pell\u00e9as of his generation.\"In 1983, Marius Constant compiled a 20-minute \"Symphonie\" based on the opera."

        "content": "Pell\u00e9as was to be Debussy's only completed opera. For this reason it has sometimes been compared to Beethoven's Fidelio. As Hugh Macdonald writes: \"Both operas were much-loved only children of doting creators who put so much into their making that there could be no second child to follow after.\" This was not for want of trying on Debussy's part, and he worked hard to create a successor. Details of several opera projects survive. The most substantial surviving musical sketches are for two works based on short stories by Edgar Allan Poe: Le diable dans le beffroi and La chute de la maison Usher.\nDebussy also planned a version of Shakespeare's As You Like It with a libretto by Paul-Jean Toulet, but the poet's opium addiction meant he was too lazy to write the text. Two other projects suggest Debussy intended to challenge German composers on their own ground. Orph\u00e9e-Roi (King Orpheus) was to be a riposte to Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice which Debussy considered to \"treat only the anecdotal, lachrymose aspect of the subject\". But, according to Victor Lederer, for \"shock value, neither [As You Like It nor Orph\u00e9e] tops the Tristan project of 1907 [...] According to L\u00e9on Vallas, one of Debussy's early biographers, its 'episodic character... would have been related to the tales of chivalry, and diametrically opposed to the Germanic conception of Wagner.' That Debussy entertained, if only for a few weeks, the idea of writing an opera based on the Tristan legend is quite incredible. He knew Wagner's colossal Tristan und Isolde as well as anyone, and his confidence must have been great indeed if he felt up to treating the subject.\" However, nothing came of any of these schemes, partly because the rectal cancer which afflicted Debussy from 1909 meant that he found it increasingly hard to concentrate on sustained creative work. Pell\u00e9as would remain a unique opera."

In addition, several incidents, of which the Forest of Fontainebleau scene and auto-da-f\u00e9 were the most substantial, were borrowed from Eug\u00e8ne Cormon's 1846 play Philippe II, Roi d'Espagne. The opera is most often performed in Italian translation, usually under the title Don Carlo.\nThe opera's story is based on conflicts in the life of Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545\u20131568). Though he was betrothed to Elisabeth of Valois, part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551\u201359 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois demanded that she be married instead to his father Philip II of Spain. It was commissioned and produced by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Imp\u00e9rial de l'Op\u00e9ra (Paris Opera) and given its premiere at the Salle Le Peletier on 11 March 1867.\nThe first performance in Italian was given at Covent Garden in London in June 1867. The first performance in Italy was in Bologna in October 1867, also in Italian translation. After some revisions by Verdi, it was performed in Italian in Naples in November/December 1872. Verdi was also responsible for a short four-act \"Milan version\" in which the first act was removed and the ballet omitted (performed in Milan in January 1884 in Italian translation) but also apparently approved a five-act \"Modena version\" in which the first act was restored but the ballet still omitted (performed in Modena in December 1886, also in Italian translation). Around 1970, substantial passages of music cut before the premiere were discovered in Paris archives, giving rise to at least one additional version that can be ascribed to Verdi: the version he prepared for the Paris Opera in 1866, before any cuts were made. No other Verdi opera exists in so many authentic versions. At its full length (including the ballet and the cuts made before the first performance), it contains close to four hours of music and is Verdi's longest opera."

These were a duet for Elisabeth and Eboli in Act 4, Scene 1; a duet for Carlos and the King after the death of Posa in Act 4, Scene 2; and an exchange between Elisabeth and Eboli during the insurrection in the same scene.\nAfter the ballet had been composed, it emerged during the 1867 rehearsal period that, without further cuts, the opera would not finish before midnight (the time by which patrons would need to leave in order to catch the last trains to the Paris suburbs). Verdi then authorised some further cuts, which were, firstly, the introduction to Act 1 (with a chorus of woodcutters and their wives, and including the first appearance of Elisabeth); secondly, a short entry solo for Posa (J'\u00e9tais en Flandres) in Act 2, Scene 1; and, thirdly, part of the dialogue between the King and Posa at the end of Act 2, Scene 2.The opera was first published as given at the premi\u00e8re and consisted of Verdi's original conception, without the music of the above-named cuts, but with the ballet.\nIn 1969, at a Verdi congress in Verona, the American musicologist David Rosen presented the missing section from the Philip-Posa duet from the end of Act 2, which he had found folded down in the conductor's copy of the score. Other pages with cuts had simply been removed from the autograph score and the conductor's copy. Shortly thereafter, the British music critic Andrew Porter found most of these other cut passages could be reconstructed from the individual parts, in which the pages with the \"lost\" music had been either \"pasted, pinned or stitched down.\" In all, 21 minutes of missing music was restored. Nearly all of the known music Verdi composed for the opera, including the pre-premi\u00e8re cuts and later revisions, can be found in an integral edition prepared by the German musicologist Ursula G\u00fcnther, first published in 1980 and in a second, revised version in 1986."

The passionate elements of the opera are given warm and expressive music, while the score in general is marked by subtle harmonic colours and deft orchestration. Oriental colour is used in prayers, incantations, dances and the scene in the market.The act 2 aria \"O\u00f9 va la jeune Hindoue?\" (the Bell Song) has long been a favourite recital piece for coloratura sopranos. (Recordings of it in Italian, as \"Dov'\u00e8 l'indiana bruna?\", also exist.)\nIn recent years, the Flower Duet in act 1 has become familiar more widely because of its use in advertisements, in particular a British Airways commercial, as well as in films. The duet sung by Lakme and Mallika was adapted for the theme \"Aria on air\" for the British Airways \"face\" advertisements of the 1980s by music composers Yanni and Malcolm McLaren."

It is a two-act tragedy set in late 1940s Brooklyn told through a montage of memories, dreams, and arguments of the protagonist Willy Loman, a travelling salesman who is despondent with his life and appears to be slipping into senility. The play addresses a variety of themes, such as the American Dream, the anatomy of truth, and infidelity. It won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony Award for Best Play. It is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest plays of the 20th century. The play was selected as one of the best plays of 1948\u20131949, with an excerpted version published in The Burns Mantle Best Plays of 1948\u20131949.Since its premiere, the play has been revived on Broadway five times, winning three Tony Awards for Best Revival. It has been adapted for the cinema on ten occasions, including a 1951 version by screenwriter Stanley Roberts, starring Fredric March.

        "content": "The genesis of the play was a chance encounter between Miller and his uncle Manny Newman, a salesman, whom he met in 1947 in the lobby of a Boston theater that was playing All My Sons. Writing in a critical study of the play, author Brenda Murphy observed that Manny \"lodged in his imagination and created a dramatic problem that he felt compelled to solve.\"Miller later recounted that when he saw Manny at the theater, \"I could see the grim hotel room behind him, the long trip up from New York in his little car, the hopeless hope of the day's business.\" Without acknowledging Miller's greeting or congratulating him on the play, Manny said \"Buddy is doing very well.'\"  Buddy was Manny's son, and Manny saw Miller and his older brother as \"running neck and neck\" with his two sons \"in some race that never stopped in his mind.\" When visiting Manny as a youth, Miller felt \"gangling and unhandsome\" and usually heard \"some kind of insinuation of my entire life's probable failure.\" Seeing him again in Boston, Manny seemed to the playwright to be \"so absurd, so completely isolated from the ordinary laws of gravity, so elaborate in his fantastic inventions,\" yet so much in love with fame and fortune that \"he possessed my imagination.\" Manny died by suicide soon after, which was the cause of death of two other salesmen Miller had known. One of Manny's sons told Miller that Manny had always wanted to create a business for his two sons. Learning that transformed Manny, in Miller's mind, to \"a man with a purpose.\"  \nMiller had been thinking about a play about a salesman for years. He also had new interest in the simultaneousness of the past and present that was evident at their meeting, as it was plain that he and his cousins were viewed by Manny as they were when they were adolescents, many years earlier. Miller sought to \"do a play without any transitions at all, dialogue that would simply leap from bone to bone of a skeleton that would not for an instant cease being added to, an organism as strictly economic as a leaf, as trim as an ant.\"In creating Willy and the other characters, Miller also drew on his relationship with his father as well as another salesman. Miller was himself the model of the young Bernard."

        "content": "The play takes place in 1949. The setting is the Loman home in Brooklyn, located amidst a typical row of urban apartment buildings. \nWilly Loman suddenly returns home exhausted after a canceled business trip to Boston. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss, Howard, to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda about their son, Biff, who is 35 years old and has yet to do something with his life. Despite Biff having a promising football career in high school, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university.\nBiff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff's unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father's mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys' high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make an ambitious business proposition the next day.\nThe next day, Willy goes to Howard\u2019s office for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail. Howard refuses to give Willy a New York job, despite Willy's desperate pleas. Willy then loses his temper and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him that he needs a long rest and is no longer allowed to represent the Wagner Company. On the other hand, Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. In response Biff, feeling crushed, impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the business office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard, who is now a successful lawyer about to argue a case in front of the Supreme Court. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley then offers Willy a stable do-nothing job, but Willy vehemently refuses despite losing his job. Charley, who feels insulted, reluctantly gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay off his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is \"worth more dead than alive.\"\nHappy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear the bad news from Biff. Happy tries to coax Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Biff had come to Boston to ask Willy to convince Biff's teacher to curve Biff's failing math grade, so he could graduate. However, Willy was in the middle of an extramarital affair with a receptionist when Biff arrived unexpectedly, and saw the half-dressed woman with him. Biff did not accept his father's cover-up story for her presence, and angrily dismissed him as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set him adrift.\nBiff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy picked up, leaving a confused and upset Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into emotional conflict. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead wealthy brother Ben. In Willy's mind, Ben \"approves\" of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to take his own life in order to give Biff his life insurance money to help him start a business. Willy exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out. The car crashes and Willy dies. \nThe final scene takes place at Willy's funeral, which is attended only by his family, Charley and Bernard (who is the only character to not speak during the final scene). The ambiguities of mixed and unaddressed emotions persist, particularly over whether Willy's choices or circumstances were obsolete. At the funeral, Biff upholds his belief that he does not want to become a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, while Linda laments her husband's decision just before her final payment on the house."

He vacillates between different eras of his life throughout the play, and re-imagines them as if they were the present. Willy's age and deteriorating mental state make him appear childlike. His first name, Willy, reflects this childlike aspect as well as sounding like the question \"Will he?\"\nLinda Loman: Willy's loyal and loving wife. Linda is supportive and docile when Willy talks unrealistically about hopes for the future, although she seems to have a good knowledge of what is really going on. She chides her sons, particularly Biff, for not helping their father, and supports Willy even though Willy treats her poorly. She is the first to realize that Willy is contemplating suicide at the beginning of the play.\nBiff Loman: Willy's elder son. Biff was a football star with potential in high school, but failed math his senior year and dropped out of summer school when he saw Willy with another woman. He wavers between going home to try to fulfill Willy's dream for him as a businessman or ignoring his father by going West to be a farmhand where he feels happy. Biff steals because he wants evidence of success, even if it is false evidence.\nHarold \"Happy\" Loman: Willy's younger son. He has lived in the shadow of his older brother Biff, but he still tries to be supportive toward his family. He has a restless lifestyle as a womanizer and ambitions of career advancement. He takes bribes at work. He yearns approval from his parents, but he rarely gets any. He makes things up for attention, such as repeatedly telling his parents he is going to get married. His relationship with Linda is turbulent; she looks down on him for his lifestyle.\nCharley: Willy's wisecracking yet kind neighbor. He frequently lends Willy money and plays cards with him, although Willy treats him poorly. Willy is envious of him because his son is more successful than Willy's. Charley offers Willy a stable do-nothing job, but Willy declines every time.\nBernard: Charley's son. In Willy's flashbacks, he is a nerd, and Willy forces him to give Biff test answers. Later, he is a successful lawyer, married, and expecting a second son \u2013 the same successes that Willy wants for his sons.\nBen: Willy's deceased older brother, a diamond tycoon. Though long dead, Willy frequently \u201cspeaks\u201d to him in his hallucinations.

Willy worked originally for Howard's father Frank and claims to have suggested the name Howard for his newborn son.

Howard is extremely proud of his wealth, which is manifested in his new wire recorder, and of his family.\nJenny: Charley's secretary.\nStanley: A waiter at the restaurant who seems to be friends or acquainted with Happy.\nMiss Forsythe: A girl whom Happy picks up at the restaurant. She is attractive and claims to have had her picture on several magazine covers.

        "content": "Carmen (French: [ka\u0281m\u025bn] ) is an opera in four acts by the French composer Georges Bizet. The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy, based on the novella of the same title by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e. The opera was first performed by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalised its first audiences. Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years.  Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon; the \"Habanera\" from act 1 and the \"Toreador Song\" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.\nThe opera is written in the genre of op\u00e9ra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don Jos\u00e9, a na\u00efve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen. Jos\u00e9 abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous torero Escamillo, after which Jos\u00e9 kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.\nAfter the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883. Thereafter, it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of op\u00e9ra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.\nThe music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which the emotions and suffering of the  characters are represented. At his death Bizet was still in the midst of revising his score and because of other later changes (notably the introduction of recitatives composed by Ernest Guiraud in place of the original dialogue) there is still no definitive edition of the opera. The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations."

        "content": "In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital's two main state-funded opera houses\u2014the Op\u00e9ra and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique\u2014followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent. Bizet's professional relationship with L\u00e9on Carvalho, manager of the independent Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, Les p\u00eacheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera Djamileh opened at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances, it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy would provide the libretto. Hal\u00e9vy, who had written the text for Bizet's student opera Le docteur Miracle (1856), was a cousin of Bizet's wife, Genevi\u00e8ve; he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach's operettas.Bizet was delighted with the Op\u00e9ra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in \"the absolute certainty of having found my path\". The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Op\u00e9ra-Comique management; Adolphe de Leuven, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected. It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's novella Carmen. M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's story is a blend of travelogue and adventure yarn, possibly inspired by the writer's lengthy travels in Spain in 1830, and had originally been published in 1845 in the journal Revue des deux Mondes. It may have been influenced in part by Alexander Pushkin's 1824 poem \"The Gypsies\", a work M\u00e9rim\u00e9e had translated into French; it has also been suggested that the story was developed from an incident told to M\u00e9rim\u00e9e by his friend the Countess Montijo. Bizet may first have encountered the story during his Rome sojourn of 1858\u201360, since his journals record M\u00e9rim\u00e9e as one of the writers whose works he absorbed in those years."

        "content": "Herv\u00e9 Lacombe, in his survey of 19th-century French opera, contends that Carmen is one of the few works from that large repertory to have stood the test of time. While he places the opera firmly within the long op\u00e9ra comique tradition, Macdonald considers that it transcends the genre and that its immortality is assured by \"the combination in abundance of striking melody, deft harmony and perfectly judged orchestration\". Dean sees Bizet's principal achievement in the demonstration of the main actions of the opera in the music, rather than in the dialogue, writing that \"Few artists have expressed so vividly the torments inflicted by sexual passions and jealousy.\" Dean places Bizet's realism in a different category from the verismo of Puccini and others; he likens the composer to Mozart and Verdi in his ability to engage his audiences with the emotions and sufferings of his characters.\nBizet, who had never visited Spain, sought out appropriate ethnic material to provide an authentic Spanish flavour to his music. Carmen's habanera is based on an idiomatic song, \"El arreglito\", by the Spanish composer Sebasti\u00e1n Yradier (1809\u201365). Bizet had taken this to be a genuine folk melody; when he learned its recent origin he added a note to the vocal score, crediting Yradier. He used a genuine folksong as the source of Carmen's defiant \"Coupe-moi, br\u00fble-moi\" while other parts of the score, notably the \"Seguidilla\", utilise the rhythms and instrumentation associated with flamenco music. However, Dean insists that \"[t]his is a French, not a Spanish opera\"; the \"foreign bodies\", while they undoubtedly contribute to the unique atmosphere of the opera, form only a small ingredient of the complete music.\n\nThe prelude to act 1 combines three recurrent themes: the entry of the bullfighters from act 4, the refrain from the Toreador Song from act 2, and the motif that, in two slightly differing forms, represents both Carmen herself and the fate she personifies. This motif, played on clarinet, bassoon, cornet and cellos over tremolo strings, concludes the prelude with an abrupt crescendo. When the curtain rises a light and sunny atmosphere is soon established, and pervades the opening scenes. The mock solemnities of the changing of the guard, and the flirtatious exchanges between the townsfolk and the factory girls, precede a mood change when a brief phrase from the fate motif announces Carmen's entrance. After her provocative habanera, with its persistent insidious rhythm and changes of key, the fate motif sounds in full when Carmen throws her flower to Jos\u00e9 before departing. This action elicits from Jos\u00e9 a passionate A major solo which Dean suggests is the turning-point in his musical characterisation. The softer vein returns briefly, as Mica\u00ebla reappears and joins with Jos\u00e9 in a duet to a warm clarinet and strings accompaniment. The tranquillity is shattered by the women's noisy quarrel, Carmen's dramatic re-entry and her defiant interaction with Zuniga. After her beguiling \"Seguidilla\" provokes Jos\u00e9 to an exasperated high A sharp shout, Carmen's escape is preceded by the brief but disconcerting reprise of a fragment from the habanera. Bizet revised this finale several times to increase its dramatic effect.\n\nAct 2 begins with a short prelude, based on a melody that Jos\u00e9 will sing offstage before his next entry. A festive scene in the inn precedes Escamillo's tumultuous entrance, in which brass and percussion provide prominent backing while the crowd sings along. The quintet that follows is described by Newman as \"of incomparable verve and musical wit\". Jos\u00e9's appearance precipitates a long mutual wooing scene; Carmen sings, dances and plays the castanets; a distant cornet-call summoning Jos\u00e9 to duty is blended with Carmen's melody so as to be barely discernible. A muted reference to the fate motif on an English horn leads to Jos\u00e9's \"Flower Song\", a flowing continuous melody that ends pianissimo on a sustained high B-flat. Jos\u00e9's insistence that, despite Carmen's blandishments, he must return to duty leads to a quarrel; the arrival of Zuniga, the consequent fight and Jos\u00e9's unavoidable ensnarement into the lawless life culminates musically in the triumphant hymn to freedom that closes the act.\nThe prelude to act 3 was originally intended for Bizet's L'Arl\u00e9sienne score. Newman describes it as \"an exquisite miniature, with much dialoguing and intertwining between the woodwind instruments\". As the action unfolds, the tension between Carmen and Jos\u00e9 is evident in the music. In the card scene, the lively duet for Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s turns ominous when Carmen intervenes; the fate motif underlines her premonition of death. Mica\u00ebla's aria, after her entry in search of Jos\u00e9, is a conventional piece, though of deep feeling, preceded and concluded by horn calls. The middle part of the act is occupied by Escamillo and Jos\u00e9, now acknowledged as rivals for Carmen's favour. The music reflects their contrasting attitudes: Escamillo remains, says Newman, \"invincibly polite and ironic\", while Jos\u00e9 is sullen and aggressive. When Mica\u00ebla pleads with Jos\u00e9 to go with her to his mother, the harshness of Carmen's music reveals her most unsympathetic side. As Jos\u00e9 departs, vowing to return, the fate theme is heard briefly in the woodwind. The confident, off-stage sound of the departing Escamillo singing the toreador's refrain provides a distinct contrast to Jos\u00e9's increasing desperation.\nThe final act is prefaced with a lively orchestral piece derived from Manuel Garc\u00eda's short operetta El criado fingido. After the opening crowd scene, the bullfighters' march is led by the children's chorus; the crowd hails Escamillo before his short love scene with Carmen. The long finale, in which Jos\u00e9 makes his last pleas to Carmen and is decisively rejected, is punctuated at critical moments by enthusiastic off-stage shouts from the bullfighting arena. As Jos\u00e9 kills Carmen, the chorus sing the refrain of the Toreador Song off-stage; the fate motif, which has been suggestively present at various points during the act, is heard fortissimo, together with a brief reference to Carmen's card scene music. Jose's last words of love and despair are followed by a final long chord, on which the curtain falls without further musical or vocal comment."

Ferruccio Busoni's 1920 piece, Piano Sonatina No. 6 (Fantasia da camera super Carmen), is based on themes from Carmen. In 1967, the Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin adapted parts of the Carmen music into a ballet, the Carmen Suite, written for his wife Maya Plisetskaya, then the Bolshoi Ballet's principal ballerina.In 1983 the stage director Peter Brook produced an adaptation of Bizet's opera known as La Tragedie de Carmen in collaboration with the writer Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re and the composer Marius Constant. This 90-minute version focused on four main characters, eliminating choruses and the major arias were reworked for chamber orchestra. Brook first produced it in Paris, and it has since been performed in many cities.The character \"Carmen\" has been a regular subject of film treatment since the earliest days of cinema. The films were made in various languages and interpreted by several cultures, and have been created by prominent directors including Gerolamo Lo Savio (1909), Raoul Walsh (1915) with Theda Bara, Cecil B. DeMille (1915), and The Loves of Carmen (1948) with Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford, directed by Charles Vidor. Otto Preminger's 1954 Carmen Jones, with an all-black cast, is based on the 1943 Oscar Hammerstein Broadway musical of the same name, an adaptation of the opera transposed to 1940s North Carolina extending to Chicago. The Wild, Wild Rose is a 1960 Hong Kong film which adapts the plot and main character to the setting of a Wanchai nightclub, including striking renditions of some of the most famous songs by Grace Chang. Other adaptions include Carlos Saura (1983) (who made a flamenco-based dance film with two levels of story telling), Peter Brook (1983) (filming his compressed La Trag\u00e9die de Carmen) and Jean-Luc Godard (1984). Francesco Rosi's film of 1984, with Julia Migenes and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, is generally faithful to the original story and to Bizet's music. Carmen on Ice (1990), starring Katarina Witt, Brian Boitano and Brian Orser, was inspired by Witt's gold medal-winning performance during the 1988 Winter Olympics. Robert Townsend's 2001 film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, is a more recent attempt to create an African-American version. Carmen was interpreted in modern ballet by the South African dancer and choreographer Dada Masilo in 2010.The opera has been adapted at least twice in African films, as Karmen Ge\u00ef, directed by Joseph Ga\u00ef Ramaka in 2001, and U-Carmen eKhayelitsha, directed by Mark Dornford-May in 2005, and achieving the Golden Bear award of the Berlinale that year."

Forster had admired Britten's music since 1937 when he attended a performance of the play The Ascent of F6 (for which Britten wrote incidental music). Forster met Britten in October 1942, when he heard Peter Pears and Britten perform Britten's Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo at the National Gallery.  In 1948, Britten and Forster discussed whether Forster might write an opera libretto. They agreed on Billy Budd as a work to be adapted into an opera, with a formal meeting in January 1949 to discuss the project.  Forster worked with Eric Crozier, a regular Britten collaborator, to write the libretto.  Scholar Hanna Rochlitz has studied the adaptation and collaboration in detail.While Britten was composing the music, the Italian composer Giorgio Federico Ghedini premiered his one-act operatic setting of Billy Budd at the 1949 Venice International Festival. This disturbed Britten, but Ghedini's opera gained little notice.\nBritten originally intended the title role for Geraint Evans, who prepared it but withdrew because it lay too high for his voice. Britten chose Theodor Uppman to replace him, and Evans sang a different role, that of Mr Flint."

Critical reaction to the premiere, according to a December 1951 New York Times article, was \"a very good press and a very fair one, enthusiastic if not really ecstatic\".Billy Budd received its United States premi\u00e8re in 1952 in performances by Indiana University Opera Company.  In 1952, NBC television presented a condensed version of the opera.   Performances of the original version fell off in number in the subsequent years.  The original four-act version has been occasionally revived, such as at the Vienna State Opera in 2001 and 2011.\nIn 1960, Britten revised the score into a two-act version, in preparation for a BBC broadcast. Vere's first appearance after the prologue had been originally the Captain's Muster, in which he addresses the crew at the end of Act 1; Britten cut this, explaining to his librettist Eric Crozier that he had never been happy with that scene, so making Vere's first appearance on the ship a private moment alone in his cabin. Britten changed some of the structural balance from the contrasting Acts 3 and 4. The first performance of the revised two-act version was on 9 January 1964 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, conducted by Georg Solti. The 1966 BBC Television broadcast was conducted by Charles Mackerras, with Peter Glossop (baritone) as Billy, Peter Pears as Vere, and Michael Langdon as Claggart. The 1967 Decca studio recording was made of the two-act version; the recording sessions were attended by staff from the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\nThe first USA performance of the revised two-act edition was on 4 January 1966 by the American Opera Society.  The opera was produced in November 1970 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, with Uppman reprising the title role, Richard Lewis as Vere, Geraint Evans as Claggart, Bruce Yarnell as Redburn, Raymond Michalski as Flint, and Arnold Voketaitis as Ratcliffe.\nThe Metropolitan Opera first staged Billy Budd in 1978.Glyndebourne Festival Opera first staged the opera in 2010, in the operatic directorial debut of Michael Grandage; the production was revived in 2013.A new performing edition of the work, with a revised orchestration by Steuart Bedford, premiered at Des Moines Metro Opera on 1 July 2017.Baritones who have sung the role of Billy Budd include Sir Thomas Allen, Sir Simon Keenlyside, Richard Stilwell, Dale Duesing, Nathan Gunn, Rod Gilfry, Bo Skovhus, Thomas Hampson, Teddy Tahu Rhodes, Peter Mattei, Jacques Imbrailo and Liam Bonner. Notable Veres have included Peter Pears, Richard Cassilly, Philip Langridge, Anthony Rolfe Johnson, and John Mark Ainsley.\nSeveral academic studies investigate various thematic undertones in the opera, including homosexuality and salvation."

        "content": "The Miss Firecracker Contest was originally produced in Los Angeles in 1980 and eventually produced on Broadway. Critics, eager to peg The Miss Firecracker Contest as a feminist play that satirizes beauty pageants, were sorely disappointed when Carnelle did not conform to the role of a strong female willing to discard the importance of the beauty pageant, but instead remains loyally intrigued by the concept of beauty and its power in her world. Others recognized this obsession with beauty and denounced the play as antifeminist, but the fact that Carnelle loses the contest and wins some self-confidence downplays the importance of the beauty contest and focuses on personal relationships as being Carnelle's redeeming quality. Beth Henley commented that she never meant to make a statement supporting feminism by including a beauty pageant in her play; instead, the central plot point revolves around wanting to belong to the world in general, a beauty pageant was simply an opportunity for Carnelle to show this world her self-worth.Beth Henley has been consistently praised for her insight into the female mind and for mixing tragedy and comedy so smoothly that her audiences leave feeling optimistic despite the depressing situations in which Henley's characters find themselves. Henley's trademark finale is a scene that offers hope to her central female character through her relationships with other characters, and the audience clearly sees this as Carnelle happily climbs up to the roof to watch the final fireworks. Beth Henley helped make a name for herself with this play by incorporating grotesque Southern humor with female struggles. The focus on the dysfunctional Southern family while producing a positive message about self-confidence, courage, perseverance, and compassion pleased critics, who praised Henley for her quirky characters and warm messages. The play's popularity allowed for the production of Miss Firecracker, the film version of this play, which was produced in 1989 directed by Thomas Schlamme and starring Holly Hunter. Hunter has been cast in many of Henley's plays in addition to The Miss Firecracker Contest.\n\n\n== References =="

You see, when I was a child I lived in Italy, and in Italy we have no Santa Claus. I suppose that Santa Claus is much too busy with American children to be able to handle Italian children as well. Our gifts were brought to us by the Three Kings, instead.\nI actually never met the Three Kings\u2014it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night to catch a glimpse of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.\nMy favorite king was King Melchior, because he was the oldest and had a long white beard. My brother's favorite was King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was a little crazy and quite deaf. I don't know why he was so positive about his being deaf. I suspect it was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.\nTo these Three Kings I mainly owe the happy Christmas seasons of my childhood and I should have remained very grateful to them. Instead, I came to America and soon forgot all about them, for here at Christmas time one sees so many Santa Clauses scattered all over town. Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television\u2014and all these things made me forget the three dear old Kings of my old childhood.\nBut in 1951 I found myself in serious difficulty. I had been commissioned by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to stop in front of the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.\nI am often asked how I went about writing an opera for television, and what are the specific problems that I had to face in planning a work for such a medium. I must confess that in writing  \"Amahl and the Night Visitors,\" I hardly thought of television at all. As a matter of fact, all my operas are originally conceived for an ideal stage which has no equivalent in reality, and I believe that such is the case with most dramatic authors. \u2014Gian-Carlo Menotti"

He is sitting outside playing his shepherd's pipe when his mother calls for him (\"Amahl! Amahl!\"). After much persuasion, he enters the house but his mother does not believe him when he tells her there is an amazing star \"as big as a window\" outside over their roof (\"O Mother You Should Go Out and See\"; \"Stop Bothering Me!\").\nLater that night, Amahl's mother weeps, praying that Amahl not become a beggar (\"Don't Cry Mother Dear\"). After bedtime (\"From Far Away We Come\"), there is a knock at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is (\"Amahl ... Yes Mother!\"). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she goes to the door to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees (\"Good Evening!\"; \"Come In!\"), saying that all she can offer is \"a cold fireplace and a bed of straw\". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy (\"Are You a Real King?\"; \"This is My Box\"). The mother returns (\"Amahl, I Told You Not to Be a Nuisance!\"). He defends himself, saying \"They kept asking me questions,\" when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors (\"All These Beautiful Things\"; \"Have You Seen a Child?\") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly (\"Shepherds! Shepherds!\"; \"Emily! Emily\"; \"Olives and Quinces\"; \"Dance of the Shepherds\").\nAfter the neighbors have left and the kings are resting, the mother attempts to steal for her son some of the kings' gold that was meant for the Christ Child (\"All That Gold\"). She is thwarted by the kings' page (\"Thief! Thief!\"). When Amahl wakes to find the page grabbing his mother, he attacks him (\"Don't You Dare!\"). Seeing Amahl's defense of his mother and understanding the motives for the attempted theft, King Melchior says she may keep the gold as the Holy Child will not need earthly power or wealth to build his kingdom (\"Oh, Woman, You Can Keep That Gold\"). The mother says she has waited all her life for such a king and asks the kings to take back the gold. She wishes to send a gift but has nothing to send. Amahl, too, has nothing to give the Child except his crutch (\"Oh, No, Wait\"). When he offers it to the kings, his leg is miraculously healed (\"I Walk, Mother\"). With permission from his mother, he leaves with the kings to see the Child and give his crutch in thanks for being healed."

There had already been several television productions of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol since about 1947, but they had not been shown annually or presented by the same television network, with the same general technical staff, as Amahl was. Until 1963, Amahl was nearly always presented with many of the same singers and production staff. From 1951 until 1966 it was presented every year on NBC (which commissioned Menotti to write it) on or around Christmas Eve, as an episode of an existing anthology series, such as The Alcoa Hour, NBC Television Opera, or the Hallmark Hall of Fame. The 1978 production of Amahl also premiered on NBC, before it went to cable television in the early 1980s.\nA film based on Amahl,  Amahl and the Night Visitors, was made in Britain in 1996 by Christine Edzard."

        "content": "Norma (Italian: [\u02c8n\u0254rma]) is a tragedia lirica or opera in two acts by Vincenzo Bellini with libretto by Felice Romani after the play Norma, ou L'infanticide (Norma, or The Infanticide) by Alexandre Soumet. It was first produced at La Scala in Milan on 26 December 1831.\nThe opera is regarded as a leading example of the bel canto genre, and the soprano prayer \"Casta diva\" in Act 1 is a famous piece. Among the well known singers of Norma of the first half of the 20th century was Rosa Ponselle who played the role in New York and London. Notable exponents of the title role in the post-war period have been Maria Callas, Leyla Gencer, Joan Sutherland, and Montserrat Caball\u00e9."

        "content": "Crivelli and Company were managing both La Scala and La Fenice in Venice, and as a result, in April\u2013May 1830 Bellini was able to negotiate a contract with them for two operas, one at each theatre. The opera for December 1831 at La Scala became Norma, while the one for the 1832 Carnival season at La Fenice became Beatrice di Tenda.With Bellini's La sonnambula successfully staged in March 1831 and Giuditta Pasta having demonstrated her extensive vocal and dramatic ranges in creating the role of Amina, the Swiss village maiden, she had been engaged by La Scala for her debut during the following season. Bellini and Romani then began to consider the subject of the coming autumn's opera. By the summer, they had decided to base it on Alexandre Soumet's play which was being performed in Paris at around that time and which Pasta would have seen.\nFor the forthcoming autumn/winter season, La Scala had engaged Giulia Grisi (the sister of Giuditta Grisi) and the well-known tenor Domenico Donzelli, who had made a name for himself with Rossini roles, especially that of Otello. They would fill the roles of Adalgisa and Pollione. Donzelli provided Bellini with precise details of his vocal capabilities which were confirmed by a report which the Neapolitan composer Saverio Mercadante also provided. By the end of August it appears that Romani had completed a considerable amount of the libretto, enough at least to allow Bellini to begin work, which he certainly did in the first weeks of September as the verses were supplied. He reported in a letter to Pasta on 1 September:\n\nI hope that you will find this subject to your liking. Romani believes it to be very effective, and precisely because of the all-inclusive character for you, which is that of Norma. He will manipulate the situations so that they will not resemble other subjects at all, and he will retouch, even change, the characters to produce more effect, if need be.\nNorma was completed by about the end of November. While, for Romani, it became \"the most beautiful rose in the garland\" of all his work with Bellini, it was not achieved without some struggles. Bellini, now at the height of his powers, was very demanding of his librettist and required many re-writes before he was satisfied enough to set it to music."

        "content": "The title role\u2014\"one of the most taxing and wide-ranging parts in the entire repertory\"\u2014is one of the most difficult in the soprano repertoire. It calls for great vocal control of range, flexibility, and dynamics as well as containing a wide range of emotions: conflict of personal and public life, romantic life, maternal love, friendship, jealousy, murderous intent, and resignation. The German soprano Lilli Lehmann once remarked that the singing of all three Br\u00fcnnhilde roles of Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen in one evening would be less stressful than the singing of one Norma. She also commented \"When you sing Wagner, you are so carried away by the dramatic emotion, the action, and the scene that you do not have to think how to sing the words. That comes of itself. But in Bellini, you must always have a care for beauty of tone and correct emission.\" According to the Met Opera Archives, Lehmann said this to Herald Tribune critic Henry Krehbiel.\nThroughout the 20th century, many singers have tackled the role of Norma. In the early 1920s, it was Rosa Raisa, Claudia Muzio, and Rosa Ponselle who were each admired. Maria Callas emerged as a major force in the role in the post-World War II period. She made two studio recordings of the opera for EMI/HMV, and several broadcasts of her live performances have been preserved from the early 1950s through her final performances of the role in Paris in May 1965.\nIn the 1960s, two very different performers sang the role: the Australian Dame Joan Sutherland and the Turkish Leyla Gencer. Following Sutherland's 1963 debut as Norma, Luciano Pavarotti called her \"the greatest female voice of all time.\"The Dutch coloratura Cristina Deutekom tackled the role in 1970. Throughout the decade, four other bel canto specialists debuted their Normas: Radmila Bako\u010devi\u0107, Montserrat Caball\u00e9, Beverly Sills, and Renata Scotto. Also singing Norma during this period were Grace Bumbry and Shirley Verrett, the American divas who began as mezzo-sopranos and eventually started singing soprano repertoire.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the role of Norma was performed by such diverse singers as Katia Ricciarelli, Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Marisa Galvany, Dame Gwyneth Jones, and Jane Eaglen. Other Normas include Hasmik Papian, Fiorenza Cedolins, Galina Gorchakova, Maria Guleghina, Nelly Miricioiu, June Anderson, Edita Gruberov\u00e1 and Carmela Remigio (who performs more frequently the role of Adalgisa).In 2008, Daniela Dess\u00ec performed as Norma at Teatro Comunale di Bologna. In 2010 (in Dortmund) and 2013 (at the Salzburg Festival) the role was taken by mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli: this version was also recorded with coloratura soprano Sumi Jo as Adalgisa. In 2011, Sondra Radvanovsky also added the role to her repertory, one to which she returned in the autumn 2014 at the San Francisco Opera and in the autumn of 2017 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. On 13 April 2013, the Italian bel canto soprano, Mariella Devia, after a career of 40 years and one day after turning 65, successfully made her debut as Norma at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna.Angela Meade has played the role often, including in 2013 and 2017 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York."

The background is the uprising of the Gallic people against the Roman occupiers, led by the Druid Oroveso.\nNorma, the high priestess of the Druid temple, who had two children by Pollione, the Roman proconsul of Gaul, breaking her Druid chastity vows, discovers that her lover is now in love with her friend, the young Druid priestess Adalgisa. Norma tries to convince Pollione to give up Adalgisa and return to her, but he refuses. Norma publicly confesses her fault and is sentenced to death by fire. Pollione is moved by Norma\u2019s self-sacrifice and joins her at the stake."

        "content": "It was Giuseppe Verdi who\u2014late in his life\u2014made some perceptive comments in a letter of May 1898 to Camille Belaigue, who had recently published a book on Bellini. In the letter, Verdi states:\n\nBellini is poor, it is true, in harmony and instrumentation; but rich in feeling and in an individual melancholy of his own! Even in the least well-known of his operas, in La straniera, in Il pirata, there are long, long, long melodies such as no-one before him had produced. And what truth and power of declamation, as for example in the duet between Pollione and Norma! [See act 2, scene 3 above. Norma: \"In mia man alfin tu sei\" / \"At last you are in my hands\"] And what elation of thought in the first phrase of the introduction [to the duet] ... no-one ever has created another more beautiful and heavenly.\nCommenting on the overall quality of the music in Norma, David Kimbell states that \"Bellini's most astonishing achievement in Norma is, amid all the more obvious excitements of musical Romanticism, to have asserted his belief that the true magic of opera depended on a kind of incantation in which dramatic poetry and song are perfectly fused.\" Additionally, Kimbell provides examples of how the composer's art is revealed in this opera, but also noting that the ability to achieve a \"fusion of music and dramatic meaning is to be found elsewhere in Bellini's work\"."

        "content": "Schopenhauer claimed that tragedy causes the spectator to lose the will to live. \"The horrors on the stage hold up to him the bitterness and worthlessness of life, and so the vanity of all its efforts and endeavors. The effect of this impression must be that he becomes aware, although only in an obscure feeling, that it is better to tear his heart away from life, to turn his willing away from it, not to love the world and life.\" He praised Norma for its artistic excellence in producing this effect. \"\u2026[T]he genuinely tragic effect of the catastrophe, the hero's resignation and spiritual exaltation produced by it, seldom appear so purely motivated and distinctly expressed as in the opera Norma, where it comes in the duet \"Qual cor tradisti, qual cor perdesti\" [What a heart you betrayed, what a heart you lost]. Here the conversion of the will is clearly indicated by the quietness suddenly introduced into the music. Quite apart from its excellent music, and from the diction that can only be that of a libretto, and considered only according to its motives and to its interior economy, this piece is in general a tragedy of extreme perfection, a true model of the tragic disposition of the motives, of the tragic progress of the action, and of tragic development, together with the effect of these on the frame of mind of the heroes, which surmounts the world. This effect then passes on to the spectator.\""
