        "content": "Pepsi was first introduced as \"Brad's Drink\" in New Bern, North Carolina, United States, in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore where the drink was sold. It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, \"Pepsi\" because it was advertised to relieve dyspepsia (today more commonly known as indigestion or an upset stomach) and \"Cola\" referring to the cola flavor. Some have also suggested that \"Pepsi\" may have been a reference to the drink aiding digestion like the digestive enzyme pepsin, but pepsin itself was never used as an ingredient to Pepsi-Cola. The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla. Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy. In 1903, Bradham moved the bottling of Pepsi from his drugstore to a rented warehouse. That year, Bradham sold 7,968 gallons of syrup. The next year, Pepsi was sold in six-ounce bottles, and sales increased to 19,848 gallons. In 1909, automobile race pioneer Barney Oldfield was the first celebrity to endorse Pepsi, describing it as \"A bully drink...refreshing, invigorating, a fine bracer before a race.\" The advertising theme \"Delicious and Healthful\" was then used over the next two decades. In 1923, the Pepsi-Cola Company entered bankruptcy\u2014in large part due to financial losses incurred by speculating on the wildly fluctuating sugar prices as a result of World War I. Assets were sold and Roy C. Megargel bought the Pepsi trademark. Megargel was unsuccessful in efforts to find funding to revive the brand and soon Pepsi-Cola's assets were purchased by Charles Guth, the president of Loft, Inc. Loft was a candy manufacturer with retail stores that contained soda fountains. He sought to replace Coca-Cola at his stores' fountains after the Coca-Cola Company refused to give him additional discounts on syrup. Guth then had Loft's chemists reformulate the Pepsi-Cola syrup formula. On three occasions between 1922 and 1933, the Coca-Cola Company was offered the opportunity to purchase the Pepsi-Cola Company, which it declined on each occasion."

        "content": "During the Great Depression, Pepsi gained popularity following the introduction in 1934 of a 12-ounce bottle. Prior to that, Pepsi and Coca-Cola sold their drinks in 6.5-ounce servings for about $0.05 a bottle.  With a radio advertising campaign featuring the popular jingle \"Nickel, Nickel\" \u2013 first recorded by the Tune Twisters in 1940 \u2013 Pepsi encouraged price-conscious consumers to double the volume their nickels could purchase. The jingle is arranged in a way that loops, creating a never-ending tune:\"Pepsi-Cola hits the spot / Twelve full ounces, that's a lot / Twice as much for a nickel, too / Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you.\"Coming at a time of economic crisis, the campaign succeeded in boosting Pepsi's status. From 1936 to 1938, Pepsi-Cola's profits doubled. Pepsi's success under Guth came while the Loft Candy business was faltering. Since he had initially used Loft's finances and facilities to establish the new Pepsi success, the near-bankrupt Loft Company sued Guth for possession of the Pepsi-Cola company. A long legal battle, Guth v. Loft, then ensued, with the case reaching the Delaware Supreme Court and ultimately ending in a loss for Guth."

        "content": "From the 1930s through the late 1950s, \"Pepsi-Cola Hits The Spot\" was the most commonly used slogan in the days of old-time radio, classic motion pictures and early days of television. Its jingle (conceived in the days when Pepsi cost only five cents) was used in many different forms with different lyrics. With the rise of radio, Pepsi-Cola utilized the services of a young, up-and-coming actress named Polly Bergen to promote products, oftentimes, lending her singing talents to the classic \"...Hits The Spot\" jingle. Film actress Joan Crawford, after marrying Pepsi-Cola president Alfred N. Steele became a spokesperson for Pepsi, appearing in commercials, television specials, and televised beauty pageants on behalf of the company. Crawford also had images of the soft drink placed prominently in several of her later films. When Steele died in 1959, Crawford was appointed to the Board of Directors of Pepsi-Cola, a position she held until 1973, although she was not a board member of the larger PepsiCo, created in 1965. Pepsi has been featured in several films, including Back to the Future (1985), Home Alone (1990), Wayne's World (1992), Fight Club (1999), and World War Z (2013). In 1992, the Pepsi Number Fever marketing campaign in the Philippines accidentally distributed 800,000 winning bottle caps for a 1 million peso grand prize, leading to riots and the deaths of five people. In 1996, PepsiCo launched the highly successful Pepsi Stuff marketing strategy. \"Project Blue\" was launched in several international markets outside the United States in April. The launch included extravagant publicity stunts, such as a Concorde airplane painted in blue colors (which was owned by Air France) and a banner on the Mir space station. The Project Blue design was first tested in the United States in June 1997, and was released worldwide in 1998 to celebrate Pepsi's 100th anniversary. It was at this point, the logo began to be referred to as the Pepsi Globe. In October 2008, Pepsi announced that it would redesign its logo and re-brand many of its products by early 2009. In 2009, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Pepsi Max began using all lower-case fonts for name brands. The brand's blue and red globe trademark became a series of \"smiles,\" with the central white band arcing at different angles depending on the product until 2010. Pepsi released this logo in U.S. in late 2008, and later it was released in 2009 in Canada (the first country outside of the United States for Pepsi's new logo), Brazil, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Panama, Chile, Dominican Republic, the Philippines, and Australia. In the rest of the world, the new logo was released in 2010. The old logo is still used in several international markets, and has been phased out most recently in France and Mexico."

        "content": "Walter Mack was named the new president of Pepsi-Cola and guided the company through the 1940s. Mack, who supported progressive causes, noticed that the company's strategy of using advertising for a general audience either ignored African Americans or used ethnic stereotypes in portraying blacks. Up until the 1940s, the full revenue potential of what was called \"the Negro market\" was largely ignored by white-owned manufacturers in the U.S. Mack realized that blacks were an untapped niche market and that Pepsi stood to gain market share by targeting its advertising directly towards them. To this end, he hired Hennan Smith, an advertising executive \"from the Negro newspaper field\" to lead an all-black sales team, which had to be cut due to the onset of World War II. In 1947, Walter Mack resumed his efforts, hiring Edward F. Boyd to lead a twelve-man team. They came up with advertising portraying black Americans in a positive light, such as one with a smiling mother holding a six pack of Pepsi while her son (a young Ron Brown, who grew up to be Secretary of Commerce) reaches up for one. Another ad campaign, titled \"Leaders in Their Fields\", profiled twenty prominent African Americans such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Ralph Bunche and photographer Gordon Parks. Boyd also led a sales team composed entirely of blacks around the country to promote Pepsi. Racial segregation and Jim Crow laws were still in place throughout much of the U.S.; Boyd's team faced a great deal of discrimination as a result, from insults by Pepsi co-workers to threats by the Ku Klux Klan. On the other hand, it was able to use its anti-racism stance as a selling point, attacking Coke's reluctance to hire blacks and support by the chairman of the Coca-Cola Company for segregationist governor of Georgia Herman Talmadge. As a result, Pepsi's market share as compared to Coca-Cola's shot up dramatically in the 1950s with African American soft-drink consumers three times more likely to purchase Pepsi over Coke. After the sales team visited Chicago, Pepsi's share in the city overtook that of Coke for the first time. Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s. The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, ladies groups, schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to promote Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion. Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted Aunt Jemimas and Uncle Bens, whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead, it portrayed black customers as self-confident middle-class citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size. This focus on the market for black people caused some consternation within the company and among its affiliates. It did not want to seem focused on black customers for fear white customers would be pushed away. In a national meeting, Mack tried to assuage the 500 bottlers in attendance by pandering to them, saying \"We don't want it to become known as a nigger drink.\" After Mack left the company in 1950, support for the black sales team faded and it was cut. Boyd was replaced in 1952 by Harvey C. Russell Jr., who was notable for his marketing campaigns towards black youth in New Orleans. These campaigns, held at locales attended largely by black children, would encourage children to collect Pepsi bottle caps, which they could then exchange for rewards. One example is Pepsi's 1954 \"Pepsi Day at the Beach\" event, where New Orleans children could ride rides at an amusement park in exchange for Pepsi bottle caps. By the end of the event, 125,000 bottle caps been collected. According to The Pepsi Cola World, the New Orleans campaign was a success; once people's supply of bottle caps ran out, the only way they could get more was to buy more Pepsi."

        "title": "Pepsi_Rivalry with Coca-Cola",
        "content": "According to Consumer Reports, in the 1970s, the rivalry continued to heat up the market. Pepsi conducted blind taste tests in stores, in what was called the \"Pepsi Challenge\". These tests suggested that more consumers preferred the taste of Pepsi to Coca-Cola. The sales of Pepsi started to climb, and Pepsi kicked off the \"Challenge\" across the nation. This became known as the \"Cola Wars\". In 1985, the Coca-Cola Company, amid much publicity, changed its formula. The theory has been advanced that New Coke, as the reformulated drink came to be known, was invented specifically in response to the Pepsi Challenge. However, a consumer backlash led to Coca-Cola quickly reintroducing the original formula as \"Coca-Cola Classic\". In 1989, Billy Joel mentioned the rivalry between the two companies in the song \"We Didn't Start the Fire\". The line \"Rock & Roller Cola Wars\" refers to Pepsi and Coke's usage of various musicians in advertising campaigns. Coke used Paula Abdul, while Pepsi used Michael Jackson. Both companies then competed to get other musicians to advertise its beverages. According to Beverage Digests 2008 report on carbonated soft drinks, PepsiCo's U.S. market share is 30.8 percent, while the Coca-Cola Company's is 42.7 percent. Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi in most parts of the U.S., notable exceptions being central Appalachia, North Dakota, and Utah. In the city of Buffalo, New York, Pepsi outsells Coca-Cola by a two-to-one margin. Overall, Coca-Cola continues to outsell Pepsi in almost all areas of the world. However, exceptions include: Oman, India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, and Northern Ontario. Pepsi had long been the drink of French-Canadians, and it continues to hold its dominance by relying on local Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois celebrities (especially Claude Meunier, of La Petite Vie fame) to sell its product. PepsiCo introduced the Quebec slogan \"here, it's Pepsi\" (Ici, c'est Pepsi) in response to Coca-Cola ads proclaiming \"Around the world, it's Coke\" (Partout dans le monde, c'est Coke). As of 2012, Pepsi is the third most popular carbonated drink in India, with a 15% market share, behind Sprite and Thums Up. In comparison, Coca-Cola is the fourth most popular carbonated drink, occupying a mere 8.8% of the Indian market share. By most accounts, Coca-Cola was India's leading soft drink until 1977, when it left India because of the new foreign exchange laws which mandated majority shareholding in companies to be held by Indian shareholders. The Coca-Cola Company was unwilling to dilute its stake in its Indian unit as required by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), thus sharing its formula with an entity in which it did not have majority shareholding. In 1988, PepsiCo gained entry to India by creating a joint venture with the Punjab government-owned Punjab Agro Industrial Corporation (PAIC) and Voltas India Limited. This joint venture marketed and sold Lehar Pepsi until 1991, when the use of foreign brands was allowed; PepsiCo bought out its partners and ended the joint venture in 1994. In 1993, the Coca-Cola Company returned in pursuance of India's Liberalization policy. In Russia, Pepsi initially had a larger market share than Coke, but it was undercut once the Cold War ended. In 1972, PepsiCo struck a barter agreement with the then government of the Soviet Union, in which PepsiCo was granted exportation and Western marketing rights to Stolichnaya vodka in exchange for importation and Soviet marketing of Pepsi. This exchange led to Pepsi being the first foreign product sanctioned for sale in the Soviet Union. Reminiscent of the way that Coca-Cola became a cultural icon and its global spread spawned words like \"cocacolonization\", Pepsi-Cola and its relation to the Soviet system turned it into an icon. In the early 1990s, the term \"Pepsi-stroika\" began appearing as a pun on \"perestroika\", the reform policy of the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev. Critics viewed the policy as an attempt to usher in Western products in deals there with the old elites. Pepsi, as one of the first American products in the Soviet Union, became a symbol of that relationship and the Soviet policy. This was reflected in Russian author Victor Pelevin's book \"Generation P\". In 1992, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Coca-Cola was introduced to the Russian market. As it came to be associated with the new system and Pepsi with the old, Coca-Cola rapidly captured a significant market share that might otherwise have required years to achieve. By July 2005, Coca-Cola enjoyed a market share of 19.4 percent, followed by Pepsi with 13 percent. Pepsi was introduced in Romania in 1966, during the early liberalization policies of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, opening up a factory at Constan\u021ba in 1967. This was done as a barter agreement similar to the one in the USSR, however, Romanian wine would be sold in the United States instead. The product quickly became popular, especially among young people, but due to the austerity measures imposed in the 1980s, the product became scarce and rare to find. Starting from 1991, PepsiCo entered the new Romanian market economy, and still maintains a bigger popularity than its competitor, Coca-Cola, introduced in Romania in 1992, despite heavy competition during the 1990s (sometime between 2000 and 2005, Pepsi overtook Coca-Cola in sales in Romania). Pepsi did not sell soft drinks in Israel until 1991. Many Israelis and some American Jewish organizations attributed Pepsi's previous reluctance to expand operations in Israel to fears of an Arab boycott. Pepsi, which has a large and lucrative business in the Arab world, denied that, saying that economic, rather than political, reasons kept it out of Israel."

Pepsiman took on three different outfits, each one representing the current style of the Pepsi can in distribution. Twelve commercials were created featuring the character. His role in the advertisements is to appear with Pepsi to thirsty people or people craving soda. Pepsiman happens to appear at just the right time with the product. After delivering the beverage, sometimes Pepsiman would encounter a difficult and action-oriented situation which would result in injury. Pepsiman is mostly silent, and he has no face except for a hole that opens up whenever he delivers a Pepsi. Another more minor mascot, Pepsiwoman, also featured in a few of her own commercials for Pepsi Twist; her appearance is basically a female Pepsiman wearing a lemon-shaped balaclava. In 1994, Sega-AM2 released the Sega Saturn version of its arcade fighting game Fighting Vipers. In this game, Pepsiman was included as a special character, with his specialty listed as being the ability to \"quench one's thirst.\" He does not appear in any other version or sequel. In 1999, KID developed a video game for the PlayStation entitled Pepsiman. As the titular character, the player runs \"on rails\" (forced motion on a scrolling linear path), skateboards, rolls, and stumbles through various areas, avoiding dangers and collecting cans of Pepsi, all while trying to reach a thirsty person as in the commercials."

The shiny coat of the breed led to their nickname, \"Golden Horses\".  These horses are adapted to severe climatic conditions and are thought to be one of the oldest existing horse breeds. There are currently about 6,600 Akhal-Tekes in the world, mostly in Turkmenistan, although they are also found throughout Europe and North America. Akhal is  the name of the line of oases along the north slope of the Kopet Dag mountains in Turkmenistan. It has been inhabited by the Tekke tribe of Turkmens. There are several theories regarding the original ancestry of the Akhal-Teke, some dating back thousands of years.  The Akhal Teke is probably a descendant of an older breed known as the Turkoman horse, and some claim it is the same breed.  The tribes of Turkmenistan selectively bred the horses, recording their pedigrees orally and using them for raiding. The breed was used in the losing fight against the Russian Empire and was subsumed into the Empire along with its country. The Turkoman has influenced many other breeds, including modern warmbloods, and recent research confirms that Turkoman stallions made significant contributions to the development of the Thoroughbred. However, there also exists the possibility that all Akhal-Tekes today have a Thoroughbred sire line. The studbook was closed in 1932. The Soviet Union printed the first breed registry in 1941, including over 700 horses."

These horses are well known for those individuals who have a golden buckskin or palomino color, a result of the cream gene, a dilution gene that also produces the perlino and cremello colors. A number of other colors are recognized, including bay, black, chestnut,  and grey.  Aficionados of the breed claim that the color pattern served as camouflage in the desert.  Many Akhal-Tekes have a natural metallic sheen to their coat, particularly noticeable in those with cream gene colors. The Akhal-Teke has a refined head with predominantly a straight or slightly convex profile, and long ears. It can also have almond-shaped or \"hooded\" eyes.  The mane and tail are usually sparse. The long back is lightly muscled, and is coupled to a flat croup and long, upright neck. The Akhal-Teke possess sloping shoulders and thin skin. The breed is tough and resilient, having adapted to the harshness of Turkmenistan lands, where horses must live without much food or water. This has also made the horses good for sport. The breed is known for its endurance, as shown in 1935 when a group of Turkmen riders rode the  from Ashgabat to Moscow in 84 days, including a three-day crossing of  of desert without water. The Akhal-Teke is also known for its form and grace as a show jumper. The quality of the Akhal-Teke horses are determined by the studbook manager. Depending on type, conformation, pedigree, quality of offspring and achievement in sport, the horses are designated as either Elite or Class I or Class II. There are usually 2 annual grading events in Moscow, Russia called the \"International Sport Meeting and World Championship \u201cHeavenly Argamak\u201d and \"Golden Akhal-Teke Cup Shael\" where breeders present their best horses to a group of judges. At the World Championship, a group of judges evaluates the horses in age and gender categories as well as in various sport disciplines and a halter class."

        "title": "Akhal-Teke_History",
        "content": "The ancestors of the breed may date back to animals living 3,000 years ago, known by a number of names, but most often as the Nisean horse. The precise ancestry is difficult to trace, however, because prior to about 1600\u00a0AD, horse breeds in the modern sense did not exist; rather, horses were identified by local strain or type. The breed is very similar to, and possibly the direct descendant of the Turkoman horse, a breed believed to be extinct, though a related strain may be bred today in Iran. Other breeds or strains with Turkoman roots also include the Yomud, Goklan and the Nokhorli. Some historians believe that these are different strains of the same breed. Other ancient strains that may have contributed to the breed included those named the Massaget and Parthian. There's also claims that Akhal-Teke horse is the descendant of the original Fergana horse which was breed in Fergana valley in 104 BC. It remains a disputed \"chicken or egg\" question whether the influential Arabian was the ancestor of the Turkoman or was developed out of that breed, but current DNA evidence points to a possible common ancestor for both.  A substantial number of Arabian mares were reportedly been used to improve the breed in the 14th and 19th century.  It is also possible that the so-called \"hot blooded\" breeds, the Arabian, Turkoman, Akhal-Teke, and the Barb all developed from a single \"oriental horse\" predecessor. Tribal people in what today is Turkmenistan first used the Akhal-Teke for raiding. The horses were their most treasured possession since they were crucial for income and survival. They selectively bred their horses, keeping records of the pedigrees via an oral tradition. Horses were managed and trained in very specific ways. Stallions were tethered next to the tent while mares and foals were free to seek forage. The stallions were covered from head to tail with up to seven layers of felt, which kept their coat short and shiny. Before raids they were put on a sparse diet to prepare them for the long ride through the desert with no water and hardly any feed. The horses were called Argamaks (divine or Sacred Horses) by the Russians and heavenly horses by ancient China, and were cherished by those who valued their speed and stamina in the desert and loyalty to their owner. Han emperors from China waged two expeditions to secure the \"heavenly horses\". And the access to these horse breeds fueled the success in China's future campaign against their nomadic neighbors. In 1881, Turkmenistan became part of the Russian Empire. The tribes fought with the tsar, eventually losing.  In the process, however, the Russian general Kuropatkin developed a fondness for horses he had seen while fighting the tribesmen, founded a breeding farm after the war and renamed the horses, \"Akhal-Tekes\", after the Teke Turkmen tribe that lived around the Akhal oasis (near Geok Tepe). The Russians closed the studbook in 1932 which included 287 stallions and 468 mares. Stallions are not gelded in Central Asia. The studbook was printed in 1941. The ancestral Akhal-Teke has had influence on many breeds, possibly including the Thoroughbred; the Byerly Turk, which may have been an Arabian, or a Turkoman Horse, was one of the three major foundation stallions of the breed. Three other stallions thought to be of Turkoman origin, known as the \"Lister Turk\", the \"White Turk\", and the \"Yellow Turk\" were among a number of minor stallions from the orient who contributed to the foundation bloodstock of the Thoroughbred breed. The Trakehner has also been influenced by the Akhal-Teke, most notably by the stallion, Turkmen-Atti, as have the Russian breeds Don, Budyonny, Karabair, and Karabakh. The breed suffered greatly when the Soviet Union required horses to be slaughtered for meat, even though local Turkmen refused to eat them. At one point only 1,250 horses remained and export from the Soviet Union was banned. The government of Turkmenistan now uses the horses as diplomatic presents as well as auctioning a few to raise money for improved horse breeding programs. In the early twentieth century, crossbreeding between the Thoroughbred and the Akhal-Teke took place, aiming to create a faster long-distance racehorse.  The Anglo Akhal-Tekes were not so resilient however, as their Akhal-Teke ancestors, and many died due to the harsh conditions of Central Asia. After the  endurance race from Ashkabad to Moscow in 1935, when the purebreds finished in much better condition than the part-breds, the studbook management decided to consider all crossbred horses born after 1936, as not purebred. Horses with English Thoroughbred ancestors born prior to that date were allowed to remain inside the studbook (e.g. 044 Tillyakush, grandson of Thoroughbred Burlak, 831 Makh, granddaughter of Thoroughbred Blondelli and great-great-granddaughter of Thoroughbred Junak, and line founder 9 Ak Belek, a direct descendant in the male line of the Thoroughbred stallion Fortingbrass). Due to this fact there doesn't exist any Akhal-Teke today whose ancestry doesn't contain a Thoroughbred. Since 1973, all foals must be blood typed to be accepted in the stud book in order to protect the integrity of the breed. From 2014 on, a DNA test based on hair follicles is sufficient if the DNA of the parents is on file.  A stallion not producing the right type of horse may be removed. Nowadays, artificial insemination is allowed as well as embryo transfer. The surrogate mother, however, needs to be a pureblood Akhal-Teke mare for the foal to be registered in the General Studbook as a pureblood Akhal-Teke. Akhal-Teke horses are bred all over the world. In addition to Turkmenistan there are breeders in Russia and Central Asia, Europe, the US, Uruguay, and Australia."

        "content": "Turkmenistan has a separate agency, Turkmen Atlary, responsible for the breeding, training and maintenance of Akhal-Teke horses. However, the agency's work has been the focus of criticism from the President of the country, who holds the agency responsible for decreasing numbers of horses and inadequate facilities for their breeding, training and management.  At present Akhal-Teke horses in Turkmenistan are not registered with any other studbook. The main reason for this are allegations of a heavy infusion of Thoroughbred blood into the breed to create faster horses for racing in Turkmenistan.  There are estimates that as many as 30% of the horses in the Ashgabat hippodrome were not purebred. When the first horse minister of newly independent Turkmenistan, Geldy Kyarizov, a lifelong advocate for the Akhal-Teke and former chair of the International Association of Akhal-Teke Breeders, began utilizing DNA to establish an Akhal-Teke studbook, he uncovered the pattern of adding in Thoroughbred blood.  His decision to go public with this information was viewed as a threat to the profits of the horse-breeding establishment and he fell out of favor with the Turkmenistan government, and in particular, then-President Saparmurat Niyazov. He was charged with abuse of office and negligence in 2002, convicted and sentenced to six years in prison.  He was ultimately pardoned in October 2007, when Niyazov died and his successor, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, took control of the country.  By 2012, Kyarizov's health, which had been poor since his arrest and subsequent imprisonment, had deteriorated to the point he needed to go abroad for medical care, but was initially prevented from leaving the country. By 2015, he was allowed to travel to Moscow for medical care, but family members, including his 14-year-old daughter, were forced to remain behind to \"guarantee\" his return. Ultimately, in September, 2015, the entire family was allowed to leave. Turkmen Atlary, in its capacity as the administrative arm of the International Akhal-Teke Horse Association, hosts a meeting of the association once or twice a year upon invitation in Ashgabat. Most of the bigger breeding farms and national Akhal Teke associations as well as Akhal Teke owners and representatives of the horse industry from around the world attend.  There is a horse racing organization called \"Galkinysh\" . In Ashgabat, the Ahalteke equestrian complex, one of the largest in Central Asia, is a horse-breeding center. The former Akhal-Teke horse Holiday, celebrated on the last Sunday in April, has been renamed 'Turkmen Horse Day'"

        "content": "The Akhal-Teke, due to its natural athleticism, can be a sport horse, good at dressage, show jumping, eventing, racing, and endurance riding. A noted example was the Akhal-Teke stallion, Absent, who won the Grand Prix de Dressage at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, while being ridden by Sergei Filatov. He went again with Filatov to win the bronze individual medal in Tokyo in the 1964 Summer Olympics, and won the Soviet team gold medal under Ivan Kalita at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, by today's studbook standards he wouldn't be admitted as Akhal-Teke, owing to the Thoroughbred ancestry of his dam Bakkara. In 2009, an Akhal-Teke named Almila carried the French poet Laurence Bougault on a trek alone from Isfahan in Iran to Paris by way of Turkey, Greece and Italy. Her trip covered 6,500 kilometres (4,000\u00a0mi) in less than six months."

        "title": "Akhal-Teke_Genetic diseases",
        "content": "There are several genetic diseases of concern to Akhal-Teke breeders. The genetic diversity of the breed is relatively low with an AVK (Ancestor Loss Coefficient ) of 30-50%, which raises concerns for dealing with an increase in carriers of these conditions, and even some risk of inbreeding depression. To date, there are no DNA tests for these conditions. Naked Foal Syndrome or Hairless Foal Syndrome is believed to be a monogenic autosomal, lethal recessive gene in the Akhal-Teke breed. Foals with this condition have been reported since 1938. Research at the University of Bern in Switzerland is ongoing to develop a DNA test for the condition.  It appears to be similar in clinical signs, though not identical to, junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) found in the Belgian horse and another condition of a similar nature identified in the American Saddlebred. The defect causes foals to be born without any hair coat, mane or tail. In some cases, the front teeth are in at birth or molars grow abnormally from normal jaws. Other symptoms include persistent diarrhea, frequent digestive disorders, and laminitis-like, treatment-resistant rotation of the coffin bones in the hooves. Due to the lack of normal skin protection, secondary symptoms include scaly, dry, and inflamed skin, as well as severe cases of sunburn in summer, and frequent pulmonary infections during winter. NFS is always fatal, most foals die within weeks of birth, although some horses have survived up to the age of two years. Early demise is usually caused by digestive problems, whereas older horses need to be humanely euthanized because of severe laminitis-induced pain. Some carriers have been identified, including 943 Arslan, 736 Keymir, 2001 Mariula, or 1054 Gilkuyruk, but the estimated number of unknown cases is likely higher, as several Russian and Turkmenian breeders have acknowledged that NFS foals are often just reported as stillborn or aborted. Hereditary cryptorchidism exists within the Akhal-Teke breed and affected stallions can be traced through multiple generations. The influential foundation sire, 2a Boinou was a cryptorchid according to experts of the breed. Other verified cryptorchids include 779 Peren, 1248 Orlan, 971 Khalif, Sayvan, Saburbek, and Garayusup. 1069 Kortik produced a cryptorchid. Unlike many European and North American breed organisations, neither Russia nor Turkmenistan bar cryptorchids from breeding. Cryptorchidism is said to be related to health and behavior problems. Affected horses are more expensive to castrate. There are no studbook regulations related to the use of cryptorchid stallions.  Breeders balance the risk of cryptorchidism against propagating other desirable qualities. Some national Akhal Teke associations, however, ban Cryptorchidism from breeding. The Akhal-Teke is one of many light riding horse breeds that may be prone to cervical vertebral malformation (CVM), commonly called Wobbler syndrome, and to Degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis (DSLD). These conditions are seen in a number of other breeds, including the Thoroughbred. There is likely a genetic component to Wobbler's, but the mechanism has not been clearly identified.  There also is a possible connection to Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)."

        "content": "The film deals with the adventures of a young Cajun boy and his pet raccoon, who live a somewhat idyllic existence playing in the bayous of Louisiana. A sub-plot involves his elderly father allowing an oil company to drill for oil in the inlet that runs behind their house. An inland barge is towed into the inlet from interconnecting waterways.  Most if not all of South Louisiana swamps and inland waters without land access were and are explored using dredged channels and barge rigs.   The film presents the rig crew tripping pipe (an oilfield operations term), changing a bit, and closing valves on the blow out preventers.  The rig crew are not actors, they are actual roughnecks.  Even though there is a moment of probable manufactured crisis when the rig drills into a trouble zone, the crew's actions are not choreographed per se.  The time frame is pre-OSHA, however there are serious doubts that drillers at that time allowed unshoed kids to hang out on the rig floor - ever.  As the story progresses the rig completes its operation and friendly drillers depart, leaving behind a phenomenally clean environment and a wealthy Cajun family. Conflict and action for the plot is provided by the presence of a giant alligator in the area, which is believed to have eaten the pet raccoon and which is hunted in revenge. There is no individual or organized resistance to the incursion of the oil seekers, even after the (brief, offscreen) disaster, who are unequivocally portrayed as friendly, progressive humanitarians. The boy, named in the film as Alexander Napoleon Ulysses Le Tour, but in the credits just identified as \"the boy\", was played by Joseph Boudreaux. The film was photographed by Richard Leacock and edited by Helen van Dongen, who were also the associate producers. Its original release was through independent film distributor Lopert Films."

Since December 2021, the party has been led provisionally by Karl Nehammer. It is currently the largest party in the National Council, with 71 of the 183 seats, and won 37.5% of votes cast in the 2019 legislative election. It holds seats in all nine state legislatures, and is part of government in seven, of which it leads six. The \u00d6VP is a member of the International Democrat Union and the European People's Party. It sits with the EPP group in the European Parliament; of Austria's 19 MEPs, 7 are members of the \u00d6VP. An unofficial successor to the Christian Social Party of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the \u00d6VP was founded immediately following the re-establishment of the Republic of Austria in 1945. Since then, it has been one of the two traditional major parties in Austria, alongside the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP\u00d6). It was the most popular party until 1970, and has traditionally governed in a grand coalition with the SP\u00d6. It was the senior partner in grand coalitions from 1945 to 1966 and the junior partner from 1986 to 2000 and 2007\u20132017. The \u00d6VP also briefly governed alone from 1966 to 1970. After the 1999 election, the party formed a coalition with the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) until 2003, when a coalition with the FP\u00d6 splinter Alliance for the Future of Austria was formed, which lasted until 2007. The party underwent a change in its image after Sebastian Kurz became chairman, changing its colour from the traditional black to turquoise, and adopting the alternate name The New People's Party (). It became the largest party after the 2017 election, and formed a coalition government with the FP\u00d6. This collapsed eighteen months later, leading to the 2019 election, after which the \u00d6VP formed a new coalition with The Greens."

        "content": "The \u00d6VP is the successor of the Christian Social Party, a staunchly conservative movement founded in 1893 by Karl Lueger, mayor of Vienna and highly controversial right-wing populist. Most of the members of the party during its founding belonged to the former Fatherland Front, which was led by chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, also a member of the Christian Social Party before the Anschluss. While still sometimes honored by \u00d6VP members for resisting Adolf Hitler, the regime built by Dollfuss was authoritarian in nature and has been dubbed as Austrofascism. In its present form, the \u00d6VP was established immediately after the restoration of Austria's independence in 1945 and it has been represented in both the Federal Assembly ever since. In terms of Federal Assembly seats, the \u00d6VP has consistently been the strongest or second-strongest party and as such it has led or at least been a partner in most Austria's federal cabinets. In the 1945 Austrian legislative election, the \u00d6VP won a landslide victory in Austria's first postwar election, winning almost half the popular vote and an absolute majority in the legislature. However, memories of the hyper-partisanship that had plagued the First Republic prompted the \u00d6VP to maintain the grand coalition with the Communist Party of Austria (KP\u00d6) and the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP\u00d6) that had governed the country since the restoration of independence in early 1945. The \u00d6VP remained the senior partner in a coalition with the SP\u00d6 until 1966 and governed alone from 1966 to 1970. It reentered the government in 1986, but has never been completely out of power since the restoration of Austrian independence in 1945 due to a longstanding tradition that all major interest groups were to be consulted on policy. After the 1999 Austrian legislative election, several months of negotiations ended in early 2000 when the \u00d6VP formed a coalition government with the right-wing populist Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) led by J\u00f6rg Haider. The FP\u00d6 had won just a few hundred more votes than the \u00d6VP, but was considered far too controversial to lead a government. The \u00d6VP's Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel became Chancellor\u2014the first \u00d6VP Chancellor of Austria since 1970. This caused widespread outrage in Europe and the European Union imposed informal diplomatic sanctions on Austria, the first time that it imposed sanctions on a member state. Bilateral relations were frozen (including contacts and meetings at an inter-governmental level) and Austrian candidates would not be supported for posts in European Union international offices. Austria threatened to veto all applications by countries for European Union membership until the sanctions were lifted. A few months later, these sanctions were dropped as a result of a fact-finding mission by three former European prime ministers, the so-called \"three wise men\". The 2002 legislative election resulted in a landslide victory (42.27% of the vote) for the \u00d6VP under Sch\u00fcssel. Haider's FP\u00d6 was reduced to 10.16% of the vote. At the state level, the \u00d6VP has long dominated the rural states of Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Tyrol and Vorarlberg. It is less popular in the city state of Vienna and in the rural, but less strongly Catholic states of Burgenland and Carinthia. In 2004, it lost its plurality in the State of Salzburg, where they kept its result in seats (14) in 2009. In 2005, it lost its plurality in Styria for the first time. After the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ\u00d6) split from the FP\u00d6 in 2005, the BZ\u00d6 replaced the FP\u00d6 in the government coalition which lasted until 2007. Austria for the first time had a government containing of a party that was founded during the parliamentary term. In the 2006 Austrian legislative election, the \u00d6VP were defeated and after much negotiations agreed to become junior partner in a grand coalition with the SP\u00d6, with new party chairman Wilhelm Molterer as Finance Minister and Vice-Chancellor under SP\u00d6 leader Alfred Gusenbauer, who became Chancellor. The 2008 Austrian legislative election saw the \u00d6VP lose 15 seats, with a further 8.35% decrease in its share of the vote. However, the \u00d6VP won the largest share of the vote (30.0%) in the 2009 European Parliament election with 846,709 votes, although their number of seats remained the same."

Their first films include Incident at Clovelly Cottage, The Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Race and Rough Sea at Dover. In France, the brothers Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re, design and built a lightweight, hand-held motion picture camera called the Cin\u00e9matographe.

She is a rhetorical illustration used by atheists and other religious skeptics as a contemporary version of Russell's teapot, sometimes mentioned in conjunction with the Flying Spaghetti Monster. The IPU is used to argue that supernatural beliefs are arbitrary by, for example, replacing the word God in any theistic statement with Invisible Pink Unicorn. The mutually exclusive attributes of pinkness and invisibility, coupled with the inability to disprove the IPU's existence, satirize properties that some theists attribute to a theistic deity."

        "content": "Russell's teapot is an analogy first coined by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making scientifically unfalsifiable claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others, specifically in the case of religion. Russell wrote that, if he claims that a teapot orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, it is nonsensical for him to expect others to believe him on the ground that they cannot prove him wrong. Russell's teapot is still referred to in discussions concerning the existence of God. The IPU seems to have become notable primarily through online culture: in addition to alt.atheism, where IPU frequently came up in discussions, there are now a number of web sites dedicated to her. An early documented reference to the IPU was on July 7, 1990, on the Usenet discussion group alt.atheism. Other sources concerning IPU state that she was \"revealed to us\" on alt.atheism. The concept was further developed by a group of college students from 1994 to 1995 on the ISCA Telnet-based BBS. The students created a manifesto that detailed a nonsensical (yet internally consistent) religion based on a multitude of invisible pink unicorns. It is from this document that the most famous quotation concerning IPUs originated:"

        "content": "It is common when discussing the Invisible Pink Unicorn to point out that because she is invisible, no one can prove that she does not exist (or indeed that she is not pink). This is a parody of similar theistic claims about God: that God, as creator of the universe, is not subject to its laws and thus not physically detecting him tells us nothing about his existence or lack thereof. The Invisible Pink Unicorn is an illustration which attempts to demonstrate the absurdity of citing attributes and a lack of evidence as proof of a deity's existence. Her two defining attributes, invisibility and color (pink), are inconsistent and contradictory; this is part of the satire. The paradox of something being invisible yet having visible characteristics (color) is reflected in some East Asian cultures, wherein an invisible red string is said to connect people who have a shared or linked destiny. There are humorous mock debates amongst her \"followers\" concerning her other attributes, such as whether she is completely invisible or invisible to most, but visible only to those who have faith in her (bearing similarities to \"The Emperor's New Clothes\"). Some arguments are quite elaborate and tortuous, satirizing the disputatiousness and intricacy of the theological debates that occur in many religions. The Invisible Pink Unicorn is also used to de-deify religious texts. The goal is to have the reader experience the text without heavily loaded concepts that many readers will associate with omnipotence, or will read with an unquestioned faith. It is argued that when someone re-reads the same text with all direct references to God replaced with the Invisible Pink Unicorn, the reader may see the text in a new and more critical way:"

        "content": "In 1996, a unicorn that no one can see was adapted as a teaching device at Camp Quest, the first free-thought summer camp for children established in the United States, by Dr. L. Wilson. As reported years later in the July 21, 2006 Cincinnati Enquirer, \"Campers must try to prove that imaginary unicorns\u2014as a metaphor for God\u2014don't exist.\" Richard Dawkins alluded to unicorns in this connection in his 2006 book The God Delusion, writing that \"Russell's teapot, of course, stands for an infinite number of things whose existence is conceivable and cannot be disproved. [...] A philosophical favorite is the invisible, intangible, inaudible unicorn.\" In the essay The Dragon in my Garage from the book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle In the Dark, Carl Sagan uses the example of an invisible dragon breathing heatless fire that someone claims lives in his garage. The supposed dragon cannot be seen, heard, or sensed in any way, nor does it leave footprints; thus, there is no reason to believe this purported dragon exists. In the South Park episode \"The Poor Kid\", a strict agnostic couple tell their foster children that God might exist, but then again, it's equally possible that there might be a \"giant reptilian bird in charge of everything\". At the end of the episode, the bird actually does appear and eats Kenny."

Many followers have responded to these critiques by improvising new literature, rituals, and customs, frequently written as farcical narrative that parodies not only scripture and rites itself but also the perceived importance or relevance of such scripture and customs. Invisible Pink Unicorn scripture and customs seek to evoke the mysticism of the unicorn and to simultaneously lampoon similar literature in other faiths per the IPU's main tenet."

This was the only feature film in which the Reagans acted together, either before or after their 1952 marriage. The film's setting is the Pacific War.

When diver Wes Barton, Abbott's rival for the affections of Nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair, gets into a life-threatening situation, Abbott must keep his personal and professional lives separate when dealing with the crisis. The story is based on the 1955 non-fiction book Hellcats of the Sea by Vice Admiral Charles A. Lockwood and Hans Christian Adamson."

When a diver, who is Abbott's competitor for the affections of nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair (Nancy Davis) back home, gets into a dangerous situation, Abbott must struggle to keep his personal and professional lives separate in dealing with the crisis. The results arouse ill feelings in the crew and especially Abbott's executive officer, Lt. Commander Landon (Arthur Franz), who asks his captain to let him air his views in confidence. The results lead Abbott to write in Landon's efficiency report that he should never be given command of a naval vessel, resulting in further ill will between the two."

        "content": "Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz appears as himself to introduce the film, and he is later played in the story by actor Selmer Jackson. Retired Navy officer Charles A. Lockwood, chief author of the book on which this feature was based, is also portrayed briefly by an actor. It was the second film Nathan Juran directed for producer Charles Schneer. Reagan said in his autobiography that he was disappointed, overall, in the film, having expected a result more like Destination Tokyo, a major Warner Bros. submarine film made during World War II. The diminishing status of the feature films that Reagan was being offered, plus his increasing involvement with television, led to his leaving the big screen forever. The United States Navy provided extensive cooperation by allowing portions of the film to be shot at Naval Base San Diego and aboard an actual U.S. submarine, possibly . The executive officer of the submarine was Lloyd Bucher, who would go on to command the  during its capture by North Korea in 1968. During the film's production, as USS Besugo was about to get underway, an argument ensued between the director and one of the unions. There was only a short window of opportunity to maneuver the boat away from the pier, as it was difficult for a submarine tied up in San Diego to get underway while a tide was running. Besugo was one of the first submarines to employ nylon rope lines, and when stretched, the lines could get about \"as big around as a pencil\" and become lethal if they broke under strain. The order was given to the helmsman to answer all bells. Reagan happened to be on deck practicing his dialog lines and hollering out, \"Ahead one third, starboard back full ...\" About this time, the nylon ropes were stretched to their breaking point when an officer gave the command, \"All stop, ALL STOP, Goddammit, ALL STOP!\" and Reagan, totally oblivious to what was going on, continued to practice his lines, rocking back and forth on his feet with his hands behind his back, as if nothing were wrong. Among the stock music used in the film were excerpts from The Caine Mutiny March, composed by Max Steiner, the main title theme for the 1954 Columbia Pictures feature film The Caine Mutiny. That film was also about World War II U.S. Navy operations in the Pacific theater; Arthur Franz appears as well in the minor role of Lt. (jg) Paynter."

He went on to criticize the lack of realistic supporting characters and the film's use of obvious stock footage, especially that of a U. S. Navy patrol boat portraying a Japanese ship. Overall, he described the film itself as \"fair\". David Krauss of Digitally Obsessed described the production values as \"bargain basement\" and found that the cast's stiff performances alienated viewers. He gave the film a C for style and a B- for substance, although he also described the direction as \"dry as a military briefing\" on CNN. Erick Harper at DVD Verdict has written that Hellcats followed a series of submarine war film clich\u00e9s, like the \"love triangle\" and familiar elements of the action sequences. He compared parts of the film to the TV series Star Trek (which premiered almost a decade later), in that it follows a standard Hollywood formula for its plot. He described Ronald Reagan as \"comfortable\" and \"believable\", and said that the film was \"worth checking out for the historical value, if nothing else\"."

        "content": "Hancock's Half Hour was a BBC radio comedy, and later television comedy series, broadcast from 1954 to 1961 and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. The series starred Tony Hancock, with Sidney James; the radio version also co-starred, at various times, Moira Lister, Andr\u00e9e Melly, Hattie Jacques, Bill Kerr and Kenneth Williams. The final television series, renamed simply Hancock, starred Hancock alone. Ten scripts (nine TV, one radio) were written but never recorded for a variety of reasons.  The unused radio script for The Counterfeiter was finally recorded in 2019 with Kevin R. McNally as Tony Hancock. Comedian Tony Hancock starred in the show, playing an exaggerated and much poorer version of his own character and lifestyle, Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock, a down-at-heel comedian living at the dilapidated 23 Railway Cuttings in East Cheam. The series was influential in the development of the situation comedy, with its move away from radio variety towards a focus on character development. The radio version was produced by Dennis Main Wilson for most of its run. After Main Wilson departed for his television career, his role was taken by Tom Ronald. The television series was produced by Duncan Wood. The distinctive tuba-based theme tune was composed by Angela Morley, then known by her original name, Wally Stott."

        "content": "The radio series broke with the variety tradition which was then dominant in British radio comedy, highlighting a new genre: the sitcom or situation comedy. Instead of the traditional variety mix of sketches, guest stars and musical interludes, the show's humour derived from characters and situations developed in a half-hour storyline. This then relatively novel format, of what was in effect a single sketch each week lasting the entire half-hour (though in the radio version James and the others sometimes played different roles), was reflected in the show's title, which aptly described the series as Hancock's \"half-hour\". Roger Wilmut, in his 1978 biography of Tony Hancock as a performer, credits two British radio comedy shows, already running in 1954, with establishing an uninterrupted 30-minute sitcom format: A Life of Bliss, written by Godfrey Harrison and starring George Cole, and Life with the Lyons, a programme heavily based on the US tradition of sitcoms; he therefore dismisses the notion that Galton and Simpson invented the genre. The comedy gradually shifted to observation, with a less strong emphasis on a narrative. The playlet \"Look Back in Hunger\" (spoofing John Osborne's Look Back in Anger) in the episode \"The East Cheam Drama Festival\" from the fifth series, showed that writers Galton and Simpson were in touch with developments in the British theatre, in the use of sighs and silent pauses, something Osborne's style had in common with the plays of Harold Pinter, whose work began to emerge towards the end of the series' run. In addition, the measured pacing of the episodes was unusual in an era of fast-talking radio comedians, such as Ted Ray, who typically used a machine-gun style of delivery to fill every single second of airtime."

        "content": "Hancock's character had various addresses, but by the third radio series he had arrived at 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam. Sometimes this was portrayed as a council house, but occasionally there was a private landlord. In a few early episodes Hancock owned the house, and later this became the norm. The house changed to accommodate the cast: in some episodes it appeared to be a two-bedroom terraced house, with Kerr as Hancock's lodger; but in series four and five it had at least three bedrooms, as Miss Pugh was also resident in some episodes. In others she 'came round' each day, presumably from her own domicile. Railway Cuttings and East Cheam were fictitious, but Cheam is a real town, once in Surrey, today part of the London Borough of Sutton in Greater London. The whole area is smart and expensive, and by creating 'Railway Cuttings, East Cheam' Galton and Simpson created an address for a snob who wanted to live in a 'posh' area, but could only afford the 'cheap end' (which in reality does not exist). In those days recordings of the radio shows were not commercially available, so the audience had to rely entirely on memory for details of who lived where or who did what in the show. Commissioning of series in the UK was then closer to American practice with extensive runs not unknown, but in this case, with only two writers. Continuity in the idiom was yet to develop, and details changed to suit each episode. The domestic situation varied, but Hancock usually portrayed a 'resting' or hopeless down-at-heel actor and/or comedian (though some episodes showed him having runs of success, while some episodes depict him pursuing professional careers as fantasies), James was always on the fiddle in some way, Kerr gradually became dim and virtually unemployable (although he had started out as a fast-talking American-style Australian), and Hancock's 'secretary', Miss Pugh, had such a loose job description that in one celebrated episode she had cooked the Sunday lunch. At times the scripts would reflect topical realities of British life, such as the reintroduction of petrol rationing from November 1956 to March 1957 (during the Suez Crisis) in 'The Stolen Petrol' and a strike by members of the trade union ASLEF (Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen) from 28 May to 14 June 1955 which involved a railway strike in 'The Rail Strike'. With the notable exception of Drop the Dead Donkey decades later, sitcoms rarely contained such topical references."

The comedy actor Sidney James (as he was then billed) played Sid (full name Sidney Balmoral James), a criminally-inclined confidant of Hancock, who usually succeeded in conning him each week. Bill Kerr appeared as Hancock's Australian lodger (full name William Montmorency Beaumont Kerr), a character who became noticeably dim-witted in the later shows. Often refers to Hancock as \"tub\". Kenneth Williams, taking his first job in comedy, provided the funny voices for all the minor characters in the show each week. Williams left after the first recording session for the sixth series. Moira Lister appeared in the first series, before being replaced by Andr\u00e9e Melly for the next two; both women played love interest for Hancock's character, in essentially 'straight' roles. In the fourth and fifth series Hattie Jacques provided comedy in the female role as the harridan Griselda Pugh, who was Hancock's secretary and Sid's occasional girlfriend. By this time, Hancock's difficulties with women had become part of the characterisation. Among the well-known actors who appeared in the series were Hugh Lloyd, Patricia Hayes, Dick Emery, Warren Mitchell, John Le Mesurier and Richard Wattis. Also appearing were Pat Coombs, Rolf Harris, Burt Kwouk, credited as 'Burd Kwouk', and Anne Reid.

Galton and Simpson never gave titles to any of their Hancock scripts, for radio or television; this was usually left to the girl who filed the scripts at their office, who gave them names that were a reminder of what the script was about. So when Roger Wilmut came to write his book Tony Hancock \u2013 Artiste (first published 1978) he took the liberty of inventing titles where necessary and these titles, a combination of the file names and Wilmut's own, have become the accepted ones ever since, with the approval of Galton and Simpson and the BBC. The regular cast members generally played \"themselves\", in that the characters were called by the actor's real name (although the English actress Andr\u00e9e Melly \u2013 sister of George \u2013 played a French character). However, there were exceptions: Kenneth Williams played a series of unnamed characters referred to in the scripts\u2014but not on air\u2014as \"Snide\".  He also played the very occasional roles of Edwardian Fred (a criminal associate of Sid's) and Hancock's Vicar, as well as various other characters. In the episode \"The Emigrant\" he is allowed to break the fourth wall and refer to himself as \"that bloke with the funny voice\". Hattie Jacques played Griselda Pugh, Hancock's secretary, with the exception of the episode \u2018The East Cheam Drama Festival\u2019 where she played herself. Alan Simpson played an unnamed man in early episodes who listened patiently to Hancock's long-winded stories. His lines would frequently be restricted to simply \"Yes\", \"Really?\", \"Mm-hmm\", or \"I see\". These performers are present in the series as indicated below. Two lost episodes of the radio series\u2014\"The Blackboard Jungle\" (series 3) and \"The New Secretary\" (series 4)\u2014were recovered in 2002 from off-air home recordings made by listener Vic Rogers."

The television and radio versions alternated until 1959, when the final radio series and the fifth television series were both broadcast during the autumn season. Only Sid James transferred from the radio series, although Kenneth Williams and Hattie Jacques each made a couple of appearances. The television version drew on a stock company of actors, who played different supporting characters in each episode. Semi-regulars included Liz Fraser, John Le Mesurier, Hugh Lloyd, Arthur Mullard and John Vyvyan. The final television series, broadcast in 1961, was retitled Hancock, as it was shortened from a half-hour to 25 minutes. For this final series Sid James was no longer in the cast, as Hancock had become frustrated with the format. Some of the most celebrated episodes of the TV series were produced in this final series, including \"The Blood Donor\", \"The Radio Ham\", \"The Bedsitter\" and \"The Bowmans\". Hancock's character was relocated to Earl's Court for this series. Some episodes of the radio series and telerecordings of some episodes from the third and fourth television series were destroyed. No episodes are known to survive from the first series of the TV show. The surviving radio episodes, which often exist only in edited versions that have been cut for overseas sale to commercial radio stations, were released as CD box sets between 2000 and 2003 (see below). In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, Hancock's Half Hour was placed 24th. In 1962, the show became the first imported programme to win a Jacob's Award following its transmission on Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann, the Republic of Ireland's national TV station. In 1956 and 1957 Hancock had starred in two series of a sketch show made by Associated-Rediffusion for ITV television, which were broadcast either side of his first television series on the BBC. In 1972 a Norwegian TV show called Fleksnes Fataliteter aired for the first time. It was based on scripts from Hancock's Half Hour. The show became trilingual, as it usually starred both Swedish and Norwegian actors, and was broadcast in Sweden and Norway as well as Denmark. In 2016, \"The New Neighbour\" was restaged as part of the BBC's Landmark Sitcom Season commemorating the 60th anniversary of the television sitcom."

        "content": "Four episodes of the TV series were re-recorded before studio audiences, in the style of radio programmes, and released on LP format, two by Pye on the 1961 album Hancock (\"The Blood Donor\" and \"The Radio Ham\") and two by Decca on the 1965 album It's Hancock (\"The Missing Page\" and \"The Reunion Party\"), which was reissued as The World of Tony Hancock in 1975. The re-recordings entailed the rewriting of a number of visual gags; for instance, at the end of the TV version of \"The Radio Ham\", Hancock smashes his radio equipment, whereas in the LP version he holds an on-air auction for it. These recordings have been reissued several times on LP, cassette and CD, and have also appeared on comedy compilation CDs. BBC Records released an LP titled Hancock featuring the original TV soundtracks of two episodes, \"The Lift\" and \"Twelve Angry Men.\"  The episode \"The Lift\" was taken from the separate magnetic soundtrack of the telerecording, with the opening non-dialogue sequence omitted and one extra line of dialogue added: \"Watch that door button... Oh my God!\" as recorded by Hugh Lloyd on 24/08/76 and edited in.  \"Twelve Angry Men\" was from the optical soundtrack of the telerecording, with theme and incidental music omitted, a few lines of dialogue edited out and pauses shortened. The LP credits the theme music to Angela Morley, even though the music was omitted, and the episodes were recorded when she was still called Wally Stott. There have been six LPs released of substantially complete radio episodes.  The first was by Pye Records in 1960 entitled This is Hancock containing \"The Wild Man of The Woods\" and \"Sunday Afternoon At Home.\"  The other five were by BBC Records, released as Hancock's Half Hour: \"The Poetry Society\" and \"Sid's Mystery Tours\", released in 1980;  \"The Americans Hit Town\" and \"The Unexploded Bomb\" in 1981; \"The Scandal Magazine\" and \"The Last of the McHancocks\" in 1982; \"The Sleepless Night\" and \"Fred's Pie Stall\" in 1983; and finally \"Hancocks War\" and \"The Christmas Club\" in 1984.  These five LPs were also released on audio cassette at the same time.  Also, a number of comedy-themed LPs, EPs and 7-inch singles have been released over the years which have featured short extracts from various radio episodes. The radio series of Hancock's Half Hour was first released on cassette by the BBC as part of their Radio Collection series of audio cassettes in the late 1980s.  The first three volumes were re-issues of the five LPs from the 1980s plus the LP of television soundtracks from 1976.  Because only 10 volumes were made with four episodes each, and because a number of episodes were later returned from homemade off-air recordings by listeners, a release of the radio series was never completed on cassette. In 2000, the episodes still remaining from Series 1 of the radio series were released as a box set on CD.  Series 2\u20136 followed throughout the next three years. The series has also been given three compilation CDs. The television series of Hancock's Half Hour was first released on VHS/Betamax in 1985 under BBC Enterprises (now Worldwide) in an incomplete form.  A Laserdisc of Volume One was also issued under catalogue number BBCL 7004. Six videos were released, each containing three episodes and were mainly drawn from the last three series.  The next video release was not to be for another nine years, and that was \"The Very Best of Hancock,\" a compilation including all episodes from the final series but excluding the last, \"The Succession: Son and Heir.\"  In 1996, a video was released containing the first three remaining episodes. Two later videos were released in 1997, and another featuring \"The Train Journey\" was released in 1999. In 1992 \"Hancock: The Australian TV Series in Colour\" was released, compiled from the three episodes of the 1968 Australian series completed before Hancock's death.  This was released on VHS in both the UK and Australia. The first DVD to be released was in 2001, which was a re-release of \"The Very Best of Hancock\" video. The next DVD was to be released in 2004, containing the first five episodes and the rarely seen \"Hancock's Forty-Three Minutes.\" However, 2 Entertain released a box set in 2007 called The Tony Hancock Collection, containing every existing episode and new bonus features, including Hancock's interview in the Face to Face from 1960. In June and August 2009, six off-air audio recordings of lost TV episodes from Series 4 were unearthed, though they had been knocking around the bootleg market for some time; however, two of them are very poor quality.  The six episodes were: \"Underpaid or Grandad's S.O.S.\", \"The Flight of the Red Shadow\", \"The Horror Serial\", \"Matrimony \u2013 Almost\", \"The Beauty Contest\" and \"The Wrong Man\". In 2009, the surviving radio episodes were repeated weekly on the digital network BBC Radio 7, chronologically sequenced."

        "content": "The Arabian or Arab horse ( , DMG \u1e25i\u1e63\u0101n \u02bfarab\u012b) is a breed of horse that originated on the Arabian Peninsula. With a distinctive head shape and high tail carriage, the Arabian is one of the most easily recognizable horse breeds in the world. It is also one of the oldest breeds, with archaeological evidence of horses in the Middle East that resemble modern Arabians dating back 4,500\u00a0years. Throughout history, Arabian horses have spread around the world by both war and trade, used to improve other breeds by adding speed, refinement, endurance, and strong bone. Today, Arabian bloodlines are found in almost every modern breed of riding horse. The Arabian developed in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent for shelter and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits, including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans, created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect. The Arabian is a versatile breed. Arabians dominate the discipline of endurance riding and compete today in many other fields of equestrian sport. They are one of the top ten most popular horse breeds in the world. They are now found worldwide, including the United States and Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, continental Europe, South America (especially Brazil), and their land of origin, the Middle East."

        "content": "Arabian horses have refined, wedge-shaped heads, a broad forehead, large eyes, large nostrils, and small muzzles. Most display a distinctive concave, or \"dished\" profile. Many Arabians also have a slight forehead bulge between their eyes, called the jibbah by the Bedouin, that adds additional sinus capacity, believed to have helped the Arabian horse in its native dry desert climate. Another breed characteristic is an arched neck with a large, well-set windpipe set on a refined, clean throatlatch. This structure of the poll and throatlatch was called the mitbah or mitbeh by the Bedouin. In the ideal Arabian, it is long, allowing flexibility in the bridle and room for the windpipe. Other distinctive features are a relatively long, level croup, or top of the hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians to have solid bone and standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining, while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flatwork such as endurance riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good hoof walls. They are especially noted for their endurance, and the superiority of the breed in Endurance riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses with superior stamina. At international FEI-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition."

        "content": "Some Arabians, though not all, have 5 lumbar vertebrae instead of the usual 6, and 17 pairs of ribs rather than 18. A quality Arabian has both a relatively horizontal croup and a properly angled pelvis as well as good croup length and depth to the hip (determined by the length of the pelvis), that allows agility and impulsion. A misconception confuses the topline of the croup with the angle of the \"hip\" (the pelvis or ilium), leading some to assert that Arabians have a flat pelvis angle and cannot use their hindquarters properly. However, the croup is formed by the sacral vertebrae. The hip angle is determined by the attachment of the ilium to the spine, the structure and length of the femur, and other aspects of hindquarter anatomy, which is not correlated to the topline of the sacrum. Thus, the Arabian has conformation typical of other horse breeds built for speed and distance, such as the Thoroughbred, where the angle of the ilium is more oblique than that of the croup. Thus, the hip angle is not necessarily correlated to the topline of the croup. Horses bred to gallop need a good length of croup and good length of hip for proper attachment of muscles, and so unlike angle, length of hip and croup do go together as a rule."

Thus, all Arabians, regardless of height, are classified as \"horses\", even though  is the traditional cutoff height between a horse and a pony. A common myth is that Arabians are not strong because they are relatively small and refined. However, the Arabian horse is noted for a greater density of bone than other breeds, short cannons, sound feet, and a broad, short back, all of which give the breed physical strength comparable to many taller animals. Thus, even a smaller Arabian can carry a heavy rider. For tasks where the sheer weight of the horse matters, such as farm work done by a draft horse, any lighter-weight horse is at a disadvantage. However, for most purposes, the Arabian is a strong and hardy light horse breed able to carry any type of rider in most equestrian pursuits."

        "content": "For centuries, Arabian horses lived in the desert in close association with humans. For shelter and protection from theft, prized war mares were sometimes kept in their owner's tent, close to children and everyday family life. Only horses with a naturally good disposition were allowed to reproduce, with the result that Arabians today have a good temperament that, among other examples, makes them one of the few breeds where the United States Equestrian Federation rules allow children to exhibit stallions in nearly all show ring classes, including those limited to riders under 18. On the other hand, the Arabian is also classified as a \"hot-blooded\" breed, a category that includes other refined, spirited horses bred for speed, such as the Akhal-Teke, the Barb, and the Thoroughbred. Like other hot-bloods, Arabians' sensitivity and intelligence enable quick learning and greater communication with their riders; however, their intelligence also allows them to learn bad habits as quickly as good ones, and they do not tolerate inept or abusive training practices. Some sources claim that it is more difficult to train a \"hot-blooded\" horse. Though most Arabians have a natural tendency to cooperate with humans, when treated badly, like any horse, they can become excessively nervous or anxious, but seldom become vicious unless seriously spoiled or subjected to extreme abuse. At the other end of the spectrum, romantic myths are sometimes told about Arabian horses that give them near-divine characteristics."

This color is usually created by the natural action of the gray gene, and virtually all white-looking Arabians are actually grays. A specialized colorization seen in some older gray Arabians is the so-called \"bloody-shoulder\", which is a particular type of \"flea-bitten\" gray with localized aggregations of pigment on the shoulder. There are a very few Arabians registered as \"white\" having a white coat, pink skin and dark eyes from birth. These animals are believed to manifest a new form of dominant white, a result of a nonsense mutation in DNA tracing to a single stallion foaled in 1996. This horse was originally thought to be a sabino, but actually was found to have a new form of dominant white mutation, now labeled W3. It is possible that white mutations have occurred in Arabians in the past or that mutations other than W3 exist but have not been verified by genetic testing."

        "content": "One spotting pattern, sabino, does exist in purebred Arabians. Sabino coloring is characterized by white markings such as \"high white\" above the knees and hocks, irregular spotting on the legs, belly and face, white markings that extend beyond the eyes or under the chin and jaw, and sometimes lacy or roaned edges. The genetic mechanism that produces sabino patterning in Arabians is undetermined, and more than one gene may be involved. Studies at the University of California, Davis indicate that Arabians do not appear to carry the autosomal dominant gene \"SB1\" or sabino 1, that often produces bold spotting and some completely white horses in other breeds. The inheritance patterns observed in sabino-like Arabians also do not follow the same mode of inheritance as sabino 1. Rabicano or roan? There are very few Arabians registered as roan, and according to researcher D. Phillip Sponenberg, roaning in purebred Arabians is actually the action of rabicano genetics. Unlike a genetic roan, rabicano is a partial roan-like pattern; the horse does not have intermingled white and solid hairs over the entire body, only on the midsection and flanks, the head and legs are solid-colored. Some people also confuse a young gray horse with a roan because of the intermixed hair colors common to both. However, a roan does not consistently lighten with age, while a gray does."

        "content": "There is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity. Nonetheless, purebred Arabians today do not carry genes for pinto or Leopard complex (\"Appaloosa\") spotting patterns, except for sabino. Spotting or excess white was believed by many breeders to be a mark of impurity until DNA testing for verification of parentage became standard. For a time, horses with belly spots and other white markings deemed excessive were discouraged from registration and excess white was sometimes penalized in the show ring. Purebred Arabians never carry dilution genes. Therefore, purebreds cannot be colors such as dun, cremello, palomino or buckskin. To produce horses with some Arabian characteristics but coat colors not found in purebreds, they have to be crossbred with other breeds. Though the purebred Arabian produces a limited range of potential colors, they do not appear to carry any color-based lethal disorders such as the frame overo gene (\"O\") that can produce lethal white syndrome (LWS). Because purebred Arabians cannot produce LWS foals, Arabian mares were used as a non-affected population in some of the studies seeking the gene that caused the condition in other breeds. Nonetheless, partbred Arabian offspring can, in some cases, carry these genes if the non-Arabian parent was a carrier."

        "title": "Arabian horse_Genetic disorders",
        "content": "There are six known genetic disorders in Arabian horses. Two are inevitably fatal, two are not inherently fatal but are disabling and usually result in euthanasia of the affected animal; the remaining conditions can usually be treated. Three are thought to be autosomal recessive conditions, which means that the flawed gene is not sex-linked and has to come from both parents for an affected foal to be born; the others currently lack sufficient research data to determine the precise mode of inheritance. Arabians are not the only breed of horse to have problems with inherited diseases; fatal or disabling genetic conditions also exist in many other breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, American Saddlebred, Appaloosa, Miniature horse, and Belgian. Genetic diseases that can occur in purebred Arabians, or in partbreds with Arabian ancestry in both parents, are the following: Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, carriers (heterozygotes) show no signs. Similar to the \"bubble boy\" condition in humans, an affected foal is born with a complete lack of an immune system, and thus generally dies of an opportunistic infection, usually before the age of three months. There is a DNA test that can detect healthy horses who are carriers of the gene causing SCID, thus testing and careful, planned matings can now eliminate the possibility of an affected foal ever being born. Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), also called Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, carriers show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals are born with a coat color dilution that lightens the tips of the coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test. Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, homozygous horses are affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, but at some stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related to the death of the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia. Occipital Atlanto-Axial Malformation (OAAM). This is a condition where the occiput, atlas and axis vertebrae in the neck and at the base of the skull are fused or malformed. Symptoms range from mild incoordination to the paralysis of both front and rear legs. Some affected foals cannot stand to nurse, in others the symptoms may not be seen for several weeks. This is the only cervical spinal cord disease seen in horses less than 1\u00a0month of age, and a radiograph can diagnose the condition. There is now a genetic test for OAAM. Equine juvenile epilepsy, or Juvenile Idiopathic Epilepsy, sometimes referred to as \"benign\" epilepsy, is not usually fatal. Foals appear normal between epileptic seizures, and seizures usually stop occurring between 12 and 18\u00a0months. Affected foals may show signs of epilepsy anywhere from two days to six months from birth. Seizures can be treated with traditional anti-seizure medications, which may reduce their severity. Though the condition has been studied since 1985 at the University of California, Davis, the genetic mode of inheritance is unclear, though the cases studied were all of one general bloodline group. Recent research updates suggest that a dominant mode of inheritance is involved in transmission of this trait. One researcher hypothesized that epilepsy may be linked in some fashion to Lavender Foal Syndrome due to the fact that it occurs in similar bloodlines and some horses have produced foals with both conditions. Guttural Pouch Tympany (GPT) occurs in horses ranging from birth to 1 year of age and is more common in fillies than in colts. It is thought to be genetic in Arabians, possibly polygenic in inheritance, but more study is needed. Foals are born with a defect that causes the pharyngeal opening of the eustachian tube to act like a one-way valve \u2013 air can get in, but it cannot get out. The affected guttural pouch is distended with air and forms a characteristic nonpainful swelling. Breathing is noisy in severely affected animals. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and radiographic examination of the skull. Medical management with NSAID and antimicrobial therapy can treat upper respiratory tract inflammation. Surgical intervention is needed to correct the malformation of the guttural pouch opening, to provide a route for air in the abnormal guttural pouch to pass to the normal side and be expelled into the pharynx. Foals that are successfully treated may grow up to have fully useful lives. The Arabian Horse Association in the United States has created a foundation that supports research efforts to uncover the roots of genetic diseases. The organization F.O.A.L. (Fight Off Arabian Lethals) is a clearinghouse for information on these conditions. Additional information is available from the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO). Recent trends in halter breeding have given rise to Arabian horses with extremely concave features, raising concerns that the trait is detrimental to the animal's welfare. Comparisons have been made to a similar trend with some dog breeds, where show judging awarding certain features has led to breeders seeking an ever more exaggerated form, with little concern as to the inherent function of the animal. Some veterinarians speculate that an extremely concave face is detrimental to a horse's breathing, but the issue has not been formally studied."

        "content": "Arabian horses are the topic of many myths and legends. One origin story tells how Muhammad chose his foundation mares by a test of their courage and loyalty. While there are several variants on the tale, a common version states that after a long journey through the desert, Muhammad turned his herd of horses loose to race to an oasis for a desperately needed drink of water. Before the herd reached the water, Muhammad called for the horses to return to him. Only five mares responded. Because they faithfully returned to their master, though desperate with thirst, these mares became his favorites and were called Al Khamsa, meaning, the five. These mares became the legendary founders of the five \"strains\" of the Arabian horse. Although the Al Khamsa are generally considered fictional horses of legend, some breeders today claim the modern Bedouin Arabian actually descended from these mares. Another origin tale claims that King Solomon was given a pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad (\"the pure\") by the Queen of Sheba. A different version says that Solomon gave a stallion, Zad el-Raheb or Zad-el-Rakib (\"Gift to the Rider\"), to the Banu Azd people when they came to pay tribute to the king. This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend. Yet another creation myth puts the origin of the Arabian in the time of Ishmael, the son of Abraham. In this story, the Angel Jibril (also known as Gabriel) descended from Heaven and awakened Ishmael with a \"wind-spout\" that whirled toward him. The Angel then commanded the thundercloud to stop scattering dust and rain, and so it gathered itself into a prancing, handsome creature - a horse - that seemed to swallow up the ground. Hence, the Bedouins bestowed the title \"Drinker of the Wind\" to the first Arabian horse. Finally, a Bedouin story states that Allah created the Arabian horse from the south wind and exclaimed, \"I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I establish thee as one of the Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings.\" Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: \"I want to make a creature out of you. Condense.\" Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: \"I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be on your back and fortune shall come through your meditation.\""

        "content": "Arabians are one of the oldest human-developed horse breeds in the world. The progenitor stock, the Oriental subtype or \"Proto-Arabian\" was believed to be a horse with oriental characteristics similar to the modern Arabian. Horses with these features appeared in rock paintings and inscriptions in the Arabian Peninsula dating back 3500 years. In ancient history throughout the Ancient Near East, horses with refined heads and high-carried tails were depicted in artwork, particularly that of Ancient Egypt in the 16th century BC. Some scholars of the Arabian horse once theorized that the Arabian came from a separate subspecies of horse, known as equus caballus pumpelli. Other scholars, including Gladys Brown Edwards, a noted Arabian researcher, believe that the \"dry\" oriental horses of the desert, from which the modern Arabian developed, were more likely Equus ferus caballus with specific landrace characteristics based on the environments in which they lived, rather than being a separate subspecies. Horses with similar, though not identical, physical characteristics include the Marwari horse of India, the Barb of North Africa, the Akhal-Teke of western Asia and the now-extinct Turkoman Horse. Recent genetic studies of mitochondrial DNA in Arabian horses of Polish and American breeding suggest that the modern breed has heterogeneous origins with ten haplogroups. The modern concept of breed purity in the modern population cannot be traced beyond 200 years."

        "content": "There are different theories about where the ancestors of the Arabian originally lived. Most evidence suggests the proto-Arabian came from the area along the northern edge of the Fertile Crescent. Another hypothesis suggests the southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula, in modern-day Yemen, where three now-dry riverbeds indicate good natural pastures existed long ago, perhaps as far back as the Ice Age. This hypothesis has gained renewed attention following a 2010 discovery of artifacts dated between 6590 and 7250 BCE in Al-Magar, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, that appeared to portray horses. The proto-Arabian horse may have been domesticated by the people of the Arabian peninsula known today as the Bedouin, some time after they learned to use the camel, approximately 4,000\u20135,000\u00a0years ago. One theory is that this development occurred in the Nejd plateau in central Arabia. Other scholars, noting that horses were common in the Fertile Crescent but rare in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise of Islam, theorize that the breed as it is known today only developed in large numbers when the conversion of the Persians to Islam in the 7th century brought knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship to the Bedouin. The oldest depictions in the Arabian Peninsula of horses that are clearly domesticated date no earlier than 1800-2000 BCE. Regardless of origin, climate and culture ultimately created the Arabian. The desert environment required a domesticated horse to cooperate with humans to survive; humans were the only providers of food and water in certain areas, and even hardy Arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive (most horses can only live about 72\u00a0hours without water). Where there was no pasture or water, the Bedouin fed their horses dates and camel's milk. The desert horse needed the ability to thrive on very little food, and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life in a dry climate with wide temperature extremes from day to night. Weak individuals were weeded out of the breeding pool, and the animals that remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare. The Bedouin way of life depended on camels and horses: Arabians were bred to be war horses with speed, endurance, soundness, and intelligence. Because many raids required stealth, mares were preferred over stallions as they were quieter, and therefore would not give away the position of the fighters. A good disposition was also critical; prized war mares were often brought inside family tents to prevent theft and for protection from weather and predators. Though appearance was not necessarily a survival factor, the Bedouin bred for refinement and beauty in their horses as well as for more practical features."

        "content": "For centuries, the Bedouin tracked the ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition. Horses of the purest blood were known as Asil and crossbreeding with non-Asil horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin did not believe in gelding male horses, and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses, thus they kept very few colts, selling most, and culling those of poor quality. Over time, the Bedouin developed several sub-types or strains of Arabian horse, each with unique characteristics, and traced through the maternal line only. According to the Arabian Horse Association, the five primary strains were known as the Keheilan, Seglawi, Abeyan, Hamdani and Hadban. Carl Raswan, a promoter and writer about Arabian horses from the middle of the 20th century, held the belief that there were only three strains, Kehilan, Seglawi and Muniqi. Raswan felt that these strains represented body \"types\" of the breed, with the Kehilan being \"masculine\", the Seglawi being \"feminine\" and the Muniqi being \"speedy\". There were also lesser strains, sub-strains, and regional variations in strain names. Therefore, many Arabian horses were not only Asil, of pure blood, but also bred to be pure in strain, with crossbreeding between strains discouraged, though not forbidden, by some tribes. Purity of bloodline was very important to the Bedouin, and they also believed in telegony, believing if a mare was ever bred to a stallion of \"impure\" blood, the mare herself and all future offspring would be \"contaminated\" by the stallion and hence no longer Asil. This complex web of bloodline and strain was an integral part of Bedouin culture; they not only knew the pedigrees and history of their best war mares in detail, but also carefully tracked the breeding of their camels, Saluki dogs, and their own family or tribal history. Eventually, written records began to be kept; the first written pedigrees in the Middle East that specifically used the term \"Arabian\" date to 1330 AD. As important as strain was to the Bedouin, modern studies of mitochondrial DNA suggest that Arabian horses alive today with records stating descent from a given strain may not actually share a common maternal ancestry."

Horses with oriental characteristics appear in later artwork as far north as that of Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. While this type of horse was not called an \"Arabian\" in the Ancient Near East until later, these proto-Arabians shared many characteristics with the modern Arabian, including speed, endurance, and refinement. For example, a horse skeleton unearthed in the Sinai peninsula, dated to 1700 BC and probably brought by the Hyksos invaders, is considered the earliest physical evidence of the horse in Ancient Egypt. This horse had a wedge-shaped head, large eye sockets and small muzzle, all characteristics of the Arabian horse."

It played a significant role in the History of the Middle East and of Islam. By 630, Muslim influence expanded across the Middle East and North Africa, by 711 Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and they controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula by 720. Their war horses were of various oriental types, including both Arabians and the Barb horse of North Africa. Arabian horses also spread to the rest of the world via the Ottoman Empire, which rose in 1299. Though it never fully dominated the heart of the Arabian Peninsula, this Turkish empire obtained many Arabian horses through trade, diplomacy and war. The Ottomans encouraged formation of private stud farms in order to ensure a supply of cavalry horses, and Ottoman nobles, such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt also collected pure, desert-bred Arabian horses. El Naseri, or Al-Nasir Muhammad, Sultan of Egypt (1290\u20131342) imported and bred numerous Arabians in Egypt. A stud farm record was made of his purchases describing many of the horses as well as their abilities, and was deposited in his library, becoming a source for later study. Through the Ottomans, Arabian horses were often sold, traded, or given as diplomatic gifts to Europeans and, later, to Americans."

        "content": "Historically, Egyptian breeders imported horses bred in the deserts of Palestine and the Arabian peninsula as the source of their foundation bloodstock. By the time that the Ottoman Empire dominated Egypt, the political elites of the region still recognized the need for quality bloodstock for both war and for horse racing, and some continued to return to the deserts to obtain pure-blooded Arabians. One of the most famous was Muhammad Ali of Egypt, also known as Muhammad Ali Pasha, who established an extensive stud farm in the 19th century. After his death, some of his stock was bred on by Abbas I of Egypt, also known as Abbas Pasha. However, after Abbas Pasha was assassinated in 1854, his heir, El Hami Pasha, sold most of his horses, often for crossbreeding, and gave away many others as diplomatic gifts. A remnant of the herd was obtained by Ali Pasha Sherif, who then went back to the desert to bring in new bloodstock. At its peak, the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif had over 400 purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, an epidemic of African horse sickness in the 1870s that killed thousands of horses throughout Egypt decimated much of his herd, wiping out several irreplaceable bloodlines. Late in his life, he sold several horses to Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt, who exported them to Crabbet Park Stud in England. After his death, Lady Anne was also able to gather many remaining horses at her Sheykh Obeyd stud. Meanwhile, the passion brought by the Blunts to saving the pure horse of the desert helped Egyptian horse breeders to convince their government of the need to preserve the best of their own remaining pure Arabian bloodstock that descended from the horses collected over the previous century by Muhammad Ali Pasha, Abbas Pasha and Ali Pasha Sherif. The government of Egypt formed the Royal Agricultural Society (RAS) in 1908, which is known today as the Egyptian Agricultural Organization (EAO). RAS representatives traveled to England during the 1920s and purchased eighteen descendants of the original Blunt exports from Lady Wentworth at Crabbet Park, and brought them to Egypt in order to restore bloodlines had been lost. Other than several horses purchased by Henry Babson for importation to the United States in the 1930s, and one other small group exported to the US in 1947, relatively few Egyptian-bred Arabian horses were exported until the overthrow of King Farouk I in 1952. Many of the private stud farms of the princes were then confiscated and the animals taken over by the EAO. In the 1960s and 1970s, as oil development brought more foreign investors to Egypt, some of whom were horse fanciers, Arabians were exported to Germany and to the United States, as well as to the former Soviet Union. Today, the designation \"Straight Egyptian\" or \"Egyptian Arabian\" is popular with some Arabian breeders, and the modern Egyptian-bred Arabian is an outcross used to add refinement in some breeding programs."

Others would have arrived with returning Crusaders\u2014beginning in 1095, European armies invaded Palestine and many knights returned home with Arabian horses as spoils of war. Later, as knights and the heavy, armored war horses who carried them became obsolete, Arabian horses and their descendants were used to develop faster, agile light cavalry horses that were used in warfare into the 20th century. Another major infusion of Arabian horses into Europe occurred when the Ottoman Turks sent 300,000 horsemen into Hungary in 1522, many of whom were mounted on pure-blooded Arabians, captured during raids into Arabia. By 1529, the Ottomans reached Vienna, where they were stopped by the Polish and Hungarian armies, who captured these horses from the defeated Ottoman cavalry. Some of these animals provided foundation bloodstock for the major studs of eastern Europe."

        "content": "With the rise of light cavalry, the stamina and agility of horses with Arabian blood gave an enormous military advantage to any army who possessed them. As a result, many European monarchs began to support large breeding establishments that crossed Arabians on local stock, one example being Knyszyna, the royal stud of Polish king Zygmunt II August, and another the Imperial Russian Stud of Peter the Great. European horse breeders also obtained Arabian stock directly from the desert or via trade with the Ottomans. In Russia, Count Alexey Orlov obtained many Arabians, including Smetanka, an Arabian stallion who became a foundation sire of the Orlov trotter. Orlov then provided Arabian horses to Catherine the Great, who in 1772 owned 12 pure Arabian stallions and 10 mares. By 1889 two members of the Russian nobility, Count Stroganov and Prince Nikolai Borisovich Shcherbatov, established Arabian stud farms to meet the continued need to breed Arabians as a source of pure bloodstock. In Poland, notable imports from Arabia included those of Prince Hieronymous Sanguszko (1743\u20131812), who founded the Slawuta stud. Poland's first state-run Arabian stud farm, Jan\u00f3w Podlaski, was established by the decree of Alexander I of Russia in 1817, and by 1850, the great stud farms of Poland were well-established, including Antoniny, owned by the Polish Count Potocki (who had married into the Sanguszko family); later notable as the farm that produced the stallion Skowronek."

        "content": "The 18th century marked the establishment of most of the great Arabian studs of Europe, dedicated to preserving \"pure\" Arabian bloodstock. The Prussians set up a royal stud in 1732, originally intended to provide horses for the royal stables, and other studs were established to breed animals for other uses, including mounts for the Prussian army. The foundation of these breeding programs was the crossing of Arabians on native horses; by 1873 some English observers felt that the Prussian calvalry mounts were superior in endurance to those of the British, and credited Arabian bloodlines for this superiority. Other state studs included the Babolna Stud of Hungary, set up in 1789, and the Weil stud in Germany (now Weil-Marbach or the Marbach stud), founded in 1817 by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg. King James I of England imported the first Arabian stallion, the Markham Arabian, to England in 1616. Arabians were also introduced into European race horse breeding, especially in England via the Darley Arabian, Byerly Turk, and Godolphin Arabian, the three foundation stallions of the modern Thoroughbred breed, who were each brought to England during the 18th century. Other monarchs obtained Arabian horses, often as personal mounts. One of the most famous Arabian stallions in Europe was Marengo, the war horse ridden by Napoleon Bonaparte. During the mid-19th century, the need for Arabian blood to improve the breeding stock for light cavalry horses in Europe resulted in more excursions to the Middle East. Queen Isabel II of Spain sent representatives to the desert to purchase Arabian horses and by 1847 had established a stud book; her successor, King Alfonso XII imported additional bloodstock from other European nations. By 1893, the state military stud farm, Yeguada Militar was established in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain for breeding both Arabian and Iberian horses. The military remained heavily involved in the importation and breeding of Arabians in Spain well into the early 20th century, and the Yeguada Militar is still in existence today. This period also marked a phase of considerable travel to the Middle East by European civilians and minor nobility, and in the process, some travelers noticed that the Arabian horse as a pure breed of horse was under threat due to modern forms of warfare, inbreeding and other problems that were reducing the horse population of the Bedouin tribes at a rapid rate. By the late 19th century, the most farsighted began in earnest to collect the finest Arabian horses they could find in order to preserve the blood of the pure desert horse for future generations. The most famous example was Lady Anne Blunt, the daughter of Ada Lovelace and granddaughter of Lord Byron."

Starting in 1877, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Lady Anne Blunt made repeated journeys to the Middle East, including visits to the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif in Egypt and to Bedouin tribes in the Nejd, bringing the best Arabians they could find to England. Lady Anne also purchased and maintained the Sheykh Obeyd stud farm in Egypt, near Cairo. Upon Lady Anne's death in 1917, the Blunts' daughter, Judith, Lady Wentworth, inherited the Wentworth title and Lady Anne's portion of the estate, and obtained the remainder of the Crabbet Stud following a protracted legal battle with her father. Lady Wentworth expanded the stud, added new bloodstock, and exported Arabian horses worldwide. Upon her death in 1957, the stud passed to her manager, Cecil Covey, who ran Crabbet until 1971, when a motorway was cut through the property, forcing the sale of the land and dispersal of the horses. Along with Crabbet, the Hanstead Stud of Lady Yule also produced horses of worldwide significance."

Notable among the survivors was the Jan\u00f3w Podlaski Stud. The Russian Revolution, combined with the effects of World War I, destroyed most of the breeding programs in Russia, but by 1921, the Soviet government reestablished an Arabian program, the Tersk Stud, on the site of the former Stroganov estate, which included Polish bloodstock as well as some importations from the Crabbet Stud in England. The programs that survived the war re-established their breeding operations and some added to their studs with new imports of desert-bred Arabian horses from the Middle East. Not all European studs recovered. The Weil stud of Germany, founded by King Wilhelm I, went into considerable decline; by the time the Weil herd was transferred to the Marbach State Stud in 1932, only 17 purebred Arabians remained. The Spanish Civil War and World War II also had a devastating impact on horse breeding throughout Europe. The Veragua stud was destroyed, and its records lost, with the only survivors being the broodmares and the younger horses, who were rescued by Francisco Franco. Crabbet Park, Tersk, and Jan\u00f3w Podlaski survived. Both the Soviet Union and the United States obtained valuable Arabian bloodlines as spoils of war, which they used to strengthen their breeding programs. The Soviets had taken steps to protect their breeding stock at Tersk Stud, and by utilizing horses captured in Poland they were able to re-establish their breeding program soon after the end of World War II. The Americans brought Arabian horses captured in Europe to the United States, mostly to the Pomona U.S. Army Remount station, the former W.K. Kellogg Ranch in California. In the postwar era, Poland, Spain, and Germany developed or re-established many well-respected Arabian stud farms. The studs of Poland in particular were decimated by both the Nazis and the Soviets, but were able to reclaim some of their breeding stock and became particularly world-renowned for their quality Arabian horses, tested rigorously by racing and other performance standards. During the 1950s, the Russians also obtained additional horses from Egypt to augment their breeding programs."

One of George Washington's primary mounts during the American Revolutionary War was a gray half-Arabian horse named Blueskin, sired by the stallion \"Ranger\", also known as \"Lindsay's Arabian\", said to have been obtained from the Sultan of Morocco. Other Presidents are linked to ownership of Arabian horses; in 1840, President Martin Van Buren received two Arabians from the Sultan of Oman, and in 1877, President Ulysses S. Grant obtained an Arabian stallion, Leopard, and a Barb, Linden Tree, as gifts from Abdul Hamid II, the \"Sultan of Turkey\". A. Keene Richard was the first American known to have specifically bred Arabian horses. He traveled to the desert in 1853 and 1856 to obtain breeding stock, which he crossed on Thoroughbreds, and also bred purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, his horses were lost during the Civil War and have no known purebred Arabian descendants today. Another major U.S. political figure, William H. Seward purchased four Arabians in Beirut in 1859, prior to becoming Secretary of State to Abraham Lincoln. Leopard is the only stallion imported prior to 1888 who left known purebred descendants in America. In 1888 Randolph Huntington imported the desert-bred Arabian mare *Naomi, and bred her to Leopard, producing Leopard's only purebred Arabian son, Anazeh, who sired eight purebred Arabian foals, four of whom still appear in pedigrees today."

Today there are more Arabians registered in North America than in the rest of the world put together. The origins of the registry date to 1893, when the Hamidie Society sponsored an exhibit of Arabian horses from what today is Syria at the World Fair in Chicago. This exhibition raised considerable interest in Arabian horses. Records are unclear if 40 or 45 horses were imported for the exposition, but seven died in a fire shortly after arrival. The 28 horses that remained at the end of the exhibition stayed in America and were sold at auction when the Hamidie Society went bankrupt. These horses caught the interest of American breeders, including Peter Bradley of the Hingham Stock Farm, who purchased some Hamidie horses at the auction, and Homer Davenport, another admirer of the Hamidie imports. Major Arabian importations to the United States included those of Davenport and Bradley, who teamed up to purchase several stallions and mares directly from the Bedouin in 1906. Spencer Borden of the Interlachen Stud made several importations between 1898 and 1911; and W.R. Brown of the Maynesboro Stud, interested in the Arabian as a cavalry mount, imported many Arabians over a period of years, starting in 1918. Another wave of imports came in the 1920s and 30s when breeders such as W.K. Kellogg, Henry Babson, Roger Selby, James Draper, and others imported Arabian bloodstock from Crabbet Park Stud in England, as well as from Poland, Spain and Egypt. The breeding of Arabians was fostered by the U. S. Army Remount Service, which stood purebred stallions at public stud for a reduced rate. Several Arabians, mostly of Polish breeding, were captured from Nazi Germany and imported to the U.S.A. following World War II. In 1957, two deaths in England led to more sales to the United States: first from Crabbet Stud on the demise of Lady Wentworth, and then from Hanstead with the passing of Gladys Yule. As the tensions of the Cold War eased, more Arabians were imported to America from Poland and Egypt, and in the late 1970s, as political issues surrounding import regulations and the recognition of stud books were resolved, many Arabian horses were imported from Spain and Russia."

The potential for profit led to over-breeding of the Arabian. When the Tax Reform Act of 1986 closed the tax-sheltering \"passive investment\" loophole, limiting the use of horse farms as tax shelters, the Arabian market was particularly vulnerable due to over-saturation and artificially inflated prices, and it collapsed, forcing many breeders into bankruptcy and sending many purebred Arabians to slaughter. Prices recovered slowly, with many breeders moving away from producing \"living art\" and towards a horse more suitable for amateur owners and many riding disciplines.

        "content": "Arabian horses were introduced to Australia in the earliest days of European Settlement. Early imports included both purebred Arabians and light Spanish \"jennets\" from Andalusia, many Arabians also came from India. Based on records describing stallions \"of Arabic and Persian blood\", the first Arabian horses were probably imported to Australia in several groups between 1788 and 1802. About 1803, a merchant named Robert Campbell imported a bay Arabian stallion, Hector, from India; Hector was said to have been owned by Arthur Wellesley, who later became known as the Duke of Wellington. In 1804 two additional Arabians, also from India, arrived in Tasmania one of whom, White William, sired the first purebred Arabian foal born in Australia, a stallion named Derwent. Throughout the 19th century, many more Arabians came to Australia, though most were used to produce crossbred horses and left no recorded purebred descendants. The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt's Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses and some of them became quite famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for Thoroughbred racehorses). The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding calvalry horses, especially around World War I. They were part of the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the Australian Pony, the Waler and the Australian Stock Horse."

        "content": "Arabian horses today are found all over the world. They are no longer classified by Bedouin strain, but are informally classified by the nation of origin of famed horses in a given pedigree. Popular types of Arabians are labeled \"Polish\", \"Spanish\", \"Crabbet\", \"Russian\", \"Egyptian\", and \"Domestic\" (describing horses whose ancestors were imported to the United States prior to 1944, including those from programs such as Kellogg, Davenport, Maynesboro, Babson, Dickenson and Selby). In the US, a specific mixture of Crabbet, Maynesboro and Kellogg bloodlines has acquired the copyrighted designation \"CMK\". Each set of bloodlines has its own devoted followers, with the virtues of each hotly debated. Most debates are between those who value the Arabian most for its refined beauty and those who value the horse for its stamina and athleticism; there are also a number of breeders who specialize in preservation breeding of various bloodlines. Controversies exist over the relative \"purity\" of certain animals; breeders argue about the genetic \"purity\" of various pedigrees, discussing whether some horses descend from \"impure\" animals that cannot be traced to the desert Bedouin. The major factions are as follows: The Arabian Horse Association (AHA) states, \"The origin of the purebred Arabian horse was the Arabian desert, and all Arabians ultimately trace their lineage to this source.\" In essence, all horses accepted for registration in the United States are deemed to be \"purebred\" Arabians by AHA. The World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) has the broadest definition of a purebred Arabian. WAHO states, \"A Purebred Arabian horse is one which appears in any purebred Arabian Stud Book or Register listed by WAHO as acceptable.\" By this definition, over 95% of the known purebred Arabian horses in the world are registered in stud books acceptable to WAHO. WAHO also researched the purity question in general, and its findings are on its web site, describing both the research and the political issues surrounding Arabian horse bloodlines, particularly in America. At the other end of the spectrum, organizations focused on bloodlines that are the most meticulously documented to desert sources have the most restrictive definitions. For example, The Asil Club in Europe only accepts \"a horse whose pedigree is exclusively based on Bedouin breeding of the Arabian peninsula, without any crossbreeding with non-Arabian horses at any time\". Likewise, the Al Khamsa organization takes the position that \"The horse...which are called \"Al Khamsa Arabian Horses,\" are those horses in North America that can reasonably be assumed to descend entirely from bedouin Arabian horses bred by horse-breeding bedouin tribes of the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula without admixture from sources unacceptable to Al Khamsa.\" Most restrictive of all are horses identified as \"straight Egyptian\" by the Pyramid Society, which must trace in all lines to the desert and also to horses owned or bred by specific Egyptian breeding programs. By this definition, straight Egyptian Arabians constitute only 2% of all Arabian horses in America. Ironically, some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had enormous difficulties being accepted as registrable purebred Arabians because many of the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper to verify the purity of their horses. However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007."

        "title": "Arabian horse_Influence on other horse breeds",
        "content": "Because of the genetic strength of the desert-bred Arabian horse, Arabian bloodlines have played a part in the development of nearly every modern light horse breed, including the Thoroughbred, Orlov Trotter, Morgan, American Saddlebred, American Quarter Horse, and Warmblood breeds such as the Trakehner. Arabian bloodlines have also influenced the development of the Welsh Pony, the Australian Stock Horse, Percheron draft horse, Appaloosa, and the Colorado Ranger Horse. Today, people cross Arabians with other breeds to add refinement, endurance, agility and beauty. In the US, Half-Arabians have their own registry within the Arabian Horse Association, which includes a special section for Anglo-Arabians (Arabian-Thoroughbred crosses). Some crosses originally registered only as Half-Arabians became popular enough to have their own breed registry, including the National Show Horse (an Arabian-Saddlebred cross), the Quarab (Arabian-Quarter Horse), the Pintabian the Welara (Arabian-Welsh Pony), and the Morab (Arabian-Morgan). In addition, some Arabians and Half Arabians have been approved for breeding by some Warmblood registries, particularly the Trakehner registry. There is intense debate over the role the Arabian played in the development of other light horse breeds. Before DNA-based research developed, one hypothesis, based on body types and conformation, suggested the light, \"dry\", oriental horse adapted to the desert climate had developed prior to domestication; DNA studies of multiple horse breeds now suggest that while domesticated horses arose from multiple mare lines, there is very little variability in the Y-chromosome between breeds. Following domestication of the horse, due to the location of the Middle East as a crossroads of the ancient world, and relatively near the earliest locations of domestication, oriental horses spread throughout Europe and Asia both in ancient and modern times. There is little doubt that humans crossed \"oriental\" blood on that of other types to create light riding horses; the only actual questions are at what point the \"oriental\" prototype could be called an \"Arabian\", how much Arabian blood was mixed with local animals, and at what point in history. For some breeds, such as the Thoroughbred, Arabian influence of specific animals is documented in written stud books. For older breeds, dating the influx of Arabian ancestry is more difficult. For example, while outside cultures, and the horses they brought with them, influenced the predecessor to the Iberian horse in both the time of Ancient Rome and again with the Islamic invasions of the 8th century, it is difficult to trace precise details of the journeys taken by waves of conquerors and their horses as they traveled from the Middle East to North Africa and across Gibraltar to southern Europe. Mitochondrial DNA studies of modern Andalusian horses of the Iberian peninsula and Barb horses of North Africa present convincing evidence that both breeds crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and influenced one another. Though these studies did not compare Andalusian and Barb mtDNA to that of Arabian horses, there is evidence that horses resembling Arabians, whether before or after the breed was called an \"Arabian\", were part of this genetic mix. Arabians and Barbs, though probably related to one another, are quite different in appearance, and horses of both Arabian and Barb type were present in the Muslim armies that occupied Europe. There is also historical documentation that Islamic invaders raised Arabian horses in Spain prior to the Reconquista; the Spanish also documented imports of Arabian horses in 1847, 1884 and 1885 that were used to improve existing Spanish stock and revive declining equine populations."

They are the leading breed in competitions such as the Tevis Cup that can cover up to  in a day, and they participate in FEI-sanctioned endurance events worldwide, including the World Equestrian Games. There is an extensive series of horse shows in the United States and Canada for Arabian, Half-Arabian, and Anglo-Arabian horses, sanctioned by the USEF in conjunction with the Arabian Horse Association. Classes offered include Western pleasure, reining, hunter type and saddle seat English pleasure, and halter, plus the very popular \"Native\" costume class. \"Sport horse\" events for Arabian horses have become popular in North America, particularly after the Arabian Horse Association began hosting a separate Arabian and Half Arabian Sport Horse National Championship in 2003 that by 2004 grew to draw 2000 entries. This competition draws Arabian and part-Arabian horses that perform in hunter, jumper, sport horse under saddle, sport horse in hand, dressage, and combined driving competition. Other nations also sponsor major shows strictly for purebred and partbred Arabians, including Great Britain France, Spain, Poland, and the United Arab Emirates. Purebred Arabians have excelled in open events against other breeds. One of the most famous examples in the field of western riding competition was the Arabian mare Ronteza, who defeated 50 horses of all breeds to win the 1961 Reined Cow Horse championship at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California. Another Arabian competitive against all breeds was the stallion Aaraf who won an all-breed cutting horse competition at the Quarter Horse Congress in the 1950s. In show jumping and show hunter competition, a number of Arabians have competed successfully against other breeds in open competition, including the purebred gelding Russian Roulette, who has won multiple jumping classes against horses of all breeds on the open circuit, and in eventing, a purebred Arabian competed on the Brazilian team at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Part-Arabians have also appeared at open sport horse events and even Olympic level competition. The Anglo-Arabian Linon was ridden to an Olympic silver medal for France in Dressage in 1928 and 1932, as well as a team gold in 1932, and another French Anglo-Arabian, Harpagon, was ridden to a team gold medal and an individual silver in dressage at the 1948 Olympics. At the 1952 Olympics, the French rider Pierre d'Oriola won the Gold individual medal in show jumping on the Anglo-Arabian Ali Baba. Another Anglo-Arabian, Tamarillo, ridden by William Fox-Pitt, represents the United Kingdom in FEI and Olympic competition, winning many awards, including first place at the 2004 Badminton Horse Trials. More recently a gelding named Theodore O'Connor, nicknamed \"Teddy\", a 14.1 (or 14.2, sources vary) hand pony of Thoroughbred, Arabian, and Shetland pony breeding, won two gold medals at the 2007 Pan American Games and was finished in the top six at the 2007 and 2008 Rolex Kentucky Three Day CCI competition."

The tricolor flag of Russia was itself inspired by the flag of the Netherlands. Historically, many Slavic nations and states adopted flags and other national symbols that used some combination of those three colors. List of Slavic countries that use or have used the colors include: Russia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, Montenegro, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. On the other hand, Belarus,  Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Poland and Ukraine have never adopted all the colors. (The flag of Poland is red and white, but has different roots that pre-date the pan-Slavic colors.) Yugoslavia, both the Kingdom (Kingdom of Yugoslavia, 1918\u20131943) and the Republic (SFR Yugoslavia, 1943\u20131992) was a union of several Slavic nations, and therefore not only sported the pan-Slavic colors but adopted the pan-Slavic flag as its own (later adding a red star). The later Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1992\u20132003); a federation of Serbia and Montenegro, and its successor state, the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (2003\u20132006) also used the pan-Slavic flag until the final dissolution of Yugoslavia in 2006. Serbia continues to use a flag with all three Pan-Slavic colors, along with Russia, Croatia, Slovakia and Slovenia. The flag of Slovenia was introduced in 1848, when a group of Slovenian intellectuals in Vienna, Austria created the tricolor flag (white-blue-red). Slovakia also has the same tricolor flag design as Slovenia and Russia. The first Slovak flag was also introduced in 1848."

Colonel Glenn Manning (Glenn Langan) receives orders to keep his men in the protective trench. Moments later, an unidentified small civilian aircraft crash-lands near the bomb site, and Glenn runs into the detonation area to rescue the pilot. Once in the detonation area, the bomb goes off, and Glenn is caught in the radiation. Surviving the blast, but suffering from third-degree burns over almost all of his body, Glenn is treated by specialist Dr. Paul Linstrom (William Hudson) and military scientist Dr. Eric Coulter (Larry Thor) at the army base hospital. Glenn's fianc\u00e9e, Carol Forrest (Cathy Downs), anxiously awaits a prognosis, but Linstrom refrains from telling her that the consensus is that Glenn is extremely unlikely to survive. The next morning, however, Linstrom and Coulter are stunned to discover that Glenn's burns have completely healed. That evening, Carol is prohibited from seeing him, and she learns that he has been moved to an army rehabilitation and research center in Summit, Nevada. She drives there and is admitted entry, and upon entering his room, she faints in horror when she sees he has mutated into a giant about 16 feet tall. The next day Linstrom tells Carol that Glenn's exposure to the plutonium blast has caused his old cells to stop dying, and his new cells to multiply at an accelerated rate, resulting in his growing proportionately 8 to 10 feet in height in one day. Linstrom admits that he and Coulter do not know if they can stop Glenn's growth, and that if they don't, he will continue to grow until he dies. The following day, he is at first frightened, then deeply disturbed. Carol sees him the next morning to comfort him, but he is now more than 22 feet tall, and distant and morose. While the public knows that he survived the explosion, the military has kept the truth of his condition secret. As Glenn's body continues to increase in size (now at 30 feet tall) Linstrom orders him moved to a tent large enough to provide shelter and recommends that Carol spend time with him. Despite her encouragement, he is angry and bitter. Linstrom eventually reveals that his heart is growing at only half the rate of his body and soon will be unable to support his enormous size and weight. That night, he loses his temper and shouts at Carol to leave him alone. The following morning, as Coulter reports to Linstrom that he may have found a solution to the phenomenal growth, Glenn disappears. The military, headed by Colonel Hallock (James Seay), conducts a 10-mile-wide search for the now 50-foot-tall Glenn, but with no results. When Carol asks Linstrom if she can help in their search, he cautions her that Glenn's condition may be affecting his mind. Coulter reveals that he has created a special syringe filled with a serum for Glenn's bone marrow that will stop his growth. Meanwhile, the local news relays that a \"giant man\" has been spotted approaching Las Vegas. As the military heads there, Glenn, now over 60 feet tall and confused, is drawn to the Vegas Strip. He wreaks havoc on various casinos, and after a policeman fires at him, he hurls a palm tree at the crowd that has formed. When the police become alarmed by his behavior, they begin firing at him, enraging him. He completely destroys the Pioneer Club's Vegas Vic sign, then heads toward Boulder Dam as military helicopters track his movements. Linstrom, Carol, and Coulter attempt to intercept Hallock's troops. After landing at the dam, Coulter and Linstrom take the enormous syringe and plunge it into Glenn's ankle. He removes it and spears Coulter with it, killing him. Glenn then picks up Carol and starts across the dam. Using a bullhorn to amplify his message, Linstrom pleads with him to spare her, and although he is disoriented, he complies. Once she is free, Hallock orders his men to open fire, causing Glenn to tumble into the Colorado River to his apparent death."

A town of the same name is adjacent to the fort. Fort Courage was named for the fictitious General Sam Courage (portrayed by Cliff Arquette). The fort itself is constructed in the stockade style typically found in most American Westerns. The commanding officer is the gallant although laughably clumsy Captain Wilton Parmenter (Ken Berry), who is descended from a long line of distinguished military officers. He is awarded the Medal of Honor after accidentally instigating the final Civil War charge at the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Only a private in the Quartermaster Corps, he is ordered to fetch the commanding officer's laundry (presumably General Grant's). As Parmenter rides away to get the laundry, he repeatedly sneezes. A group of Union soldiers mistake his sneezing for an order to charge, turning the tide of the battle and \"earning\" Parmenter the nickname \"The Scourge of Appomattox\". He also is awarded the Purple Heart after he is accidentally pricked in the chest by his father and commanding officer while receiving his first medal, making him known as \"the only soldier in history to get a medal for getting a medal.\" His superiors reward his action by promoting him to captain, only to give Parmenter command of remote Fort Courage, a dumping ground for the Army's \"least useful\" soldiers and misfits (the Secretary of War (William Woodson) notes \"Why, the Army sent them out there hoping they'd all desert\"). Indeed, of the three commanding officers at Fort Courage before Captain Parmenter, two did desert the army, while the third suffered a nervous breakdown. Much of the humor of the series derives from the scheming of Captain Parmenter's somewhat crooked but amiable non-commissioned officers, Sergeant Morgan O'Rourke (Forrest Tucker) and Corporal Randolph Agarn (Larry Storch). They, in league with the local (fictitious) American Indian tribe, the Hekawis\u2014led by Chief Wild Eagle (Frank de Kova), are forever seeking to expand and conceal their shady business deals covertly and collectively referred to as \"O'Rourke Enterprises\". Initially, rations and pay were drawn for 30 men at Fort Courage, though only 17 are actually accounted for (the other 13, according to O'Rourke, are Indian scouts who only come to the fort at night and leave before dawn). The pay of the fictitious scouts is apparently used to help finance the dealings of O'Rourke Enterprises. Although O'Rourke and Agarn try to take full advantage of Captain Parmenter's innocence and na\u00efvet\u00e9, they are also very fond of and fiercely protective of him, and woe be to anyone attempting to harm him. Parmenter also struggles to exert his authority outside the ranks. Very bashful, he tries to escape the matrimonial plans of his girlfriend, shopkeeper\u2013postmistress Jane Angelica Thrift, known locally as \"Wrangler Jane\" (played by Melody Patterson, who was awarded the role at the age 16, due to a forged birth certificate)\u2014though he becomes a bit more affectionate toward her during the second season. The episode \"Captain Parmenter, One Man Army\"  reveals that all of the soldiers (troopers) of \"F Troop\" have been at Fort Courage for at least 20 months, meaning they spent at least part of the Civil War there. They are so incompetent that when they are formed into a firing squad in the episode titled \"The Day They Shot Agarn\", all of their shots miss Agarn despite the fact they are standing only a few yards from him. The most common running gag through both seasons of the series (shown in every first season opening except for the pilot episode) involves the fort's lookout tower. Every time the cannon is fired in salute, the lit fuse burns out. Corporal Agarn or Private Dobbs then steps up and kicks the cannon's right wheel, collapsing the cannon and causing it to fire off target. The cannonball strikes a support leg of the lookout tower, bringing it crashing to the ground along with the trooper in it (in the opening credits, this coincides with the line in the lyrics, \"Before they resume with a bang and a boom.\") In one episode, an arrow brings the tower crashing down, and in another, Parmenter yanks down the tower with a lasso. In another episode, musical instruments being played loudly cause the tower to collapse. The fort water tower is also a frequent victim of this sort of gag. In one variation of the tower gag, Vanderbilt, Parmenter, O'Roarke, and Agarn are standing in the water tower platform when a lone Indian, \"Bald Eagle\" (played by Don Rickles), tries to capture Fort Courage by scaling the tower and jumping on the platform; the combined weight causes the floor to collapse and \"Bald Eagle\" to be captured. In another variation of the cannon gag, the cannon collapses as it is fired, and blows up the fort's powder magazine, causing Agarn to be saved from a vengeful Chief Geronimo. Another running gag during the second season involves dialogue between Sergeant O'Rourke and Agarn. In many episodes, a comment by Agarn sparks an idea in O'Rourke, who then says to Agarn, \"I don't know why everyone says you're so dumb\", to Agarn's apparent pleasure. Immediately the scene ends. Then, near the beginning of the next scene (presumably after a significant time lag), Agarn indignantly asks, \"Who says I'm dumb?\" Yet another dialogue gag between the two, occurring periodically during both seasons, has O'Rourke explaining something to Agarn, after which Argarn ponders for a second and says, \"That makes sense... not to me, but it makes sense.\""

        "content": "Captain Wilton Parmenter (Ken Berry) is the so-called \"Scourge of the West.\" As military governor of the territory and commander of Fort Courage, he is credited with keeping the peace (which is in fact really kept by O'Rourke's secret treaty with the Hekawi tribe \u2013- though other tribes seem to fear his reputation). Chief Wild Eagle knows him by a different title: \"The Great White Pigeon\". When the need to keep up appearances arises, the troopers and the Hekawis stage mock battles to fool Parmenter and outsiders. Parmenter is successful at \"keeping the peace\"; he just does not know why. He is well-meaning and sweet-natured, although essentially clueless and a bit gullible. He also invariably is kind and encouraging to his men, and always bravely leads them into action, albeit ineptly. A stickler for regulation and proper military conduct, he checks the Army Manual for even the oddest situations, such as \"If a soldier is captured by horse\". A perpetual klutz, Parmenter forever is jabbing himself, pinching his fingers in or on something, banging into, tripping over, or knocking things over. He cannot dismount a horse properly, and frequently becomes entangled with his ceremonial sword. Parmenter, originally from Philadelphia, comes from a \"proud family\" with a \"great military tradition.\" Among his ancestors are his first cousin Major Achilles Parmenter, second cousin Lt. Colonel Hercules Parmenter, uncle Colonel Jupiter Parmenter (Rod McGaughy), his father General Thor Parmenter and his great-grandfather Major Hannibal Parmenter\u2014who was with Gen. George Washington at Valley Forge. By contrast, Corporal Agarn's great-grandfather was a deserter. Jeanette Nolan played Parmenter's visiting mother (no first name given) in \"A Fort's Best Friend is Not a Mother\". When his sister Daphne Parmenter (Patty Regan) visits the fort, her eyes are on Private Dobbs. O'Rourke frequently calls Captain Parmenter \"the Old Man\" (in the sense that he is their leader) though Parmenter usually is surprised at being called that because he is fairly young (\"What old man?\"). In one episode, he receives a medal for accidentally capturing Chief Geronimo, who falls into a bear trap while trying to kill Corporal Agarn. (True to form, Parmenter captures the bear in the trap and then gets trapped in another bear trap.) In \"The Majority of Wilton\" (near the end of the series), he turns down a promotion to major because it would mean being reassigned to a new command and leaving F Troop. Sergeant Morgan Sylvester O'Rourke (Forrest Tucker) is the Sgt. Bilko of his day (as Agarn said to O'Rourke: \"When it comes to shifty, sneaky, double dealing ... you're the tops\"). Originally from Steubenville, Ohio, he has been in the Army at least 25 years, and it took him either 10 years to become a sergeant or has been a sergeant for 22 years as of his 25th anniversary.  O'Rourke's business dealings involve illegally running the local town saloon and an exclusive-rights treaty with the local Indian tribe (the Hekawi) to sell their \"authentic\" souvenirs to tourists and for the commercial market through the shady, undercover O'Rourke Enterprises operation. He also tries to find ways to fleece the men out of their pay through different schemes such as finding the men mail-order brides. Though most of his business schemes fail, he apparently is the only competent soldier in F Troop.  O'Rourke is mentioned as a veteran of the Mexican\u2013American War, but nothing is said about the Civil War. In \"The Sergeant and the Kid\", the tall and rugged O'Rourke shows his romantic side by taking an interest in the widow Molly Walker (Pippa Scott) and her son Joey (Peter Robbins). In \"Don't Look Now, But One of Our Cannons is Missing,\" O'Rourke claims he saved Agarn's life twice\u2014once from drowning and once when a rattlesnake bit him. (Coincidentally, Forrest Tucker actually served in the US Cavalry prior to World War II and played a similar \"O'Rourke\" cavalry sergeant on Gunsmoke.) Tucker's wife at the time, Mary Fisk, appeared in the series twice. She played Squirrel Girl in \"Lieutenant O'Rourke, Front and Center\" and Kissing Squaw in \"What Are You Doing After the Massacre?\". Corporal Randolph Agarn (Larry Storch) is O'Rourke's somewhat dimwitted sidekick and business partner in the shady O'Rourke Enterprises (his name is a play on both Randolph Scott and John Agar, who were cowboy stars). The character Agarn, originally from Passaic, New Jersey, took six years after enlistment to become a lowly corporal.  At the time of the series, Agarn has been in the cavalry for 10 years, and has been posted to Fort Courage for the last four, apparently spending the Civil War years at Fort Courage. He has impersonated Generals George Washington and Ulysses Grant. However, in dual roles, Storch played numerous lookalike relatives of Agarn, including his French-Canadian cousin Lucky Pierre, his Russian cousin Dmitri Agarnoff and his Mexican bandito cousin Pancho Agarnado, known as \"El Diablo.\" (In the same episode he also played Granny Agarn, Uncle Gaylord Agarn of Tallahassee and Pancho's sister Carmen Agarnado). Confrontational and often overly-emotional in every respect, Agarn frequently collapses in tears with the phrases \"Oh, Cap'n!\" or \"Oh, Sarge!\" (depending on whose chest he buries his head in). To get the men to attention, he barks out his trademark loud and exaggerated (but unintelligible) \"Aaaaa-aaahh\" command.  Whenever he becomes frustrated by something one of the troopers does wrong (which is often), short-tempered Agarn hits him with his hat which, unlike everyone else's, is white. A hypochondriac, Agarn thinks he has contracted the illnesses he reads or hears about or others around him have (including a horse). Agarn was briefly promoted to sergeant in the episode \"Lieutenant O'Rourke, Front and Center\".  Larry Storch was nominated for an Emmy Award for  outstanding performance by an actor in a leading role in a comedy series in 1967. Bugler Private Hannibal Shirley Dobbs (James Hampton) is F Troop's inept bugler, originally from New Orleans, who can only play \"Yankee Doodle\" and \"Dixie\" with regularity. Standard U.S. Army tunes such as \"Reveille\", \"Assembly\", and \"Retreat\" are only occasionally played competently. One episode had him playing a song, which Wrangler Jane says is a lovely rendition of \"Old Kentucky Home\", only for him to say he'd been trying to play \"Reveille\". A southern \"mama's boy\", he is also Captain Parmenter's orderly, as well as serving in the fort's cannon crew\u2014usually with disastrous results. Private Dobbs is a personal thorn in Agarn's side, with his regular taunts resulting in Agarn's frequent retort, \"I'm warning you, Dobbs!\", even threatening him with a court-martial. Dobbs learned how to use a lasso on his mama's alligator farm. Dobbs was briefly promoted to Corporal in the episode \"Lieutenant O'Rourke, Front and Center\". In one episode O'Rourke saved Dobbs from being married by explaining to a gold-digging mail-order bride that Dobbs was not a rich man! Trooper Vanderbilt (Joe Brooks) is the fort's lookout, who seems all but blind even with glasses (20/900 in each eye, according to Agarn) and answers questions from the lookout tower about what he sees with incongruous responses, such as \"No, thank you Agarn. I just had my coffee.\" He once allowed two Indians wearing feather head-dresses to enter the fort unchallenged. Asked why, he replied, \"I thought they were turkeys.\" In another episode he mistakes a flock of turkeys for attacking Indians. In one episode, he shoots his pistol in a crowded barracks\u2014and manages to miss everyone.  Vanderbilt was a bustle inspector in a dress factory before joining the Army. In the running gag that brings the lookout tower crashing to the ground,  the heavyset Vanderbilt is who comes down with it. Trooper Duffy (Bob Steele) is an aged old-time cavalryman with a limp, the result of his \"old Alamo injury\" acting up again. Duffy claims to be the lone survivor of the siege of the Alamo in 1836, and loves to recount his exploits alongside Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie, \"shoulder to shoulder and backs to the wall\" roughly 30 years before being in F Troop. (Steele was in fact a Western movie and serial star years earlier, even appearing in With Davy Crockett at the Fall of the Alamo in 1926, some four decades before F Troop). However, no one ever seems to take his claim seriously, and he may be engaged in telling tall tales. Parmenter discovered that Duffy is listed as dead in his service record (as Sergeant O\u2019Rourke noted to Captain Parmenter, Duffy's service record might need some updating)."

She owns Wrangler Jane's Trading Post and runs the U.S. post office in town. She is a telegrapher and the best sharpshooter in the territory. Whenever the fort is attacked she fights alongside everyone else usually shooting more Indians than everyone else. She is determined to marry the ever romantically elusive and na\u00efve Parmenter, and is often obliged to rescue him from his various predicaments. When she kisses the very bashful Parmenter, he usually says, \"Please Jane, not in front of the men.\" In \"The Sergeant and the Kid\", she replied back, \"But there're no men here\", to which he replied \"Well then, not in front of me.\u201d As part of this running gag, in the same episode after Jane mistakenly kisses Agarn, he says, \"Please Jane, not in front of the Captain.\" While Parmenter is reticent about showing any overt interest in Jane, he does become quite jealous if another man shows any interest in her. However, in \"Marriage, Fort Courage Style\" (one of the last episodes in the series), Parmenter finally shows a direct interest in Jane. He sets a date three months hence as the beginning of their engagement to be married (Parmenter explains the reason he has hesitated to marry Jane is that the Parmenters as military men are rather hard on their wives). The character had her own theme music; a banjo piece usually played on the soundtrack to cue her entrances, or initial appearance in each episode.

        "title": "F Troop_The Hekawi tribe",
        "content": "The Hekawi appear to be a very small tribe consisting of only one small village. They live an indeterminate distance from Fort Courage, though the directions to their camp are described as: \"Make right turn at big rock that look like bear, then make left turn at big bear that look like rock.\u201d In \"Reunion for O'Rourke\", Chief Wild Eagle explains how the tribe got its name: \"Many moons ago, tribe leave Massachusetts because Pilgrims ruin neighborhood! Tribe travel west, over stream, over river, over mountain, over mountain, over river, over stream! Then come big day... tribe fall over cliff. That when Hekawi get name. Medicine man say to my ancestor, \"I think we lost. Where the heck are we?\". \"Where the heck are we?\" became \"We're the Hekawi\" (the original name for the tribe in the series, 'Fugawi', was changed after the censors discovered the sentence \"Where the Fugawi?\"). The Hekawis are 50/50 partners in everything they do with O'Rourke Enterprises. They make most of the company's products, usually in the form of Indian souvenirs (on a commercial scale) and whiskey for the town saloon. They are a peace-loving tribe (mainly due to cowardice), and are self described as \"the tribe that invented the peace pipe\", \"lovers, not fighters\", and \"proud descendents of cowards\". Profit minded, the Hekawis look to be paid when O'Rourke needs them to do something like orchestrate a fake attack on the fort, and haggle over the price and how many braves would be in the attack (when O'Rourke balks at the price, the Chief reminds him that the Apache will gladly make a real attack on the fort for free). Because it had been such a long time, though, since they had been on the \"warpath\", when the series started, Agarn has to teach the Hekawis how to do a war dance, a clip of which was shown in the first-season opening credits. Anytime the tribe wants to contact the fort, they use smoke signals, which only O'Rourke can read. In one episode (and referred to in another), the Hekawis have a \"Playbrave Club\" (a parody of the Playboy Club) complete with go-go dancing and 1960s-style music. As a sly jest based on the myth that Native Americans are the 13th tribe of Israel, many of the Hekawi Indians were played by veteran Yiddish comedians using classic Yiddish shtick. The regular Indian characters (none of whom were played by Native American actors) include: Chief Wild Eagle (Frank de Kova) is the shrewd, cranky, but essentially good-natured leader of the Hekawi tribe, and business partner in the shady O'Rourke Enterprises schemes (in \"Reunion for O'Rourke\" Wild Eagle says he has been chief for 17 years). In spite of his gruff appearance, Wild Eagle said: \"Don't let name Wild Eagle fool you. I had changed it from Yellow Chicken\". Like all the Indian characters portrayed in F Troop,  he speaks with a mock American Indian accent in a semibroken English dialect stereotypical of American Westerns. Often, O'Rourke, Agarn, Parmenter, and Jane come to him for advice when they have a problem, and Wild Eagle has a wise old Indian saying for every occasion (such as \"Wise old Indian say you cannot make a fur coat out of a goose feather\"), which he often admits even he does not know the meaning of which or how it applies to the situation at hand. On differing occasions, he says he is the son of Crazy Horse, the brother-in-law of Sitting Bull, and the cousin of Geronimo.  De Kova and the character of Chief Wild Eagle became important enough by the beginning of the second season as to merit listing in the show's opening credits sequence. Crazy Cat (Don Diamond) is Chief Wild Eagle's goofy assistant and heir apparent. He often speculates on when he will become chief, but is subsequently rebuked by Chief Wild Eagle. Appearing sporadically in the early first-season episodes, he became a regularly featured character later in the first season, as Roaring Chicken and Medicine Man were phased out of the series.  \"Craze\" (as O'Rourke and Agarn sometimes call him) does become \"acting chief\" in the episode titled, \"Our Brave in F Troop\" (when O'Rourke and Agarn have to somehow sneak Wild Eagle into Fort Courage to see the Army dentist so he can get his tooth pulled).  Crazy Cat humorously comments on the situation, \"When Wild Eagle away, Crazy Cat play.\""

        "content": "Happy Bear/Smokey Bear (Ben Frommer) is an overweight, usually silent Hekawi brave in black braids and a fire ranger's hat (a parody of Smokey Bear of \"Only you can prevent forest fires\" fame). In the first season, Frommer appears (usually uncredited) as Happy Bear, sometimes as Smokey Bear, once as Papa Bear, as Red Arrow, and a few times without a name. In the second season, he appears solely as Smokey Bear. Overall, Frommer appeared in 52 episodes. Trooper Duddleson (Ivan Bell) is a sleepy, slovenly, obese soldier, who is hit on the head repeatedly by Agarn for having his body in line, but not his belly, or sleeping when he is supposed to be at attention.  He is sometimes upbraided by Agarn for having gravy stains on his shirt. Duddleson typically wears a printed piece of cloth instead of the standard yellow neckerchief.  According to his service record, Duddleson was a female impersonator with a carnival in civilian life. He appears in 45 episodes. Trooper Hoffenmueller (John Mitchum) is a trooper who can either only speak in his native German or  speaks English with a German accent, depending upon the episode. According to his service record, Hoffenmueller can speak Cherokee, Sioux, Apache, and Hekawi. \"We can use you as an interpreter ... just as soon as you learn to speak English\" \u2014Capt. Parmenter. He appears in 11 episodes. Mitchum did make an uncredited cameo in the second-season episode \"The Day They Shot Agarn\" as the man singing the ballad (for which singing he was credited) of the same name. John Mitchum's much more famous brother is tough-guy actor Robert Mitchum. Stagecoach Driver (Rudy Doucette) briefly appears in seven episodes, including one as Slim. Roaring Chicken (Edward Everett Horton) is an ancient Hekawi medicine man and son of Sitting Duck. He appears in only six episodes in the first season, and he \"invented\" the RoarChick test (a parody of the Rorschach test). Longtime veteran actor Horton parodied the role on the 1960s Batman TV series as \"Chief Screaming Chicken\". Horton was also the narrator of Fractured Fairy Tales, a popular segment of the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon series. Pete (Benny Baker), the bartender at the saloon, appears in five episodes. Charlie is the town drunk (veteran stuntman Harvey Parry and Frank McHugh). Fort Courage got Charlie from Dodge City. As Capt. Parmenter says: \"We were lucky to get him \u2013 Dodge had a spare\", and \"We're all proud of you Charlie; you're the fastest drunk in the West\". The role was created especially for Parry to show off his skills (he was in his 60s by then, but appears in only three episodes). In \"Will the Real Captain Try to Stand Up\", Charlie (McHugh) temporarily pretends to be the captain of F Troop, while Charlie's daughter, Cindy Charles (Linda Foster), is visiting because she thinks he actually is the captain of F Troop rather than the town drunk. Major Duncan (James Gregory) is Captain Parmenter's superior from the territory headquarters, who usually \"brings a saddlebag full of trouble,\" according to O'Rourke. According to the episode \"Too Many Cooks Soil the Troop\", Major Duncan had taken F Troop's quartermaster, clerk, blacksmith, and cook as transfers to his own fort. Gregory appeared twice as Major Duncan and once as the land baron Big Jim Parker who bought the town and the land the fort sits on. Secretary of War (William Woodson) appears in three episodes. Trooper Leonard \"Wrongo\" Starr (Henry Gibson) is a jinxed soldier (the name is a play on Beatles drummer Ringo Starr). He appears in \"Wrongo Starr and the Lady in Black\" and in \"The Return of Wrongo Starr.\" Alternative explanations are given for the origin of the jinx. Medicine Man (J. Pat O'Malley) is an unnamed Hekawi \"doctor\", who prescribes various tribal dances to treat diverse ailments. He appears in two episodes."

        "content": "Although the show's opening credits claim F Troop was created by Richard Bluel, a final arbitration by the Writers Guild of America eventually gave Seaman Jacobs, Ed James, and Jim Barnett credit. Episode writers included Arthur Julian (who, alone, wrote 29 of the 65 episodes; he also appeared as an undertaker in his \"Survival of the Fittest\" script), Stan Dreben (Green Acres), Seaman Jacobs, Howard Merrill (The Dick Van Dyke Show), Ed James, Austin and Irma Kalish, and the highly successful comedy writing duo of Tom Adair and James B. Allardice, who collaborated on some of the most successful American TV sitcoms of the 1960s, including The Munsters; My Three Sons; Gomer Pyle, USMC, and Hogan's Heroes. The series was directed by Charles Rondeau and Leslie Goodwins, among many others, and produced by William T. Orr and Hy Averback. I. Stanford Jolley, Forrest Tucker's former father-in-law, appeared as Colonel Ferguson in the 1966 episode \"Survival of the Fittest\". The entire series was shot on the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California. The plot engine of O'Rourke and Agarn's moneymaking schemes echoed that of an American television series of the late 1950s, The Phil Silvers Show, which had featured swindling by the wily Sergeant Bilko, also based at a \"peacetime\" Army base \u2014 albeit in the mid-20th century, although with the twist of involving local preindustrial aboriginals with US military men in money-making schemes. It also echoes some of the money-making schemes found in the American television series McHale's Navy, which was written by some of the same writers from the Bilko show. The concept of misfit troops sent out West bears some resemblance to the 1964 Western comedy Advance to the Rear. Melody Patterson lied about her age to get the part of Wrangler Jane. She was 15 at the time of her audition, but turned 16 by the time filming started. As a result, the romance between Jane and Parmenter was kept very low key during the first season. By the time production of the second season started, Patterson had turned 17 and Parmenter's affections were made stronger and Jane was made more sexually aggressive (Patterson was 10 days short of turning 18 when the last episode was aired). The show's ratings were still healthy after the second year (ranked number 40 out of 113 shows for the 1966\u201367 season, with a 31.3 share), but according to Tucker, Warner Bros.' new owners, Seven Arts, discontinued production because they thought it was wasteful for so much of the Warner Ranch to be taken up by a single half-hour TV show. Producer William Orr says the studio was also unhappy with the added costs of producing the show in color during its second season."

Following the successful sales from the \"Television Favorites\" sampler release, Warner Home Video released F Troop: The Complete First Season, with all 34 black-and-white episodes included. The Complete Second Season of F Troop was released on DVD on May 29, 2007. Both seasons of this show have been released on DVD by Warner Home Video.  The DVD features interviews with original F Troop members, writers, and other production personnel, as well as behind-the-scenes information. However, only one major actor from the series, Ken Berry, was interviewed for the half-hour special. Also, audio segments were included of an interview with actor Joe Brooks (Private Vanderbilt). The complete series has been released on iTunes in both standard-definition and remastered high-definition television. For the high-definition remaster, the original film elements were rescanned into high-resolution video."

While the colorful coat pattern is essential to the identity of the breed, American Paint Horses have strict bloodline requirements and a distinctive stock-horse body type. To be eligible for registry, a Paint's sire and dam must be registered with the American Paint Horse Association, the American Quarter Horse Association, or the Jockey Club (Thoroughbreds). At least one of the parents must be a registered American Paint Horse. There are two categories of registration, regular, for horses with color, and solid Paint-bred, for those without color."

If a solid-colored horse is bred to a regular registry Paint horse, it is possible to produce a spotted foal.  In some cases, such as the recessive sabino patterns, described below, even a solid colored horse may still carry genes for color.  However, in the case of the dominant tobiano pattern, a Breeding Stock Paint will not carry these color genes, though it may retain other desirable traits."

        "content": "Each Paint Horse has a particular combination of white and another color of the equine spectrum.  Most common are horses with white spots combined with black, bay, brown, and chestnut or sorrel.  Less common are horses with spot colors influenced by dilution genes such as palomino, buckskin, cremello, perlino, pearl or \"Barlink factor\", and champagne, various shades of roan, or various shades of dun, including grullo. Paints may also carry the gray gene and have spots that eventually fade to white hair, though retaining pigmented skin underneath the areas that were once dark. Spots can be any shape or size, except leopard complex patterning, which is characteristic of the Appaloosa, and located virtually anywhere on the Paint's body. Although Paints come in a variety of colors with different markings and different underlying genetics, these are grouped into only four defined coat patterns: overo (includes frame, splash and sabino), tobiano and tovero and solid. Breeding Stock Paints can sometimes showcase small color traits, particularly if they carry sabino genetics. Such traits include blue eyes, pink skin on lips and nostrils, roan spots, and minimal roaning."

        "title": "American Paint Horse_Terms for color patterns defined",
        "content": "Tobiano: The most common spotting pattern, characterized by rounded markings with white legs and white across the back between the withers and the dock of the tail, usually arranged in a roughly vertical pattern and more white than dark, with the head usually dark and with markings like that of a normal horse. i.e. star, snip, strip, or blaze. Overo: A group of spotting patterns characterized by sharp, irregular markings with a horizontal orientation, usually more dark than white, though the face is usually white, sometimes with blue eyes. The white rarely crosses the back, and the lower legs are normally dark. The APHA recognizes three overo patterns: Frame: The most familiar overo pattern, the gene for frame has been genetically mapped and in the homozygous form, results in Lethal White Syndrome (LWS). Visually identified frames have no health defects connected to their color, and are characterized by ragged, sharp white patches on the sides of the body, leaving a \"frame\" of non-white color that typically includes the topline. Sabino: Often confused with roan or rabicano, sabino is a slight spotting pattern characterized by high white on legs, belly spots, white markings on the face extending past the eyes and/or patches of roaning patterns standing alone or on the edges of white markings. Splashed white: The least common spotting pattern, splashed whites typically have blue eyes and crisp, smooth, blocky white markings that almost always include the head and legs. The tail is often white or white-tipped, and body markings originate under the belly and extend \"upwards\". Tovero: spotting pattern that is a mix of tobiano and overo coloration, such as blue eyes on a dark head. Solid:  A horse otherwise eligible for registration as a Paint that does not have any white that constitutes a recognized spotting pattern. \"Color\": An informal term meaning that the horse has a spotting pattern. (The opposite of \"Solid.\") \"Chrome\": An informal term of approval used in some geographic regions to describe a particularly flashy spotting pattern. Pintaloosa: An informal term used to describe the color of a horse that has been crossbred between an American Paint and an Appaloosa. Paint or Pinto? The terms \"paint\" and \"pinto\" are sometimes both used to describe paint horses. But \"Paint\" horses are the breed and \"Pinto\" is actually the coloring of the horse"

A registered Paint horse should conform to the same \"stock horse\" body type desired in Quarter Horses: a muscular animal that is heavy but not too tall, with a low center of gravity for maneuverability, and powerful hindquarters suitable for rapid acceleration and sprinting. When the American Quarter Horse Association emerged in 1940 to preserve horses of the \"stock\" type, it excluded those with pinto coat patterns and \"crop out\" horses, those born with white body spots or white above the knees and hocks. Undeterred, fans of colorful stock horses formed a variety of organizations to preserve and promote Paint horses. In 1965 some of these groups merged to form the American Paint Horse Association."

        "title": "American Paint Horse_Genetic problems",
        "content": "One medical issue associated with the breed is the genetic disease lethal white syndrome (LWS).  Also called Overo lethal white syndrome (OLWS) or, less often, white foal syndrome (WFS), it is linked to a recessive gene associated with the frame overo pattern.  Horses that are heterozygous carriers of the gene do not develop the condition and are physically healthy.  However, when a foal is born that is homozygous for the LWS gene, it should be humanely euthanized shortly after birth, or else will die within a few days from complications involving an underdeveloped intestinal tract.  A DNA test is available for LWS so that horses who are carriers of this gene are not bred to one another.  Horses can carry the LWS gene and not visibly exhibit overo coloring; cases have appeared in the offspring of both tobiano and solid-colored parents, though all cases to date are horses that had overo ancestors.  LWS is also not unique to Paint Horses; it can occur in any equine breed where the frame overo coat pattern is found. Due to the heavy influx of American Quarter Horse breeding, some Paints may also carry genetic disorders such as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA), equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (called PSSM - polysaccharide storage myopathy - in Paints, Quarter Horses and Appaloosas), malignant hyperthermia (MH) and glycogen branching enzyme deficiency (GBED).  The influence of Thoroughbred breeding puts some bloodlines at higher risk for Wobbler's syndrome."

Pictures, produced by David Weisbart, directed by Gordon Douglas, and starring James Whitmore, Edmund Gwenn, Joan Weldon, and James Arness. The film is based on an original story treatment by George Worthing Yates, which was then developed into a screenplay by Ted Sherdeman and adaptation by Russell Hughes. Them! is one of the first of the 1950s \"nuclear monster\" films, and the first \"big bug\" feature film to use insects as the monster. A nest of gigantic irradiated ants is discovered in the New Mexico desert; they quickly become a national threat when it is discovered that two young queen ants and their consorts have escaped to establish new nests. The national search that follows finally culminates in a battle with Them in the concrete spillways and storm drain system of Los Angeles."

        "content": "New Mexico State Police Sgt. Ben Peterson and Trooper Ed Blackburn discover a little girl wandering the desert, near Alamogordo, in shock and in a catatonic state. They take her to a nearby vacation trailer, located by a spotter aircraft, where they find evidence that the little girl had been there when it was attacked and nearly destroyed. It is later discovered that the trailer was owned by an FBI Special Agent named Ellinson, on vacation with his wife, son, and daughter; the other members of the girl's family remain missing. Now in an ambulance, the child briefly reacts to a pulsating high-pitched sound coming from the desert. She sits upright in the stretcher, but no one else notices her reaction, and she lies back down when the noise stops. At a general store owned by \"Gramps\" Johnson, Peterson and Blackburn find him dead and a wall of the store partially torn out. After a quick look-around, Peterson leaves Blackburn behind to secure the crime scene. Blackburn later goes outside to investigate a strange, pulsating sound. Gun shots are fired, the sound becomes faster and louder, and Blackburn goes missing. Peterson's captain later points out that both Johnson and Blackburn had fired their weapons at their attacker. More puzzling is the coroner's report on Johnson's brutal death, which includes a huge amount of formic acid being found in his body. The FBI sends Special Agent Robert Graham to New Mexico to investigate because one of the missing persons is an FBI Agent. After a strange impression is found in the sand near the Ellisons' trailer, the Department of Agriculture sends myrmecologists Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn) and his daughter, Dr. Pat Medford, to assist with the investigation. The elder Medford exposes the Ellinson girl to formic acid fumes, which releases her from her catatonic state; she screams in panic and yells \"Them!\". Medford's suspicions of Camponotus vicinus are validated by her reaction, but he will not reveal his theory prematurely. At the Ellinson campsite, Pat encounters a giant, eight-foot-long foraging ant. Following instructions from the elder Medford, Peterson and Graham shoot off the ant's antennae, blinding it, and kill it using a Thompson submachine gun. Medford finally reveals his theory: a colony of giant ants, mutated by radiation from the first atomic bomb test near Alamogordo, is responsible for the area's deaths. General O'Brien orders an Army helicopter search, and the giant ants' nest is found. Cyanide gas bombs are tossed inside, and Graham, Peterson, and Pat descend into the nest to check for survivors. Deep inside, Pat finds evidence that two queens have hatched and escaped to establish new colonies. Peterson, Graham, and the Medfords join a government task force which covertly begins to investigate reports of unusual activity. In one a civilian pilot (Fess Parker) has been committed to a Texas mental hospital after claiming that he was forced down by UFOs shaped like giant ants. Next, the Coast Guard receives a report of a giant queen hatching her brood in the hold of a freighter at sea in the Pacific; giant ants attack the ship's crew, and there are few survivors. The freighter is later sunk by U.S. Navy gunfire. A third report about a large sugar theft at a rail yard leads Peterson, Graham, and Major Kibbee to Los Angeles. An alcoholic (Olin Howland) in a hospital \"drunk tank\" claims he has seen giant ants outside his window. The mutilated body of a father is recovered, but his two young sons are missing. Peterson, Graham, and Kibbee find evidence that they were flying a model airplane in the Los Angeles River drainage-channel near the hospital. Martial law is declared in Los Angeles, and troops are assigned to find the ants in the vast storm-drain-system under the city. Peterson finds the two missing boys alive, trapped by the ants near their nest. He calls for reinforcements and lifts both boys to safety, just before being attacked and grabbed by a giant ant in its mandibles. Graham arrives with reinforcements and kills the ant, but Peterson dies from his injuries as the ants swarm to protect the nest. Graham and the soldiers fight off the ants, but a tunnel collapse traps Graham. Several ants charge, but he is able to hold them off with his submachine gun just long enough for troops to break through. The queen and her hatchlings are discovered and quickly destroyed with flamethrowers. Dr. Medford offers a philosophic observation: \"When Man entered the Atomic Age, he opened the door to a new world. What we may eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict\"."

        "title": "Them!_Production",
        "content": "When Them! began production in the fall of 1953, it was originally conceived to be in 3D and Warner Color. During pre-production, tests shots in color and 3D were made. A few color tests of the large-scale ant models were also made, but when it was time to shoot the 3D test, Warner Bros.' \"All Media\" 3D camera rig malfunctioned and no footage could be filmed. The next day a memo was sent out that the color and 3D aspects of the production were to be scrapped; widescreen black-and-white would now be the film's presentation format. Warner Bros. hoped to emulate the \"effective shock treatment\" effect of its previous science fiction thriller The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms; ultimately, however, the film was never made in widescreen. Because of the preparation of certain scenes, many of the camera set-ups for 3D still remain in the film, like the opening titles and the flamethrowers shots aimed directly at the camera. Although Warner Bros. was dissatisfied with the color results, the film's titles were printed in a vivid red and blue against a black-and-white background in order to give the film's opening a dramatic \"punch\". This effect was achieved by an Eastman Color section spliced into each release print. The 1985 VHS tape release, the subsequent LaserDisc and later DVD release have retained this black-and-white-with-two-color title effect. The entrance to the ants' final nest was filmed along the concrete spillways of the Los Angeles River, between the First and Seventh Street Bridges, east of downtown. The depiction of the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico is actually the Mojave Desert near Palmdale, California. Mercy Hospital was a real institution and is now Brownsville Medical Center. James Whitmore wore \"lifts\" in his shoes to compensate for the height difference between himself and James Arness. Whitmore also employed bits of \"business\" (hand gestures and motions) during scenes in which he appeared in order to draw more attention to his character when not speaking. The Wilhelm scream, created three years earlier for the film Distant Drums, is used during the action sequences: when a sailor aboard the freighter is grabbed by an ant, when James Whitmore's character is caught in an ant's mandibles, and when an overhead wooden beam falls on a soldier in the Los Angeles storm drain sequence. The giant ants, painted a purplish-green color, were constructed and operated by unseen technicians supervised by Ralph Ayers. During the climactic battle sequence in the Los Angeles sewers, there is a brief shot of one ant moving in the foreground with its side removed, revealing its mechanical interior. This blunder has been obscured in the DVD releases of the film. The film poster shows a gigantic ant with menacing cat-like eyes rather than the normal compound eyes of an ant. The sounds the giant ants emit in the film were the calls of bird-voiced tree frogs mixed in with the calls of a wood thrush, hooded warbler, and red-bellied woodpecker. It was recorded at Indian Island, Georgia, on April 11, 1947, by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology."

According to an article in Slate, this was Warner Bros. highest-grossing film that year. However, 1954 In Film lists two other films from Warner Bros. that earned more in gross. From contemporary reviews, the Monthly Film Bulletin stated that despite the science fiction film genre being new it had developed several sub-divisions including \"the other-worldly, the primaeval-monstrous, the neo-monstrous, the planet-ary-visitant, etc.\" and that \"Them! is a \"well-built example of the neo-monstrous\", \"less absurdly sensational than most\" Discussing the ant monsters in the film, the review referred to them as \"reasonably horrible--they do not entirely avoid the impression of mock-up that is almost inevitable when over-lifesize creatures have to be constructed and moved\", while noting that they were \"considerably more conceivable than those prehistoric remnants that have recently been emerging from bog and iceberg\". The review commented on the cast as \"like most science-fiction, [the film] is on the whole serviceably rather than excitingly cast\" and the crew was noted, stating the direction was \"smoothly machined\" and the film has \"decent writing\" though \"more short cuts might have been [taken]\", finding that the start of the film was too slow. A. H. Weiler's review in The New York Times noted \"... from the moment James Whitmore, playing a New Mexico state trooper, discovers a six-year-old moppet wandering around the desert in a state of shock, to the time when the cause of that mental trauma is traced and destroyed, Them! is taut science fiction\". The reviewer in Variety opined it was a \"top-notch science fiction shocker. It has a well-plotted story, expertly directed and acted in a matter-of-fact style to rate a chiller payoff and thoroughly satisfy the fans of hackle-raising melodrama\". John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote, \"If you're willing to let your imagination off its leash, you may have a fairly good time at 'Them!'\" Since its original release, Them! has become generally regarded as one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s. Bill Warren described it as \" ... tight, fast-paced and credible ... [T]he picture is suspenseful\". Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction noted, \"Directed by [Gordon] Douglas in semi-documentary fashion, Them! is one of the best American science fiction films of the fifties\". Danny Peary believed the film \"Ranks with The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers as the best of the countless '50s science fiction films\". In the Time Out Film Guide, David Pirie wrote, \"By far the best of the 50s cycle of 'creature features'\u00a0...\u00a0retains a good part of its power today\". The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating with an average rating of 7.6/10, based on 57 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"One of the best creature features of the early atomic age, Them! features effectively menacing special effects and avoids the self-parody that would taint later monster movies\". Them! was nominated for an Oscar for its special effects (but the award went to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea) and won a Golden Reel Award for best sound editing."

Sindoor is the mark of a married woman in Hinduism. Single women wear the bindi in different colors for special occasions but do not apply sindoor in their parting of the hairline. Widows do not wear sindoor or bindis, signifying that their husband is no longer alive. The sindoor is first applied to the woman by her husband on the day of her wedding; this is called the Sindoor Daanam ceremony. After this, she applies it herself every day. A similar coloring ritual is known as pasupu kumkuma, named after another name for sindoor, kumkuma. The wiping off of the sindoor is very significant for a widow. There are many rituals associated with this practice. The most common is when a mother-in-law or older sister-in-law wipes off the sindoor when a woman becomes a widow. The widow will break her bangles and remove her bindi as well, and many will also remove their nose ring and toe rings. The parting of hair is symbolic of a river of red blood full of life. When the sindoor is removed then the river becomes barren, dry and empty. This custom is prevalent in rural areas and is followed by all castes and social ranks. The red sindoor is significant for the married woman as she is full of colour. When she becomes a widow she adopts plain white dress and removes all colour from her face including the bright red sindoor. Methods and styles of applying the sindoor vary from personal choice to regional customs. Many new brides will fill the whole hair line with sindoor, while other married women may just apply a red spot at the end of the hair line and forehead. Recently, a triangle shape on the forehead pointing towards the nose, with a diamond bindi for fashion, is being worn by younger women."

        "content": "Nyah, a female commander from Mars heads for London in her flying saucer. She is part of the advance alien team looking for Earthmen to replace the declining male population on her world, the result of a \"devastating war between the sexes\". Because of damage to her craft, caused when entering the Earth's atmosphere, and an apparent crash with an airliner, she is forced to land in the remote Scottish moors. She is armed with a raygun that can paralyse or kill, and is accompanied by a tall, menacing robot named Chani. Professor Arnold Hennessey, an astrophysicist, accompanied by journalist Michael Carter, is sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the crash, believed to be caused by a meteorite. The pair come to the Bonnie Charlie, a remote inn run by Mr and Mrs Jamieson in the depths of the Scottish Highlands. At the bar they meet Ellen Prestwick, a fashion model who came to the Bonnie Charlie to escape an affair with a married man. She quickly forms a romantic liaison with Carter. Meanwhile, escaped convict Robert Justin (under the alias Albert Simpson), convicted for accidentally killing his wife, comes to the inn to reunite with barmaid Doris, with whom he is in love. Nyah happens across the inn, incinerates the Jamiesons' handyman David, and enters the bar. When she finds no one willing to come with her to Mars, she responds with intimidation, trapping the guests and staff within an invisible wall and turning Chani loose to vaporise much of the manor\u2019s grounds. Discovering Justin and Tommy, the Jamiesons' young nephew, hiding in the grounds, Nyah kidnaps Tommy as a possible male specimen, and sends Justin back to the inn under some manner of mind control. Nyah then brings Professor Hennessy aboard her spaceship to view the technological achievements of Martian civilisation, including the ship's atomic power source. In exchange for Tommy, Carter volunteers to go to Mars with Nyah. Realising that the only road to victory over Nyah requires trickery, Hennessy suggests Carter sabotage the ship's power source after take off. However Carter attempts a double cross before boarding the ship, snatching Nyah's controller for Chani, but this attempt is thwarted by Nyah's mind control powers. Carter is released by Nyah, and they both return to the bar, where she announces that she will destroy the inn and kill everyone within when she leaves for London. However she allows for one man to go with her in order to escape death. The men draw lots and Carter wins the draw, still hoping to enact Hennessy's plan to destroy the ship. At the last minute, Justin, alone at the bar and now free from mind control when Nyah returns, offers to go with her of his own free will. After take-off he successfully sabotages Nyah's ship, sacrificing himself to save the men of Earth, and atoning for the death of his wife, and allowing the survivors to celebrate their escape with a drink at the bar."

        "content": "In an interview with Frank J. Dello Stritto, screenwriter John Chartres Mather claimed that Devil Girl from Mars came about while he was working with The Danzigers, who were producing Calling Scotland Yard that appeared as both an American television series and as cinema featurettes in Great Britain and the British Commonwealth. When production finished ahead of schedule, Mather says he was ordered to use up the remaining film studio time already booked and paid for by working on a feature film for the Danzigers. The interview also claims Patricia Laffan's devil girl costume was economically made by designer John Sutcliffe. The film was made on a very low budget, with no retakes except in cases where the actual film stock became damaged; it was shot over a period of three weeks, often filming well into the night. Actress Hazel Court later said: \"I remember great fun on the set. It was like a repertory company acting that film\". The robot, named Chani, was constructed by Jack Whitehead and was fully automated, although it suffered breakdowns during the filming. The alien Klaatu, posing as  \"Mr. Carpenter\" in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), was intended by screenwriter Edmund H. North to evoke Jesus Christ, so too are there indications that the Martian woman Nyah was intended to evoke an anti-Virgin Mary image. Devil Girl from Marss sound editor was Gerry Anderson (listed as Gerald Anderson in the credits), later to create UK television series such as Thunderbirds. To save time and money, composer Edwin Astley reused his Saber of London score for the film."

There is really no fault in this film that one would like to see eliminated. Everything, in its way, is quite perfect\". Devil Girl from Mars developed a following via home video. Rolling Stone columnist Doug Pratt later called Devil Girl from Mars a \"delightfully bad movie\". The \"acting is really bad and the whole thing is so much fun you want to run to your local community theatre group and have them put it on next, instead of Brigadoon.\" American film reviewer Leonard Maltin said the film is a \"hilariously solemn, high camp British imitation of U. S. cheapies\". In the book Going to Mars the authors described the film as \"an undeniably awful but oddly interesting\" film. They noted that the plot was \"more a reflection of the 1950s view of politics and the era's inequality of the sexes than a thoughtful projection of present or future possibilities\". Eric S. Rabkin likens the character Nyah to a dominatrix and even a neo-Nazi. He said of the film that, \"a host of charged images and subconscious fears\" are handled with a broad camp irony. Otherwise, \"without some underlying psychological engagement, how could anyone sit through a movie so badly made\"? The film inspired Hugo and Nebula award-winning author Octavia Butler to begin writing science fiction. After watching the motion picture at age 12, she declared that she could write something better. Likewise, the Los Angeles avant-garde artist Gronk lists this film as the crucial factor that guided him in his career choice."

It co-stars Larry Johns, Herb Jacobs, Barbara Morrison, and Ernestine Barrier. The film was distributed by Lippert Pictures and is based on a story by Robert A. Heinlein, who shares the screenwriting credit with producer Jack Seaman. Project Moonbase is unusual for its time in both attempting to portray space travel in a \"realistic\" manner and for depicting a future in which women hold positions of authority and responsibility equal to men; as an example, the President of the United States is a woman. Mystery Science Theater 3000 featured the film in January 1990 as an episode during its first season on The Comedy Channel.

Colonel Briteis (pronounced \"Bright Eyes\", whose first name is never stated, played by Donna Martell), Major Bill Moore (Ross Ford), and Doctor Wernher (Larry Johns) are sent to orbit the Moon to survey landing sites for future lunar missions. However, Wernher is an impostor whose mission is to destroy the US's Earth-orbiting space station, which he plans to do by colliding the rocket with the station on the way back from the Moon. Col. Briteis, who made the first orbital flight around the Earth four years earlier, is arrogant and distrusting of Major Moore. Moore, in turn had a romantic interest in Briteis when they began in the United States Space Force, but was rejected in favor of Briteis's ambition to be the first person on the Moon. Moore realizes that the man claiming to be Wernher is actually a spy for an unnamed country, because the impostor has no knowledge of Wernher's expertise nor of the Brooklyn Dodgers, despite having supposedly taught in Brooklyn. In the ensuing struggle for control of the rocket, Colonel Briteis accidentally hits the boosters, which saves their lives but leaves the ship critically low on fuel. She takes unfair blame which Moore assures her is not her fault. Briteis then realizes she may not have all the answers and does need Moore's help on the mission. They are forced to make an emergency landing on the Moon, and with them all marooned the fake Wernher redeems himself by helping Moore establish communications with Earth, although an accident results in his untimely death. In response to the unexpected turn of events, the US authorities decide to make the immobilized spaceship the core of a Moon base. Later General Greene has a man-to-man talk with Moore about his feelings for Briteis. Moore expresses doubts about her feelings for him, and says \"she has no need for me.\" Briteis, after overhearing this, secretly proposes to Moore via Greene and cuts a deal with Madame President to promote Moore to brigadier general and in command of Project Moonbase to make up for her earlier actions towards him. Greene observes that Briteis and Moore will be isolated for weeks or perhaps months, and public opinion, the USSF and Madame President would want them to be husband and wife (in addition to general and colonel). After a video wedding officiated by a USSF chaplain, and witnessed by Greene, Briteis pins a paper star on Moore, thereby indicating his new rank (presumably O-7, Brig. Gen.), one above hers (O-6, Col.). The couple then kisses, thereby signaling the beginning of their married life, and the end of the movie."

The film was released in the U.K. by Eros Films; in the U.S. it was released in June 1958 by MGM as a double feature with The Haunted Strangler. Fiend Without a Face tells the story of mysterious deaths at the hands of a mentally created invisible life form that feeds on atomic power and then steals human brains and spinal columns to use as bodies in order to multiply its numbers. The screenplay by Herbert J. Leder was based upon Amelia Reynolds Long's 1930 short story \"The Thought Monster\", originally published in the March 1930 issue of Weird Tales magazine."

        "content": "U. S. Air Force Interceptor Command Experimental Station No. 6 is a long-range radar installation located in rural Winthrop, Manitoba, Canada. Unexplained deaths begin to occur in the general area of a farming village near the American base. Postmortems reveal the victims were murdered and the brains and spinal cords are missing from the corpses; the only clue left behind are two puncture marks at the base of each skull. The locals, however, become convinced that radiation leaks from the radar installation's nuclear-power experiments are the cause of the mysterious deaths. Air Force Major Jeff Cummings (Thompson) begins an investigation as the local deaths continue, interviewing various townsfolk, while looking for anything unusual. Cummings becomes suspicious of Professor R. E. Walgate (Reeves), a retired British scientist living near the airbase; Walgate is in the process of writing another book about his ongoing experiments with telekinesis, this time as it applies to thought projection. Major Cummings' suspicion of Walgate is later proved to be correct. The scientist finally admits he has not only succeeded in developing his mental ability, but in the process created a living thought projection. Unknown to Professor Walgate, the nuclear power radar experiments underway at the nearby U. S. airbase have greatly enhanced his mental abilities to the point that, through him, his living thought projection has become a malevolent and invisible new life form. It escaped from Walgate's laboratory and is now attacking humans as a means of replicating physical, though still invisible, new versions of itself, all of which are now feeding on the base's nuclear-generated power. The invisible creatures eventually attack and kill the military personnel at the airbase in order to take over control of the radar station's nuclear reactor; two of them dial-up the power to very dangerous levels. As they do so all the creatures suddenly become visible. Their now visible bodies are revealed to be the missing brains with spinal cords stolen from their victims; their spinal cords have become very flexible and have now sprouted tendrils. These mutations also allow the brain-spine creatures to move quickly and even leap distances; each brain-spine has also developed a pair of small eyes at the ends of extended eye stalks. The slithering creations then attack Walgate's home, where most of the film's principal characters have gathered to discuss the crisis. Some of the brains get inside by breaking through a boarded-up window using their tendrils, while others leap to the roof and slither down through the fireplace's open flue. Some of the defenders are attacked and killed, but well-aimed .45 semi-automatic pistol shots to the brains soon make short work of most of the attacking creatures; they gorily bleed out as they expire. Walgate exits his home as a diversion, but is quickly attacked and killed by his creation. Meanwhile, Major Cummings escapes out the back way and quickly heads to the airbase, where he saves the day by blowing up the radar installation's power machinery. This immediately robs the surviving brains of their high-energy food source, and the creatures quickly die, dissolving into puddles of goo."

Screenwriter Leder was originally set to direct the film, but being American, was unable to obtain a British work permit in time, so Crabtree replaced him as director. Thompson later said that when the director showed up on the first day of shooting and looked at the script, Crabtree claimed it was not the film he had been hired to direct, as he did not do \"monster\" films. After a heated argument with the producers, Crabtree left the set and did not show up for several days. In the interim, Thompson himself directed the film. Fiend Without a Face was made entirely in England. Its Canadian setting was chosen because it would appeal to both American and British Commonwealth movie audiences, while still being easy to replicate using the English shooting locations. U. S. Air Force stock aviation footage was also used to establish the military base setting and to pad out the film's meager running time. The producers used primarily expatriate American and Canadian actors working in the United Kingdom, plus a few British actors dubbed by Americans. The film's visible brain creatures were created using stop-motion animation, an unusual practice for such a low-budget science fiction thriller of this era. The director of these effects sequences was Florenz Von Nordoff, while the actual stop-motion was done in Munich by Nordhoff's partner, German special effects artist K. L. Ruppel. Peter Neilson headed up the British practical effects crew. During July 1958, Fiend Without a Face first opened in the United States at the Rialto Theatre in New York City's Theater District. The film's producers placed an outdoor, front-of-the-house exhibit near the sidewalk that showcased a \"living and breathing Fiend\" in a steel-barred glass display case. It periodically moved its spinal cord tail, startling onlookers, and also made menacing sounds with the help of a concealed electrical device. The crowds that gathered to watch the caged Fiend grew so large that NYC police finally ordered the display case removed because it was creating a public disturbance. Five months later, Fiend Without a Face created a public uproar after its British premiere at the Ritz Theatre in Leicester Square in London's West End. The British Board of Film Censors had demanded a number of cuts before its release and finally granted the film an \"X\" certificate, but newspaper critics were still aghast at its horrifying special effects. Questions were actually raised in Parliament as to why British censors had allowed Fiend Without a Face to be released, notably: \"What is the British film industry thinking by trying to beat Hollywood at its own game of overdosing on blood and gore\"."

James Rolfe called the film the \"best killer brain movie ever\" and stated that \"it may be the goriest film of its time\". Later reviews concentrated on the B-movie production values and lack of a cohesive plot. In Leonard Maltins review, he noted, \"...horrific climax, good special effects.\" Marcella Papandrea of The Super Network said about the film \"While the film gets off to a bit of a rocky start, it finds its footing fairly quickly though and it becomes quite immersive and intense.\" A reviewer for Harrison's Reports wrote in May of 1958, \"Up until the last two reels, this British-made science-fiction-horror program horror melodrama is fairly interesting in the usual fantastic sort of way, because it deals with unexplained, invisible monsters who strangle their victims and supposedly suck out their brains and spinal cords. During the final fifteen minutes, however, the picture, instead of being mystifying or horrifying, is just plain revolting, to an extent that even those with strong stomachs may not be able to take it... Because of its excessive gore, the picture is too unpalatable to be classified as entertainment.\" A reviewer for Motion Picture Daily in June of 1958 wrote, \"This entry in the science fiction, horror division sweepstakes is well and logically constructed, capably acted and directed with an eye toward building suspense. The cast is substantially unknown but exploitation of the horror angle is indicated and should be effective.\""

In the United States the film did only marginally well, however it was notable for doing better than most other British movies did in the U.S. that year (1958), and it was notable that it was a much bigger box office success in the south, midwest and California than it was in the northeast. An unusually large portion of the film's North American box office came from Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana as well as Southern California. This was notable because British films often overperformed in the northeast, whereas the film did \"okay\" in New Jersey the only states in the region where it did \"very well\" were Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and the very small media markets in Maine. Equally notable was that M.G.M.'s market research showed that American audiences appeared uninterested in The Haunted Strangler, which ran with Fiend Without a Face as a double feature, and Fiend Without a Face was the \"stronger draw by far\" in the U.S. market."

It was produced and directed by Phil Tucker, written by Wyott Ordung, and stars George Nader, Claudia Barrett, and George Barrows. The production company was Three Dimensional Pictures, Inc. The film was distributed by Astor Pictures. Robot Monster tells the story of the alien robot Ro-Man's mission to Earth to destroy humanity. He manages to kill all but eight survivors, who have become immune to his death ray. Ro-Man runs afoul of the Great Guidance, his leader, when he becomes attracted to the human Alice. She is the eldest daughter of a surviving scientist, and he refuses to harm her. The Great Guidance must now come to Earth and finish what the Moon robot started."

The survivors are a professor, whose name is never mentioned; his wife; their two daughters, Alice and Carla; their young son, Johnny; the professor's assistant, Roy; and space pilots Jason and McCloud (neither of whom is seen or heard). Both pilots depart in a rocket ship for an orbiting space platform. All eight have developed an immunity to Ro-Man's death ray, having received an experimental antibiotic serum developed by the professor. Ro-Man must complete the destruction of all humans, even if it means his physically killing them one by one, before his mission to subjugate the Earth is complete. After fruitless negotiations, Ro-Man destroys Jason and McCloud's spaceship, along with the space platform. He later strangles Carla, then tosses Roy over a cliff to his death. Ro-Man's mission is waylaid, however, when he develops an illogical attraction to Alice and cannot bring himself to eliminate her. Great Guidance (referred to as \"The Great One\"), leader of the Ro-Man Empire, destroys both Johnny and Ro-Man with a Calcinator blast. The Great One continues the genocide with Cosmic June Rays, which cause prehistoric reptiles to appear (stock footage from the movie One Million Years B.C.); and psychotronic vibrations, which \"smash the planet Earth out of the universe\". But Johnny is alive, having just awakened from a concussion-induced fever dream. Up to now, all that has happened has just been his nightmare. His sisters, their mother, and the two scientists, whom the family met while picnicking in Bronson Canyon, rejoice at finding him. Johnny and his family invite the scientists home for dinner; they accept. Suddenly, the Great Guidance, his arms raised in a threatening manner, walks out of the cave directly toward the audience."

Except for a few scenes at a house in Los Angeles and a building site near Dodger Stadium, most footage was filmed outdoors in Bronson Canyon, the site of innumerable motion pictures and TV settings. Principal photography on Robot Monster wrapped on March 23, 1953. Robot Monsters very low budget did not allow for a robot costume as first intended, so Tucker hired his friend Barrows, who had made his own gorilla suit, to play Ro-Man; Tucker then added a space helmet similar to those used in Republic serials such as Radar Men from the Moon. Robot Monster is similar in its plot to Invaders from Mars, released a month earlier by 20th Century Fox. Both films contain a young boy, stumbling upon an alien invasion, who is captured as he struggles to save his family and himself. As the alien commences the final destruction of Earth, the boy awakens to find it was all a dream. Barrett recalled in an interview that the film's original screenplay was designed as reality, but director Tucker changed his mind and then shot a new twist ending that showed the film's story has been a boy's dream that is about to come true. In Robot Monsters opening credits, \"N. A. Fischer Chemical Products\" is given prominent credit for the \"Billion Bubble Machine\", used as part of Ro-Man's communication device for reporting to his superior, the Great Guidance. The film was preceded in theatres by Stardust in Your Eyes, a one-reel 3D monologue by comic/impressionist Trustin Howard, performing under his stage name \"Slick Slavin.\""

He was only saved because he had written a suicide letter and sent it to a newspaper, which sent a reporter and some detectives to the hotel. He was discovered with a pass in his pocket from the psychopathic ward of a veteran's hospital. In the letter, Tucker said he had not been paid for Robot Monster and was unable to get a job. \"When I was refused a jobeven as an usher\", Tucker wrote, \"I finally realized my future in the film industry was bleak.\" It was revealed that Tucker and the producer had quarreled, and film exhibitors had instructions not to let Tucker in to see the film unless he paid admission. In Keep Watching the Skies!, a comprehensive history of 1950s and early 1960s American science-fiction films, author Bill Warren claimed that Tucker's attempted suicide was due to depression and a dispute with the film's distributor, who had allegedly refused to pay Tucker his contracted percentage of the film's profits. The actors connected to Robot Monster included George Nader, who won the Golden Globe in 1955 as \"Most Promising Male Newcomer of the Year\" (although his award was not tied to his Robot Monster performance). He signed with Universal Studios, where he starred only in secondary features. Selena Royle, an MGM stock player, had a durable film career beginning in 1941, but it ended in 1951 when she was branded a Communist sympathizer. She refused to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and eventually cleared her name. By then, the damage to her reputation had already been done; she made only two additional films, Robot Monster being her last."

The project started in 1984, when Hamann wrote a short 30- to 40-page script. Tarantino became attached to the project as co-writer and director, and he and Hamann expanded the script to 80 pages. On an estimated budget of $5,000, the film was originally planned in a Super 8mm format. However,   when Tarantino was able to borrow a 16mm camera from film director Fred Olen Ray, the film was shot in 16mm over the course of the next four years. Hamann and Tarantino starred in the film, along with several video store and acting class buddies, and worked on the crew, which included fellow Video Archives employees Rand Vossler and Roger Avary. It is the most overtly comedic film that Tarantino has made. In an interview with Charlie Rose (available on the Region 1 Collector's Edition DVD of Pulp Fiction), he referred to it as a \"Martin and Lewis kind of thing.\" It was long alleged that the original cut was about 70 minutes long, but due to a film lab fire, only 36 minutes of the film still exist. In 2019, a book titled My Best Friend's Birthday: The Making of a Quentin Tarantino Film, written by Andrew J. Rausch, was published by BearManor Media. The book features interviews with all of the film's principal personnel, including Quentin Tarantino, Craig Hamann, and Roger Avary. In the book, it is revealed the fire story was fabricated, with Tarantino choosing not to dismiss it as he thought it sounded interesting. In actuality, some rolls of film were simply discarded by mistake, and Tarantino, unsatisfied with the final product, edited together the scenes he liked, leaving the project unfinished. However, he has not dismissed the possibility of restoring and completing the film one day. The surviving footage has been edited together and shown at several film festivals."

        "content": "The Lusitano, also known as the Pure Blood Lusitano or PSL (Puro Sangue Lusitano), is a Portuguese horse breed. Horses were known to be present on the Iberian Peninsula as far back as 20,000 BC, and by 800 BC the region was renowned for its war horses. The fame of the horses from Lusitania goes back to the Roman Age, which attributed its speed to the influence of the West wind, who was considered capable of fertilizing the mares. When the Muslims invaded Iberia in 711 AD, they brought Arabian horses with them that were crossed with the native horses, developing a horse that became useful for war, dressage and bull fighting. The Portuguese horse was named the Lusitano, after the word Lusitania, the ancient Roman name for the region that modern Portugal occupies. There are four main breed lineages within the breed today, and characteristics differ slightly between each line. Lusitanos can be any solid color, although they are generally gray, bay or chestnut. Horses of the Alter Real strain are always brown. Members of the breed are of Baroque type, with convex facial profiles, heavy muscling, intelligent and willing natures, with agile and elevated movement. Originally bred for war, dressage and bullfighting, Lusitanos are still used today in the latter two. They have competed in several Olympics and World Equestrian Games as part of the Portuguese and Spanish dressage teams. They have also made a showing in driving competitions, with a Belgian team of Lusitanos winning multiple international titles."

        "content": "Horses were known to humans on what is now the Iberian Peninsula as far back as 25,000 to 20,000 BC, as shown by cave paintings in the area. Among the local wild horses originally used by humans were the probable ancestors of the modern Lusitano, as studies comparing ancient and modern horse DNA indicate that the modern \"Lusitano C\" group contains maternal lineages also present in wild Iberian horses from the Early Neolithic period.  These ancient horses were used for war, with clear evidence of their use by Phoenicians around 1100 BC and Celts around 600 BC. It is believed that these invaders also brought horses with them, contributing outside blood to the ancestry of the modern Iberian breeds.  By 800 BC, the alliance known as Celtiberians had been formed by the Iberians and Celts, and from this point on the horses bred in this area were renowned as war horses. Xenophon, writing around 370 BC, admired the advanced horsemanship and riding techniques used by Iberian horsemen in war, made possible in part by their agile horses. Legend claimed that mares of the area were sired by the wind (hence their amazing swiftness, passed onto their foals), and one modern hypothesis suggests that the bond between Iberian humans and horses was the initial inspiration for the centaur, which was believed to come from the area of the Tagus River. Later invasions into the area by Carthaginians and Romans resulted in these civilizations establishing stud farms that bred cavalry horses for the Roman army from local stock. When the Umayyad Muslims invaded the Iberian peninsula in 711 AD, their invasion brought Barb horses, which were crossed with native Iberian horses. The cross between these two breeds produced a war horse superior even to the original Iberian horse, and it was this new type that the Conquistadors introduced to the Americas. Called the Iberian war horse, this ancestor of the Lusitano was used both on the battlefield and in major riding academies throughout Europe. Bullfighting on horseback and displays of high school dressage were common entertainment for the Portuguese gentry. Mitochondrial DNA studies of the closely related modern Andalusian horse, compared to the Barb horse of North Africa, present convincing evidence that Barbs and Iberian horses crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in each direction, were crossbred with each other, and thus each influenced the other's maternal bloodlines.  While Portuguese historian Ruy d'Andrade hypothesized that the ancient Sorraia breed was an ancestor of the Southern Iberian breeds, including the Lusitano,  genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA show that the Sorraia is part of a genetic cluster that is largely separated from most Iberian breeds. One maternal lineage is shared with the Lusitano, however, Sorraia lineages in Iberian breeds are relatively recent, dating to the Middle Ages, making the Sorraia an unlikely prehistoric ancestor of the Lusitano. Prior to modern times, horse breeds throughout Europe were known primarily by the name of the region where they were bred. The Lusitano takes its name from Lusitania, an ancient Roman name for the region that today is Portugal. A very similar horse, the Spanish Andalusian, originally described the horses of distinct quality that came from Andalusia in Spain. Some sources state that the Andalusian and the Lusitano are genetically the same breed, and the only difference is the country in which individual horses are born. The Lusitano is also known as the Portuguese, Peninsular, National or Betico-lusitano horse. During the 16th and 17th centuries, horses moved continually between Spain and Portugal, and horses from the studs of Andalusia were used to improve the Portuguese cavalry. Portugal's successful restoration war against Spain (1640\u20131668) was in part based on mounted troops riding war horses of Spanish blood. During the reign of Philip III of Portugal (also Philip IV of Spain), Portuguese horse breeding reached its lowest point. The Spanish passed laws to halt the country's production of cavalry horses, and what stud farms did exist were run in secrecy with horses smuggled or stolen from Spain. These secret farms, however, provided the base for the modern Lusitano. In 1662, when Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza of Portugal, the royal dowry included Portugal's Tangier and Bombay garrisons. These garrisons included large groups of Portuguese cavalry, mounted on Iberian horses. Prior to the 1960s, the Iberian-type horse was called the Andalusian in both Portugal and Spain. In 1966, the Lusitano name was adopted by Portugal after a studbook separation by the two countries. The revolutions of Portugal's African colonies resulted in the near economic collapse of Portugal. The landed class attracted political agitators, estates were vacated, and stud farms were broken up and their horses sold to Spain. However, the best lines were saved through the efforts of breeders, and breeding soon increased. Today, Lusitanos are bred mainly in Portugal and Brazil, but maintain a presence in many other countries throughout the world, including Australia, the United States, Great Britain, South Africa, and other European countries. Crossbred horses of partial Lusitano blood are popular, especially when crossed with Andalusian, Arabian or Thoroughbred blood."

The Portuguese School of Equestrian Art (Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre) uses these horses exclusively in their performances. The strain was developed from 300 Iberian mares imported from Spain in 1747. When Napoleon invaded Spain in the early 19th century, the Alter Real strain deteriorated due to the introduction of Arabian, Thoroughbred, Spanish-Norman and Hanoverian blood. However, in the 19th and 20th centuries the strain was re-established with the further introduction of Spanish blood. In the early 20th century, with the 1910 revolution that ended the monarchy, the Alter Real strain faced extinction, as records were burned, stallions were gelded and the stud discontinued. Ruy d'Andrade, a specialist in Iberian horse breeds, saved two stallions and several mares, and was able to re-establish the strain, turning his herd over to the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture in 1942, when the stud was reopened. The Portuguese state has maintained ownership of the stud, and continues to produce horses for use in high school dressage."

They usually stand  high, although some stand over .  Members of the breed have narrow, but well-proportioned, heads with profiles that are slightly convex. The necks are thick and arched, leading to well defined withers, shoulders that are muscular and sloping and a deep, broad chest. The horses have short, strong backs and rounded, sloped croups, leading to a low-set tail. The legs are sturdy and muscled. Lusitanos are known as powerful horses, noted for their intelligence and willing nature. The breed's gaits are agile and elevated, but generally comfortable to ride. The Lusitano differs from the Andalusian through having a more sloped croup, a lower-set tail, and a more convex head profile. The mane and tail are extremely thick in both breeds. The ancestors of the Lusitano were originally used for classical dressage, driving and bullfighting on horseback. Today, Lusitanos are seen in internationdisciplines, including high-level combined driving competition. In 1995, a four-in-hand team driven by Belgian Felix Brasseur won the FEI Driving World Cup, and took the World Championships in 1996. In 2002, there was a Lusitano on the World Equestrian Games bronze-winning dressage team that went on to collect a silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2006, the entire Portuguese dressage team rode Lusitanos at the World Equestrian Games, as did one Spanish dressage competitor. The Belgian Brasseur took the gold medal in four-in-hand driving at the same competition with a team composed solely of Lusitanos. They are still used for mounted bullfighting today, in a form where the bull is not killed and it is considered a disgrace to the rider if the horse is injured. Horses bred for this sport must be agile and calm, remaining in the control of the rider even when confronted by a bull.  Between 1980 and 1987, Lusitanos were used for breeding Colorado Ranger horses, although these crosses are no longer allowed by the breed registry. An Alter Real stallion, taken to Brazil prior to Napoleon's invasion, was a foundation stallion of the Mangalarga Marchador breed."

It stars Allen, Mia Farrow, John Malkovich, John Cusack, Madonna, and Kenneth Mars. It was filmed on a  set at Kaufman Astoria Studios, which was the biggest set ever built in New York. It was also Allen's last film for Orion Pictures. Shadows and Fog is an homage to German Expressionist filmmakers Fritz Lang, G. W. Pabst and F. W. Murnau in its visual presentation, and to the writer Franz Kafka in theme. Critical reception of the work was lukewarm."

        "content": "Kleinman is awakened from his sleep by a vigilante mob, which claims to be looking for a serial killer and therefore to be needing his help. Kleinman's landlady gives him a bag containing pepper. Irmy and her boyfriend Paul, a pair of circus performers, quarrel about getting married and having a baby. Paul leaves and goes to another tent where he has sex with Marie, another artist. Seeing this, Irmy runs to the city and enters a brothel. Irmy also ends up having sex with a student named Jack. Kleinman visits a coroner's house and has a glass of sherry with him. But after he leaves, the coroner is murdered by the killer. Kleinman comes to the police station to protest a local family's eviction. There, the police talk about the coroner's murder, saying that they have a clue about the killer in the fingerprints on the sherry glass. A panicked Kleinman meets Irmy in the police station, who had been arrested at the brothel for prostitution. She protests against the police calling her \"whore,\u201d and in the confusion Kleinman confiscates the evidence. Irmy is allowed to leave the police station after a $50 fine, and she meets Kleinman outside. Together they start exploring the city, seeing its different scenes \u2014 a man peeping into a woman's room, a starving mother and child, a church \u2014 and decide to go back. Paul arrives in the city looking for Irmy. He goes into a bar where Jack is having a drink. The student reflects on the wonderful experience he had with \"a sword-swallower,\u201d shocking Paul. Kleinman and Irmy return to his place to stay but are refused entry by his fianc\u00e9e. They go to the pier but are ambushed by the vigilante mob who find the sherry glass in Kleinman's pocket. Thinking him to be the killer, they decide to lynch Irmy and Kleinman, but the latter uses the pepper spray and they escape. Meanwhile, Irmy and Paul meet, and at first Paul is ready to kill Irmy for sleeping with another man. They break off their fight when they find the starving woman murdered, and the baby lying on the ground. They decide to keep the child and return to the circus. Kleinman comes to the brothel searching for Irmy but is unable to find her. From his rival at work, he learns about the circus leaving the town and decides to follow it. At the circus, Kleinman meets the magician Armstead, whom he greatly admires. The murderer arrives and tries to kill them but is thwarted by Armstead. Kleinman becomes Armstead's assistant on the circus and Irmy and Paul continue their careers as circus performers, while raising their newfound child."

It is different. It should not be anticipated in the manner of other Allen films. It's unpredictable, with its own tone and rhythm, even though, like all of the director's work, it's a mixture of the sincere, the sardonic and the classically sappy.\"  Variety similarly wrote, \"Exquisitely shot in black & white, Woody Allen's Shadows and Fog is a sweet homage to German expressionist filmmaking and a nod to the content of socially responsible tales since narrative film began. Allen's fans will regard this as a nice try that falls short.\""

        "title": "Joe McDoakes_Summary",
        "content": "Joe McDoakes is an American short film comedy series produced and directed by Richard L. Bare for Warner Bros. A total of 63 black and white live action one-reel short subjects films were made and released between 1942 and 1956. The Joe McDoakes shorts are also known as the Behind the Eight Ball (for the large eight ball Joe appeared behind in the opening credits) or the So You Want... series (as the film titles began with this phrase). The character's name comes from \"Joe Doakes,\" which was then a popular American slang term for the average man. The theme song of the series is \"I Know that You Know\" (music by Vincent Youmans) from his Broadway musical Oh, Please! (1926), used later in the MGM musical Hit the Deck (1955). George O'Hanlon, who would later provide the voice of George Jetson in Hanna-Barbera's animated sitcom The Jetsons, starred as the series' title character, Joe McDoakes. These one-reel shorts were co-written by Bare and O'Hanlon, although Bare usually received sole screen credit as writer. Art Gilmore, through 1948, served as the narrator of Joe's humorous efforts to accomplish the activity that was the focus of the short. Gordon Hollingshead, who won five Academy Awards for producing other short subjects for Warner Bros., was also credited as a producer on the series until his death in 1952, although his role on this series was primarily as liaison between the studio and the director."

        "content": "The series began with So You Want to Give Up Smoking, made as a project by Bare to teach his students at the University of Southern California the fundamentals of making a movie. It was picked up by Warner Bros. for $2500 and became the first of a series of short subjects. Only one more short was produced before World War II caused the series to be suspended, but production resumed in 1945 with So You Think You're Allergic. These first three shorts were filmed silent, with narration added in post-production, in the manner of the popular Pete Smith shorts, made at MGM from 1931 to 1955. They also resembled the Smith shorts in that they addressed actual, everyday problems (giving up smoking, caring for the eyes, coping with allergies) in an instructional but humorous way. In 1946 the series began using live sound recording, and the addition of dialogue gave the films a new dimension. Now the action was being played strictly for laughs, with many familiar character actors adding to the fun. Fritz Feld, Ralph Sanford, Philip Van Zandt, Fred Kelsey, and Leo White made frequent appearances; semi-regulars were Clifton Young and later Del Moore as Joe's loudmouthed pal Homer, Rodney Bell as dumb-bell \"helper\" Marvin, and Ted Stanhope as an all-purpose authority figure (desk clerk, salesman, businessman, etc.). Many of the shorts are domestic comedies, with \"the original hard-luck kid\" McDoakes insisting on carrying a project through, with often disastrous consequences. So You Want to Build a Model Railroad has Joe so engrossed in the hobby that it overruns his entire apartment; So You Want to Be a Cowboy has Joe going to a movie, and creating a disturbance when he envisions himself as a cowboy hero; So You're Going on a Vacation has Joe struggling with a camping outfit. Warner contract player Jane Harker co-starred as Joe's wife, Alice, in eight comedies, beginning with So You Want to Play the Horses in 1946 and ending with So You Want to Build a House in 1948. Screen newcomer Phyllis Coates took over the role in So You Want to Be in Politics. Coates had married producer/director Bare that same year; the working relationship between Coates and Bare would survive their divorce. Former singing star Jane Frazee assumed the role beginning with So You Want to Be Your Own Boss (1954), but Coates returned in 1956 for the last three installments. Harker, Coates, and Frazee each displayed a fine sense of comedy as Joe's long-suffering mate. While the Alice character would appear in most of the shorts, the actress playing her would not be billed, and unless the story required Joe to be married, not only would Alice not appear, but Joe could even be a bachelor again, as there was no continuity between installments. Star O'Hanlon and director Bare shared the same crazy sense of humor, which ran all through the series. So You Want to Be a Detective pokes fun at the detective mystery Lady in the Lake; the action is in the first person, with the camera representing Art Gilmore (taking a more active role in the story than usual), who is presumably tagging along with Joe. In So You Want to Be in Pictures, McDoakes is listening to a record that is providing an acting lesson, and when the telephone rings the record tells him to answer it. Later in that same short, McDoakes is hired to serve as a stunt double at a movie studio. The job turns out to be a George O'Hanlon comedy (the clapper board identifies it as So You Want to Hold Your Wife), and Joe takes a pie in the face from Jane Harker! So You Want to Know Your Relatives turns into a wicked satire of This Is Your Life, with Joe as the reluctant guest of honor. Joe occasionally punctuates the end of a scene by looking straight into the camera to speak to (or commiserate with) the movie audience. The series hit its stride in the late 1940s, gaining three consecutive Academy Award nominations in the category of Short Subjects, one-reel for So You Want to Be in Pictures (1947), So You Want to Be on the Radio (1948), and So You Think You're Not Guilty (1949). For most of the series's run, the McDoakes shorts were the only live-action comedies offered in the 10-minute length, making them handy for theater owners to include in their programs. The series ran until 1956, when the decline of the studio system brought an end to the production of short subjects by Warner Bros. and most of the other Hollywood studios."

The king summoned Mavrud's mother to learn the source of such courage. She said she had secretly saved a vine, made wine, and that this was the source of Mavrud's bravery. Khan Krum ordered the vineyards replanted.

The film also features Joyce Grenfell, Keenan Wynn and William Windom. Chayefsky's screenplay was loosely adapted from the 1959 novel of the same name by William Bradford Huie, who had been a SeaBee officer during the Normandy Invasion. The film is set in London during World War II in the weeks leading up to D-Day in 1944. Controversial for its stance during the dawn of the Vietnam War, the film has since been praised as a \"vanguard anti-war film.\" Both James Garner and Julie Andrews have considered the film their personal favorite of those in which they acted.

Charlie's job as a dog robber is to keep his boss and other high-ranking officers supplied with luxury goods and amiable Englishwomen. He falls in love with a driver from the motor pool, Emily Barham, who has lost her husband, brother, and father in the war. Charlie's pleasure-seeking \"American\" lifestyle amid wartime rationing both fascinates and disgusts Emily, but she does not want to lose another loved one to war and finds the \"practising coward\" Charlie irresistible. Profoundly despondent since the death of his wife, Jessup obsesses over the US Army and its Air Force overshadowing the Navy in the forthcoming D-Day invasion. The mentally unstable admiral decides that \"The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor\". A combat film will document the death, and the casualty will be buried in a \"Tomb of the Unknown Sailor\". He orders Charlie to get the film made. Despite his best efforts to avoid the duty, Charlie and his now gung-ho friend, Commander \"Bus\" Cummings, find themselves and a film crew with the combat engineers, who will be the first sailors ashore. When Charlie tries to retreat from the beach, the manic Cummings shoots him in the leg with a Colt .45 pistol. A German artillery shell lands near the limping-running Charlie, making him the first American casualty on Omaha Beach. Hundreds of newspaper and magazine covers reprint the photograph of Charlie running ashore, alone (in reality trying to escape from Cummings), making him a war hero. Jessup, having recovered from his breakdown, is horrified by his part in Charlie's death. He plans to use the heroic death in support of the Navy when testifying before a Senate committee in Washington, D.C. Losing another man she loves to the war devastates Emily. Then comes unexpected news: Charlie is not dead, but alive at the Allied 6th relocation center in Southampton, England. A relieved Jessup plans to show him off during his Senate testimony as the \"first man on Omaha Beach\", a sailor. Charlie, limping from his injury and angry about his senseless near-death, uncharacteristically plans to act nobly by telling the world the truth about what happened, even if it means being imprisoned for cowardice. By recounting what he had told her previously, Emily persuades Charlie to choose happiness with her, instead, and to keep quiet and accept his role as a hero."

        "content": "The Americanization of Emily is based on William Bradford Huie's 1959 novel of the same name. The New York Times ran a brief news item mentioning Huie's novel prior to its publication, but never reviewed the novel, although in 1963 Paddy Chayefsky's development of the novel into a screenplay was found worthy of note. A first draft of the screenplay for the film was written by George Goodman, who previously had a success at MGM with The Wheeler Dealers (1963), also with James Garner in the male lead and with the same director and producer. In 1964 a Broadway musical with music written by John Barry was announced. Chayefsky's adaptation, while retaining the title, characters, situation, background and many specific plot incidents, told a very different story. He said, \"I found the book, which is serious in tone, essentially a funny satire, and that's how I'm treating it.\" The screenplay's theme of cowardice as a virtue has no parallel in the novel; in fact, the novel does not mention cowardice at all. The screenplay implies, but never explicitly explains, what is meant by the term \"Americanization.\" The novel uses \"Americanized\" to refer to a woman who accepts, as a normal condition of wartime, the exchange of her sexual favors for gifts of rare wartime commodities. Thus, in reply to the question \"Has Pat been Americanized?\", a character answers: This theme runs throughout the novel. Another character says, \"We operate just like a whorehouse ... except we don't sell it for cash. We swap it for Camels and nylons and steak and eggs and lipstick ... this dress ... came from Saks Fifth Avenue in the diplomatic pouch.\" Emily asks Jimmy, \"Am I behaving like a whore?\" Jimmy replies, \"Whoring is a peacetime activity.\" The screenplay uses Hershey bars to symbolize the luxuries enjoyed by Americans and their \"Americanized\" companions, but the novel uses strawberries. The novel briefly mentions that Emily's mother, Mrs. Barham, has been mentally affected by wartime stress, but she is not a major character. There is no mention of her self-deception or pretense that her husband and son are still alive. The film contains a long scene between Charlie and Mrs. Barham, full of eloquent antiwar rhetoric, in which Charlie breaks down Mrs. Barham's denial and reduces her to tears while insisting that he has performed an act of kindness. The novel has no parallel to this scene. In the film, Charlie is comically unprepared to make the documentary film demanded by Admiral Jessup and is assisted only by bumbling drunken servicemen played by Keenan Wynn and Steve Franken. But in the novel, Charlie has been a PR professional in civilian life, takes the assignment seriously and leads a team of competent cinematographers."

        "content": "Author and amateur astronomer John Putnam (Richard Carlson) and schoolteacher Ellen Fields (Barbara Rush) watch a large meteorite crash near the small town of Sand Rock, Arizona. They awaken a neighbor, who has a helicopter, and all three fly to the crash site. Putnam climbs down into the crater and notices a partially buried round object in the crater's pit. He comes to the realization, after he sees a six-sided hatchway close, that this isn't a meteorite but a large alien spaceship. The hatchway's noise starts a landslide that completely buries the craft. Putnam's story is later scoffed at by Sand Rock's sheriff (Charles Drake) and the local news media. Even Ellen Fields is unsure about what to believe but still agrees to assist Putnam in his investigation. Over the next several days, local people disappear; a few return, but they act distant or appear somewhat dazed and not their usual selves. Convinced by these and other odd events, Sheriff Warren comes to believe Putnam's story that the meteorite is actually a crashed spaceship with alien inhabitants; he then organizes a posse to hunt down the invaders at their crash site. Putnam, however, hopes to reach a peaceful solution to the looming crisis. Alone, he enters a nearby abandoned mine, which he hopes will eventually connect to the now buried spaceship and its alien occupants. Putnam finally discovers the spaceship and learns from the alien leader that they crashed on Earth by accident; the aliens appear benign and only plan to stay on Earth just long enough to repair their damaged craft and then continue on their voyage. The aliens' real appearance, when finally revealed to Putnam, is entirely non-human: they are large, single-eyed, almost jellyfish-like beings that seem to glide across the ground, leaving a glistening trail that soon vanishes. They are also able to shape shift into human form in order to appear human and move around Sand Rock, unobserved, in order to collect their much needed repair materials. To do this, they copy the human forms of the local townspeople that they have abducted. In doing so, however, they fail to reproduce the townspeople's exact personalities, leading to suspicion and eventually to the deaths of two of the aliens. The aliens  have decided to destroy themselves and their spaceship, now that they have been discovered. Putnam reasons with them at length and convinces the alien leader to instead finish the repairs while he, as a sign of the aliens' good faith, takes the captives outside to the sheriff and his posse. To protect the aliens from the sheriff and his advancing posse, Putnam manages to seal off the mine in order to give them the time they still need to finish their spaceship's repairs. Shortly afterwards the alien spaceship leaves Earth. Putnam's fianc\u00e9e Ellen asks him if they are gone for good. He responds \"No, just for now. It wasn't the right time for us to meet. But there will be other nights, other stars for us to watch. They'll be back\"."

        "content": "The screenplay by Harry Essex, with input by Jack Arnold, was derived from an original and lengthy screen treatment by Ray Bradbury; screen legend says that Bradbury wrote the screenplay and Harry Essex merely changed the dialogue and took the credit. Unusual among science fiction films of the era, the alien \"invaders\" were portrayed by Bradbury as creatures stranded on Earth and without malicious intent toward humanity. Bradbury said \"I wanted to treat the invaders as beings who were not dangerous, and that was very unusual\". He offered two story outlines to the studio, one with malicious aliens, the other with benign aliens. \"The studio picked the right concept, and I stayed on\". In 2004 Bradbury published in one volume all four versions of his screen treatment for It Came From Outer Space. Filming took place on location in and around the California towns of Palmdale, Victorville, and the Mojave Desert, as well as on Universal's sound stages. The film's uncredited music score was composed by Irving Gertz, Henry Mancini, and Herman Stein. Universal's make-up department submitted two alien designs to studio executives for consideration; the rejected design was saved and later used as the \"Metaluna Mutant\" in Universal's 1955 science fiction film This Island Earth. The fiery special effects created for the crashing alien spacecraft consisted of a wire-mounted iron ball with dorsal fin, which had hollowed out \"windows\" all around for the burning magnesium inside. The Arizona setting and the alien abduction of telephone lineman and two other characters are fictionalized story elements taken from Bradbury's younger life when his father moved the family to Tucson, where he worked as a telephone lineman. Urban legend has it that an extra in an Army staff sergeant's uniform seen at the \"meteor\" crash site is comedy writer-performer Morey Amsterdam. While the briefly glimpsed extra does indeed resemble Amsterdam, no hard evidence (e.g., cast call bureau records, interviews with Amsterdam) has ever confirmed this is actually him. The most recent DVD re-release of It Came from Outer Space comes with a documentary, The Universe According to Universal. It was written and directed by David J. Skal and has audio commentary by Tom Weaver, in which Weaver notes the extra's resemblance to Morey Amsterdam."

        "content": "It Came from Outer Space was released in June 1953; by the end of the year it had accrued US$1.6 million in distributors' US and Canadian rentals, making it the year's 75th biggest earner. Barbara Rush won the Golden Globe award in 1954 as most promising female newcomer for her role in the film. The film was nominated for AFI's Top 10 Science Fiction Films list. Patricia Bosworth, writing in 1992, counted It Came from Outer Space as one of a number of '50s Hollywood anti-Communist propaganda films in which \"aliens from outer space serve as metaphors for the Soviet menace\". Bosworth's inclusion of the Korean War-era film as anti-Communist propaganda is at odds with both The American Film Institute and story author Ray Bradbury, who stated, \"I wanted to treat the invaders as beings who were not dangerous, and that was very unusual\". No Earthlings are killed or injured in the film by the aliens. If they were intended to be stand-ins for the Soviet Union/Communists, as Bosworth professes, their presence in an Arizona town is antithetical to how Communist surrogates were portrayed in Hollywood science fiction films during the Cold War. Bosworth blames her father's 1959 suicide on his being targeted by the Hollywood Blacklist; her father, defense lawyer Bartley Crum, died of an alcohol and barbiturate overdose."

The space ship and its improbable crew, which keep the citizens of Sand Rock, Ariz., befuddled and terrified, should have the same effect on customers who are passionately devoted to king-sized flying saucers and gremlins\".  \"Brog\" in Variety opined that \"Direction by Jack Arnold whips up an air of suspense in putting the Harry Essex screenplay on film, and there is considerable atmosphere of reality created, which stands up well enough if the logic of it all is not examined too closely ... story proves to be good science-fiction for the legion of film fans who like scare entertainment, well done\". Since its original release, the critical response to the film has become mostly positive. Bill Warren has written that \"Arnold's vigorous direction and Bradbury's intriguing ideas meld to produce a genuine classic in its limited field\". Jonathan Rosenbaum described the film as \"[A] scary black-and-white SF effort from 1953\". Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction observed \"Dark desert roads and sudden moments of fear underline Arnold's ability as a director of Science Fiction films, and Essex's/Bradbury's lines match his images superbly\". Of the reviews included on Rotten Tomatoes regarding It Came from Outer Space, 79% of critics liked the film. One of the negative reviews, from FilmCritic.com, states that the film \"moves terribly slowly (despite an 80 minute running time) because the plot is overly simplistic with absolutely no surprises\"."

Written by Jim and Ken Wheat, it was directed by Roger Duchowny, and was his final work before retiring. The story is essentially a remake of the first film, with former small town resident Jack Putnam (Kerwin) returning and witnessing an alien craft landing. Strange things then begin to happen, with his neighbours behaving oddly and the power going off and on. Writing for The Radio Times, Alan Jones gave the film one star out of five and called it a \"lacklustre update\" which was \"proof positive that 40 years of technical advances can't compensate for poor production values, boring characters and a complete lack of thrills.\" He summarised: \"file this under 'don't bother.'\" Leonard Maltin called the original \"intriguing\" and \"remarkably sober for its era, with crisp performances and real restraint, even in its use of 3-D\" and the 1996 effort \"a much inferior remake, rather than the sequel the title suggests.\" In the New York Daily News, David Bianculli wrote that \"the fact that this is a remake not a sequel, yet carries the suffix II anyway, is a clue about how clearly the makers of this new version were thinking when they made it.

The film was produced by Anatole de Grunwald, directed by Anthony Asquith, and stars Michael Redgrave, John Mills, Rosamund John, and Stanley Holloway. In the United States it was distributed by United Artists under the title Johnny in the Clouds and was shortened by 22 minutes. The screenplay was co-written by Richard Sherman and noted dramatist, Terence Rattigan, as a significant reworking of Rattigan's 1942 play Flare Path. Rattigan, then a Royal Air Force Flight Lieutenant, was posted in 1943 to the RAF Film Production Unit to work on The Way to the Stars and Journey Together. The title The Way to the Stars is often assumed to have been taken from the Latin motto of the RAF, Per ardua ad astra. However, the literal translation of the RAF motto is \"Through adversity to the stars\". The alternate American title, Johnny in the Clouds, is derived from the poem recited in the film as tribute to a dead aviator."

He is a very green \"15-hour sprog\" Bristol Blenheim pilot and is assigned to B Flight, under Flight Lieutenant David Archdale (Michael Redgrave). When No 720 Squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader Carter (Trevor Howard, in his second but first credited film role), is shot down, Archdale takes over. While Penrose develops into a first-class pilot, he meets Iris Winterton (Renee Asherson), a young woman living with her domineering aunt at the Golden Lion hotel in the nearby town. Archdale marries Miss Todd (Rosamund John), the popular manager of the hotel, who is known to everyone as Toddy. The Archdales later have a son, Peter. By May 1942, the squadron is now flying Douglas Boston bombers. When Penrose shows signs of strain from extensive combat, Archdale has him posted to controller school but is himself shot down and killed over France while Penrose is on his last mission. Penrose had been courting Iris, despite her aunt's disapproval, but Archdale's fate weighs heavily on his mind. Not wanting Iris to suffer if the same thing happened to him, he stops seeing her. No 720 Squadron is sent to the Middle East, but Penrose remains behind as a ground controller for a United States Army Air Forces B-17 Flying Fortress bombardment group, which takes over the airfield. He befriends USAAF Captain Johnny Hollis (Douglass Montgomery) and Lieutenant Joe Friselli (Bonar Colleano). On 17 August 1942 the American airmen participate in the first attack by the USAAF on Occupied France, later ruefully acknowledging that they underestimated the difficulties involved. Afterwards, Penrose is posted to flying duties with an RAF Avro Lancaster bomber squadron. In 1944, now a Squadron Leader and Pathfinder pilot, Penrose makes an emergency landing at Halfpenny Field, where he once again meets Iris. Iris had decided to leave her aunt for good and join up. Toddy persuades a still-reluctant Penrose to propose to Iris, saying that she did not regret her own marriage in spite of her husband's death. Hollis, who has formed a platonic relationship with Toddy, is killed while trying to land his battle-damaged B-17 with a hung up bomb aboard, rather than safely bail out and risk crashing into the local village or another town."

In 1945 he was released from the service to help rewrite it with Anatole De Grunwald as The Way to the Stars screenplay. Although Michael Redgrave and John Mills were the leads, the film offers very early performances of two actors, who would become international film stars in later years: Jean Simmons and Trevor Howard. Filming was mainly in North Yorkshire, and some of the locations remain little changed. RAF Catterick was used to film the RAF Halfpenny Field scenes, Bedale was used for street scenes outside the pub in the local small town, the Golden Lion Hotel in Northallerton was used as the pub and Constable Burton Hall was used as the USAAF headquarters. Footage of B-17 Flying Fortresses landing and taking off was filmed at RAF Grafton Underwood in Northamptonshire. One of the USAAF aircrew involved recorded in his diary seeing B-17s of the 384th Bombardment Group (Heavy) and ground scenes including the crash of Captain Holliss' B-17 being filmed at Grafton Underwood. As well as B-17s, the other aircraft used during filming were Avro Ansons, Bristol Blenheims, Hawker Hurricanes, and Douglas Bostons. They came from a variety of training and operational USAAF, RAF and Free French units, the Bostons being from 342 Squadron, RAF / Groupe de bombardement Lorraine. There was a real airfield with a name resembling the fictional RAF Halfpenny Field, RAF Halfpenny Green in Staffordshire. However, it was not used in any way for this film. Unlike RAF Halfpenny Field, RAF Halfpenny Green was used for training pilots and not as a bomber airfield. It is now home to Wolverhampton Halfpenny Green Airport."

However, it performed poorly in the US, where it was released post-war under the title Johnny in the Clouds, with a prologue added. According to Kinematograph Weekly, the film performed well at the British box office in 1945. The 'biggest winners' at the box office in 1945 Britain were The Seventh Veil, with \"runners up\" being (in release order), Madonna of the Seven Moons, Old Acquaintance, Frenchman's Creek, Mrs Parkington, Arsenic and Old Lace, Meet Me in St Louis, A Song to Remember, Since You Went Away, Here Come the Waves, Tonight and Every Night, Hollywood Canteen, They Were Sisters, The Princess and the Pirate, The Adventures of Susan, National Velvet, Mrs Skefflington, I Live in Grosvenor Square, Nob Hill, Perfect Strangers, Valley of Decision, Conflict and Duffy's Tavern. British \"runners up\" were They Were Sisters, I Live in Grosvenor Square, Perfect Strangers, Madonna of the Seven Moons, Waterloo Road, Blithe Spirit, The Way to the Stars, I'll Be Your Sweetheart, Dead of Night, Waltz Time and Henry V. Later reviews considered the film \"... one of the more thoughtful of British war movies ...\" and an \"excellent drama about a British airfield and the men stationed there, focusing mainly on personal relationships in wartime.\". The British Film Institute describes the film as \"one of the most effective and understated films about the conflict made during the Second World War, though it features no combat scenes and only three (brief) shots from inside a cockpit\". The BFI Screenonline reviewer stated that the film \"effectively comments on the traditional emotional reticence of the British by weaving a critique of it into the fabric of the story, turning it into a theme of the film. The introduction in the film's second half of the American flyers (as exemplified by the wise-cracking Bonar Colleano, making his film debut) further emphasises this. It also puts into relief the film's main focus: Penrose's development from callow youth into a burned-out, emotionally detached pilot and his eventual return to life and love\"."

The film shows a history of hemp and hemp products, how hemp is grown, and how hemp is processed into rope, cloth, cordage and other products. Before 1989, the film was relatively unknown. The United States government denied ever having made such a film. The United States Department of Agriculture library and the Library of Congress told all interested parties that no such movie was made by the USDA or any branch of the U.S. government. Two VHS copies were recovered and donated to the Library of Congress on 19 May 1989 by Maria Farrow, Carl Packard, and Jack Herer. The only known copy in 1976 was a 3/4\" broadcast quality copy of the film that was originally obtained by William Conde in 1976 from a reporter for the Miami Herald and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church of Jamaica. It was given in trust that it would be made available to as many as possible. It was put into the hands of Jack Herer by William Conde during the 1984 Oregon Marijuana Initiative. The film is now available in numerous locations on the Internet. In July 1989, Jack Herer together with Chris Wright, of the Grassroots Party, attempted to obtain a copy from the National Archives where it was listed, but the curators were unable to locate the film.  Subsequently, in May 1990, the founder of The Institute for Hemp, John Birrenbach, recovered a copy of the film from the National Archives. The film was a two part film the first section being 6:46 the second being 7:16 long.  Together the approx 15 minute film detailed the cultivation of cannabis for fiber.  This was the first recovery of the film from a government source.  This film can now be downloaded from the National Archives. Hemp for Victory was produced by the US Department of Agriculture, and contained scenes from the 1926 silent film Old Ironsides.

The film's storyline is based on operations by United States Navy Underwater Demolition Teams, popularly known as \"frogmen\", against the Japanese Army and naval forces. It was the first such film about scuba diving and became a popular cultural hit. Following the opening credits, The Frogmen has an on-screen written statement: \"This is a true story based on incidents which occurred in the latter part of World War II. It deals with one of the most hazardous and unique branches of the Armed Forces ... the Underwater Demolition Teams. This film could not have been produced without the active cooperation of the Department of Defense and the United States Navy\". Underwater Demolition Teams have been used since World War II for reconnaissance duties, clearing underwater obstacles planted by the enemy, advance landings on beaches, and offensive underwater attacks on enemy ships; they were the forerunners of the Navy SEALs. At the 24th Academy Awards for films from 1951, the film was nominated for Best Cinematography (Black-and-White) for Norbert Brodine and Best Screenplay (Motion Picture Story) for Oscar Millard. However, the award for Cinematography went to A Place in the Sun (William C. Mellor) while the Story award went to Seven Days to Noon (Paul Dehn and James Bernard)."

Jack Cassidy, is killed in action. The unit's men are distrustful of the professionally aloof Lawrence, and the relationship immediately takes a turn for the worse when they brawl with sailors aboard their transport ship. The ship's captain, Lt. Cmdr. Pete Vincent (Gary Merrill), understands the natural resentment the elite UDT men feel over the death of Cassidy, which they have transferred to Lawrence, and offers to go easy on the team at captain's mast. The \"by-the-book\" Lawrence, however, elects to hold his own mast and disciplines the entire team just before a dangerous reconnaissance mission to ascertain the safest landing beach during an upcoming invasion of a Japanese-held island. Lawrence is scornfully perceived as afraid when he splits up the platoon and puts team executive officer Lt. Klinger in charge of a diversion to the more dangerous beach, where the main landing is scheduled. During the mission, Lawrence cuts his leg on coral, and the diversionary section's pick-up boat receives a direct hit from artillery during pick-up operations, killing Klinger and most of his men. Lawrence sees that two frogmen, including Chief Jake Flannigan (Dana Andrews), are still in the water, but rather than risk loss of the information already gathered, orders a rescue boat launched and continues back to the transport. The rescue succeeds in recovering the two swimmers, but Lawrence's apparently cowardly action increases the unit's ill will toward him. An embittered Flannigan and some of the others request transfer to another unit, but Lawrence insists that they first complete the next day's mission to clear the new landing site for the invasion. The next morning, Lawrence, who is sick with coral poisoning, does not reveal his illness when he puts Flannigan in charge of the mission and stays behind. Convinced now that Lawrence is a coward, the men angrily but efficiently complete their task, although \"Pappy\" Creighton (Jeffrey Hunter), whose brother is a U.S. Marine, sneaks onto the beach with Flannigan to leave a sign \"welcoming\" the Marines. Creighton is shot after the prank, but Flannigan tows him to the pick-up boat. Back on the ship, Creighton is put in traction because of the bullets in his spine, and Flannigan confesses to Lawrence that the prank caused Creighton's injuries. Lawrence furiously upbraids Flannigan for giving in to the prank, and soon all of the men request transfers. While Lawrence is discussing the transfer requests with Vincent, a torpedo hits the ship but does not detonate. Lawrence volunteers to disarm the torpedo, which has lodged in the sick bay next to Creighton's bed, and with Flannigan's help, succeeds. Soon after, Lawrence receives orders to blow up a Japanese submarine pen, and tells the men that although it will be their last mission together, he is proud to have served with them. Although Flannigan voices disdain that Lawrence will again dodge dangerous duty, Lawrence leads the mission, which is discovered when one of the men accidentally trips a signal wire. Japanese sentries shoot at the men as they plant the charges, and Lawrence is stabbed in hand-to-hand combat with a Japanese diver. He orders Flannigan to leave him behind, but Flannigan tows him to safety. The mission is a success, and soon Lawrence is recuperating beside Creighton. Finally won over by Lawrence's bravery, the men show their acceptance of him by asking him to sign the portrait they have drawn of Cassidy to present to his widow."

        "content": "Producer Paul Short of Allied Artists protested the use of the title The Frogmen by Twentieth Century-Fox, asserting that he had established prior claim to it. Eventually, Short dropped his claim and Twentieth Century-Fox was allowed to use the title. Short's production was never made. Several major studios were interested in producing films about the Underwater Demolition Teams, but only Twentieth Century-Fox obtained an exclusive guarantee of cooperation from the U.S. Navy. Henry Hathaway, one of the studio's most well received directors, was originally set to direct the film, which was to feature Millard Mitchell in a starring role. Richard Conte was also originally set to play \"Pete Vincent\", while Jack Elam was first cast as \"Sleepy\", and Craig Hill was set to play \"Lt. J. G. Franklin\". Assistant director Dick Mayberry briefly filled in for director Lloyd Bacon when Bacon fell ill with influenza. Producer Sam Engel wrote an original story, titled \"Frogmen in Korea\", as an intended follow-up to The Frogmen, but the project soon dissolved. A one-hour television remake of The Frogmen, titled Deep Water, was broadcast in May 1957 on the 20th Century-Fox Hour. The program was directed by Roy Del Ruth and starred Ralph Meeker (Lawrence), James Whitmore (Flannigan), and Richard Arlen (Vincent). Because working conditions for The  Frogmen were deemed too \"riotous\" for women, all female roles were written out of the screenplay and none appeared in the completed film. Jack Warden makes an uncredited appearance in the beginning of the film as a crew member of the transport ship. Co-star Gary Merrill, in the role of the captain of UDT-4's transport ship, delivers the line of dialog, \"Looks like you've got what amounts to a legal mutiny on your hands\", that is virtually identical to a line that he spoke two years earlier in the World War II Army Air Force drama Twelve O'Clock High. The filming of the submarine sequence took place on the deck of USS Kleinsmith (APD-134) while the ship was off Key West, FL on 11 January 1951. Much of the boat and high-speed transport scenes were shot between 15 January and 6 February 1951 from the deck of Kleinsmith, while the ship was off St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. USS Taconic (AGC-17) appeared as the command ship. As spoken in dialog, the submarine's name sounds like \"USS Jackass 259\", but is actually \"USS Jack SS-259\". The real USS Jack (SS-259) was not actually used in the film, as it was out of commission at the time. Many United States Navy SEALs have cited this film as their inspiration for joining the SEAL Teams, including Richard Marcinko (the first Commanding Officer of SEAL Team Six and Red Cell), the Medal of Honor recipient Michael E. Thornton, and Dennis Chalker."

Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Despite this, Lufton asks him to deliver a note to his family. Riling tells Garry that he and his partner, Indian agent Jake Pindalest, have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has rejected Lufton's cattle as unfit to feed the Indians and ordered him to remove his herd from the reservation within a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their interest. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd. Riling offers Garry $10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd off the reservation unimpeded; he and Amy assume (incorrectly) Garry read the note, which described the route he wanted Riling to think he planned to take, but Riling was actually tipped off by Lufton's other daughter, Carol, who is in love with Riling. Riling and his men find the cattle eventually and stampede them back onto the reservation. There is not enough time to gather the herd together and move the herd. Garry becomes disgusted when a young man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. Eventually, she comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he stops two of Riling's men from gunning her father down. To buy time, Garry deceives Pindalest, who is unaware of his break with Riling, into sending a messenger to the government to extend the deadline. Garry then takes Pindalest prisoner. Riling and his gang track them down. Garry flees to the cabin of Kris Barden, the father of the young man killed in the stampede; they are joined by Amy. A gunfight erupts. Though wounded earlier, Garry sneaks out at night, knocks Pindalest out and dispatches Riling's two henchmen. That leaves the two old friends to face each other. Riling is fatally wounded. Pindalest is taken into custody, and Garry decides to give up his wandering ways, much to Amy's delight."

        "content": "The idea for Blood on the Moon (based on Luke Short's Gunman's Chance) came from Robert Wise and Theron Warth, who pitched the idea to producer Dore Schary as a mood piece akin to Out of the Past and Crossfire, both produced by RKO. Schary agreed to produce the film and signed Lillie Hayward to write the screenplay. Talent agency Famous Artists offered RKO a deal with either James Stewart or Robert Mitchum in the leading role of Jim Garry, and Jacques Tourneur as director, but Schary refused the deal and backed up Wise as director. Wise enjoyed working with Mitchum and liked that he offered suggestions. When Mitchum showed up to the set dressed up in costume, Walter Brennan exclaimed: \"That is the realest goddamnest cowboy I've ever seen!\" Filming of Blood on the Moon began in February of 1948 and ended in May of the same year, with Sedona, Arizona, the Rocky Mountains, California, Utah and New Mexico serving as locations. Inspired by the production design of Citizen Kane (which Wise co-edited), Wise had the interior sets built with visible low-ceilings. In order to create the night scenes of the film, Wise and cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca utilized infrared film, which in Musuraca's opinion, could cause headaches regarding problems with color of clothing and tone of makeup. The bar brawl between Garry and Rilling took three days to shoot. Wise wanted a realistic fight where the winner comes out on top badly beaten and exhausted instead of the usual Western brawls and had Mitchum and Preston do the fight instead of stunt doubles. Production of the film dragged on due to bad weather. Wise noted that none of the weather reports that the crew received got the weather forecast right. After the film was completed, Howard Hughes terminated Barbara Bel Geddes' contract with RKO, believing she was not sexy enough."

The reason is obvious enough. This picture has a sound, sensible story to tell and, besides, it is well acted. Robert Mitchum carries the burden of the film and his acting is superior all the way...Lillie Hayward's screen play, taken from a novel by Luke Short, is solidly constructed and by not over-emphasizing Jim Garry's inherent honesty, she has permitted Mr. Mitchum to illuminate a character that is reasonable and most always interesting. The same can be said of the rancher's daughter, whom Miss Bel Geddes represents. Others who give worthy help include Walter Brennan, Mr. Preston, Phyllis Thaxter, Frank Faylen and Tom Tully. And a word should be said, too, for the direction by Robert Wise. A comparative newcomer to the directorial ranks, he has managed to keep the atmosphere of this leisurely paced film charged with impending violence."

After driving for two hours, the Baldwins notice unusually bright light flashes coming from a great distance behind them. Sporadic news reports broadcast on CONELRAD hint at the start of an atomic war, later confirmed when the Baldwins see a large mushroom cloud over what was Los Angeles. The family initially attempts to return to rescue Ann's mother back at their home, but they soon abandon the plan as panicked people climb over one another to escape the fallout from multiple nuclear explosions. Witnessing society being torn apart, Harry decides that the family must find refuge at their secluded vacation spot. The Baldwins stop to buy supplies at a small town off the main road, which has not yet been inundated by the crowd fleeing Los Angeles. When Harry attempts buy tools and guns from hardware store owner Ed Johnson (Richard Garland), who believes only Los Angeles has been hit, and assumes the government will remain intact, withholds the guns per state law since Harry can only cover them with checks. With Rick's help, Harry absconds with the weapons, but insists to Johnson that he will eventually return to pay for them in full. On the road, the family encounters three threatening young hoodlums, Carl (Richard Bakalyan), Mickey (Rex Holman), and Andy (Neil Nephew), but manage to drive them off. After a harrowing journey, the Baldwins reach their destination and find shelter in a cave, while they wait for order to be restored. On their portable radio, they listen to war news and learn that what remains of the United Nations has declared this to be \"Year Zero\". Harry and Rick soon discover that Ed Johnson and his wife are their neighbors, but not for long: the Johnsons are killed by the three thugs encountered earlier. While doing laundry, Ann drops a blouse in a stream, which draws the attention of the hoodlums. As Karen sits and reads a book, they accost her. Ann scares them off with a rifle and comforts her traumatized daughter. They return to the cave, where it is confirmed that Karen was raped. Upon hearing this, the Baldwin men search for the two rapists, find them at a farm house, and Harry shoots both dead in cold blood. He and Rick hear a noise and discover a teenage girl, Marilyn (Joan Freeman), kept in a locked room as a sex slave. When questioned, she tells them she lived there with her parents before both were murdered by the thugs. Freeing her, Marilyn returns with them to the cave, where Ann cares for her. Some time later, Rick is out with Marilyn chopping wood. Carl, the third hoodlum, sneaks up behind Marilyn, forcing her to drop the rifle she is holding. He questions her about what happened to his brothers. Rick tells him to back off and throws a piece of wood at him, while Marilyn breaks away, grabs the dropped rifle, and shoots Carl dead. In the midst of the struggle, Carl fires a shot, striking Rick in the leg. The family begins a journey to find a doctor Marilyn knows in nearby Paxton, California. On the drive there, they hear \"the enemy\" has asked for a truce and that \"Year Zero\" is ending. They find Doctor Strong (Willis Bouchey, billed as Willis Buchet), and he does what he can for Rick, who has lost so much blood that he now needs a blood transfusion; he must be taken to an Army hospital more than 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away or he will die. Along the way, they encounter an Army military patrol that is reestablishing order. After a tense meeting with both soldiers, they are allowed to continue. Watching them depart, the soldiers note they are among the \"good ones\" who escaped radiation sickness by being in the mountains when the atomic bombs exploded. As the family drives on, a closing title card states: \"There must be no end \u2013 only a new beginning\"."

It was produced by Val Lewton for RKO Radio Pictures as part of a series of low-budget horror films. The film can be seen as a \"low-key psychological thriller\", a \"suspense drama\", and a \"waterlogged melodrama\". The film is about a young merchant marine officer who begins to suspect that his ship's captain is mentally unbalanced and endangering the lives of the ship's crew. The ship's crew, however, believes the vessel to be haunted and cursed and several mysterious deaths occur. Upon its theatrical release on Christmas Eve, 1943, the film was a box office success but received a mixed critical reception. In February 1944, Lewton was sued for plagiarism by playwrights Samuel R. Golding and Norbert Faulkner, who claimed that the script was based on a play that was submitted to Lewton for a possible film. Because of the suit, The Ghost Ship was withdrawn from theatrical release and not shown for nearly 50 years. It was not until the film's copyright was not renewed and it entered the public domain in the 1990s, that it began to be available again, and was released as part of the Val Lewton Horror Collection DVD set in 2005."

        "content": "Tom Merriam (Russell Wade), a young merchant marine officer, joins the crew of the ship Altair. At first, all seems well and Merriam bonds with the captain, Will Stone (Richard Dix). The ship, already shorthanded due to the death of a crew member before it left port, almost loses another (\"the Greek\") when he develops appendicitis. Taking direction over the ship's radio, the captain is to perform the appendectomy, but he is unable to make the incision. Instead, Merriam successfully removes the sailor's appendix, but \u2013 feeling he should be loyal to the captain and spare him embarrassment \u2013 swears the radio operator to secrecy. Afterward, the captain has a self-serving explanation for his failure. One of the crew, Louie (an uncredited Lawrence Tierney), tells the captain he should pull in to port and take on new crew. The captain says, \"You know, there are captains who might hold this against you, Louie.\" Shortly after, the captain closes the hatch to the chain locker with Louie inside, and Louie is crushed to death by the chain. Merriam believes that Captain Stone, who is obsessed with authority, did it intentionally. When they dock at the fictional Caribbean island of \"San Sebastian\" (which had appeared in RKO's I Walked with a Zombie\u2014another Lewton production\u2014and later in RKO's Zombies on Broadway), Merriam attempts to expose the Captain's madness at a board of inquiry. The crew all speak favorably of the captain, including the Greek, who credits the captain with saving his life. Merriam states his intention to leave the Altair. After the inquiry, the captain admits to a female friend (Edith Barrett, who had appeared in I Walked with a Zombie) that he fears he is losing his mind. Soon after, Merriam is involved in a fight in port and knocked unconscious. One of his former shipmates \u2013 unaware that he has left the Altair \u2013 brings the unconscious man back aboard ship before the vessel departs. Merriam wakes up on the ship and fears that the pathologically insane Captain Stone may now attempt to kill him, a fear that is only reinforced when the captain, referring to the young officer's accusations, says, \"You know, Mr. Merriam, there are some captains who would hold this against you.\" Merriam, scorned by the crew, finds that he can no longer lock the door to his cabin. Fearing for his life, he tries to steal a gun from the ship's weapons locker, but is confronted by Captain Stone. Stone dares Merriam to try to get the support of the crew, but Merriam is rebuffed in this effort. This changes when Radioman Winslow (Edmund Glover) receives a radiogram asking if Merriam is on board, and Captain Stone orders Winslow to lie, replying that Merriam is not aboard. The radioman shows Merriam the captain's reply radiogram and says that he now mistrusts the captain and will send a message to the company expressing his concerns about Stone's mental health. However, as he leaves Merriam's cabin, Winslow encounters the captain. As the two walk side-by-side, Winslow drops the captain's radiogram to the deck, and it is picked up by an illiterate crewman, Finn the Mute (Skelton Knaggs), whose internal monologues serve as a sort of one-man Greek chorus throughout the film. Captain Stone now orders Merriam to send a radio message to the corporate office advising them that Winslow has been washed overboard. Merriam accuses the captain of murdering Winslow, and the two fight. Crew members intervene, and the captain has the crew tie up Merriam and put him in his bunk. The captain then has First Officer Bowns (Ben Bard) administer a sedative to Merriam. Finn finally delivers the captain's radiogram to Bowns. After reading it, Bowns becomes deeply alarmed. The first officer talks to several other crew members, all of whom now begin questioning the captain's sanity. Captain Stone overhears Bowns' conversation with the crew, and goes insane. He takes a knife and enters Merriam's cabin to kill the young officer, but Finn arrives to try to stop him. While the crew is up on deck singing, Finn and the captain engage in a desperate struggle in the dark, during which Finn kills the captain. After the captain's death, Merriam is reinstated and the ship returns to its home port of San Pedro."

        "content": "RKO had scored a major financial success with Cat People (1942). The film, which cost $141,659, brought in almost $4 million in its first two years and saved the studio from financial disaster. RKO wanted to move quickly on a sequel to build on the success of Cat People, but producer Val Lewton wished to make the fantasy-comedy story \"The Amorous Ghost\" instead. As Lewton and studio wrangled, Lewton commenced production on The Seventh Victim, a horror-murder mystery film, and on May 12, 1943, RKO announced it was delaying production on the sequel The Curse of the Cat People due to the unavailability of key performers. RKO production chief Charles Koerner did not want Lewton to be idle once filming on The Seventh Victim ended nor did he favor the idea of Lewton working on comedy, so Koerner suggested that Lewton direct a horror film set at sea, utilizing the studio's existing ship set, built for Pacific Liner (1939). According to Robert Wise, a longtime collaborator with Lewton, it was this set that gave Lewton the idea for the film. \"He would find what we call a 'standing set,' and then tailor his script to the set, whatever it was. That's how he made The Ghost Ship. He walked onto a set and saw a tanker, then cooked up the idea for this ship with a murderous captain.\" One scholar has suggested that Lewton accepted the assignment in part because, as an amateur sailor himself, the ship captain's behavior mirrored Lewton's own views on how to manage a ship, but also because Lewton saw the plot as a way of criticizing his micro-managing superiors at RKO. The budget, as with all of Lewton's films, was set at $150,000. At the time screenwriting began, Lewton claimed that the idea for the film was an original one attributable to himself. Leo Mittler did the treatment and Donald Henderson Clarke wrote the script, although Lewton significantly revised the screenplay and wrote many lines of dialogue himself. Mark Robson was assigned to direct in June 1943. Robson was the RKO director \"most in tune with [Lewton's] idea of psychological terror\". Robson had just finished editing Orson Welles' Journey Into Fear, and there are distinct stylistic similarities between the two films. Robson and Lewton chose to use single-source lighting throughout the film in order to make the sets and performances more interesting, and sets were designed to utilize this type of lighting. The two men also agreed to continue Lewton's emphasis on unseen and implied terror. Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, art directors Albert S. D'Agostino and Walter E. Keller, and composer Roy Webb all regularly worked with Lewton, and did so on The Ghost Ship as well. Richard Dix was cast because he was already on contract with RKO to do several \"quickie\" pictures at a set fee per film, and doing The Ghost Ship would help fulfill his contract without much effort. Russell Wade had provided a disembodied voice in The Leopard Man, and this was his first starring role in a Lewton production. His performance here led him to be cast in Lewton's later The Body Snatcher (1945). Edith Barrett, Ben Bard, Dewey Robinson, and Charles Lung all had worked with Lewton before. Future film noir star Lawrence Tierney, whom Lewton had seen modeling clothing in a Sears, Roebuck catalog, made his motion picture debut in the movie. Sir Lancelot, a well-known calypso singer, who later influenced the career of Harry Belafonte, had already appeared in singing roles in three prior films (including I Walked with a Zombie). Atmosphere is created in the film by the contrast between murder and the joviality of the calypso songs sung on board. Production began on 3 August 1943. Many details about the performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of time in order to not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve suspense on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People."

Bosley Crowther of The New York Times enjoyed the film, calling it \"... a nice little package of morbidity, all wrapped around in gloom.\" Paul Meehan calls it \"a tepid potboiler of malfeasance and murder on the high seas.\" John Brosnan described The Ghost Ship as \"a more conventional mystery-thriller involving a number of deaths on board a ship, but was produced with Lewton's customary attention to atmosphere.\" The script has come in for significant praise, with Captain Stone being compared to Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick, and Captain Wolf Larsen in The Sea-Wolf. Other critics have pointed out that Stone and Merriam seem to have a father-son relationship, but that the perverseness of the script is that the father-figure becomes so enraged at his \"son's\" failings that he seeks to murder him. Modern film critics have also praised the picture's acting, cinematography, and lighting, as well as its ability to scare.  Actor Richard Dix is almost uniformly praised for bringing a depth of character, moodiness, and pathos to the role of Captain Stone. The film's direction, cinematography and lighting, too, display a depth of artistry not usually seen in cinema. Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca won high praise for his chiaroscuro lighting design. Film historian Edmund Bansak has written one scene in particular which is highly effective: An excellent set-piece early in the film showcases Robson's underrated directorial skill. Robson creates a dynamic sense of menace from a physical object: a massive giant hook hanging from upon an enormous chain, pendulumlike, inches above the deck. ... [The] hook remains unattended and unsecured. ... In a tightly directed, genuinely exciting scene, the monstrous hook sways back and forth in a direct path toward the camera, making one wonder how cinematographer, Nicholas Musuraca, kept his camera (and head) intact during the shooting. ... The lighting is also used to great advantage, the shadows and fog accenting the terror.  Half the time the swinging hook is so hidden in the darkness that aside from the creak of its sway, there is no telling which direction it will take. The set design, too, has been praised for being \"suitably claustrophobic.\" Robson's direction has earned kudos for heightening the suspense by leaving certain actions and motives vague. In the scene in which Seaman Parker (Lawrence Tierney) dies, crushed by the anchor chain, Robson left it unclear whether Captain Stone committed murder by trapping Parker in the anchor chain locker or whether he merely shut the door. The vagueness leaves the audience unsure whether to believe Merriam's accusations against the Captain, and builds an atmosphere of paranoia and doubt which is critical to the picture's success. Contemporary critic Gary Giddins has pointed out that the film incorporates classic Lewton scare tactics but in new ways. \"His trademark scare tactic, a high point in practically all of his films, is a long, dark, nightmarish walk, where every sound is magnified and every object threatening. In The Ghost Ship, that \"walk\" is transferred to the cabin of the victimized third officer\u00a0...\" Others have pointed out another Lewton device, the gradual stalking of a main character by a murderer, as another deft touch in the film. Modern critics have also pointed out that the film, unlike so many motion pictures of the 1940s, has an almost exclusively male cast and avoids the trope of a man \"redeemed by the love of a good woman.\" The picture is \"entirely concerned with male conflict\", one critic noted, and at the end of the film a woman appears only in shadow and fog \"as the possibility of salvation\" rather than bringing emotional closure. Other film critics have made sustained arguments that the film is a lengthy if coded study of repressed homosexuality, similar to that in Herman Melville's novel, Billy Budd.  Indeed, the focus on men and men's problems has led one modern critic to declare the film \"one of the most homoerotic films Hollywood ever made.\" Contemporary film programmers seem to have a high opinion of the film as well. A 1993 Film Forum series, \"Val Lewton: Horror Most Noir\", screened The Ghost Ship 42 times, while I Walked With A Zombie screened only 10 times and Cat People a mere eight. Film director Alison Maclean chose The Ghost Ship for a retrospective of classic RKO films, arguing that the film was \"genuinely eccentric\" and a cinematic revelation. When The Ghost Ship was shown on French cable television in the late 1990s, it was introduced as a prime example of Val Lewton's genius at presenting \"unseen horror.\""

        "content": "The Finnhorse or Finnish Horse (, literally \"horse of Finland\"; nickname: suokki, or , literally \"finnish cold-blood\") is a horse breed with both riding horse and draught horse influences and characteristics, and is the only breed developed fully in Finland. In English it is sometimes called the Finnish Universal, as the Finns consider the breed capable of fulfilling all of Finland's horse needs, including agricultural and forestry work, harness racing, and riding. In 2007, the breed was declared the official national horse breed of Finland. The Finnhorse is claimed to be among the fastest and most versatile \"coldblood\" breeds in the world.  In Finland, the term \"universal horse\" is used to describe the Finnhorse and breeds such as the Fjord horse that are relatively small with a body type that is heavy for a riding horse but light for a draught.  There are four separate sections within the Finnhorse stud book, each with different goals: to develop a heavier working horse, a lighter trotter type, a versatile riding horse, and a proportionally smaller pony-sized animal. The combined breed standard for all four sections defines the breed as a strong, versatile horse with pleasant disposition. The average height of the breed is , and the most typical colour is chestnut, often with white markings and a flaxen mane and tail. The exact origins of the early Finnish horse are currently not known. Because the Finnhorse breed and its progenitors were the only horses in Finland for centuries, the history of horses in Finland parallels the history of the Finnhorse itself. The documented history of the distinct breed begins at the turn of the 13th\u00a0century. Outside influences by many light and warmblood breeds were recorded beginning in the 16th\u00a0century, making the breed larger and more usable. An official Finnhorse studbook was founded in 1907, producing purebred animals in significant numbers for many years. Due to mechanisation of agriculture and the dismantling of Finnish horse cavalry in the later half of the 20th\u00a0century, the Finnhorse population plummeted from a high of just over 400,000 animals in the 1950s to a low of 14,100 in 1987. However, the breed managed to survive thanks to its popularity for harness racing and its versatility as a mount."

        "content": "The breed standard defines the Finnhorse as a multi-purpose horse of average height, and sturdy conformation. The ideal Finnhorse is easy-to-handle, versatile, and combines strength, agility, speed and endurance. Finnhorses are lively, with both a reliable and alert temperament. The breed standard encourages a horse that is \"honest and sincere\"; eager to cooperate with humans, obedient, and willing to work. They are hardy with good endurance, robust health, and are generally long-lived. The breed standard describes the head of a Finnhorse as dry and the profile straight, not long or convex, with well-spaced, short ears. The neck should be well-shaped and not underslung or ewe-necked; the body should be on the long side, but rounded and proportionate; and the croup should neither be level nor with a too-high connection to the tail. Finnhorses are strongly muscled, with good bone, sturdy \"dry\" legs, and strong hooves. Finnhorses typically have thick manes and tails, and the legs have light feathering. The average height is . Pony-sized Finnhorses\u2014under \u2014exist as well, and are licensed for breeding in a separate section of the official stud book. Finnhorses have good gaits that are regular with elasticity, and relatively low, steady action. They are fast for a coldblooded breed, known as good trotting horses and used for harness racing. In addition to these general traits, there are four separate breed sections in the Finnhorse studbook, and a Finnhorse's overall conformation should be typical of the section in which it is recorded, though some horses are registered in multiple sections."

        "content": "Over 90\u00a0percent of Finnhorses today are chestnut. Flaxen manes and tails as well as white markings on the face and legs are common in the breed. As of 2007, only a minority of Finnhorses are any color other than chestnut: 6\u00a0percent are bay and 1.2\u00a0percent black. Roans, palominos, buckskins and silver dapples exist in smaller numbers. The genes for other cream dilutions and rabicano are present in the gene pool. A distinctive sabino, non-SB1 pattern is moderately common, but is usually minimally expressed due to the selective colour breeding of the 20th\u00a0century. A single white horse, registered as pinto and deemed \"sabino-white,\" has been recorded in the modern history of the breed. The number of non-chestnuts is increasing due to dedicated breeding for other colours, and as of 2009, a few dozen black and grey Finnhorses exist. SW1, one of the genes responsible for the splashed white markings, has been found in a number of individuals by genetic testing. Through the 18th\u00a0and\u00a019th\u00a0centuries, chestnut in various shades was the prevailing colour of Finnish horses, making up about 40\u201350 percent of the breed, and bays, blacks and greys existed in much greater numbers than today: 34\u00a0percent were bay, 16\u00a0percent black, and the remaining 3\u00a0percent were grey, palomino or spotted. Wide blazes and high leg markings were rare, unlike today; bold markings became common only in the 20th\u00a0century. The change came about through selective breeding. At the turn of the 20th\u00a0century, when a nationalistic spirit was high, the Finnhorse began to be considered a symbol of Finland, and purebreeding became very popular. In addition, chestnut colour was officially chosen as an official aim for breeding as the \"utmost original\" colour of the Finnhorse, and named the \"Hippos colour\" after Hevoskasvatusyhditys Hippos, the name of the recently founded Finnish national horse breeding association that is now Suomen Hippos. Any colours other than chestnut were considered evidence of \"foreign\" blood, and the goal was to make the Finnhorse an all-chestnut breed. The breeding regulation of 1909 stated that no stallion \"with coat of white, grey, palomino or spotted\" could be accepted into the stud book. The popularity of bay and black Finnhorses dropped as well, and at least one mare was removed from the stud book solely because of her bay colour. Selective breeding combined with the export of horses in colours popular in neighbouring countries, especially bays into Sweden, and made chestnut the prevailing colour. In the earliest section of the first Finnhorse studbook, 105 of the stallions listed were chestnut and only 8 were bay. There were stallions of other colours as well, but they were not included in the first book. At one point, chestnuts made up more than 96\u00a0percent of the breed. Because of the vigorous colour breeding for chestnut in the early 20th\u00a0century, combined with a genetic bottleneck resulting from the low number of Finnhorses that existed in the 1980s, colours such as grey and cream dilutions were preserved only by a few minor breeders. In the 1980s there were fewer than ten grey and palomino Finnhorses combined. All Finnhorse carriers of the cream gene today descend from a single maternal line, founded by the palomino mare Voikko (literally, \"Palomino\") who lived in the 1920s. While both cream dilution and black are rare, there are some known smoky blacks in the breed, the first of which was a filly foaled in 2009, identified as smoky black and confirmed as such by a DNA test in 2010. The filly is considered \"if not the first ever, at least the first in a long long time.\" In April 2010, a filly appearing to be a double cream dilute was born, sired by a buckskin and out of a palomino. She was blue-eyed and had \"pink skin and very pale coat\", and was later officially recognised as a double cream dilute. The roan colour is rare, and today is passed on via a single dam line that descends from the strawberry roan mare Sonja, foaled in 1936. As of 2010, only six confirmed roan Finnhorses exist, all descendants of a 1987 mare, Taika-Tytt\u00f6, great-great-granddaughter of Sonja. The second-to-last roan line died out with the passing of the 1981 stallion Jesper Jr, who had no offspring. Grey exists in one dam line, descending from mare Pelelaikka, especially through her maternal grandson E.V. Johtot\u00e4hti 1726-93Ta, an award-winning working section stallion. The second last grey line died in 2010 with the 1988 mare Iiris 2275-88R, who had no grey offspring. The silver dapple gene survived for two reasons. First, it only affects black colour and therefore is \"masked\" in chestnuts. Second, when it does act on black and bay base coat colors, it produces a chestnut-like phenotype. Silver dapple bays were long registered as \"cinnamon chestnuts\", and silver dapple blacks as \"flaxen-maned dark chestnuts\"."

        "content": "The working or draught type is the oldest of the Finnhorse types, and has had its own separate breeding section since the studbook was first split in 1924. Though the oldest of the Finnhorse types, it is rare today, with a total of only about 1,000 horses registered in the working section as of 2004. Draught-type Finnhorses are heavier and have a longer body than horses of the trotter and riding types. Though relatively small compared to other draught breeds, Finnhorses have considerable pulling power and can pull very heavy loads because of the breed's good pulling technique, with powerful take-off and a low, efficient body stature during the actual pulling. The Finnish Draught type is, pound for pound, stronger than many larger draught breeds. An average  horse in draught work is capable of pulling about 80\u00a0percent of its own weight, while a Finnhorse can pull as much as 110\u00a0percent. In work horse competitions, the best Finnhorses can achieve even higher results, pulling more than 200\u00a0percent of their own body weight. A draught-type horse must pass two tests in the studbook evaluation: a walking test and either a pulling or a general drivability test. The points given for the horse's performance in these tests are added to those given for its temperament and gaits, resulting in the final workability score. The horse is also given a score for its conformation. In addition to achieving the minimum scores for both workability and conformation, stallions accepted for the working-horse section of the stud book are required to trot  in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds."

        "content": "The trotter type is the lightest Finnhorse. A trotter section horse should be of light conformation yet muscular, with a relatively long body and long legs. At the studbook evaluation, a trotter-type horse must meet the standards in racing results and/or in breeding value index as decreed by Suomen Hippos. A trotter's disposition is evaluated during the drivability test. However, type is not part of the studbook evaluation standard for trotters. The trotter type has existed as a separate breeding section since 1965, when the \"universal horse\" section of the Finnhorse studbook was renamed and replaced by the trotter section. While the total number of Finnhorses dropped during the 20th\u00a0century, the popularity of harness racing turned Finnhorse birthrates around from the historical lows of the 1970s and 1980s. Today, approximately 2,000 Finnhorses are in training and 3,000 compete in harness racing. The official Finnhorse racing championship Kuninkuusravit began in 1924 and has been held annually ever since, attracting tens of thousands of spectators. The Finnhorse is slower to mature than lighter breeds, and thus usually enters harness racing competition at the age of four. However, its build withstands competition better than light trotters, and the breed's effective competition career can be very long. The Finnish harness racing bylaws allow Finnhorses to be raced from ages 3 to 16. For a \"coldblood\" breed, the Finnhorse is quite fast. The official Finnish coldblood record from 2010 is 19,9aly, was long held by the quintuple Finnhorse racing champion stallion Viesker, but was finally broken by Jokivarren Kunkku in 2015 (19,5x) The coldblood horse world record in harness racing was long held by Finnhorses, until in 2005 the record was broken by J\u00e4rvs\u00f6faks, a Scandinavian coldblood trotter from Sweden. As of 2010, the official Finnish record for mares, and the world record for coldblood mares, is 20.2aly, held by the double Finnhorse racing female champion I.P. Vipotiina. The absolute Finnhorse speed record is 19.4aly, held by the stallion Sipori. As the result was not achieved from a win, the time is not an official Finnish record. Finnhorses have been so successful against other coldblood trotter breeds of Scandinavia, that by the 21st\u00a0century, they have been admitted to Swedish and Norwegian races only by invitation. Some conformation flaws common in the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses is a tendency to trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to increase with age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels."

        "content": "The riding horse section Finnhorse is a capable and reliable mount. It lacks some traits required for competing at the highest levels of international riding sports, but its combination of size and good temperament makes it suitable for both adults and children. To qualify for the riding section, a horse must carry itself well, and have a long neck, small head, sloping shoulder and well-defined withers. The body must not be too long. The universal Finnhorse breeding goals have made the breed of a lighter build, with longer neck, better gaits and fewer faults in conformation, allowing modern riding-type Finnhorses to work more easily on the bit. Even the temperament of the riding section animals appears to have become more lively. To pass the studbook evaluation, a riding type horse must either have placed in a Grade IV dressage or combined driving competition, or pass a dressage test; must  pass a jumping evaluation and a ridability test, and possess clean gaits. Mares may be qualified solely on grounds of a ridability test and a movement evaluation. Despite the Finnhorse's image as a working farm horse, the breed was used as a cavalry mount from the 17th\u00a0century until the end of World War II. After the mechanisation of Finnish agriculture in the 1960s and the 1970s, however, it was not clear if the Finnhorse would make the transition into a riding horse, even though the long use of the breed by the Finnish cavalry had proven it well-suited for the job. The Finnhorse had a strong image as a harnessed working horse, associated with rural life and old times. When riding as a hobby emerged and became more established in Finnish cities during the 1960s, imported horses and ponies were preferred as mounts; warmblooded horses represented modern times, leisure time and wealth, while the Finnhorse was viewed as rugged and unsophisticated. The riding section studbook, created in 1971, grew slowly and gained only a few dozen horses during its first decade, as the idea of a Finnhorse used for riding was considered near-ridiculous at the time. The Suomenratsut ry (SuoRa, or \"Finnmounts\") organisation was founded in 1974 to promote the use of the Finnhorse under saddle, and with the growing popularity of riding and the support of SuoRa, Finnhorses of riding type gained a foothold, though by the late 1970s, even SuoRa estimated that only about 300 Finnhorses were being used for riding. However, the popularity of harness racing and the breeding of trotter type Finnhorses made the breed lighter and faster overall, which also benefitted the riding section. In addition, the Finnish state horse breeding institute of Yp\u00e4j\u00e4 was founded in the 1970s, and was the first stud farm to breed and train Finnhorses for riding on a larger scale. Well-trained Finnhorse mounts from Yp\u00e4j\u00e4, seen in growing numbers in competition, added to the popularity and credibility of the breed for under-saddle use. After the slow beginning, the Finnhorse was increasingly appreciated as a riding horse. Today, over 5,000 are used for riding. Riding section horses currently are sought after while the trotting section suffers from oversupply."

Both sexes are also required to pass either a drivability or a ridability test. The horse's pedigree is also evaluated, and uncharacteristically small individuals descending from larger-sized lines are not accepted. The horse should be proportionately small all over, and express all the qualities of a full-size Finnhorse. Especially thorough attention is paid to the pony-sized horse's character, obedience and cooperation. The pony-sized Finnhorse is suited to practically any use the larger Finnhorse is, with the exception of heavy draught work because of its smaller size and proportionally reduced strength. However, some individuals have been able to compete with and even win against full-size Finnhorses in work horse competitions. Many pony-sized individuals are cross-registered for trotter section breeding, as small Finnhorses can be equal competitors in harness against larger ones. In combined driving, the pony-sized Finnhorse's size is an advantage, allowing for greater agility. The section is popular for therapy and riding school use. Although its breeding section was created at the same time as the trotter and riding types, the pony-sized Finnhorse is technically the newest of the sections, as trotters and riding horses were bred as \"universal horses\" in a combined section beginning in 1924. The Finnhorse had been bred for larger size for centuries, and when the pony-sized breeding section was established, few pony-sized lines existed. The section remains the rarest type of Finnhorse, with only about 80 stallions and 420 mares accepted in the studbook as of 2010."

Individuals that do not qualify for the studbook on their own merits during the stud book evaluation process may be accepted later, based on the quality and accomplishments of their offspring. For this to occur, a horse's offspring are evaluated by their competitive history or their stud book evaluation, and if of high enough quality, their parent then is also granted acceptance into the stud book.

The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistic analysis suggest that horse was in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age\u00a0(400\u2013800\u00a0CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and it can be argued that this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20th\u00a0century, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s. In the 21st century, the numbers of the breed have stabilised at approximately 20,000 animals."

        "content": "Although multiple hypotheses exist on the origins of the horse in Finland, an indigenous wild horse origin is thought improbable, as significant numbers of domesticated horses were imported from earliest times. The Finnhorse is most likely descended from a northern European domestic horse. One theory suggests that horses arrived from the west, brought to what today is western Finland by the Vikings during the Viking Age, circa 800\u20131050 CE. These Viking horses would have been of northern European ancestry. The other main theory suggests that non-Viking peoples, who migrated into Finland from the southeast and south, brought with them horses of Mongolian origin that had been further developed in the Urals and Volga River regions. Both theories have merit, as there were two distinct horse types in the eastern and western regions of Finland that remained distinct from one another until at least the middle of the 19th\u00a0century. The eastern origin of the breed was first proposed by archaeologist Johannes Reinhold Aspelin, who published Suomalaisen hevosen kotoper\u00e4isyydest\u00e4 (\"On the Nativity of the Finnish horse\") in 1886\u20131887. Aspelin proposed that Finnish horses descended from an animal that had accompanied the migration of Finnic peoples from the Volga region and middle Russia to the shores of the Gulf of Finland. A similar idea was suggested over a hundred years earlier by natural historian Pehr Adrian Gadd, and this theory has continued to receive support into modern times.  Ludvig Fabritius considered the proposed prototype a side branch of a \"Tartarian\" breed, and considered it possible that the same prototype also influenced Estonian, Swedish and Norwegian horse populations. A genetic study in 2014 concluded that closest relatives to the Finnhorse were the Estonian horse, Mezen horse, Yakutian horse and Mongolian horse. Later, agronomist Axel Alfthan (1862\u20131934) and veterinarian Kaarlo Gummerus (1840\u20131898) expanded Aspelin's hypothesis, proposing that the horse population later diverged into Eastern Finnish and Mid-Finnish types, which had remained distinguishable as late as the turn of the 20th\u00a0century. Photographs support these claims: the small Karelian horse was blocky and stout, with pronounced withers, a short neck and large head. The small horse from central Finland, on the other hand, was \"more noble\", with a longer body, lighter neck and more refined head. The Swedish professor Eric \u00c5kerblom even suggested that the Finnish horse spread along river valleys to Troms, Norway, and was the ancestor of the Nordlandshest/Lyngshest, found around the Lyngenfjord. The Norwegians continue to utilise Finnhorse bloodlines, having purchased the Finnish pony-type stallion Viri 632-72P for stud use in 1980. However, \u00c5kerblom dismissed the possibility that the eastern Finnhorse came from same prototype as the western pony breeds. In 1927, veterinarian and professor Veikko Rislakki (then Svanberg) proposed a different theory in his doctoral thesis. He argued that three types of wild horses existed in Europe, one of which he believed to be the Przewalski's Horse. Rislakki believed this unrefined and notably large-headed type was the horse the early Finns encountered about 1000 BCE. He suggested that the Finns later encountered other peoples and horses south of the Gulf of Finland, and that these peoples had better proportioned horses with a shorter muzzle and wider forehead, descended from the Tarpan. In addition, Rislakki suggested that the Finns came across European horses of Spanish and French origin during the first few centuries CE, larger in size and with narrow foreheads. Rislakki believed that his craniometric examinations, carried out in the 1920s, proved the influence of all these three horse types. Almost 20 years later, during the Continuation War, Rislakki also measured Karelian horses, and proposed they also came from an original Northern European animal descended from the Tarpan. Modern studies have discredited theories suggesting modern domesticated horse breeds descending from the Tarpan or the Przewalski's horse. The modern Konik horse resembles the extinct Tarpan however. In the early 20th\u00a0century, English J. C. Edward and Norwegian S. Petersen, proposed that Finland and the other countries surrounding the Gulf of Finland were the home region for the so-called \"yellow pony\". A later ethnologist, Kustaa Vilkuna (1902\u20131980) supported this view, proposing that an \"Estonian-Finno-Karelian pony\" descended from a small forest horse previously widespread in the lands surrounding the Gulf of Finland. Earliest horse equipment (bits) found in Finnish graves date from the Finnish Middle Iron Age, beginning from circa 400 CE. Breeds considered to descend from the same early types as the Finnhorse include the Estonian Native horse, the Norwegian Nordlandshest/Lyngshest, the Swedish Gotland Russ, the Mezen horse from the region of Archangelsk, Russia, and the Lithuanian \u017demaitukas. At some point in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions crossbred with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work. The earliest known documentation of Finnish trade in horses, both as imports and exports, dates to 1299, when Pope Gregory IX sent a letter of reprimand to the merchants of Gotland, who were selling horses to the non-Christianized Finns. Apparently the Finns succeeded in improving their horse population, as the predominant form of Finnish trade in horses eventually shifted from imports to exports. A Russian chronicle from 1338 mentions \"Tamma-Karjala\" (\"Karelia of the Mares\"), presumably denoting a place of good horse breeding. As early as in 1347, King Magnus IV saw it necessary to put limits to the horse exports from Karelia to Russia. Later, the 16th\u00a0century writer Olaus Magnus mentioned the high quality of the horses used by the early Finns; in the 1520s, Gustav Vasa found the Finns exporting horses by the shipload to L\u00fcbeck, and strictly prohibited such trading, banning the sale of horses under the age of 7 years."

        "content": "The earliest document noting the importation of outside horses to Finland is a papal letter in 1229. During the Swedish rule of Finland that followed, foreign horses obtained by the Finnish cavalry, whether purchased for replenishment or seized as spoils of war, probably influenced the Finnish horse population. The first significant, planned efforts to improve the quality of horses through selective breeding in Finland occurred in the 16th\u00a0century, when Gustav Vasa, known for his interest in horse breeding, founded mare manors (), stud farms, on his properties in Western Finland. He ordered the importation of larger horses from Central Europe, mainly from the region of Friesland. These horse were brought to Sweden and probably into Finland as well. The imports were kept at regional royal farms (, literally, \"King's estate\") to service local mares. In a letter from 1556, Gustav Vasa mentions that there were 231 breeding horses of this kind in Finland. It is not known whether these horses were imported directly from Central Europe to Finland, or descended from imports brought first to Sweden. Friesian stallions were used in Finland early in the 16th\u00a0century to increase the size of the Finnish horse, and were employed for breeding in the royal farms up until the 1650s. Gustav Vasa also carried out major reforms of his cavalry. After the decline of heavy cavalry in the Late Middle Ages, light cavalry was gaining importance, and with it a new approach to horse breeding. In 1550, he gave orders that \"stud manors\" () be founded on royal farms (Sw: kungsg\u00e5rd), not only in Sweden but also in every municipality of Finland. These studs were to each hold 20 mares and a smaller number of stallions, both Finnish horses and horses imported from Sweden. Gustav Vasa also imported mares from the lands bordering the North Sea; most likely of a Friesian type. His goal was to increase the size and weight of the Finnish horse population. His successor, Eric XIV prohibited the exporting of Finnish horses, which demonstrated the success of these efforts as well as the importance of the horses of the region of Finland. The horse breeding farms lasted only for about 100 years under later rulers of the Vasa line before the programs deteriorated. The last of the stud manors, that of Pori, was closed in 1651, and the crown-owned stallions and mares of the Pori stud were transported to Gotland. Outside of these breeding efforts, Finnish horses were widely kept in semi-feral conditions through the mid-19th century. Ethnologist Kustaa Vilkuna describes how all horses regardless of sex and age were let out on forest pastures for the summer after the spring fieldwork was finished. The pasture was scarce and the terrain challenging, with both rocky ground and wetlands. Vilkuna considers this practice an important factor in making the Finnhorse an easy-keeping, hardy breed."

However, the Finnish cavalry survey records (katselmusp\u00f6yt\u00e4kirjat) from the 1620s indicate this goal was not achieved. The heights of horses surveyed in 1623, measured not at the withers but at the highest point of the croup, which provides a height measurement significantly different from standard measures, ranged between , the taller animals being the horses of officers. Only the horses owned by Colonel Herman Fleming were taller, with a croup measurement of . It is not known if these horses were domestic crossbreeds or imported. The average height of the horses of the troops of Hollola, Pori and Raseborg was only  one year, but those in the next year's survey were . Overall, there were no pony-sized horses below a croup measurement of , and the all-around average height of the horses used by the cavalry was about . During the Thirty Years' War in 1618\u20131648, the horses used by Finnish cavalry were small and unrepresentative, considered inferior even to the cargo horses used by the Swedish Royal Army. However, these animals had great stamina, a crucial quality during long, exhausting campaigns. The humble-looking Finnish horses were presumably exchanged when possible for other horses obtained as spoils of war. It was probably rare for a cavalryman to return with the same horse with which he left, and it is likely that the horses brought back to Finland were crossbreeds or of purely Central European lines. Reinforcements to replace the considerable horse casualties were obtained from the Baltic States, but during the reign of Charles XI almost all of the cavalry horses were imported from south of the Gulf of Finland, due to their larger size. Before World War II, the Finnhorse was the breed that made up almost all of the horses that were part of the Finnish army and mounted police forces. While officers mostly rode various foreign light horse breeds, the so-called \"light type\" of Finnhorse was used for the enlisted members of the cavalry. Many of the most talented Finnhorses had competitive success during their service. After the war, the Finnish cavalry was converted to infantry, and the use of the Finnhorse for riding purposes nearly ended."

        "content": "The Finnish horse had been intentionally crossbred from as early as the 16th\u00a0century. Friesians and Oldenburgs were among the first known influences in the breed, having been used in the early 17th\u00a0century to add size. Friesian horses were used systematically until the 1650s. During the 18th\u00a0century, new warmblood breeds were created throughout Europe by crossing local native horse populations with light, hotblooded riding horses. Finnish military officers developed an interest in similar breeding while on study secondments (assignments) in foreign military forces. In 1781, Colonel Yrj\u00f6 Maunu Sprengtporten founded a state stud farm in conjunction with the Haapaniemi military school. The stud had a few stallions described as \"Arabian\" and \"Andalusian\". For about 30 years, these stallions influenced the local horse population outside the military school as well, and a number of writings from the 19th\u00a0century mention a \"Haapaniemi breed\". Similar if smaller crossbreeding programs developed elsewhere; at Tavinsalmen kartano, the royal estate (kungsg\u00e5rd) of Tavinsalmi, at least one of the mares had been imported from Sweden. Russian Orlov trotters and Don horses also influenced the Finnhorse population in the first half the 19th\u00a0century, improving its size, ridability and refinement. The horse type originating in Northern Savonia known as the \"F\u00fcrstenbergian breed,\" bred by the engineer F\u00fcrstenberg at the beginning of the 19th\u00a0century, was a crossbreed between the Finnish horses and Orlov trotters. The influence of Don horses was seen as late as in the 1920s and 1930s among the black and bay horses used by the Finnish cavalry \u2013 the dragoons of Nyland had two full squadrons of these colours. In addition to the needs of the military, crossbreeding was used to improve the common working horse; improved roads and advances in agriculture had replaced the previously predominant oxen with the horse, and more horses of better quality were needed for transport and agricultural work. Attempts to create better working horses used many breeds, including Percherons and a heavy Norwegian breed; Ardennes horses were favoured in Southern Ostrobothnia and Southern Finland. In Southern Savonia a multitude of breeds were used. The amount and diversity of crossbreeding led to difficulties in creating a consistent type up until the beginning of the 20th\u00a0century and the creation of the Finnhorse studbook; some of the first stallions accepted in the studbook were criticised for having a \"Norwegian\" look. Other intentional crossbreeding experiments included the bloodstock of Sarkkila and Hali in Northern Karelia, descended from crosses with Russian military horses. The breeding programme of Sarkkila stated one of the stallions to be of \"F\u00fcrstenbergian breed\", and one of the mares of \"oriental\" descent. The \"Hali breed\", descending from the stallions of Sarkkila, was an important influence in the pedigree of a few notable Finnhorse trotter sires such as Eino 680 and his son Eino-Vakaa 25. Some estates, especially in southern regions of Finland, were known to have used stallions of several light and hot-blooded breeds; for example, an officer in Pernaja bred Arabians. These crossbreeds were probably an attempt to create showy driving horses. A notable failing of a crossbreeding attempt happened in 1875, when a stud was founded in Porvoo to import and export Norfolk Trotters, a breed that has had important influence in several driving horse breeds, including the Standardbred. The crossbred offspring were praised for their looks, but turned out to have poor temperaments and no talent for speed. Due to a combination of the large population of horses in Finland (over 200,000 animals) and the later enthusiasm for purebreeding, these estate-based crossbreeding attempts never had significant influence on the modern Finnish horse. An especially detailed description of the best Finnish horses of the mid-19th\u00a0century is available due to the development of the Tori horse in Estonia. Three experts were consulted about the Finnish horse in order to ascertain its value for the project. According to the stud farm inspector of the Russian Empire, Mayendorff, Finnish horses were found in four types: the \"Haapaniemi type\", the \"F\u00fcrstenbergian type\", an \"Orlov type\", and a \"Karelian type\". A Finnish academic master, A. Elving, considered Finnish horses most purebred in Karelia, and mixed elsewhere, especially in Southwest Finland, where Swedish, North-German and even English horses had been crossed with Finnish ones, while in Karelia and Savonia the outside influence had been mainly Russian. Swedish count Carl Gustav Wrangler, a respected hippologist of the time, mentioned in his report that Finns were then importing Norfolk Trotters for crossbreeding purposes. Documents created some years after a number of Finnish horses had been imported to the Tori stud describe the Finnish mares obtained. Their average height was , and the colour was typically dark with a star. Their heads were large and necks short but well-carried; their bodies sturdy and proportionate with muscular withers, deep chest and muscular back; the loins were on the long side, and the haunches muscular if sloping. The leg joints were well-defined, the pasterns short and the feet tough. However, records also noted that the legs had \"serious faults of position,\" not further defined. The Finnish horses also were considered calm and good workers, and swift walkers and runners."

        "content": "In the 18th\u00a0century, the horse population of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At the beginning of the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger than at any other time in history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718. The Russian invasion and occupation caused additional hardships. By the end of Russian occupation in 1721, a third of the Finnish human populace as well as large numbers of horses were lost to war and epidemic diseases. Furthermore, a great number of horses were exported to Russia during the invasion at the command of Peter\u00a0I. Horses removed from Finland ended up mainly in the area of Vyatka government, and some Russian researchers such as Simanov and Moerder have suggested that the Vyatka horse was developed mainly from Estonian and Finnish bloodlines. In addition to the hardships of war and occupation, the treaties of Nystad in 1721 and \u00c5bo in 1743 ceded Finnish territory to Russia, which resulted in much of the Finnish horse population being left behind the new borders. The Finnish horses in these now-Russian areas were crossbred with the Russian horses in significant numbers. With the Russians having taken the best animals, combined with the old custom of pastures shared by municipalities or larger areas, rebuilding the horse population took decades. To increase numbers, horses were often bred too young, and inbreeding also occurred. By 1761, one of the first researchers in the agricultural chemistry in Finland described the Finnish horse population of the time: According to ethnologist Kustaa Vilkuna's estimations, calculated from measurements of horse collars used in Finland in the early 18th\u00a0century, the average peasant's horse was about  tall, while some horses employed by manors were larger, sometimes more than  tall. Vilkuna also discovered that the horses of the southern and western regions of Finland were larger than those of the northern and eastern regions. This was probably due to the influence of imported horses. By the mid-18th\u00a0century, a typical Finnish horse was probably about , about the same size as a small contemporary Finnhorse yearling, and weighed about , roughly half the weight of a contemporary  working section horse. A civilian horse of good quality had good action and was swift. However, leg faults were common. In response to the decline of the Finnish horse population and especially the great loss of good quality breeding animals experienced during the great famine of 1866\u20131868, the Senate of Finland gave orders for three provinces to obtain quality stallions for public use. The scope of the programme was later expanded to include eight provinces, and Finland was divided into breeding districts, which were all to have a state-owned stallion available to service local mares. The horses in this programme became known as \"crown stallions\" (). Official guidelines for the selection of stallions were never given, but one common aim throughout Finland was to increase the size and bulk of the horse population to create a type better suited for agricultural work."

In the beginning of the 19th\u00a0century, German historian Friedrich R\u00fchs especially blamed the west coast estates for damaging the Finnish horse by crossbreeding. Nonetheless, outside stallions were still imported to Finland. At the end of the century, stallions \"of oriental, Arabian blood\" still served at state farms. The influence of the Russian-imported \"oriental\" Turkish and Caucasian horses, as well as \"F\u00fcrstenbergian\" horses was also noted. Orlov Trotters were used in Savonia and Karelia, and Norwegian stallions were brought to northern Ostrobothnia. Light riding horses were imported from Russian and Central Europe. Conversely, heavier horses such as the Norfolk Trotter and Ardennes were imported to southern Finland as late as 1870. As Finnish nationalism arose and increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, crossbreeding of the Finnish horse essentially ended and a new direction was taken by Finnish horse breeders. The breed was considered a symbol of the nation, and thus it was desired that it be as purebred as possible. On 20 November 1894, Finland's first horse breeding association Hevoskasvatusyhdistys Hippos (now Suomen Hippos) was founded to breed and improve the Finnish horse by the means of purebreeding, and in 1905, a governmental decree was issued for horse breeding associations to be founded throughout the country, leading to the establishment of the Finnhorse stud book in 1907. At first the only notable objectives of the Finnhorse breeding programme concerned appearance, especially the colour, of the breed. The aim was to remove \"foreign\" characteristics. Later, in the 1920s, trials of performance were introduced, and since then, the main objectives of the Finnhorse breeding programme have continued to encourage improvements in the capacity, movement, conformation and character of the breed. Since the establishment of the Finnhorse stud book it has been closed and the breed has been bred pure. While accidental and even intentional Finnhorse crossbreds exist, they are not accepted for the Finnhorse registry and have not been used to develop new breeds within Finland. The Finnhorse stud book remains in the control of Suomen Hippos."

Animals were procured from private owners in a systematic procedure, but to ensure the continuity of Finnhorse breeding, neither stallions nor any nursing, pregnant or studbook-approved mares were enrolled to be eligible for military procurement. All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were marked for identification and as necessary, were returned or reported dead. The program was successful in preserving the breed, as the horse population rebounded to its pre-war count of over 380,000 animals as soon as 1945. The great number of Russian horses captured as mat\u00e9riel during wartime became a threat to the Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian animals were stallions, and there was no way to ensure new owners would not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia would not accept these horses back as a part of Finland's massive war indemnity. Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18,000 animals were sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia."

The horse population, consisting almost entirely of Finnhorses, remained stable for 50 years. The rebuilding of the country after two wars had increased demand for horse power, and by the 1950s, the breed reached its all-time peak, with an estimated 409,000 animals, with a great majority of the horses being of the draught type. However, with the increased mechanisation of agriculture and forestry in the 1960s, the number of Finnhorses dropped precipitously. Horses, having been bred in large numbers only a few years earlier, were taken to slaughter by the thousands; a change in forestry tax policy made previously state-supported horse-powered forestry unprofitable and further discouraged keeping horses. Many working horse bloodlines ended, while lines more suitable for sports and recreation survived. By the 1970s, the breed's numbers had declined to 90,000 animals, and 10 years later as few as 20,000 Finnhorses existed. The breed's all-time lowest point was 1987, with only 14,100 horses. By this time, however, the overall horse population in Finland had been increasing for almost a decade, with lighter harness racing horse breeds establishing their position, counting 12,800 animals the same year. Although other breeds were being increasingly imported and bred, the numbers of the Finnhorse population also slowly began to recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed. Harness racing and associated parimutuel betting, and to some degree also the relatively new hobby of riding, became the most important factors ensuring the survival of the breed."

        "content": "Nearly all Finnish horses foaled since 1971 have been registered. During the first decade of the 21st century, the breed's numbers in Finland stabilised at roughly 20,000 animals, and approximately 1,000 foals are born annually. The breed makes up roughly one third of Finland's total horse population. The objective for ensuring the breed's continuity is to have at least 200 stallions and 2,000 mares used for breeding every year, 3,000 horses used for harness racing, and 6,000 horses for riding and other uses. In the 21st century, most Finnhorses are bred to be trotters, but the breed is also popular at riding schools and for recreational riding. The Finnhorse is a relatively unknown horse breed outside of Finland, with no organised efforts to promote it internationally. The very word \"Finnhorse\" was only recently coined, and only became the standard name after 1990. However, a few Finnhorses exist outside Finland, having been exported in small numbers to nations such as Germany and Sweden. As part of an equestrian exchange project carried out in the 1980s, a number of Finnhorses were sold to Austria and Germany in 1985 and 1987. In Germany, the horses were used as foundation bloodstock for the Freund stud, which went on to breed dozens  of Finnhorses, selling them in Germany and Austria.  A number of horses were also exported to the Netherlands. The German Finnhorse population remains the most notable one outside Finland, with 150 animals. Apart from the exchange project of the late 1980s, activity to export the Finnhorse has been minimal. However, a 2008 study stated that increased international interest and demand for the Finnhorse was advisable to ensure the survival of the breed. To this end, the objectives of the national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating demand for the breed for recreation and lower level equestrian education; to make it the standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats. Within Finland, the Finnhorse is considered to have value as the national horse breed with cultural ties and strong support from a variety of Finnhorse organisations. On the other hand, progress in popularizing the breed internationally is complicated by its low population and lack of international recognition.  The strengths of the breed in international disciplines are considered to be its good health and working qualities, its versatility, and its novelty value outside of Finland. The versatility of the breed's \"universal\" horse type, a Finnish concept, has plusses and minuses:  It creates a challenge in marketing because of its vague status to buyers who currently tend to seek conventional horse types, and as a result it lacks a strong advantage over specialized breeds. Yet, the versatility of the Finnhorse can also be an advantage; more specialised breeds may be limited to a smaller range of activities."

The Finnish horses exported to Russia in early 19th\u00a0century influenced the development of the Vyatka horse. In the 19th\u00a0century and early 20th\u00a0century, horses of Finnish origin were used in creating many Baltic and Russian agricultural draught breeds, such as the Tori Horse and the Lithuanian Draught. In most cases, these breeds were developed by crossbreeding Finnish horses on small local horses, thus increasing size. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Finnhorse was also used in the breeding of the Estonian horse. The heavy Mezen horse was bred with both the Finnhorse and the Estonian Horse, until its stud book was closed in the 1950s. Traces of Finnhorse influence is found in other Soviet and Russian work horse breeds, in the mid-20th\u00a0century, Finland exported 15,000 horses to Soviet Russia as part of its war indemnity. In the 1960s and 1970s, pony-sized Finnhorses were also used to improve quality and broaden the gene pool of the Norwegian Nordlandshest, which had become highly inbred by the 1960s."

Finnish horses were among the good quality breeds considered for the job. The state stud farm of Tori was founded as the central base for the new Estonian breed in 1856, and ten Finnish mares and three stallions were bought for its needs. Though some purebred Finnish horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove as good as expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using Finnish horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T."

Many Finnhorses have multiple uses, such as starting their career in harness racing and later moving on to riding. Finnhorses perform both at their own competitions and in open, all-breed classes in dressage, show jumping, and eventing. They are also used for endurance riding, western riding and combined driving. Approximately 1,000 Finnhorses are used in riding schools and in riding therapy, as they are usually easy going and pleasant to ride. They are also popular as pleasure horses."

        "content": "Agricultural and forestry work were the traditional uses of the Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, as it was the only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200\u00a0percent of their own weight. There are few draft-type Finnhorse family lines left, and only an estimated two or three hundred animals are known to be used as actual workhorses in the 21st century. However, interest in traditional uses and methods has been increasing, and workhorse competitions are regularly held which usually include horse pulling or ploughing contests."

        "content": "Finnhorses have historically been used for harness racing, with organised harness races having been held since 1817. Prior to that, racing from church back home had been a traditional recreation among farmers, and harness racing remained a farmer's hobby up to the end of the 1950s.  By that time, the number of horses kept in Finland was plummeting and racing lost popularity. After 1959 the Finnhorse was no longer the only horse breed that was allowed to race in Finland; the importing of faster, light trotter breeds and the introduction of Parimutuel betting brought professionalism and new life to the harness racing sport. Increased interest in betting led to growth in racing, which in turn helped establish harness racing as the main use for the Finnhorse during the next decades. Finnhorses also successfully compete in combined driving, and are the breed most often used for the sport in Finland, especially at regional and national levels; the Finnhorse Jehun Viima, driven by Heidi Sinda, was a member of the Finnish singles driving team that finished 2nd at the 2002 World Singles Championships in Conty, France. According to Sinda, the Finnhorse is ideally suited for combined driving, being well-mannered, focused, hard working, obedient, and possessing \"cool nerves.\""

        "content": "Finnhorses are popular as recreational riding horses, and well-suited for use at riding schools, trekking, and riding therapy. Of the ten horses currently employed by the mounted police of Helsinki, two are Finnhorses, though they are considered a bit small for the job. They are also competitive in many disciplines, and in the 1970s separate competition classes for Finnhorses were established at horse shows, which also helped to increase the popularity of the breed. While in eventing and horse racing, Finnhorses are too slow to compete directly against Thoroughbreds and the sport horse breeds, they are a highly reliable mount for cross-country riding, particularly over difficult terrain; during the Continuation War, the breed successfully crossed any wetland with which it was confronted. In endurance riding. Uusi-Helin\u00e4, ridden by Ritva Lampinen, successfully finished the endurance riding world championship competition in Stockholm, Sweden in 1990, finishing 28th. The Finnhorse is considered a reliable and fairly good jumper, and is regularly seen in  show jumping classes. Finnhorses have been quite successful at lower levels because they are clean and efficient jumpers, but their shorter stride at the canter and gallop keeps them from competing at more advanced levels. In his 1952 book Ratsastuskirja, Olympic rider Werner Walld\u00e9n described the Finnhorse as enduring and resilient, mentally focused, and an easy keeper. He considered jumping to be the breed's best asset as a riding animal, but noted that its scope does not reach the level required for modern international competition. In dressage, the Finnhorse is able to compete with warmbloods up to national levels, and in lower levels it has the upper hand because it can easily perform the required movements, and has smoother gaits that allow for ease of riding. In 2010, a Finnhorse medaled in international paraequestrian dressage competition. In higher level dressage, the breed however it is hindered by its less-flashy movement, restricted by a somewhat upright shoulder. Despite this there are successful dressage horses, and a number of Finnhorses even earn their keep with their dressage winnings, a notable achievement as competing in Finland is expensive and prize money low. Most Finnhorses used in dressage compete at the national 4th level (US) or Grade IV (GB), though some individuals have competed at the Prix de St. Georges level. The Finnhorse is also well-suited to riding therapy, being calm and steady, hard-working, obedient, healthy and enduring. They are small enough to allow the patient to be assisted easily, yet large enough to have gaits that stimulate the muscles, senses, and balance of the rider. Many Finnhorses have also been trained for driving, and therefore are familiar with unusual noises and can be controlled from behind, and ex-trotters are inexpensive. Many Finns also find the appearance of the Finnhorse comforting."

These were Earth-based space policemen who patrolled the United Worlds of the Solar System in the not-too-distant future. Rocky and his crew would routinely blast-off in a V-2-like, chemically-fueled, upright rocketship, the Orbit Jet XV-2. It was later replaced by the nearly identical Silver Moon XV-3 on missions to moons and planetoids, where the odds of success seemed remote, yet they would always prevail. Although they might destroy a rocketship full of unseen villains, their space pistols were never fired at people, and conflicts were always resolved with only fistfights. Although many strange worlds were visited, the alien characters usually spoke American English, and always appeared as normal humans, albeit wearing bizarre costumes in normal environments. The script-writers did not appear to know the difference between planets, moons, stars, and constellations, so that the specific locations Rocky and his sidekicks visited are generally unknown to astronomers. Half-hour episodes were usually grouped into storylines that consisted of three \"chapters\" that were broadcast in successive weeks. A few of the storylines were completed in a single episode."

To the women of these stories, he is irresistible, even to arch-villain Cleolanta. Winky: Rocky's faithful co-pilot and sidekick, the womanizing Winky was the upbeat comic relief to balance the always serious Rocky. Winky was played by Scotty Beckett, one of the original Our Gang comedies' kids. The Winky character was replaced by Biffen \"Biff\" Cardoza (James Lydon) from the planet Herculon after 26 episodes, when Beckett became unavailable, serving time in jail for carrying a concealed weapon. Vena Ray: The beautiful blond Vena serves as Rocky's navigator and translator and was a strong female role model in some episodes. She was played by character actor Sally Mansfield. Bobby: Bobby is the young ward of Professor Newton who wants to grow up to be a Space Ranger, and no mention was ever made of his parents or origins. He was portrayed by Robert Lyden. Professor Newton: Played by Maurice Cass. Professor Newton could always be counted on to provide the scientific explanation for the fantastic events that unfolded, and although elderly, he would often accompany the crew on their space adventures. The character of Professor Newton was replaced by Professor Mayberry upon Cass' death in 1954. Secretary Drake: As the head of the Office of Space Affairs and the Space Rangers, Secretary Drake was a father figure to Rocky and his crew, and to him Rocky was like his own son. Secretary Drake was played by Charles Meredith. Cleolanta: Played by Patsy Parsons. Cleolanta is the Suzerain (queen) of the planet Ophecius. She was usually the force behind the troubles that befell the United Worlds, but secretly she had a crush on Rocky. She often berated her henchmen for not measuring up to him. Juliandra/Noviandra: Played by Ann Robinson. Juliandra is the Suzerain of the planet Herculon and friendly to the United Worlds, and she is the one who offers the services of Biffen Cardoza as the replacement co-pilot for the Silver Moon. She has an imprisoned mad twin sister, Noviandra, who hates the United Worlds and everything for which it stands. Pinto Vortando: Pinto is a seedy, unshaven space rogue whose presence usually meant trouble for Rocky. He was played by Ted Hecht. Bovarro: Big and boisterous, he lives with his wife and young son on the storm-wracked moon Posita, one of the two \"gypsy moons\" (the surviving moon was called Negato) due to it crashing into Opheucius in the three episode adventure, Crash of the Moons. He was played by John Banner. Ranger Clark: One of Rocky's fellow Rangers. Clark operates the refueling space station O.W.9. Ranger Clark was played by William Hudson."

        "content": "Rocky Jones was the creation of Roland D. Reed, a Hollywood producer best known for his successful My Little Margie TV series. Roland Reed Productions was founded in 1950, and in 1951 Warren Wilson penned the screenplay for the Rocky Jones pilot. By the end of 1951, a cast had been selected, headed by Richard Crane as Rocky Jones and one-time Our Gang member Scotty Beckett, as Rocky\u2019s co-pilot and comic relief, Winky. The pilot was filmed between January and April 1952 with the titles and effects shots being prepared in March of that year. The outdoor scenes were filmed at Palomar Mountain Observatory. Post-production was completed in May. The pilot was screened on September 29, 1952. Although the premise showed potential, several characters were recast, including Vena Ray and Secretary Drake. With the new cast finally in place and teleplays prepared for the first 26 episodes, filming began in October 1953 and continued until April 1954. A merchandising blitz began during this time. Wristwatches, wallets complete with space dollars, badges, buttons, records, and clothing were produced to promote the show. A Rocky Jones, Space Ranger comic book was issued by Charlton Comics. Issues 15, 16, 17, and 18 of the ongoing title Space Adventures are devoted to Rocky's adventures. Rocky, Winky, Vena, Bobby, and Cleolanta appear prominently. The largest sponsor of the series was the Gordon Baking Company, makers of Silvercup Bread, the original sponsor of the Lone Ranger radio and television series. The series finally premiered the week of Monday, February 22, 1954, at various days and times on stations across the United States. Off-screen issues began almost immediately. In February 1954, Scotty Beckett was arrested for possessing a weapon after being implicated in an armed robbery at the Cavalier Hotel in Hollywood. After posting bail, he fled to Mexico where he encountered more problems for writing bad checks and more weapons charges. After a gun battle with local police, he was incarcerated for four months, and did not return to the United States until September 1954. By then, the character of Winky had been written out of the show, replaced by Biffen Cardoza (James Lydon). After filming of the initial 26 episodes ended, Maurice Cass (Professor Newton) died of a heart attack on June 8, 1954. An additional 13 episodes were ordered, and filming took place between August and October 1954. Lydon continued to play Biffen Cardoza, and Professor Newton was replaced by Professor Mayberry (Reginald Sheffield), while regular villain Cleolanta, Suzerain of Ophiucius (Patsy Parsons) was replaced by Juliandra, Suzerain of Herculon (Ann Robinson). No further episodes were ordered, and the series ended after 39 episodes. (Several researchers have stated that this may have been due to the high cost of the special effects, which apparently made the series unprofitable, especially since the show was syndicated, rather than being broadcast by a major network.) Today, all 39 episodes of the TV series are available for viewing on YouTube."

A beautiful saloon singer (Jane Greer) catches Haven's eye. After he meets Mrs. Caslon (Agnes Moorehead), who owns the gold mine, Haven hears that someone called \"Charlie\" is the brains behind the scene. He finds out to his surprise that Charlie is the singer. Charlie's lawyer, Bristow (Raymond Burr), is $6,000 in her debt and therefore might be involved in the gold theft.

Charlie's friend, Prince (Gordon Oliver), meanwhile, is growing jealous of her interest in Haven.

Haven convinces him rather that he is the next target of Prince and Charlie as he knows too much. Bristow, terrified, tries to get away but is shot by Prince. Haven is pinned down, but after persuading the sheriff to arrest him for the crime, Haven escapes, and learns that Charlie's men plan to disguise themselves as soldiers to steal more of Mrs. Caslon's gold. He foils this plot, then arrives back at the saloon, to arrest Charlie, but also because he is in love with her. Prince sneaks up intending to shoot Haven, but his bullet hits Charlie instead. Haven kills Prince. Before she dies, Charlie  tells Haven that she loves him, and Haven confesses his love for her.

The film is about an Egyptian mystic named Andoheb (George Zucco) who is ordered by his High Priest (Eduardo Ciannelli) to guard over the mummy of Kharis (Tom Tyler), who can be revived or neutralized by burning a handful of tanna leaves. Meanwhile, archeologists Steve Banning (Dick Foran) and Babe Jenson (Wallace Ford) try to persuade magician Solvani (Cecil Kellaway) to finance an expedition in search of Ananka's sarcophagus. They are joined by Solvani's daughter Marta (Peggy Moran) and Andoheb disguised as the professor of Egyptology at the Cairo Museum. Kharis is ordered to kill off expedition members Dr. Petrie (Charles Trowbridge) and Ali (Leon Belasco) while Andoheb becomes attracted to Marta who he plans to kidnap and make immortal. The Mummy's Hand was made after the financial success of two other Universal Products: Son of Frankenstein and The Invisible Man Returns which led to the studio making a follow-up to The Mummy. The film had what was described as \"modest\" budget and reuses footage from The Mummy as well as reusing nearly the entire score from Son of Frankenstein. The film was shot with a planned budget of $80,000 but went $4,000 over-budget as production completed.

The dying priest of the sect explains the story of Kharis to Andoheb, involving the theft of sacred tana leaves that can restore life to the dead Princess Ananka, who Kharis secretly loves. Kharis' penalty upon being discovered is to be buried alive, without a tongue, and the tana leaves are buried with him. During the cycle of the full moon, the fluid from the brew of three tana leaves is to be administered to the creature to keep him alive. Should despoilers enter the tomb of the Princess, a fluid of nine leaves will restore movement to the monster. Meanwhile in 1940, down on his luck archaeologist Steve Banning and his sidekick, Babe Jenson, discover the remnants of a broken vase in a Cairo bazaar. Banning is convinced it is an authentic ancient Egyptian relic, and his interpretation of the hieroglyphs on the piece lead him to believe it contains clues to the location of the Princess Ananka's tomb. With the support of the eminent Dr. Petrie (Charles Trowbridge) of the Cairo Museum, but against the wishes of Andoheb, who is also employed by the museum, Banning seeks funds for his expedition. Banning and Jenson meet an American magician, Solvani (Cecil Kellaway), who agrees to fund their quest while they also get into a scuffle with Andoheb\u2019s henchmen. His daughter Marta is not as convinced, thanks to a prior visit from Andoheb, who brands the two young archeologists as frauds. The expedition departs in search of the Hill of the Seven Jackals, with the Solvanis tagging along. In their explorations, they stumble upon the tomb of Kharis, finding the mummy along with the tana leaves, but find nothing to indicate the existence of Ananka's tomb. Andoheb appears to Dr. Petrie in the mummy's cave and has the surprised scientist feel the creature's pulse. After administering the tana brew from nine leaves, the monster quickly dispatches Petrie and escapes with Andoheb, through a secret passageway, to the temple on the other side of the mountain. The creature continues his periodic marauding about the camp, killing an Egyptian overseer and eventually attacking Solvani and kidnapping Marta. Banning and Jenson set out to track Kharis down, with Jenson going around the mountain and Banning attempting to follow the secret passage they have discovered inside the tomb. Andoheb has plans of his own. Enthralled by Marta's beauty, he plans to inject himself and his captive with tana fluid, making them both immortal. Jenson arrives in the nick of time, and guns down Andoheb outside of the temple, while Banning attempts to rescue the girl. However, Kharis appears on the scene and in the ensuing struggle, Banning's bullets have no effect on the immortal being. Marta overheard Adoheb tell the secret of the tana fluid and tells Banning and Jenson that Kharis must not be allowed to drink any more of the serum. When the creature raises the tana serum to his lips, Jenson shoots the container from his grasp. Dropping to the floor, Kharis attempts to ingest the spilled life-giving liquid. Banning seizes the opportunity to overturn a brazier onto the monster, engulfing it in flames. The ending has the members of the expedition heading happily back to the United States with the mummy of Ananka, and the spoils of her tomb."

The film's budget was set at $80,000 and began filming towards the end of May 1940. The authors of the book Universal Horrors described the budget as \"modest\" and noted that cost-cutting for the film involved using stock shots taken from The Mummy, leftover sets from James Whale's film Green Hell, and musical scores almost entirely lifted from Son of Frankenstein. The producer for the film was Ben Pivar, who Reginald LeBorg described as the epitome artless, noncreative studio executive who was often crude and occasionally seemed illiterate. The Mummy's Hands production continued into mid-June, which led director Christy Cabanne and his crew to film into overtime hours. According to Peggy Moran, she had to be on set at 6am to do hair and makeup and filming began at 8am and would occasionally work as late as 4am the next day.  Moran commented that \"they could do that with people like me because we were under contract. The law requires that outside talent only work for X-number of hours, but me they could work all the time!\"  When asked about her fellow cast, she spoke positively about Dick Foran (\"very nice and friendly\") and Wallace Ford (\"very funny always\"). On Tom Tyler who played Kharis, she never met him without his make-up on, stating that he had to be at the studio at four in the morning and he couldn't talk with his make-up on.

While the scientists busily explore dank passageways and decipher weird hieroglyphics on tombs and chests, jackals howl outside, the native work-gangs mutiny and the mummy is always just around the corner. Once or twice Miss Moran makes a grimace \u2014 as if she had caught an unpleasant odor \u2014 and screams. Otherwise every one seems remarkably casual. If they don't seem to worry, why should we? Frightening or funny, take your choice.\" The Philadelphia Record found that the films plot was \"sheer nonsense\" but that the film \"manages to raise a few more goose pimples than other recent horror movies.\" \"Hobe.\" of Variety found the film to be \"muddled in the writing and clumsy in the production. Direction and photography are bush league. Acting varies from violent mugging to smooth under-playing.\" Graeme Clark of The Spinning Image comparing the movie with Boris Karloff's and granting 6 out of 10 stars, writes, \"This was no eerie love story across the millennia, this was straight fright fare with Universal Studios' least-loved monster, here in the form that viewers would know him best, shambling, strangling, singleminded and mute. A nice touch is that his eyes have been blacked out for his closeups, giving him an undead look. However, more than half the short movie is over before we get to the creepy chase scenes...\" The film holds a 67% \"Fresh\" rating on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 9 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10."

        "content": "Zombies of the Stratosphere is a 1952 black-and-white Republic Studios serial directed by Fred C. Brannon, with a screenplay by Ronald Davidson, and special effects by Republic's Lydecker brothers. It was intended to be Republic's second serial featuring \"new hero\" Commando Cody and the third 12-chapter serial featuring the rocket-powered flying jacket and helmet introduced in King of the Rocket Men (1949). Instead, for reasons unknown, the hero was renamed \"Larry Martin\", who must prevent Martian invaders from using a hydrogen bomb to blow Earth out of its orbit, so that the Martians can move a dying Mars into a closer position to the Sun. As in Radar Men from the Moon (also released in 1952), most of the screen time for each of the dozen chapters is spent on fistfights and car chases between the heroes and a gang of crooks hired by Narab and his extraterrestrial colleague Marex to steal and stockpile the Atomic supplies needed for construction of the H-bomb. The serial is best remembered as one of the first screen appearances of a young Leonard Nimoy, who plays Narab, one of the three Martian invaders. In 1958, a feature film version of this serial, retitled Satan's Satellites, was made by editing down the serial's footage to feature film length."

He takes to the air in his jet-powered rocket suit and helmet to investigate and discovers Martian invaders, led by Marex (Lane Bradford). Since Mars is now orbiting too far from the Sun and its ecology has been dying, the Martian invaders want to swap Earth's and Mars' orbits, so Mars will then be closer to the Sun. They plan on achieving this by using hydrogen bomb plans stolen from Earth scientists to cause the two planets' orbits to swap, using specifically placed atomic explosions on both worlds.  Martin also learns the Martians have Earth accomplices in the forms of the traitorous Dr. Harding (Stanley Waxman), and two gangsters, Roth (John Crawford) and Shane (Ray Boyle), who bedevil him and his associates, Sue Davis (Aline Towne) and Bob Wilson (Wilson Wood). The Martians set up a base in a cave that can only be reached from underwater, where they begin constructing their bomb; and make a remotely-controlled robot to supplement their human associates in acquiring supplies and funds to complete the project.  Eventually, Larry and his comrades gain the upper hand: Marex kills Harding when he attempts to surrender, Roth and Shane are killed when Larry turns the robot against them, and the Martians are brought down in flames in their rocket ship after a furious stratosphere raygun battle with Larry in his own spacecraft.  Marex's Martian aide, Narab (Leonard Nimoy) survives the crash and tells Larry where to find the underwater cave with the activated bomb in it.  Larry arrives in time to defuse the bomb just seconds before it would have exploded."

        "content": "Zombies of the Stratosphere was scripted as a sequel to the successful Radar Men from the Moon serial (1952), which introduced an original semi-superhero, Commando Cody, played by George Wallace; it interrupted production on a planned TV series, also built around that character, titled Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe, with Judd Holdren now starring as Cody. Then, just as filming began on the Zombies serial, the name of the hero was changed from \"Commando Cody\" to \"Larry Martin\"; but he retains all the same sidekicks (also renamed), high-tech props, and laboratory facilities that Cody had in the previous Radar Men from the Moon serial. An addition to the \"rocket man\" back-pack and helmet, and used for the first time in this serial, is a two-way radio about the size of a lunchbox; Larry Martin wears it hanging heavily from his belt when dressed for flying. This bulky radio is also seen in some stills of Cody in Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe. As most flying sequences are reused stock footage from earlier \"rocket man\" serials, the radio usually disappears when Commando Cody is in flight. Martin also uses an ordinary police revolver instead of the ray gun favored by Cody in earlier and later serials. Zombies of the Stratosphere was budgeted at $172,838, although the final negative cost was $176,357 (a $3,519, or 2%, overspend). It was the cheapest Republic serial of 1952 and was filmed between April 14, and May 1, 1952. At seventeen days, this is tied with King of the Carnival (1955) for the shortest filming period of all Republic serials. The serial's production number was 1933. Zombies of the Stratosphere reuses the \"Republic robot\" (somewhat resembling a walking silvery hot-water heater with two ribbed arms that terminate in pincers), along with stock footage of it in action (such as the \"bank robbery by robot\" scene from Mysterious Doctor Satan) and black-and-white footage from a Republic full color Roy Rogers film. The serial is also heavily padded with footage from their King of the Rocket Men (1949) serial, to which this is a pseudo-sequel. Although the Zombies serial has Martians as the villains, they are not the same Martians as shown in the Republic's earlier, The Purple Monster Strikes (1945) serial.  The robot was first seen in Republic's Undersea Kingdom (1936) and prominently featured in their Mysterious Doctor Satan (1940) serials."

It was  Coppola's feature film directorial debut.  The film stars William Campbell and Luana Anders with Bart Patton, Mary Mitchell, and Patrick Magee. It was released in the United States by American International Pictures during the fall of 1963 as the bottom half of a double feature with Corman's X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes. Although Coppola had been involved in at least two sexploitation films previously, Dementia 13 served as his first mainstream \"legitimate\" directorial effort. Corman offered Coppola the chance to direct a low-budget horror film in Ireland using funds left over from Corman's recently completed The Young Racers, on which Coppola had worked as a sound technician. The producer wanted a cheap Psycho copy, complete with gothic atmosphere and brutal killings, and Coppola quickly wrote a screenplay with Corman's requirements. Although he was given total directorial freedom during production, Coppola found himself at odds with Corman after the film was completed. The producer declared it unreleasable and demanded several changes be made. In 2017, Coppola's company, American Zoetrope, restored the film's director's cut under the supervision of James T, Mockoski, with editing by Robert Schafer, sound restoration by Jim McKee of Earwax Productions, and color supervision by Chris Martin of Mission Film and Design."

        "content": "While out rowing in the middle of a lake after dark, John Haloran and his young wife Louise argue about his rich mother's will. Louise is upset that everything is currently designated to go to charity in the name of a mysterious \"Kathleen.\" The argument, combined with the exertion of rowing the boat, causes John to have a heart attack. He informs Louise that, should he die before his mother, Louise will receive none of the inheritance, after which he promptly dies. Thinking quickly, the scheming Louise dumps his fresh corpse over the boat's side, where it sinks to the bottom of the lake. Her plan is to pretend that he is still alive so that she can ingratiate her way into the will. She types up a letter to her mother-in-law, Lady Haloran, inviting herself to the family's castle in Ireland while her husband is \"away on business.\" At the castle, she immediately notices that things are a little odd. John's two brothers, Billy, and Richard, take part in a bizarre, ritualistic ceremony with their mother, part of a yearly tribute to their deceased younger sister Kathleen, who died years before in a freak drowning accident. Lady Haloran still mourns for her daughter, and during the ceremony, she faints dead away as she does every year. As Louise helps her mother-in-law into the castle, Lady Haloran tells her that she fainted because one of the fresh flowers she had thrown died as it touched Kathleen's grave. Louise, realizing that Lady Haloran is emotionally overwrought and superstitious, devises a plan to convince the old woman that Kathleen is trying to communicate with her from beyond the grave. The plan involves stealing some of the dead girl's old toys and placing them at the bottom of the estate's pond, where they will float to the surface in a ghostly way during the middle of the day. That night, Louise swims underwater and begins placing the toys, as planned. She is shocked to see what appears to be Kathleen's perfectly preserved corpse at the bottom of the pond. Horrified, she surfaces and is abruptly attacked with an axe by an unknown assailant; her killer drags Louise's bloody corpse away. Concerned family doctor Justin Caleb arrives and becomes determined to solve the mystery. He intensely questions the family. The murderer, meanwhile, strikes again, decapitating a man named Simon, who has been poaching on the estate. Dr. Caleb has the pond drained, revealing a stone statue shrine, engraved with the words \"Forgive Me, Kathleen.\" The following night, Lady Haloran is attacked by a shadowy figure, but she eludes him and collapses in the castle's courtyard. Dr. Caleb finally uses an obscure nursery rhyme (\"Fishy, fishy, in a brook, Daddy caught you on a hook\"), recited by Billy under hypnosis, to help him discover Louise's frozen corpse hidden away in a meat locker. Next to the bloody body is a wax figure of Kathleen. Dr. Caleb places the figure in a public square to lure out the killer. Taking the bait, a gibbering Billy, who has gone insane with guilt over causing the death of his sister Kathleen, attempts to kill Richard's fianc\u00e9e Kane with an axe. Dr. Caleb saves her life by shooting Billy to death with a pistol he was carrying in his pocket."

Dementia 13 was one of several Roger Corman productions the veteran B-movie character actor appeared in, but it was the first that was completed on such a small budget. Coppola had convinced Campbell (and his The Young Racers co-star Patrick Magee) to appear in the film. The actor originally felt that it would turn out to be a strictly \"amateur endeavor\", but he soon became impressed by Coppola's leadership abilities, talent, and energy on the set. Campbell recalled years later, \"There were all kinds of promises as to what he [Coppola] would do for me later. It was one of those 'I-owe-you-one' things, but he never did anything! I tried to get to him when he was doing The Godfather, thinking that a cop or gangster part might be good for about 17 weeks, but after Dementia 13, I was never able to get through to him again!\" Luana Anders as Louise Haloran. Anders' role as the scheming wife of a rich but prematurely dead heir to a fortune is one of the actress's most notable screen roles. Dementia 13 was one of several appearances that she made in AIP productions. Most of these films had been directed by Roger Corman, including a major role co-starring with Vincent Price in The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Like Campbell and Patrick Magee, Anders had been borrowed by Coppola from the cast of Corman's just-completed film The Young Racers. After Dementia 13, Anders never had such a sizable role again, appearing in numerous small parts in both television and film until her death from breast cancer in 1996."

        "content": "Francis Ford Coppola worked as a sound man on Corman's The Young Racers (1963), a racing film which starred Campbell and Magee. That film was shot in several different countries, and after production was completed in Ireland, Corman still had $22,000 of the film's allocated $165,000 budget remaining. Corman originally thought of using the funds to direct a \"quickie\" film himself, but his schedule made this impractical. Instead, Corman suggested that Coppola remain in Ireland with a small crew and direct a low-budget horror film, to be produced by Corman. Coppola later recalled, \"Roger wanted to make Dementia 13 cheaply. He wanted it to be homicidal, sort of a copy of Psycho. You know, gothic and psychological, with some kind of terrible knife-killing scene thrown in. So I wrote the script to order\". Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night. The next morning, he described to Corman the most vividly detailed sequence: a half-naked woman ties several dolls to the bottom of a lake, then surfaces to find herself at the feet of an axe murder: \"axed to death!\", Coppola exclaimed. Corman was impressed enough to immediately provide Coppola with the $22,000 for the film. The young director was able to arrange an additional $20,000 in financing himself by pre-selling the European rights to a producer named Raymond Stross. Coppola did not inform Corman of the production's additional funding ... and quickly moved the initial $22,000 into a bank account in case an angry Corman ever attempted to reclaim his original investment. Coppola's friend Al Locatelli served as the film's art director and helped Coppola write the final script in three days, uncredited. The speed at which the screenplay was completed resulted in unrealistic, \"stilted\" dialogue that Campbell recalled as being very difficult for the actors to speak. The majority of the American actors in the cast were friends of Coppola's from UCLA, and many of them paid their own way to Ireland for the opportunity to appear in a film. Most of the Irish cast members were from the Abbey Theatre and were paid strictly minimum wage salaries. Eithne Dunne received approximately $600 for her performance. The cast and crew lived together in a farm house located outside of Dublin. Howth Castle, located in the Dublin suburb of Howth, depicted the fictitious \"Castle Haloran\" in the film. Principal photography on Dementia 13 began on September 10, 1962 at Ardmore Studios in Bray, Ireland, under the working title \"Dementia\". During filming, Coppola kept Corman updated on the status of the production in letters that promised much sex and violence would appear in the film, \"enough to make people sick\". Coppola was left entirely on his own while directing the film, without interference of any kind from Corman. When the completed film was shown to him, Corman stormed out of the screening room and demanded that several changes be made, changes that Coppola did not agree with. According to Coppola, Corman \"insisted on dubbing the picture the way he wanted it, adding voiceovers to simplify some of the scenes. Worse, he wanted extra violence added, another axe murder at least...\" Jack Hill was later hired by Corman to shoot some brief sequences featuring actor Karl Schanzer as a comical poacher, who is beheaded by the murderer. Corman also complained the film was too short and insisted that it be padded out with at least another five minutes of footage. Gary Kurtz, one of Corman's assistants at the time, recalled, \"So we shot this stupid prologue that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. It was some guy who was supposed to be a psychiatrist, sitting in his office and giving the audience a test to see if they were mentally fit to see the picture. The film was actually released with that prologue\". The prologue was directed by Monte Hellman. This cheap William Castle-style gimmick also included a \"D-13 Test\" handout that was given to theater patrons. It was devised by a supposed \"medical expert\" to weed out psychologically unfit people from viewing the film. The test consisted of such questions as, \"The most effective way of settling a dispute is with one quick stroke of an axe to your adversary's head?\" and \"Have you ever been hospitalized in a locked mental ward, sanitarium, rest home or other facility for the treatment of mental illness?\" \"Yes\" or \"No\" were the only possible answers. The rockabilly song that is played during the film's opening is \"He's Caught\" by Buddy and The Fads, written by Arthur \"Buddy\" Fowler. The song was recorded in 1959 in Hollywood, California for Accent Records."

T.\", dismissed the film, writing, \"Under the stolid direction of Francis Coppola, who also wrote the script, the picture stresses gore rather than atmosphere and all but buries a fairly workable plot\". Michael Weldon, in The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, noted it had \"[A] great trick ending, some truly shocking, gory axe murders, and lots of inventive photography\". Tom Raynes, in the Time Out Film Guide, said \"The location (an Irish castle) is used imaginatively; the Gothic atmosphere is suitably potent, and there's a wonderfully sharp cameo from Patrick Magee\". Danny Peary, in his Guide for the Film Fanatic, stated that \"despite the hopelessly confusing storyline ... the horror sequences are very exciting\". Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror opined, \"[O]ne senses the presence of a director right from the moody opening sequence ... A piece of high gothic melodrama ... The weakness of the film is in the script, which gives every indication of having been bundled together at the last minute\"... John Charles, in Video Watchdog, wrote that the film was \"a remarkably confident and proficient thriller. Several of its components hint at the creativity that was still to come from Coppola ... and the finished product is a testament to his ingenuity\". Kim Newman opined, \"Coppola ... works fast and creative in Dementia 13... making memorable, shocking little sequences out of the killings and the implied haunting, using his locations well and highlighting unexpected eeriness like a transistor radio burbling distorted pop music as it sinks into a lake, along with a just-murdered corpse\".

        "content": "Out 1, also referred to as Out 1: Noli Me Tangere, is a 1971 French film directed by Jacques Rivette. It is indebted to Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's La Com\u00e9die humaine, particularly the History of the Thirteen collection (1833\u201335). Known for its length of nearly 13 hours, the film is divided into eight parts around 90\u2013100 minutes each. The vast length of Out 1 allows Rivette, like Balzac, to construct multiple loosely connected characters with independent stories whose subplots weave amongst each other and continually uncover new characters with their own subplots. A shorter version of the film exists, and its Spectre subtitle was chosen for the name's ambiguous and various indistinct meanings, while the Noli me tangere (\"touch me not\") subtitle for the original version is clearly a reference to it being the full-length film as intended by Rivette. The film's experimentation with parallel subplots was influenced by Andr\u00e9 Cayatte's two-part Anatomy of a Marriage (1964), while the use of expansive screen time was first toyed with by Rivette in L'amour fou (1969). The parallel narrative structure has since been used in many other notable films, including Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's Dekalog and Lucas Belvaux's Trilogie, which includes  Un couple \u00e9patant, Cavale and Apr\u00e8s la vie, to name a few. Each part begins with a title in the form of \"from person to person\" (usually indicating the first and last characters seen in each episode), followed by a handful of black and white still photos recapitulating the scenes of the prior episode, then concluded by showing the final minute or so (in black and white) of the last episode before cutting into the new episode itself (which is entirely in color). Out 1 received 13 votes in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made, resulting in a final ranking of 127th."

The action of the film is rather like a serial which could continue through several episodes, so I gave it the number 'One'.\" From the starting image of a small group of actors lying down with their legs bent back toward themselves, Rivette again focuses his film on rehearsals for a play, a motif present in both L'amour fou and his debut feature Paris nous appartient (1960); in particular, he extends L'amour fous relentless reportage-style examination of the continual development of a play under rehearsal (in that case Jean Racine's Andromaque) and its effects on the director and his wife. In the case of Out 1, the two main anchors of the film are two different theater groups each rehearsing a different Aeschylus play (Seven Against Thebes and Prometheus Bound), and the film does not particularly privilege any character within these groups more than any other. External to these two groups, two outsiders peripheral to the theater are featured: Colin (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud), a young man who believes that there may be a real-life Thirteen group in operation, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique (Juliet Berto), a young swindler who happens to steal letters which may prove to be communication between members of the Thirteen. Other featured characters include Emilie (Bulle Ogier), who runs a local hangout under the name Pauline and whose husband, Igor, has been missing for six months. Michael Lonsdale plays Thomas, the director of the Prometheus Bound group, and there are cameos by directors Barbet Schroeder and \u00c9ric Rohmer, who plays a Balzac professor in a scene of both plot exposition and comic relief. The first few hours of the film alternate between documentary-style scenes observing the two troupes' rehearsals, Colin soliciting money from cafe patrons as a deaf man by playing irritating harmonica tunes, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique stealing money through a variety of deceptions. The plot gradually develops when Colin receives three mysterious messages in quick succession containing cryptic references to \"the Thirteen\" and to Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark. He quickly connects this to Balzac and begins a quixotic quest to uncover what the messages mean and who the Thirteen are. Sometime afterward, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique casually interrupts a businessman, Etienne, playing chess against himself at home; when she has the room to herself briefly, she attempts to locate a stash of money but instead steals a collection of letters. Sensing that they refer to some sort of secret society, she attempts to sell them to several of the correspondents in exchange for either money or more information on the group, but fails to gain any information. Only Emilie buys the letters, but only because they refer to her husband. The Seven Against Thebes production takes on a newcomer, Renaud, to assist in the production, but he quickly begins to take over more and more of the creative direction of the piece from Lili, who recedes into the background in disgust. Their fortunes appear high when Quentin wins a million francs at the races, but during the ensemble's celebration, Renaud steals all the cash; the production is cancelled and the members undertake a futile search for Renaud, spreading out all across Paris with a photo of him to try to discover his whereabouts. Thomas brings in old friend Sarah to help work through a creative block on Prometheus Bound, but she instead causes a rift within the group and the play is abandoned after another player leaves for unrelated reasons. It turns out that Thomas's block was largely due to his break-up with Lili after being with her personally and professionally for seven years. Thomas also is revealed to be a key member of the Thirteen, although the group never really was fully functional and had agreed to go into a period of dormancy two years earlier. Ironically, a chance encounter between Colin and Thomas motivates the latter to suggest reviving the Thirteen to Etienne, who is reluctant because the group never really did anything to begin with. One of the main correspondents in Etienne's letters, Pierre, is frequently discussed but never seen, and is described alternately as sinister and childlike.  After reading the contents of the letters sold to her by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique, Emilie prepares packages to be sent to major Parisian newspapers containing photocopies of these letters and purporting to disclose the existence of a scandal involving Pierre setting up Igor. Since Pierre and Igor are both members of the Thirteen, members of the group are forced to reconstitute to prevent the disclosure, and Thomas, Etienne and the ruthless lawyer Lucie de Graffe (Fran\u00e7oise Fabian) meet to discuss what to do. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique eventually meets up with the young man that her gay friend Honey Moon (Michel Berto) is infatuated with, who turns out to be Renaud; the two become married in a blood ritual, but she suspects that he may be a member of another secret society even more sinister than the Thirteen. After seeing him associate with a local gang, she draws a gun on him, but warns him \u2013 causing him to turn around and shoot instantly, killing her. Colin gives up on the idea of the Thirteen, while it is quietly suggested during a discussion between two other members of the Thirteen, Lucie de Graffe and the cynical professor named Warok (Jean Bouise), that perhaps Pierre was the author of the messages to Colin and has been the invisible hand behind much of the plot, because he misses the Thirteen and wants to either restore it or replace it with young blood like Colin. Several of the characters retreat in the end to Emilie's small seaside house in Normandy called \"the Obade\" (another Balzacian reference, see \"Ferragus\"), where she breaks down in front of Sarah, confessing her love for Colin (who had been courting her earlier) and Igor at the same time. Her dilemma is solved at the end, when she receives a call from Igor telling her to meet him in Paris. She and Lili set off for Paris. Thomas remains behind on the beach at the Obade with two of his actors and has a drunken hysterical episode there, when he pretends to collapse on the sand. His actors are worried and frantically try to revive him.  When he reveals his jest, they walk away in disgust and get in the car to go back to Paris.  Thomas is left alone on the beach, crying and laughing at the same time, stranded at the Obade and for the first time in the film, part of no group whatsoever.  The film then quickly cuts to a completely unrelated shot of Marie, an actress from the Thebes group who still seems to be searching for the missing Renaud and the money he stole.  A golden statute of a Greek goddess, perhaps Athena, towers above her.  The shot is held for a second before fading out. CharactersAchille (Sylvain Corthay): Actor in Prometheus Bound troupe.

        "title": "Out 1_Style",
        "content": "After working with both 35mm film and 16mm film in L'amour fou, Rivette was comfortable enough with the 16mm format to work with it on Out 1, the massive length of which precluded any serious attempt to shoot the whole film on expensive 35mm. Despite the immense length of the final product, the film was shot under a tight shooting schedule of only six weeks. Rivette's preference for the long take was the main reason why such a schedule could be maintained. Because he wanted the performances to have a level of realism, some takes include lines \"fluffed\" by actors, or other common \"mistakes\" such as camera and boom microphone shadows, as well as unwitting extras looking at the camera in exterior shots (including a well-known scene where two young boys doggedly follow Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud along the street during an extended monologue). Rivette has said that the intimacy of the performances in the face of such mistakes was precisely why he kept those takes in the film. Many of the rehearsal scenes, particularly those of the Prometheus Bound group, are composed almost entirely of long shots, although the film also contains more conventional editing elsewhere. The slow pacing of the film as a whole is also loosely based on Balzac, and its first few hours are constructed more like a prologue, where the editing is slower and the characters are no more than introduced. It is not until three or four hours into the film that characters' motives and the story lines begin to reveal themselves. The work also includes stylistically adventurous techniques, including the shooting of long shots through mirrors (again developing from work in L'amour fou), short cuts to black to punctuate otherwise continuous scenes, short cutaways to unrelated or seemingly meaningless shots, non-diegetic sound blocking out crucial parts of the dialogue, and even a conversation in which selected lines are re-edited so that they appear to be spoken backward. However, these experiments form a fairly small part of the work as a whole, which is generally conventional in style (aside from the length of takes and of the work as a whole)."

        "content": "First shown as a work in progress at the Maison de la Culture in Le Havre, the film was re-edited down to a four-hour \"short\" version called Out 1: Spectre, which is more accessible and available (although not widely). Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, called this version \"a mind-blowing experience, but one which, instead of taking one 'out of this world' as the expression has it, took one right smack into the world. Or into a world which one only dimly realised was there \u2013 always right there beneath the everyday world\u00a0... the cinema will never be the same again, and nor will I.\" Few people have seen the full-length version, though it is championed by Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, who compares it to Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, and has included both Out 1: Noli Me Tangere and Out 1: Spectre in the 100 films singled out from his 1000 favourite films, published in his anthology Essential Cinema. Out 1: Noli Me Tangere was restored in Germany in 1990 and was shown again at the Rotterdam and Berlin Film Festivals shortly thereafter. It disappeared again into obscurity until 2004, when both Noli Me Tangere and its shorter version Out 1: Spectre featured in the programme on 1\u201321 June, in the complete retrospective Jacques Rivette Viaggio in Italia di un metteur en sc\u00e8ne organized by Deep A.C. and curated by Goffredo De Pascale in Rome at the Sala Trevi Centro Sperimentale and in Naples at Le Grenoble. Then, only in the April/May 2006 Rivette retrospective at London's National Film Theatre, with the shorter film also screening twice across two subsequent nights at Anthology Film Archives in New York City on the same April weekend as the NFT projection of the long work. The North American premiere of Noli Me Tangere took place on 23 and 24 September 2006 in Vancouver's Vancouver International Film Centre organized by Vancouver International Film Festival programmer and Cinema Scope editor Mark Peranson, attended by around twenty people (22 at Peranson's initial count, before episode 1, though others came and went). A subsequent screening took place as a part of the 2006 festival over 30 September and 1 October, introduced by Jonathan Rosenbaum. The subtitled Out 1: Noli Me Tangere provides a particular challenge for exhibitors, as the subtitles are not burned onto the print of the film itself, as is usual with most foreign films shown in North America. Rather, the subtitles for Out 1, provided by the British Film Institute, are projected from a computer in a separate stream (in the Vancouver screening, just below the film itself); this then has to be synchronized with the film itself, almost certainly by someone unfamiliar with the entire Out 1. Few theatres can meet this technical challenge, especially over a thirteen-hour span. In addition, the film was shot on 16mm at a nonstandard 25 frames per second, a speed few current projectors are equipped to handle. In the Vancouver screening, the film was projected at 24fps, adding about half an hour to the film as a whole. Screenings of both the long and short works took place in late November and December 2006, during an extensive retrospective of Rivette's work which ran at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, New York City. The screening of the longer version was sold out for the 9 and 10 December 2006 screening, so the Museum held an encore performance of the film on 3 and 4 March in 2007 (which came close to selling out).  It was shown on both occasions over 2 days.  In interviews, Rivette has explicitly stated that the work is meant to be seen theatrically \"on the big screen\", and apparently dislikes it being watched on television. Ironically, the preparation of the film in eight episodes was in large part due to the \"naive hope\", according to Rivette, of it originally being distributed like that on French television, although his disdain for that mode of exhibition only arose after the film's completion. Out 1 was restored by Carlotta Films in 2015 and made its U.S. theatrical premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on 4 November 2015.  This version has now been released on DVD and Blu-ray in the U.S., while Arrow Films have released it on both formats in the UK. The restored Out 1 was screened in London, England over two days at the Prince Charles Cinema, Leicester Place on 28 and 29 November 2015. The screening was presented by the Badlands Collective and A Nos Amours."

He stages it to look as if she was accidentally asphyxiated while drunkenly trying to light a gas heater. To his chagrin, he discovers that she actually intended to leave him all her money; instead, he only inherits the mansion from a prior will, while her fortune is left in trust to her only relative, her sister Dora. Edward will receive the money if Dora dies. An inquest rules it an accident, but Phillip makes it clear he suspects Edward. When Edward asks where Dora lives, Phillip tells him she is too far away, in Jamaica. Edward manages to marry lower-class but well-off widow Freda Jeffries (Margaret Lockwood), who is closer to her husband's age, and much less trusting than her predecessor, keeping tight control over her fortune. As the death of a second spouse so soon after the first would be highly suspicious, he is powerless to do anything. Edward becomes acquainted with Charlotte Young (Kay Walsh), who is looking for a house to purchase for an equestrian school. As Edward was an estate agent before he married Monica, he shows her around, making Freda jealous. Edward lures Charlotte to his mansion late one night while Freda and the servant are out. He reveals he knows that Charlotte is actually Dora. Then he brazenly admits killing her sister before trying to make her leave. Suspicious, she remains where she is. Eventually, however, Freda returns home and escorts Charlotte to the door. After she drives away, Edward tells Freda that he killed Monica, secure in the knowledge that a wife cannot be compelled to testify against her husband, and that he expects to inherit Charlotte's money shortly, as he has tampered with the brakes on her car. He is shocked when Phillip enters the room, having heard his confession, followed by his intended victim. She had returned to the house after meeting the lawyer at the estate's gate. Edward flees in his car, but the entrance is blocked by Charlotte's and Phillip's automobiles. With Phillip in pursuit, Edward switches to another vehicle, only to realise too late that he has taken Charlotte's. He loses control and drives off a cliff."

Soon an angry mob forms, led by the violent Luke Benson, in order to kill the \"monsters\". Superman stops Benson and the mob and saves one of the creatures after it has been shot. He takes it to the hospital. The second creature returns to the well head and disappears down its shaft. A doctor announces that the injured creature will die unless he has surgery to remove the bullet. When a nurse refuses to do so out of fear, Clark volunteers to assist. Benson's mob arrives at the hospital demanding that the creature be turned over to them. Superman stands guard outside the hospital. Lois stands at his side, but a shot is fired from the mob, narrowly missing her. Superman sends her inside and relieves the mob of their rifles and pistols. Three more Mole Men emerge from the drill shaft, this time bearing a strange weapon. They make their way to the hospital. Benson and his mob see the creatures, and Benson goes after them alone. The creatures fire their laser-like weapon at him. Superman jumps in front of the pulsating ray, saving Benson's life, which Superman says \"is more than you deserve!\". Superman fetches the wounded creature from the hospital and carries him as his companions return to the well head. Soon after, from deep underground, the Mole Men destroy the drill shaft, making certain that no one can come up or go down it ever again. Lois observes, \"It's almost as if they were saying, 'You live your lives ... and we'll live ours'\"."

        "content": "Superman and the Mole Men is the first theatrical feature film based on any DC Comics character. Previously, two live-action, multiple chapter movie serials made by Columbia Pictures Inc., based on the Superman comics feature and radio program, featuring Kirk Alyn as Superman and Noel Neill as Lois Lane, had been shown in weekly installments in movie theaters. Two additional serials based on DC's Batman, the first featuring Lewis Wilson as Batman and Douglas Croft as Robin/Dick Grayson, and the second featuring Robert Lowery as Batman and Johnny Duncan as Robin/Dick Grayson, were also made by Columbia (1943 and 1949). The original screenplay was by \"Richard Fielding\", a pseudonym for Robert Maxwell and Whitney Ellsworth. Superman and the Mole Men was filmed in a little more than 12 days starting on July 10, 1951 at RKO-Pathe Studios.  The feature runs just 58 minutes and originally served as a trial balloon release for the syndicated Adventures of Superman TV series, for which it became the only two-part episode, \"The Unknown People\". Some elements of the original film were trimmed when converted for television, including some portions of a lengthy chase scene and all references to \"Mole Men\". The theme music used for the film had a generic \"science fiction sound\", with nothing suggesting a specific Superman theme. The title cards were similarly generic, with low-grade animation of comets sailing by Saturn-like ringed planets. The original film score by Darrell Calker was removed when Superman and the Mole Men was re-cut into the two-part Superman TV episode and replaced with the \"canned\" production library music used in the first season of the series. The laser-like weapon of the Mole Men, which they retrieve from their subterranean home in order to defend themselves and rescue their injured comrade, was a prop made by adding metal shoulder braces to one end of an Electrolux vacuum cleaner body; for the ray's \"gun barrel\" a standard metal funnel was attached to the other. The image of actors Reeves and Coates on the theatrical release poster is a painting derived by reversing (\"flopping\") a publicity photograph image of the two actors, with Superman's \"S shield\" emblem then reversed in order for it to read correctly."

The original titles were Die 1000 Augen des Dr. Mabuse (German), Il diabolico Dr. Mabuse (Italian) and Le diabolique docteur Mabuse (French). It was the last film directed by Fritz Lang, who had returned from the U.S. to Germany to make what would turn out to be a total of three films for producer Artur Brauner: The Tiger of Eschnapur, The Indian Tomb and The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse. The film made use of the character Doctor Mabuse invented by Norbert Jacques, whom Lang had used in two previous films back in 1922 (Dr. Mabuse der Spieler, released in two parts) and 1933 (Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse). The script of this movie, written by Fritz Lang and Heinz Oskar Wuttig, was based on the Esperanto novel Mr. Tot Buys A Thousand Eyes by the Polish author Jan Fethke. It brought the Mabuse character from his previous pre-war appearances into contemporary times (the 1960s) and combined elements of the German Edgar Wallace film series, spy fiction and Big Brother surveillance with the nihilism of the Mabuse world. Filming took place 5 May to 28 June 1960 at the Spandau Studios in Berlin. The film premiered on 14 September 1960 at the Gloria-Palast in Stuttgart (Germany) and on 28 June 1961 in Paris (French version)."

The children have extraordinary powers of intellect and are all able to complete a difficult brick puzzle in exactly the same amount of time. British psychologist Tom Lewellin (Ian Hendry) and geneticist David Neville (Alan Badel) are interested in Paul, a London boy whose mother Diana (Sheila Allen) clearly hates the child and insists she was never touched by a man. This is initially dismissed as hysteria and it is implied she has 'loose' morals. But after a while, the two men realize that all six children were born without fathers and are also capable of telepathy. The children, from various countries \u2013 China, India, Nigeria, the Soviet Union, the United States of America and the UK \u2013 are brought to London for a collective study into their advanced intelligence. However the children escape from their embassies and gather at an abandoned church in Southwark, London. They intermittently take mental control of Paul's aunt (Ferris) to help them survive in the derelict church. Meanwhile, the military debates whether or not to destroy them. The children have demonstrated the capacity for telekinesis and construct a complex machine which uses sonic waves as a defensive weapon, which kills several government officials and soldiers. But the military realizes that they only fight back when attacked. After psychologist Tom Lewellin makes a passionate plea asking the group to return to their respective embassies, the children obey and murder embassy and military officials before returning to the church. Lewellin urges the government to give the children leeway. However his team of scientists observe the difference between an ordinary human blood cell and the cells of one of the children, thereby implying the children to be non-human, and destined to become a threat to the human race. When authorities try to take control of the children, they are forced to protect themselves. As the situation escalates into a final showdown between the military and the children, one of the scientists postulates that the judgment of the children being alien was incorrect, and that the children's cells are in fact human, advanced by a million years. Meanwhile, the children also imply they have arrived at the decision their presence is incompatible with that of basic humans, and therefore they intend to lower their defences and sacrifice themselves. The military commander recognizes a mistake has been made, and aborts the attack command. However, the command is triggered accidentally by a screwdriver \u2013 one of the simplest of basic man's machines. The church is destroyed, and the children are killed."

After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn).  Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fianc\u00e9e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom.  Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition. This prevents Mrs. Morgan from learning who Francey is, but she accidentally finds out from Francey herself during a conversation in Francey's apartment. Mrs. Morgan accepts the news happily, and admits to Francey that she pretends to have heart trouble any time her husband gets into an argument, but Mr. Morgan demands that Francey leave Peter, threatening to fire him if she doesn't.  Francey agrees to leave, but the incident releases thirty years of marital frustration in Mrs. Morgan, who also decides to leave her husband. Francey tells Peter she is leaving him.  He vows that he can change his father's mind before her train departs. Peter's solution is to threaten the family with disgrace by getting drunk and otherwise misbehaving until his father relents, even if it costs him his job. Peter passes out before he can reach the train, which departs with both Francey and Mrs. Morgan aboard, but Mr. Morgan, having finally yielded to the combined pressure of his son and wife, stops the train by driving ahead of it with Peter and parking the car on the track. Both marriages are saved, and Peter and Francey finally have their honeymoon on the train."

The Japanese secret police visit the Chronicle\u2019s headquarters, interrogating editor Nick Condon (James Cagney) about the source, which he refuses to disclose. Intrigued at the heavy-handed response to the rumor, Condon assigns Ollie Miller (Wallace Ford), a Chronicle reporter, to further research the plan. Some time later, Ollie and his wife Edith (Rosemary DeCamp) make plans to leave Japan on a ship. Believing he discovered the details of the plan, the secret police arrange to have him killed. When Condon goes to his cabin on the ship, he finds Edith strangled, and narrowly misses another woman exiting the cabin; he glimpses a ruby ring on her hand. Later that night, Ollie is shot outside Condon\u2019s house. Before he dies, he gives to Condon a copy of the Tanaka Memorial plan. As the secret police, led by Captain Oshima (John Halloran), arrive, Condon hides the document behind a portrait of Emperor Hirohito. Revering the portrait, Oshima does not search it, but ransacks the rest of his house and subdues him when he resists. Condon wakes the next morning in a prison cell. The Japanese police have fabricated a story about him having a drunken party the previous night and fixed his house to hide the damage, and the document is missing. Condon\u2019s search for it is interrupted by a courier inviting him to Baron Tanaka\u2019s home. At Tanaka\u2019s home, the Baron subtly threatens Condon to return the document, and Condon realizes that Tanaka does not have it and someone else took it. Suspecting that the other party consists of Japanese anti-war liberals interested in sneaking the document out of the country, Condon publicly announces his intention to return to the United States. That evening, he meets Iris Hilliard (Sylvia Sidney), a half-Chinese woman. Seeing a ring on her finger, he suspects she was the woman he saw fleeing Edith\u2019s cabin, but the two are attracted to one another. Unbeknownst to him, Iris is a spy for Baron Tanaka, tasked with retrieving the plan. Disgruntled at being passed over as Condon\u2019s replacement as editor, Cassell (Rhys Williams), an unscrupulous reporter, inadvertently reveals that Tanaka ordered him to introduce Iris to Condon. Armed with this knowledge, Condon confronts Iris, who confesses that, while she works for Tanaka, she is loyal to Japan\u2019s liberal faction and, having no fear of the Emperor\u2019s portrait, she herself took the Tanaka Memorial from his house. Condon takes the document and leaves. Eavesdropping on their conversation, the secret police imprison Iris, but she escapes. Disgraced by his failure, Tanaka commits seppuku. Before Condon leaves for the United States, Iris contacts him, asking to meet on a fishing dock. Evading the secret police tailing him, Condon meets her on the dock. She is accompanied by Prince Tatsugi (Frank Puglia), a liberal within the Japanese government. Aware that the government will claim the document is a forgery, Tatsu places his seal on it, legitimizing it. The police arrive and kill Tatsugi; Condon gives the document to Iris, who flees in a fishing boat, and stays behind to delay the policemen. Defeating Captain Oshima at judo and evading the secret police, Condon arrives outside the embassy. He is shot and incapacitated, but when the Japanese search him, they are unable to find the document. As an American diplomat arrives to help Condon, the head of the secret police asks him to forgive his enemy. As he enters the embassy, Condon replies, \u201cSure, forgive your enemies \u2013 but first, get even!\u201d"

        "content": "The film is set in Arnhem Land, in a time separate of Western influence, and tells the story of a group of ten men in a traditional hunting context. The leader of the group, Minygululu, tells the young Dayindi (Jamie Gulpilil) a story about another young man even further back in time who, like Dayindi, coveted his elder brother's youngest wife. The sequences featuring Dayindi and the hunt are in black and white, while shots set in distant past are in colour. All protagonists speak in indigenous languages of the Yol\u014bu Matha language group, with subtitles. The film is narrated in English by David Gulpilil, although versions of the film without narration, and featuring narration in Yol\u014bu Matha, are also available. Minygululu tells a story of the great warrior Ridjimiraril, who suspects a visiting stranger of kidnapping his second wife. In a case of mistaken identity, Ridjimiraril kills a member of a neighbouring tribe. To prevent all-out war, tribal laws dictate that the offending tribe allow the offender to be speared from a distance by individuals of the tribe of the slain man. The offender is allowed to be accompanied by a companion, and in this instance he takes his younger brother, Yeeralparil. Whenever one of the two is hit, the spear-throwers will stop, and justice will have been served. Ridjimiraril is hit and mortally wounded but survives long enough to return to his camp, where he is tended to by his eldest wife. When he knows he is dying he performs a ritual dance and once dead his hair is cut and his body is painted to enable the ancestral spirits to guide him to the next world. The elder brother's kidnapped second wife then finds her way back to the camp. She reveals that she had been kidnapped by a different tribe, much farther away and had taken this long to return. She mourns her lost husband, who had attacked the wrong tribe, though now she and the elder wife take his younger brother as their new husband. The younger brother, who was only interested in the youngest of the three wives, now has to care for all of them, and satisfying their many demands is clearly going to be much more than he wished. Minygululu tells this story in the hope that Dayindi learns of the added responsibilities of a husband and elder statesman in the tribe, and in the end we see Dayindi withdrawing from his pursuit of Minygululu's young wife."

        "content": "Ten Canoes won the Un Certain Regard Special Jury Prize at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. De Heer rejected claims he is a white director making an Indigenous story: \"People talk about, what is a white director doing making an Indigenous story? They're telling the story, largely, and I'm the mechanism by which they can.\" Ten Canoes was screened at the Sydney Film Festival in June 2006 and was released nationally on 29 June 2006. In October 2006 Ten Canoes was chosen as Australia's official entry into the Best Foreign Language Film category for the 2007 Academy Awards, thus becoming the third Australian film to be considered for the award (following Floating Life in 1996 and La Spagnola in 2001). Ten Canoes was nominated for seven Australian Film Institute (AFI) awards, of which it won six. The movie won the awards for Best Picture (Julie Ryan, Rolf de Heer producers), Best Director (Rolf de Heer and Peter Djigirr), Best Screenplay - Original (Rolf de Heer), Best Cinematography (Ian Jones), Best Editing (Tania Nehme), and Best Sound (James Currie, Tom Heuzenroeder, Michael Bakaloff, and Rory McGregor). It was also nominated for Best Production Design (Beverly Freeman). It won three awards from the Film Critics Circle of Australia: Best Film, Best Editing (Tania Nehme), and Best Cinematography (Ian Jones). (The latter award was a tie with David Williamson's work on Jindabyne.) The film was also nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. The Balanda and the Bark Canoes, a documentary that aired on Australian network SBS and which detailed de Heer's experiences making the film, won Best Australian Short Documentary for de Heer, Tania Nehme, and Molly Reynolds. The documentary explores the interplay between cultures in a film project immersing a balanda (white man) into the intricacies of kinship systems impacting the casting of the film as well as giving some voice to the inner conflicts of indigenous peoples today caught between the world of their heritage and that of modern life. This aspect has been explored by academic D. Bruno Starrs with regard to the \"authentic Aboriginal voice\". At the end of 2006, the film stood as one of the highest grossing Australian films of that year. By October it had made just over $3,000,000 from a budget of $2,200,000. The film ranked #72 in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010."

Wallis and Robert Fellows, directed by Raoul Walsh, that stars Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. The film's storyline offers a highly fictionalized account of the life of Gen. George Armstrong Custer, from the time he enters West Point military academy through the American Civil War and finally to his death at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Custer is portrayed as a fun-loving, dashing figure who chooses honor and glory over money and corruption. The battle against Chief Crazy Horse (played by Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians and a corporation that wants the land Custer promised to the Native Americans. The film was one of the top-grossing films of 1941. They Died with Their Boots On was the eighth and final film collaboration between Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. The supporting cast features Arthur Kennedy, Sydney Greenstreet as Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott, Anthony Quinn as Crazy Horse, John Litel as Gen. Phillip Sheridan, Regis Toomey as Fitzhugh Lee, Joseph Crehan as President Ulysses S. Grant, and Hattie McDaniel."

        "content": "George Armstrong Custer (Flynn) arrives at West Point in an outlandish uniform he had designed himself, which makes him appear to be a visiting foreign general. Following the misunderstanding, he signs as a cadet and begins to stack up demerits for pranks and a general disregard for rules while at the Point. When the Civil War breaks out, Custer is at the bottom of his class. Custer is walking a silent punishment tour when he is approached by Libbie Bacon who asks him for directions. Shortly thereafter, his punishment ends, and he runs after her, explaining his rude silence, and asking if he may come to call that evening. Later, Custer and other members of his class are graduated early and ordered to report immediately to Washington, D.C. for assignment. As a result, Custer misses his appointment with Libbie. Custer makes the acquaintance of Gen. Winfield Scott (Sydney Greenstreet), who aids him in getting placed with the 2nd U.S. Cavalry. He becomes a war hero after disregarding a superior's orders during a crucial battle, successfully defending a bridge for the Union infantry. Awarded a medal, he gets leave to return home to Monroe, Michigan. He meets Libbie at her home, but her father, who has been the butt of Custer's joke earlier that day, orders him to leave. Custer returns to his regiment. Due to a miscommunication from the Department of War, he is promoted by mistake to the rank of Brigadier General and takes command of the Michigan Brigade at the Battle of Gettysburg. He wins the day, and many victories follow thereafter. Upon returning home to Monroe as a Union war hero, Custer marries Libbie in a lavish ceremony with a full honor guard, but soon grows bored with civilian life and begins drinking too much. Libbie visits Custer's old friend Gen. Scott and begs him to assign Custer to a regiment again. He agrees, and Custer is given a Lt. Colonel's commission out west in the Dakota Territory. When Custer and Libbie arrive at Fort Lincoln, Custer finds the soldiers a drunken, rowdy, and undisciplined lot in need of firm leadership. His old West Point enemy, Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy), who has a government license to run the fort's trading post and saloon, is providing Winchester repeating rifles to the local Native Americans. Furious, Custer stops the rifle sales and permanently closes the saloon. He then instills proper military discipline in his men and introduces a regimental song, \"Garryowen\", both of which quickly bring fame to the U.S. 7th Cavalry under Custer's command. The 7th has many engagements with Lakota tribal chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), who eventually offers peace, wanting a treaty that will protect the sacred Black Hills; Custer and Washington sign the treaty, but soon it is bankrupting Sharp's trading posts. Sharp and several others spread a rumor that large gold deposits have been discovered in the Black Hills. American settlers stream into the area in violation of the treaty, but Custer and his troops permit no infractions. To embarrass Custer, Sharp passes out free bottles of liquor to Custer's men hours before they drunkenly pass in revue, in complete disarray, before Commissioner Taipe, a politician in league with Sharp. Custer punches both Sharp and the commissioner in anger, and he is quickly relieved of his command. On the way to Washington for his Court martial Custer hears from Libbie about attempts to start the gold rush in the Black Hills and realizes from the timing that it has been fabricated, a plan that would bring much business and large profits to a select group. Outraged, Custer takes the information to the U.S. Congress, but they only ridicule him, refusing to hear his evidence. When news arrives that the presence of gold miners has led to open conflict between the Lakota and U.S. troops, Custer appeals in person to President Ulysses S. Grant, one soldier to another, who restores him to command. Upon returning to Fort Lincoln, Custer comes to realize that his band of cavalry are the only chance at rescuing a force of U.S. infantry from the Lakota. He also knows full well that he and his men have little chance of survival against their force. Custer has a final, emotion-filled goodbye with Libbie, after which he leads his cavalry into battle. An even greater number of Native American tribes, numbering 6000, have come together and joined the conflict. Quickly surrounded, Custer and his meager forces are killed. A few corrupt politicians have now goaded the western tribes into war for personal profit, threatening the survival of all white settlers in the Dakota Territories. Custer and his men have given their lives at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in order to slow the Native American advance. A letter left behind by Custer with Libbie, now considered his dying declaration, names the culprits and absolves the Native Americans of all responsibility; Custer wins his final campaign."

Three men were killed during the filming. One fell from a horse and broke his neck. Another stuntman had a heart attack. The third, actor Jack Budlong, insisted on using a real saber to lead a cavalry charge under artillery fire. When an explosive charge sent him flying off his horse, he landed on his sword, impaling himself. In September 1941, during filming, Flynn collapsed from exhaustion. The film reunited Gone With The Wind (1939) cast members Olivia de Havilland and Hattie McDaniel. De Havilland appeared in this film while simultaneously making The Male Animal (1942) starring Henry Fonda, putting the actress under enormous pressure from a heavy workload."

        "content": "While the rest of the film was shot in locations in southern California, the filmmakers had hoped to capture this climactic sequence near the actual location of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Owing to scheduling and budget constraints, however, the finale of the film was relegated to a rural area outside Los Angeles. The film shows Custer leading his troops in a saber charge, in the course of which they are surrounded and Custer, being the last man alive, is killed. In reality, the men had boxed their sabers and sent them to the rear before the battle; site evidence, along with some Native American accounts, indicates that Custer may have been among the first to die. He is also shown during the battle with his trademark long hair when, in reality, he had cut it short just prior to the Little Bighorn campaign. Several members of Custers family (his brothers Thomas and Boston, his brother-in-law James Calhoun and nephew Henry Reed) also died in the battle, but aren't depicted in the drama. Crazy Horse, played by Anthony Quinn, is the only individualized Native American appearing in scenes and represents the \"Red Man\", whose lifestyle is rapidly coming to an end. Quinn is one of the few actors of indigenous American descent in the film. Only 16 of the extras used were Sioux. The rest of the Native American warriors were mostly portrayed by Filipino extras."

Custer knew the song while he was at West Point, where he is said to have performed it in a talent show. In the film, however, Custer hears the song for the first time being played on a piano by former English soldier, now a U.S. Army officer, Lt. \"Queen's Own\" Butler. This connection is apocryphal. It is actually a traditional Irish drinking song, much beloved by the cavalry for its galloping rhythm. Warner Brothers recycled some of the film's music, and variations of it can be heard in Silver River and Rocky Mountain, both starring Errol Flynn, and The Searchers starring John Wayne."

It was all shot in 12 days, and completed in about four weeks, at a cost of just \u00a330,000, a notable achievement in those times. Within days of its release, copies had been shipped to 60 countries. Although it is difficult to determine its actual impact on the public, The Lion Has Wings was considered a significant factor in persuading the British government to allow the film industry to continue to work, and the film was regarded as a model of how filmmakers could be an asset to the war effort. Like many propaganda films, The Lion Has Wings does not tell the whole truth, but there are many elements of truth in it. The use of radar as a defensive measure was not mentioned, since it was still a secret. However, the bombing raids were shown first being reported by spies then confirmed by the Observer Corps, a tactic that was actually occurring as part of Britain's defensive measures. The film also shows Luftwaffe bombers trying to attack London, but being completely turned back by barrage balloons, which in reality had little effect on the raids. The use of RAF fighters intercepting and attacking enemy bombers at night was not feasible at that point. These errors or misinterpretations added to other lofty claims that Britain had sufficient aircraft in production and was quite ready to fight to counter the overwhelming numbers of Luftwaffe raiders; all purposeful exaggerations were intended to bolster morale. Public reaction was generally reserved, as British audiences saw The Lion Has Wings as patently simplistic and patronising; yet, it was a commercial success. Powell later derided the project as 'an outrageous piece of propaganda, full of half-truths and half-lies, with some stagey episodes which were rather embarrassing and with actual facts which were highly distorted...' Author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, William Shirer recounts in his Berlin Diary on 10 June 1940 that he thought the film 'very bad, supercilious, and silly'. He was shown the film at the German Propaganda ministry while working as a CBS Radio news reporter."

The first feature Keaton wrote, directed, produced, and starred in (unlike The Saphead [1920], in which he only acted), Keaton structured the film like three inter-cut short films. This was a kind of insurance for the studio. While Keaton was a proven success in the short film medium, he had yet to prove himself as a feature-length star. Had the project flopped, the film would have been broken into three short films, each covering one of the ages. The structure also worked as a parody of D. W. Griffith's 1916 film Intolerance."

In all three plots, characters played by the small and slight Buster Keaton and handsome bruiser Wallace Beery compete for the attention of the same woman, played by Margaret Leahy. Each plot follows similar \"arcs\" in the story line in which Keaton's character works for his beloved's attention and eventually wins her over. In the Stone Age, Keaton competes with the bigger, brutish Beery for a cavewoman, Leahy. After observing another caveman drag away a woman by the hair in order to \"claim\" her, Keaton tries to become more assertive, but is continuously pushed back and bullied by Beery. An attempt to make Leahy jealous by flirting with another woman ends in failure. Nevertheless, Keaton grows closer to Leahy, and Beery challenges him to a fight at sunrise. Keaton wins thanks to hiding a rock in his club, but is caught and tied to the tail of an elephant to be dragged around the dirt as punishment. Upon his return, he finds Leahy about to be claimed by Beery and attempts to make off with her. Beery catches him and the two battle by tossing boulders at each other from afar, with Keaton and Leahy on a cliff together. When Beery climbs up to reclaim Leahy, Keaton dispatches Beery's cronies and finally defeats him. He drags a smitten Leahy off by the hair. In the epilogue, they go off for a walk with their huge family of children following them. In the Ancient Rome segment, Keaton attempts to attract the attention of the wealthy Leahy, but is continually pushed back by Beery. Beery challenges him to a chariot race after a hard snow \u2014 Keaton wins by using sled dogs instead of horses. In revenge, Beery forces him into the lion pit belonging to Leahy's family. Keaton survives by befriending the lion and manicuring its claws. Keaton is rescued by Leahy's parents while Beery kidnaps Leahy. Keaton rescues her and tries to seduce her in her palanquin, which takes off without them. In the epilogue, they also go out for a walk with many children in tow. In \"modern times\", Keaton is a poor man yearning for Leahy, who has rich parents. Leahy's mother, unimpressed with Keaton's bank account but interested in Beery's, decides on Beery as a match for her daughter. Keaton accidentally gets drunk at a restaurant where Beery and Leahy are dining, and Beery tricks the male half of another couple into punching Keaton, who stumbles home drunk. Later, Keaton impresses Leahy by playing a football game, whereas Beery is only a coach; Beery decides to play opposite Keaton. Keaton is overwhelmed by the bigger Beery, but ends up winning the game with an impressive touchdown. An irritated Beery frames Keaton for possession of alcohol and gets him arrested, simultaneously showing him a wedding announcement between him and Leahy \u2014 Keaton will be unable to stop the wedding while in jail. While shadowed by a guard, Keaton finds a criminal file showing that Beery has been charged with bigamy and forgery. He attempts to call Leahy to warn her. He accidentally escapes when the phone booth he is using is taken out for replacement. Keaton evades the police chasing him and makes it to the church in time to drag Leahy away from the wedding and into a cab. After showing her Beery's criminal file, he takes Leahy home and prepares to leave, but she kisses him. He declares to the cab driver that they are going back to the church. In the epilogue, they also go out for a walk \u2014 this time with their dog instead of children."

        "content": "A mysterious old woman named Malla (Estelle Hemsley) who claims to have been brought to America 140 years ago as a slave approaches endocrinologist Dr. Paul Talbot (Terry) and promises to reveal to him the secret of eternal youth if he will fund her final trip back to Africa, so that she can be beautiful and young for one last night before she dies. Paul is unhappily married to the alcoholic June (Gray), who is 10 years his elder. Paul prefers younger women. \"Old women,\" he says, \"give me the creeps.\" They follow Malla to Africa and witness a secret ceremony of the Nando tribe that utilizes orchid pollen and a sacrificial male's pineal gland secretions. The secretions, extracted from the back of the neck via a special ring and mixed with the pollen, temporarily transform Malla into a young, beautiful woman (Kim Hamilton). After discovering that her conniving husband only brought her along as \"a guinea pig who could talk,\" June takes revenge, choosing him to be sacrificed so that she can use his pineal gland extract to become young again herself, though Malla warns her that the transformation will not last long. She steals the ring and pollen, kills her jungle guide (John van Dreelen) and returns to the United States. Masquerading as her own niece, Terry Hart, she keeps herself young by picking up men and killing them for their pineal extract. But each time the potion wears off, she is older than she was before. As Terry, June quickly becomes enamored of her lawyer Neil Foster (Williams), a man half her actual age. She kills his jealous fianc\u00e9e Sally Howards (Talbott), draining her pineal gland and eliminating Sally as competition. When the police come to investigate the murders that June has committed, she uses Sally's pineal gland extract but finds that it does not work because it is from a woman. Before the police can arrest her, she throws herself out her bedroom window, crashes to the ground and dies. When they see her body, it is much older and much more shriveled than ever."

        "content": "The film's working title was The Leech. According to contemporary reviews, the filmmakers mixed stock footage of African wildlife and tribal dances with scenes shot in the studio. Film critic and psychometrist Bryan Senn notes that much of the stock footage was \"taken from the jungle adventure Tanganyika (1954)\". Production of the film ended in March 1959. It had its official premiere in Los Angeles on 15 June 1960. The pairing of The Brides of Dracula and The Leech Woman was one of several examples of Universal-International releasing UK horror films with inexpensive, quickly-produced second films to fill double bills in the US. However, as science fiction film historian Bill Warren points out, The Brides of Dracula was a \"lively, colorful Hammer film, one of their best\", which made the black-and-white The Leech Woman \"look drab and old-fashioned\". The film has the \"heavy, 'indoorsy' atmosphere of an early '60s TV show\" and its \"extended takes create the stagy feeling associated with live TV\". In the UK, The Leech Woman was given an X-certificate by the British Board of Film Censors, following their viewing of the film on 14 March 1960. The X-certificate limited the exhibition of the film to persons over age 16. Quoting an unpublished interview with Gray given to film historian Tom Weaver, Senn writes that although the film was one of her most difficult, because of her character's rapid age changes, \"That picture was 10 days of sheer joy (...) I got to 'camp' all over the place; it was kind of flamboyant and, really, excrutiatingly funny\". For her part, Talbott told Weaver in a published interview her reason for taking a role in the film: \"I made that picture because I wanted to buy a horse for my son\", she said, \"and The Leech Woman got him a really nice horse and saddle\"! Talbott also discussed the scene where she held Gray at gunpoint and the script called for Gray to wrestle the gun away from her. Before the scene was filmed, Gray mentioned to Talbott that she was pretty strong and wouldn't have any problem taking the gun away.  Talbott was taken aback by the comment and approached the scene with the intent of overpowering her blonde co-star even though the script called for Gray to win the fight. Talbott admitted in the interview that Gray was right, she was much stronger than Talbott and easily overpowered her. In a separate interview, screenwriter David Duncan told Weaver that the story did not originate with him, instead saying that \"I think they gave me a screenplay that had been written by somebody named Bruce Pivar. It wasn't a very good screenplay - really, it was unshootable. In redoing it, I suppose I changed the story somewhat. I rewrote it on a two-week assignment (...). Duncan said that he never saw the film in a theater but called it \"awful\" after seeing it on TV years later."

The film premiered in Los Angeles on Wednesday 15 June 1960 as the bottom half of a double bill, following The Brides of Dracula. Beginning that night, both films were billed as a \"Double Chill and Thrill Show\" in the Los Angeles Times and played at six indoor theaters and eight drive-ins in the LA area. When The Leech Woman reached Dayton, Ohio on Saturday 17 June 1960, just two days later, it was the second film on triple features shown simultaneously at three local drive-ins. According to an advertisement in the Dayton Daily News, the third film varied by drive-in, but all were 1950s westerns: Run for Cover (1955), Three Violent People (1956) and The Hangman (1959). The film was screened on 9 March 2019 at the Wayward Coffeehouse in Seattle as part of the \"B-Movie Bingo\" retrospective film series."

        "content": "The Leech Woman got mixed reviews upon release. According to BoxOffice magazine's standing feature \"Review Digest\", which summarized the rankings of films by a standard set of publications, the film was called \"very good\" by Harrison's Reports; \"good\" by Film Daily and BoxOffice itself; \"fair\" by The Hollywood Reporter and Parents' Magazine, and \"poor\" by the New York Daily News and Variety. BoxOffice also compiled figures for its \"Boxoffice Barometer', a percentage scale on which 100 equaled \"normal\" box office receipts. The Leech Woman had an average score of 101. Eight theaters in cities around the US reported their percentages: Minneapolis, 140; Buffalo, Detroit, Indianapolis and San Francisco, 100 each; New Haven, 95; Boston, 90; and Omaha, 85. The BoxOffice review says relatively little that is specific to the film itself, starting instead with the statement \"Dracula's various femme relatives, 'The Wasp Woman' [1959] and all the other gory gals of the screen, must move over and make room in their hall of infamy for this newcomer to the rank of distaff side chill dispensers\". But the anonymous review goes on favorably to call the film \"a solidly produced, ably acted spine-tingler\" and describes Dein as a \"business-like\" director and Gershenson a \"budget-stretching\" producer who \"combine[d] to elevate the offering several cuts above the norm\". Warren, however, quotes two contemporary reviews that thought little of The Leech Woman. The pseudonymous \"Tube,\" writing in Variety, called the film a \"lower-berth item\" with a \"tendency to meander into lengthy, irrelevant passages\", while The Monthly Film Bulletin used the phrase \"dull horror film\" to describe it. Warren himself finds the film to be not very well made, saying that it has a \"perfunctory get-it-over-with air\" and is saddled with a poor structure as \"More than half the film is spent simply setting up the rejuvention gimmick; June's life as a leech woman occupies a very small part of the film\". Nonetheless, he praises Gray's performance as \"the film's greatest strength\" and \"one of the few really memorable performances of her career\". But he writes that \"Gloria Talbott can't work up much energy\" in her role and that Williams was \"a hapless contract player (...) who had no choice about appearing in certain films\". Warren also says that \"no characters are likable, so we spend our time with unpleasant bores\". British horror and science fiction scholar Phil Hardy puts The Leech Woman into the category of \"one of several low-budget rejuvenation films of the early sixties\", but compliments \"Bud Westmore's striking makeup\" as \"the most notable feature of this workmanlike offering, the last to be directed by Dein, a Poverty Row regular\". Senn, on the other hand, says that Gray is \"let down by Bud Westmore's makeup department in her early scenes where her face looks like it needs rejuvenation less than just a good scrubbing\". But Senn, too, writes that Gray's \"performance as the female Mr. Hyde stands out\" in a film that is otherwise a \"juvenile but well-acted chiller that came at the tail end of Universal's string of 1950s sci-fi/horror melodramas\". In a synopsis, Eleanor Mannikka of AllMovie describes The Leech Woman as \"An uninspired horror film\" with a \"ragged story [that] begins in darkest Africa and in the even darker psyche of a mentally deteriorating woman\". In looking at race in the film, the anonymous reviewer at Blackhorrormovies calls it a \"parade of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes\" and points out that its \"portrayal of Africa is pretty typical of Hollywood in this era (and to some extent, up to the turn of the [21st] century)\" with its \"mystical rites with wildly gyrating natives\", its \"references to indigenous tribes as 'savages'\" and its \"'good' locals escorting the outsiders who either die or flee in terror (in this case, both)\". But \"the Malla character is an intelligent, well-spoken, classy lady - the type of black person not often seen in horror films of this era\". The reviewer also points out that Malla 'has a heart of gold compared to the Caucasian characters in the film, who are all despicable human beings\". Other critics, such as Bruce F. Kawin, bring up the roles that sexual identity and aging play in the film. Kawin writes that June's failed attempt to use Sally's pineal gland secretions is her undoing as the transformation ritual demands male secretions. \"The Leech Woman rejects a lesbian solution to June's problem (there is no radical feminist movement yet), which in context is presented as unnatural - that is, as another unnatural solution when what is needed is submission to nature, letting oneself age and die\". Aging is the specific focus of critic Dawn Keetley. To her, the film \"gets not only at what aging feels like for everyone, but, specifically, at what it feels like for a woman in a society that continues to value youth and beauty\" as June is forced to face the \"sudden horrific onset on aging\" over and again. Worse, when June \"reverts\" from being youthful to middle-aged, she experiences becoming \"older and older each time\". Likewise, aging (and sexism) is the topic of film scholar Vivian Sobchack. She writes, \"It is now a commonplace to acknowledge the complexity of ageism and sexism in white heterosexual culture in the United States\". Taking The Leech Woman as her text, and the relationship of June and Paul in particular, Sobchack notes that \"in a sexist as well as ageist technoculture, the visibly aging body of a woman has been and still is especially terrifying - not only to the woman who experiences self-revulsion and anger, invisibility and abandonment, but also to the men who find her presence so unbearable they must - quite literally - disavow and divorce her\". Sobchack further points out the additional complexity of the \"double standard\" of the aging man and woman, naming it as a \"standard that elicits a complex of engendered emotions from both the women and the men who bear it: fear, humiliation, abjection, shame, power, rage, and guilt\"."

En route, their car breaks down and they are reluctantly given accommodations in the home of Judge Malcolm Parker. The Judge, under indictment for bribery, has much to fear. His life, as well as that of his niece Louise has been threatened by a gang of racketeers; his companion, Giles, has accused him of embezzling Louise's fortune; and his sinister housekeeper, Agnes, blames him for the death of her mistress, Leonora. The Judge's fears are compounded when he meets Knuckles Dolan, the boys' guardian, whom he had unjustly sentenced to death, only to have his verdict reversed and Knuckles exonerated. Later that night, when Louise is kidnapped and the Judge found strangled, Giles and Simp, the Judge's bodyguard, accuse Knuckles of the murder, but the boys capture Simp and Giles and determine to find the murderer themselves. Muggs and Danny discover a secret panel in the library wall and enter a passage where they find Louise's unconscious body and glimpse the figure of a fleeing man. Knuckles captures the man, who identifies himself as Jim Harrison of the district attorney's office. Amid the confusion, the real killer takes Louise captive, but the boys track him down and unmask Simp. Harrison then identifies the bodyguard as the triggerman seeking revenge on the Judge. With the crime solved, the boys can finally leave for their summer camp."

        "content": "This film was a direct follow-up to East Side Kids. After completing the pilot film for the series, producer Sam Katzman was able to convince former Dead End Kids Bobby Jordan and Leo Gorcey to join the series. Katzman also brought in Gorcey's younger brother David, and former Our Gang star and Vaudeville entertainer \"Sunshine Sammy\" Morrison. Morrison had already known Katzman prior to joining the series. While this film is technically a sequel to the previous film, some unexplained changes are made (namely the addition of \"Muggs\", \"Scruno\", and \"Buster\"). Most of the cast from the previous film did not return. Bobby Jordan replaced Harris Berger in the role of \"Danny\", and would retain the role for a large portion of the series' run. Jack Edwards was originally slated to return as \"Algernon Wilkes\", but immediately declined after being offered a better paid part elsewhere. Eugene Francis took his place the day before filming began. Francis says he was paid $66 a week and the film was shot in five days. New York City exteriors were done at the Roach Studio, with interiors done on a soundstage on Gower St next to Columbia. Francis: I knew what I was getting into. It was Gower Gulch-bottom of the barrel. The cliche in Hollywood at the time was if you were working in Gower Gulch you\u2019re either on your way up or on your way down... They\u2019d block it out so we knew where we were supposed to walk. Sometimes that was the trouble with the picture. Everyone would pile in a scene like some kind of free-for-all. It looked like it was ad-libbed or at least that's how it seemed to me. I\u2019m a guy who likes rehearsing but they didn\u2019t believe in it. I don\u2019t think Leo Gorcey could ever rehearse. He was pretty wild and you never knew what was going to happen... There was a lot of ad-libbing but [the scenes and storyline were not substantially changed]. You\u2019d never get the picture done otherwise. We didn\u2019t have to be word perfect just approximate... I did know that Boys of the City was terribly shot. You could see the flashlight reflection of a candle during one scene! No one cared. It was junk. They were poverty row films and no one wanted to be in them. Hal E. Chester returned, but as his character was killed off in the previous film, he plays a different character here. This would be his last East Side Kids film. In addition to Chester, Frankie Burke, Donald Haines, and Dave O'Brien all returned, and each reprised their role from the previous film. This would be Burke's last East Side Kids film. After his departure, the character of \"Skinny\" was given to Haines, while \"Peewee\" was given to David Gorcey. Filming started in June 1940."

They find the samurai troop and bring them to an illusory mansion in the bamboo grove where the burnt-out house was. They seduce and then kill the samurai like cats, tearing their throats with their teeth. Meanwhile, in northern Japan a battle is taking place with the Emishi. A young man, Hachi, fortuitously kills the enemy general, Kumasunehiko. He brings the severed head to show the governor, Minamoto no Raik\u014d. He says that he fought the general under the name Gintoki. He is made a samurai in acknowledgement of his achievement. When he goes looking for his mother and wife, he finds their house burned down and the women missing. Raik\u014d tells Gintoki to find and destroy the ghosts who are killing the samurai. Gintoki encounters the two women and realizes that they are Yone, his mother, and Shige, his wife. They have made a pact with the underworld to return and kill samurai in revenge for their deaths. Because Gintoki has become a samurai, by their pact they must kill him, but Shige breaks her pledge to spend seven nights of love with Gintoki. Then, because she has broken the pact, Shige is condemned to the underworld. Reporting on his progress, a mournful Gintoki tells Raik\u014d that he has destroyed one of the ghosts. Gintoki encounters his spectral mother again at Raj\u014dmon trying to seduce samurai. After seeing her reflection as a ghost in a pool of water, he attacks her with his sword, cutting off her arm, which takes on the appearance of a cat's limb. Gintoki brings the limb to Raik\u014d, claiming it is evidence that he has killed the second ghost. Raik\u014d is pleased and says Gintoki will be remembered as a hero, but first orders him to complete seven days of ritual purification. During the purification, Gintoki is visited by Yone, who claims to be a seer sent by the emperor to ward off evil spirits. She tricks Gintoki into giving her the limb, and then flies through the ceiling and disappears into the sky. Distraught and disheveled, Gintoki staggers through the woods to the cottage where he met the ghosts, where he collapses. The walls disappear around him, revealing the charred remains of his family home where Shige and Yone were murdered. Snow falls and covers his body as a cat is heard meowing in the distance."

Although the Japanese title literally means \"a black cat in a bamboo grove\", the phrase yabu no naka in Japanese is also used idiomatically to refer to a mystery that is difficult to unravel. Suzumura also identified the legends of Minamoto no Raik\u014d as an influence on the film: since Raik\u014d himself appears in the film, it is likely that the film's protagonist's name  refers to the name of Raik\u014d's legendary follower . In an essay about Kuroneko, film critic Maitland McDonagh highlighted the roles cats play in Japanese folklore\u2014particularly the bakeneko, a y\u014dkai (or supernatural entity) thought to have the ability to take the form of a human victim, often eating the victim in the process. Kuroneko is one of a number of Japanese \"monster cat\" horror films (kaiby\u014d eiga or bake neko mono), a subgenre derived primarily from the repertoire of kabuki theatre. Other theatrical elements observed in Kuroneko include the film's implementation of spotlights; the use of smoke to create a ghostly atmosphere, which is characteristic of kabuki theatre; the dance movements of the mother's spirit, based on dances in Noh theatre; and the resemblance of the spirits' jumping and flying movements to ch\u016bnori, a visual trick used in kabuki theatre in which actors are made to \"fly\" in mid-air through the use of wires. Additionally, lead actor Kichiemon Nakamura was a kabuki performer, and Hideo Kanze, who played the Mikado in Kuroneko, specialized in Noh theatre."

        "content": "Lamont Granston assumes his secret identity as \"The Shadow\", to break up an attempted robbery at an attorney's office. When the police search the scene, Granston must assume the identity of the attorney, Chester Randall. Before he can leave, a phone call summons the attorney to the home of Caleb Delthiern, a wealthy client who wants a new will drawn up. As Granston meets with him, Delthiern is suddenly shot but not before he is able to state that his niece Marcia Delthiern \"is to be completely disinherited if she marries Warran\" (Berringer). The oldest nephew, Winstead Comstock is arrested as he is under suspicion since he stands to inherit half of Delthiern's entire estate, the remainder to be divided equally among the remaining heirs: Marcia, and two other nephews, Jasper Delthiern and Humphrey Comstock. Winstead is later cleared of suspicion as he was at the theater and a caf\u00e9 at the time of the shooting. Marcia discovers a pistol on Jasper's night stand, she and Humphrey phone \"Randall\" (Granston) at his private number and he agrees to come right over. After talking to Detective Kelly on the phone, Granston discovers the pistol is a different caliber than the one used in the Delthiern's murder. Marcia has Randall put the gun in the library desk drawer. Chester Randall's secretary, Miss Hughes, phones Captain Breen to let him know she read that Randall is in town when in fact he is away on vacation. Breen finds Granston at the Delthiern's and inists he's an imposter. Granston/Randall has Breen phone his secretary to verify that he is who he says he is. Granston has his assistant, Henry Hendricks, disconnect the phone cord just before Granston talks to the secretary, but talks into the receiver as if she was still on the line. Breen is convinced and leaves. Jasper owes casino club owner, Barney Brossett, ten thousand dollars for gambling debts. Jasper confronts Winstead and insists on an eleven thousand loan to pay off his gambling debts while holding the gun he finds in the desk drawer. A shot is fired and Winstead is killed, Granston asks Captain Breen to run a paraffin test to see if the pistol has been fired in the last two hours. Granston hands Marcia her uncle's will and asks her to keep it in a safe place. Warran suspects that Granston is not really Randall after the telephone company repair the connection, he visits Randall's secretary and learns that Randall is supposed to be away on vacation and lets Captain Breen know. Marcia goes to Granston's home and warns him. Granston pays a visit to Brossett as Hendricks sets up a listening device in Brossett's window and overhears Brossett on the phone talking about getting the will from the Delthiern house to get Jasper to pay him to get the will back. Brossett's men go to the house and attempt to get Marcia to hand over the will, but the Shadow appears and forces them to hand it back. Delthiern's butler, Wellington finds Granston's address on a piece of paper in Marcia's purse and goes to Granston's place and tells him he intends to kill him. Brossett now suspects that Granston is the Shadow, follows him to his residence and confronts him, while Wellington is hidden behind a curtain. Brossett and Wellington attempt to shoot Granston but instead kill each other as Granston ducks out of the way. A dying Wellington admits that he tried to get his son, Warran Berringer, some of the Delthiern money."

Biologist Ted Baxter (Kent Taylor) and Federal Agent William Grant (Rodney Bell) discover the man's body, washed up on the beach and covered with radiation burns. They decide to investigate the strange death. After two young divers are killed by the monster, Ted and Grant decide to go dive in the same location and investigate the area. They discover a glowing radioactive rock being guarded by the monster. Grant shoots it with a harpoon gun, allowing them to escape, but the creature survives. Ted eventually discovers that Dr. King (Michael Whalen), another marine biologist, created the monster and the radioactive rock with a mutating device in his laboratory. Meanwhile, foreign agents try to discover Dr. King's secrets, while Ted and King's daughter Lois (Cathy Downs) develop a relationship. Agent Grant captures the foreign agents after one of them kills King's secretary with a spear gun. Ted finally tells Dr. King that the monster is killing people and that it must be stopped. When King witnesses a ship explode as it passes over the rock, he realizes Ted is right. He destroys his lab and goes out to the ocean to kill his creation using dynamite. Shortly before a timed detonation, the monster grabs Dr. King while he is planting the underwater explosives. Ted, Grant, and Lois arrive just in time to witness the large explosion, which destroys the rock, the monster, and Dr. King."

        "content": "When American Releasing Company began making low-budget films, they knew that if they made two together and released both as a double feature, they could make a larger profit. ARC's cofounder James H. Nicholson came up with the film's Phantom from 10,000 Leagues title. He was looking for a feature to support and team with Day the World Ended. ARC lacked money to make both, so they allocated Phantom to Dan and Jack Milner, film editors who wanted to get into feature-film production. ARC and Milner split the costs 60/40. Both films cost about $100,000 each to make. As planned, The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues was theatrically released on a double bill alongside Day the World Ended. Both proved popular with audiences, due in part to savvy marketing by James H. Nicholson. In January 1956, the films were released simultaneously in 250 New England theaters grossing $45,000 from just 2 Boston theaters in its first week. Within two months of their release, both films had earned $400,000."

On Broadway, it debuted on February 7, 1957, and ran for 388 performances. Ritchard received a Tony Award nomination for his performance as Kreton.

Vidal intended the play as a satire on the post-World War II fear of communism in the United States, McCarthyism, Cold War military paranoia and the rising importance of television in American life. A major critical success, it was subtitled A Comedy Akin to Vaudeville. The play tells the story of Kreton, an alien from an unnamed planet who lands on Earth intending to view the American Civil War. He miscalculates and lands instead 100 years later. Having missed the opportunity to see conflict first hand, but delighted with all the new playthings the 20th century has invented for war-making, he decides to create a war for himself."

        "content": "The US Army has decided to form an elite strike force similar to the British Commandos, led by Major William Darby (James Garner), a former staff officer. Darby is in command of the 1st Ranger Battalion, formed entirely from able-bodied volunteers. On June 19, 1942 the 1st Ranger Battalion is sanctioned, begins recruiting, and trains volunteers under command of British commando units in Dundee, Scotland. Darby and Master Sergeant Saul Rosen (Jack Warden), who also narrates the film, are called on to select a variety of men, who must undergo rigorous training by the British Commando veterans.  Darby tells his men that the British Commandos are the best soldiers in the world, but in time the Rangers will be own that distinction. The American trainees are quartered in Scottish homes and several of the Rangers pair off with local lassies: Rollo Burns (Peter Brown) with Peggy McTavish (Venetia Stevenson), the daughter of the fearsome but humorous Scottish Commando instructor, Sergeant McTavish (Torin Thatcher), and vagabond Hank Bishop (Stuart Whitman), with prim and proper, Wendy Hollister (Joan Elan). The Rangers prove their worth in Operation Torch (the invasion of French North Africa), and two more Ranger battalions are formed, with Darby promoted to colonel. Joining the Rangers is Second Lieutenant Arnold Dittmann (Edd Byrnes), a by-the-book graduate of West Point. The Rangers fight successfully in Sicily. There are several action scenes in a bombed-out Italian village where the men face a sniper, and a running firefight with the Germans. Lt. Dittmann is humanized by his encounter with Angelina De Lotta (Etchika Choureau). Darby confides to Rosen a recurring dream of being run over by an oncoming train, foreshadowing the tragic climax. During the Battle of Anzio, the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions are sent on a dangerous mission; they are ambushed and wiped out by the Germans in the Battle of Cisterna. Of the 767 men who go in, only seven come back, the majority being captured. Burns is among the dead. Darby leads his 4th Ranger Battalion in an unsuccessful rescue attempt. After the heavy losses at Cisterna, the Ranger units are disbanded. Brief vignettes show Bishop on leave with Wendy and her family, and Dittman with Angelina. At the Anzio beachhead, Rosen says goodbye to Darby, who is ordered to report to Army HQ at the Pentagon. Darby mechanically takes salutes from newly arrived troops as he walks alone down the beach to board a landing craft. Then a soldier calls out, \u201cLook at that Ranger patch!\u201d Darby straightens up and continues to salute, with pride, as a rousing march plays on the soundtrack. He walks alone onto the landing craft and as the boarding ramp is lifted, a printed panel acknowledges the U.S military's cooperation in the making of the film: \"We dedicate this picture to the Rangers, whose rugged hard-hitting methods of training inspired techniques now employed by all fighting units of the United States Army.\u201d Note: In the film, nothing is mentioned of the fact that William Orlando Darby was killed in action after returning to Italy in April 1945. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of brigadier general."

        "content": "Warner Brothers had had a financial and critical hit in Battle Cry, and wanted to repeat the success with Major James Altieri's biographical account of Darby's Rangers, The Spearheaders. Altieri was known to Warner Brothers, as he had been technical advisor on Force of Arms (1951). Director William Wellman's reputation for superb war films lay in The Story of G.I. Joe and  Battleground. He was hired on condition that Warner Brothers finance his dream project, Lafayette Escadrille, about his (Wellman's) own World War I French Foreign Legion air squadron. Warner Brothers emphasised the romantic pairings of most of the leads, as a feature of the film, to emulate the success of Battle Cry; problems arose. One problem was with the United States Army. The United States Marine Corps had enthusiastically lent bases, Marine extras, and film of its campaigns to Hollywood films to boost its public image (see The United States Marine Corps on film). But the Army was not so keen on this project. The Army felt that Ranger operations led to heavy losses of excellent soldiers that the Army thought would be better employed leading regular infantry units. By the 1950s, rather than the separate Ranger units shown in the movie, the Army preferred training individual officers and NCOs at the Ranger School, who then returned to their parent units and trained them in Ranger tactics and military values. Thus, the U.S. Army's co-operation was limited to training the actors and providing black-and-white stock footage. Originally, Charlton Heston was cast as William O. Darby. He was enthusiastic about portraying a recent historical figure; he could interview people who knew Darby in creating his characterization. However, he asked for five percent of the profits. Jack L. Warner thought he was joking, until just before filming. (Heston later sued Warner Bros for $250,000 \u2013 $100,000 fee, $50,000 further earnings, and $100,000 damage to his career.) Warner looked to his studio's contracted actors, and, fortuitously, replaced Heston with thirty-year-old James Garner who was already going to be in the film. Garner had the proper appearance and age to play William O. Darby, who died at age thirty-four. Garner, a Korean War veteran, was in his first leading film role. Garner's original role in the film was taken by Stuart Whitman. (Garner too would later sue Warner Brothers). Garner later wrote in his memoirs that he did not feel Wellman \"wanted me in the part... and I don't blame him: I was too young for it and he deserved a bigger star. But we got along fine because we respected each other.\" Originally, Tab Hunter was to play Lt. Dittmann, but quit before filming; Edd Byrnes replaced him. Garner's interpretation of Ranger commander Darby is earnest and sensitive; Byrnes' character is heartless and over-serious, the ultimate \"square\".  These are the opposites of the two stars' portrayals of their best-known TV characters: cynical, easy-going  Bret Maverick and hip \"Kookie\" of 77 Sunset Strip. Darby's Rangers was filmed, economically, on the studio backlot. The supporting cast includes: Murray Hamilton, Adam Williams, Corey Allen, and William Wellman Jr. French actress Etchika Choureau (n\u00e9e Jeannine Paulette Verret) made her Hollywood d\u00e9but in this film, and acted in Lafayette Escadrille, then returned to Europe. Francis De Sales had an uncredited role as a captain. The film emphasizes romantic subplots, as Darby counsels his soldiers about their personal problems. William H. Clothier's black and white cinematography blends with the stock footage, and renders the sets believable."

It\u2019s not enough to say that romance is a recurring distraction in this film; it would be more accurate to describe the battle scenes as interrupting all the mush.\u201d He does praise two combat sequences, \u201cnotable because the movie makes extensive use of stock footage from the war, so these are some of the few combat scenes that were actually shot for the movie.\u201d The audience rank on Rotten Tomatoes is 43 percent."

On the day of the one-year anniversary of the divorce, he and his former wife, Valerie, go to the restaurant where they first fell in love. Randy was responsible for breaking up their marriage in the first place, by spending more time with his race horse than Valerie. At the restaurant, while they are dancing, the police come and arrest Randy for not paying his alimony to Valerie. He is thrown in jail, and desperate to get out he starts to plan how to get rid of his obligation to pay alimony altogether. He finds that the best solution is to get Valerie to marry someone else, and so he tries to fix her up with a friend of his, Paul Hunter. They both accompany Randy to a party at the estate of a rich eccentric socialit\u00e9, Ethel Hilary, who has a special interest in collecting original characters to her circle of friends at the estate. Besides Randy and his company and yoga master Dickie Brown, a very handsome man named Freddie arrives to the estate. He is unknown to everyone, but is soon romantically interested in Valerie, trying to get her interested in him by singing her a serenade in the night. She mistakes the singer for Randy, and he discovers that Valerie is more interested in Freddie than Paul, and forces her to go with him instead of Freddie to a picnic. Problems arise when Randy gets a flat tire and Valerie has to be escorted by Freddie anyway. She manages to get Freddie to propose to her at the picnic, but is devastated to learn that Freddie is already married. Having re-discovered his interest in Valerie, Randy gets jealous of Freddie, and wants to remarry his ex-wife. Randy quickly proposes to Valerie and she immediately accepts, having longed a long time for him to utter those words. Unfortunately Randy's lawyer, Bill Carter, accidentally reveals that Randy has had a \"plan\" to get rid of the alimony, and Valerie gets second thoughts about marrying him again. She decides on marrying the dull Paul instead, upset with Randy's presumptious behavior. The marriage is about to take place at the estate, but on the wedding day both  Randy and Paul turn up as grooms. During the ceremony, Randy's own race horse Ajax participates in a race broadcast over the radio. The ceremony is quite disturbed by the race, and just when Valerie has decided to marry Randy, the horse wins the race to both their joy."

His younger brother Hasan urges him not to dam the spring, but reluctantly goes along with him. The farmers are furious with Osman. They initiate a legal dispute. Osman is ordered to keep the spring open while the dispute is being resolved, but he disobeys this order. Hasan occasionally opens the dam out of pity for his neighbors, but Osman is quick to close it again. Meanwhile, Hasan courts and marries a young woman named Bahar. On their wedding night, Osman bursts into their bedroom and orders Bahar to breed as many as 10 children for the family. Hasan has to put a dresser in front of the window to block out his drunken brother. Osman finds a crack in the wall and watches the consummation. One of the farmers kills Osman's dog, prompting the brothers to keep watch at night to prevent further violence. That night, two farmers blow up the dam. Osman and Hasan chase the saboteurs. Osman fires several shots into the darkness, killing one of the farmers. He convinces Hasan to take the blame for the killing by arguing that Hasan is much younger and will get a lighter sentence. Hasan is sentenced to 24 years, which is reduced to 8 because he was provoked. Osman uses his absence to advance on Bahar. He destroys Hasan's letters to make it appear as if he has forgotten Bahar. When a prisoner named Hasan is killed in the same prison as her husband, Bahar is distraught. She flees the farm and returns to her mother. Osman convinces her to return by explaining that, as Hasan's widow, she owns half of everything. Hasan is not dead, and he is eventually pardoned. On his way home from prison, he learns how Osman has tricked Bahar. He goes straight to confront his brother. Osman shoots first at Bahar who runs at him with an axe. He shoots repeatedly at Hasan, but Hasan manages to topple his brother into the spring and drown him. Osman's body washes down the sluice towards the farms he had deprived of water."

The other lost scene is when The Frisco Doll switched identities with Sister Annie and dressed Sister Annie up as a prostitute. The veiled connection of Sister Annie and The Salvation Army made this scene inappropriate to the censors but its deletion made the final print of the film appear choppy. The State of Georgia went so far as to ban this film outright. The film caused a rift between West and William Randolph Hearst, who decided never to print West's name in any of his newspapers. The reason given was the racy material of the film and West's sexual persona in a religious setting. This may seem hypocritical due to his extramarital affair with actress Marion Davies.

The Monster and the Girl used these themes but applied it to a monster movie theme for The Monster and the Girl. The censorship board rejected original story ideas due to the plot dealing with white slavery and homicide. The script was changed to imply Susan's entrapment by Munn.

A rescue training parachute jump is conducted, but the patrol boat sent to pick up the jumper finds only a floating parachute. One sailor dives in but also disappears. The other sailor screams in terror as something rises from the water. When the patrol boat does not answer radio calls, Lt. Cmdr. John \"Twill\" Twillinger takes a rescue party out on a second patrol boat to investigate. They find the deserted patrol boat covered in a strange slime; the jumper's body then floats to the surface, now blackened and drained of bodily fluids. Twill takes a sample of the slime to the base lab for analysis, where he teams up with recently widowed Gail MacKenzie and Dr. Jess Rogers. A young couple disappear after going for a swim. U.S. Navy divers investigate and discover a giant egg and the body of one of the victims on the ocean floor. The divers are attacked by a giant mollusk (which looks like a giant caterpillar), which kills one of the divers. The mollusk attacks the boat, but Twill stabs it in the eye with a grappling hook. The egg is taken to the U.S. Navy lab for study and kept under temperature control to prevent it from hatching. The mollusks escape into an irrigation canal system, attacking livestock, a lock keeper, a trysting couple, and others. Navy divers locate a group of mollusks in the canal system, and use explosives to destroy them. In the meantime, Gail is at the lab with her young daughter, Sandy. Worried about the lab rabbits being cold in the lab's lowered temperature, Sandy surreptitiously turns up the thermostat. Twill calls the lab and gets no answer. He arrives and finds that the hatched mollusk has Gail and Sandy cornered in a closet, where they ran to escape from the monster. He fights it with lab chemicals and a CO2 fire extinguisher, and a live steam line until other Navy personnel arrive and shoot the mollusk."

During production, Duncan's original work was titled The Jagged Edge, before the screenplay was renamed The Kraken.  Prior to the film's release, it was once more retitled, this time to The Monster That Challenged the World. Filming took place in 16 days on a budget of $200,000. A majority of the underwater scenes in the production were shot at Catalina Island off the coast of Los Angeles. Other primary filming locations included the Salton Sea, as well as Brawley and Barstow, California. The close-ups were later filmed in a tank filled with water and plastic seaweed. In a 2016 interview, star Audrey Dalton recalled: \"I thought it was a very interesting experience - as all my movies were in different ways. The director, Arnold Laven, had formed a production company with Jules Levy and Arthur Gardner. The monster stuff was fun, crouching behind a desk with a monster breaking down the wall. But you had to play it very straight. Once you start seeing the funny side of it, it doesn't work. Tim Holt had come out of retirement to do this movie. He was a quiet, very nice man - the most 'unactor' actor that I ever worked with. The film's poster features a woman in a bathing suit. People think it's me, but it was the actress whose character was drowned in the opening sequence. She's pulled into the water by the monster. We shot down on the beach for that. I think the rest of it was filmed along the California Aqueduct.\""

For one thing, I think the characters are unusually well drawn for this type of movie, and they're given a dimension and a sense of realness that adds a lot to the proceedings\". Respect for the \"monster\" also dominated a later review of The Monster That Challenged the World in the Video Movie Guide: \"This late-1950s sci-fi programmer is set apart by only one thing: the giant monster, which is life-size (not a miniature), and given plenty of screen time.\""

He manages, with some difficulty, to get Shumann's aircraft to start, but the plane crashes and Shumann is killed.

In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther said the film \"was badly, cheaply written by George Zuckerman and is abominably played by a hand-picked cast. The sentiments are inflated \u2014 blown out of all proportions to the values involved. And the acting, under Douglas Sirk's direction, is elaborate and absurd.\" Variety called the film \"a stumbling entry. Characters are mostly colorless, given static reading in drawn-out situations, and story line is lacking in punch.\" More recent reviews, penned after a resurgence of interest and respect for Sirk's directing, are almost uniformly positive. In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100. Dave Kehr wrote in The New York Times: \"The Tarnished Angels is among Sirk\u2019s most self-conscious and artistically ambitious creations. ... This is bravura filmmaking in the service of a haunting vision. Yet there are moments of almost microscopic subtlety: the camera movement that expresses the moral reversal of the Hudson and Stack characters, one growing larger than the other; the infinite tenderness with which Hudson strokes Ms. Malone\u2019s hair, helplessly trying to comfort her after a shock.\" TV Guide rated the film four out of a possible four stars and called it \"the best-ever adaptation of a Faulkner novel for the screen, directed with passion and perception by Sirk ... The acting is first-rate here, and the script is outstanding, full of wit, black humor, and occasional fine poetic monologues.\""

The film is loosely based on the 1891 novel of the same name by George du Maurier. A tale of a love that transcends all obstacles, it relates the story of two youngsters who are separated in childhood and then drawn together by destiny years later. Even though they are separated in real life because Peter is unjustly convicted of murder (it was actually self-defense), they discover they can dream themselves into each other's consciousness while asleep. In this way, they live out their lives together. The transitions between reality and fantasy are captured by the cinematography of Charles Lang, as discussed in the documentary Visions of Light (1992)."

After his mother dies, Gogo is taken to England by his uncle who gives him an English name based on his mother's maiden name, transforming Gogo into Peter Ibbetson. \"So ended the first chapter in the strange foreshadowed life of Peter Ibbetson.\" Now an adult Englishman, Ibbetson is an architect working in Yorkshire on a restoration job for the Duke of Towers, a peer of the realm. He falls in love with Mary, Duchess of Towers, and she with him, although she is already married. When the duke discovers this, he callously demands they explain themselves. Peter then realizes that Mary is his childhood sweetheart. All these years, Mary has kept, in the dresser beside her bed, the dress she wore at their last childhood meeting. The Duke becomes jealous and pulls a gun on Ibbetson. Ibbetson manages to kill the Duke in self-defense. \"So Death ended the second chapter. And then, in a prison on the bleak English moors...\" Ibbetson is unjustly convicted of murder, sentenced to life in prison, and despairs that he will never see Mary again. In a fight with his guards, he breaks his back and lies unconscious. Mary visits him in his dreams and convinces him that they can continue to live together in one another's dreams, which connect them spiritually. Peter can leave prison to join Mary in sunlit glades and meadows, but only in his slumbers. \"...and so, many years went by.\" Though the years pass, Peter and Mary remain youthful in their dreams. Mary eventually dies of old age, but she goes to her usual dream rendezvous one last time and speaks to Peter from beyond. Peter, back on his bed in prison, promises to join her now, and dies."

        "content": "The film was well received by film critics, including Andre Sennwald, in The New York Times, who liked Hathaway's adaptation of the novel on film, his direction, and the acting. He wrote: Mr. Hathaway bridges the spiritual gulfs between Lives of a Bengal Lancer [his previous film]...and the fragile dream world of du Maurier's sentimental classic with astonishing success. With his directness and his hearty masculine qualities, he skillfully escapes all the lush pitfalls of the plot and gives it a tenderness that is always gallant instead of merely soft. The photoplay, though it scarcely is a dramatic thunderbolt, possesses a luminous beauty and a sensitive charm that make it attractive and moving. Under Mr. Hathaway's management Miss Ann Harding, who has been losing prestige lately, gives her finest performance, while Gary Cooper fits into the picture with unexpected success. Variety praised the cinematography, saying: \"From a technical standpoint, picture is just about tops, gaining so much weight in beauty and serenity that it almost overbears the incredulity of the story\". The film received a positive reception from Andr\u00e9 Breton and other proponents of Surrealism; Breton commended it as \"a triumph of surrealist thinking\". The fact that Cooper and Harding, as well as the child actors who portrayed them as youths, had American rather than English or French accents did not seem to bother critics."

In the years following the 1935 film, a Ford Theater television Peter Ibbetson (1951) starring Richard Greene, and a Campbell Playhouse radio Peter Ibbetson (1951) directed by and starring Orson Welles were produced. An opera, Peter Ibbetson with music by Deems Taylor from a libretto by Constance Collier and Deems Taylor, based on the same 1891 novel by George du Maurier. It was performed at the Metropolitan Opera 55 times from 1931 to 1935. Orson Welles's The Campbell Playhouse program performed a one-hour radio adaptation, broadcast on CBS on September 10, 1939. The musical Dream True, by Ricky Ian Gordon (music and additional lyrics) and Tina Landau (book and lyrics), is a loose adaptation of the novel, reset in the United States from the 1940s through the 1980s, with a gay subtext (the Peter and Mary characters are both male).  It played at the Vineyard Theatre in New York in 1999.  The cast was led by Jeff McCarthy, Daniel Jenkins, and Judy Kuhn. The 1947 film The Guilt of Janet Ames, starring Rosalind Russell and Melvyn Douglas, makes reference to Peter Ibbetson and utilizes the concept of projecting in the plot."

The next morning, Carol is concerned that her ne'er-do-well father did not come home the night before. She convinces her boyfriend Mike to assist in a search. They find his crashed truck and the bracelet. Thinking he may have taken shelter in a nearby cave, they investigate. In the darkness of the cave, they step off a ledge and fall onto the gigantic web of an enormous tarantula, which emerges to attack them. They escape and make it back to town. The sheriff does not believe Carol and Mike about the giant spider, but their science teacher, Mr. Kingman, persuades him to return to the cave with large amounts of DDT. They find Jack's body, drained of fluids, and spray DDT throughout the cavern to flush out and then kill the spider. The apparently lifeless body of the spider is taken back to town to the high school gym, where Kingman wants to study it, concerned that whatever conditions created it may produce a whole race of giant spiders. A group of teenagers uses the gym to practice rock and roll numbers they are going to play for a school dance. The music awakens the spider and it crashes through the wall of the gym. The janitor, stopping to call the sheriff, is killed. The spider terrorizes the town, killing a number of people before heading to Kingman's house, attacking his wife and son. Kingman, in his car, gets the spider's attention and lures it outside of town before escaping and doubling back to confirm that his wife and son are safe. The spider is spotted returning to its cave. The sheriff and Kingman use dynamite to seal the spider in, but then discover Carol and Mike had gone into the cave to retrieve the bracelet her father had bought her as a final memento of him. A crew is put to work digging into the cave through its ceiling. Kingman acquires a couple of large electrodes from the power company and runs cables to some power lines. In hopes of escaping the spider's reach, Carol and Mike proceed onto a narrow ledge, which collapses behind them, leaving them trapped. The spider descends on a strand of web to get at them. The townspeople arrive and toss one of the electrodes to Mike. Kingman and Mike use the electrodes to electrocute the spider, which falls, impaling itself on stalagmites. Dynamite is again used to seal off the cave, and the sheriff remarks with satisfaction that even should the spider return to life again, it will be trapped and starve to death. However, Kingman fears that curious scientists may again dig up the spider in hopes of studying it."

They leave, and the alien follows them. A colleague of the professor, the unscrupulous and ambitious scientist Dr. Mears (William Schallert), discovers that the humanoid speaks in musical tones and tries to force from it the metal formula for its spaceship. He shuts off its breathing apparatus and leaves the spaceman for dead, telling the professor that communication was hopeless. Soon, Lawrence discovers that the alien is gone, as is the professor's daughter, Enid (Margaret Field). Tommy, the seaside village's constable (Roy Engle), reports that others are now missing as well. Lawrence takes the constable to the site where the spaceship had landed, but it is no longer there. With more villagers now missing, including Mears, and with the phone lines suddenly dead and the village in a panic, they are finally able get word to Scotland Yard by using a heliograph to contact a passing freighter just off the coast. When an Inspector (David Ormont) and a sergeant fly in and are briefed on the situation, it is decided that the military must destroy the spaceship. Lawrence objects that doing so will also kill the people who are now under the alien's control. With the planet due to reach its closest approach to Earth at midnight, Lawrence is given until 11:00pm to rescue them. He sneaks up to the alien ship and learns from Mears that the spaceman intends to use its ship as a wireless relay station in advance of an invasion coming from the approaching planet, which we also learn is a dying world. Lawrence orders the enthralled villagers to leave and attacks the alien, shutting off its breathing apparatus, then escapes with Enid and the professor. Mears, however, returns to the spaceship and is killed when the military opens fire and destroys it, shortly before the planet is nearest Earth.

Directed by Robert Scheerer, it premiered in black-and-white switching to color broadcasts in the fall of 1965. At the time, Kaye was at the height of his popularity. He starred in a string of successful 1940s and 1950s musical comedy features, made numerous personal appearances at venues such as the London Palladium, and his rare selective visits to the small screen were considered major events. With his recent motion pictures considered disappointments, three triumphant early '60s television specials led the way to this series. Prior to his film and television career, Kaye had made a name for himself with his own radio show, also titled The Danny Kaye Show. He made numerous guest appearances on other comedy and variety radio shows and headlined in several major Broadway musical revues throughout the 1940s."

        "content": "With the start of the 1963\u201364 television season at hand, James T. Aubrey, then president and board head of the CBS network, firmly believed he had scored a major coup by signing Judy Garland and Danny Kaye to headline their own variety shows. Kaye's program was originally slated to air on Sunday nights at 9:00 pm (EST) following The Ed Sullivan Show. However, that particular time slot was swiftly becoming known as a graveyard slot with NBC's top-rated western Bonanza also shown at that hour. CBS offered Kaye the Sunday 9:00 pm slot and he flatly refused. As a result, the network placed Kaye's show on Wednesday nights at 10:00 pm (replacing the alternating The United States Steel Hour and Armstrong Circle Theatre drama anthologies), and gave the Sunday 9:00 pm slot to Garland."

        "content": "The Danny Kaye Show followed the usual variety-show format, with an emphasis on comedy (Danny became the weekly equivalent of Sid Caesar and Carol Burnett), and was one of many variety shows that filled television schedules between 1948 and 1973, when the format had its heyday. Consultant Larry Gelbart worked with producer Perry Lafferty, a veteran of several recent Arthur Godfrey specials, in formulating the basic framework for the show months before it began production. They were also involved in the selection of talent with the program featuring many relative newcomers. Comedian Harvey Korman and actress Joyce Van Patten were featured performers on the show. Tony Charmoli, formerly of The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, who would later go on to direct many television specials himself, including Mikhail Baryshnikov's staging of The Nutcracker (1977), was the choreographer for the musical numbers. The program's orchestra was conducted by gifted arranger-composer Paul Weston, husband of vocalist and Capitol Records recording star Jo Stafford. In the comedy elements of The Danny Kaye Show a recurring character was painfully shy guy \"Jerome\" (Kaye), getting into weekly scrapes through his shyness; the Jerome sketches were often introduced by Kaye doing a short monologue. As with many variety shows of the era, the final segment was \"the sit-down\", a less formal segment in which Kaye would have a light monologue or conversation summarizing the preceding program."

By this point, The Danny Kaye Show was in a time slot considered too late in the evening for variety shows of its type, but too family-friendly for late night (CBS did not program in the late-night slots at the time). Show regular Harvey Korman quickly signed with another CBS variety series premiering in September - The Carol Burnett Show, where he remained as a cast member for 10 years. Tim Conway, a three-time Kaye guest star and also a future Burnett show series regular, first worked with Korman on a 1966 Kaye show. Following their years with Burnett, they continued as a duo in concert and television appearances until Korman's death in 2008. Danny Kaye remained a constant in the eyes of the public for the next two decades through his concert appearances, television work in both comical and highly praised dramatic roles, and as a tireless fundraiser for charities including UNICEF in which he spearheaded as an ambassador-at-large until his death in March 1987."

        "content": "At his psychiatric institute, Dr. Charles Conway (John Carradine) is surreptitiously experimenting with artificial glands to try to create longevity; he works with his minion Lobo (Tor Johnson) and his assistant Dr. Sharon Gilchrist (Marilyn Buferd). Conway receives his test subjects through an associate, Dr. Loren Wright (Roy Gordon), who delivers patients seeking treatment for lesser conditions. After this, they are then taken into the operating room for Conway's illicit surgery. Wright delivers his newest find, Grace Thomas (Allison Hayes), who is seeking treatment for depression. When Conway balks at Wright for bringing him a patient with living relatives, he confides in Conway that he plans to throw Grace's purse and bags into the bay, to fool family and the authorities into believing she had committed suicide. He then asks Conway for a demonstration of his experimental progress; Conway takes him down into the basement, where he introduces him to Harry Jedrow (Harry Fleer), his latest victim. Jedrow is clearly alive, but severely disfigured and in a vegetative state; this concerns Wright, who reveals that Jedrow's sister is currently seeking him out. Conway is furious, since none of his patients were supposed to have ties of any kind. That night, Lobo (who famously delivers the line \"Time for go to bed!\") discovers Frank Scott (Myron Healey) roaming around the grounds. Scott attempts to conceal his identity, but Conway quickly deduces that he is an escaped convict from his description in the newspapers, as well as a telltale tattoo on his wrist. Rather than turn Scott into the police, he offers him the chance to take part in his experiments. Knowing the odds are stacked against him, Scott accepts his offer. Scott is introduced to Grace the following morning, along with the two other patients: Danny Green (Arthur Batanides), who is being treated for anger issues, and pretty young Natalie Andries (Sally Todd), whose treatment schedule for a nervous breakdown is nearing completion. After demanding Wright to make out a certificate of death for Harry Jedrow, Conway happily informs Natalie that one last treatment for her is all that's necessary. While the other patients sleep, Natalie is sedated, taken to the operating room, and given an artificial gland along with a high dosage of electricity. The procedure backfires, and she ends up a senile old woman. They hide her in a back room. Lobo is ordered to bury Jedrow alive, but Frank Scott sneaks out to the burial site and opens the coffin. Jedrow rises out of it and escapes, and Lobo - not having been alerted - buries the casket. Sharon confronts Conway about his apparent affinity for Grace, and requests that she be made the next patient to be experimented upon. Meanwhile, Scott begins attempting to reveal to the other patients that Dr. Conway is carrying out horrific deeds to their friends. After a failed attempt to reveal Natalie's fate, he manages to show Grace and Danny what had happened to her, only to get caught by Dr. Conway and Sharon. They detain Scott and Danny and prepare Grace for surgery. Danny helps Scott escape by distracting Lobo, who fatally shoots him before being knocked unconscious. Scott confronts Dr. Conway with Lobo's gun and reveals that he is not a convicted murderer; he is actually Lt. Mark Houston, an undercover police officer sent to the psychiatrist's business to investigate it. Dr. Conway evades arrest, but is murdered by Jedrow. Lobo comes in and kills Jedrow, but Chambers' police backup arrive soon afterward and arrest Lobo and Sharon, barely saving Grace from the procedure. The police go downstairs and find Danny's body, and then discover a menagerie of beastly men, all failed subjects of Conway's longevity experiments. The police captain wonders, \"Good Lord - what if they DO live forever?\""

Peters.\" Originally called The House of Monsters, it was filmed over approximately five days. The film was acquired by American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres Pictures after principal photography had been completed. While the film credits Jane Mann with the original story, her co-screenwriter John D.F. Black (credited as Geoffrey Dennis) reports that she merely typed the script. Tor Johnson appears as Dr. Conway's minion \"Lobo\", a role similar to his character of the same name in Ed Wood's Bride of the Monster (1955). Johnson also played Lobo in Night of the Ghouls, a pseudo-sequel to Bride; it was shot in 1957 and released nearly thirty years later. Of note, the production designer was Charles D. Hall, credited here as Daniel Hall. This was his second to last feature. Hall was the acclaimed art director of Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), The Black Cat (1934), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), and One Million B.C. (1940). In many of his later productions, Hall used found objects and locations. These were both simple and economical. Here he uses found props in addition to simple designs for the operating room and the creature holding cell, where the monsters toil at a turret, reminiscent of Island of Lost Souls (1932), intended as a brief tribute to the horror genre greats. Character actor Richard Reeves appears here, uncredited, as one of the toiling creatures. The film has an exceptional music score by Henry Vars (1902-1972), one of the best created for an independent, low-budget horror film."

Don't you join them.\" Nevertheless the movie has its fans. They see the film's humor, especially its manic, selfish devotion to science, with a complete lack of caring toward its victims. While most mad doctor stories center on the cause of a single character, here there is a secret cabal of scientists who support Dr. Conway's experiments. They are unquestioningly loyal, especially Drs. Wright and Gilchrist, who is not only an admirer but is in love with him. They know the experiments are illegal but wholeheartedly support the cause, even to the extent of creating a clinic to help society's weakest and most vulnerable, a psychiatric halfway home, in which they lure their victims. Two of the guests, Allison Hayes and Sally Todd, are strikingly beautiful. When Todd's experiment goes wrong, it leaves her a drooling burn victim. Conway is disappointed only in the loss of an experiment. Gilchrist is more disappointed about Dr. Conway's loss of self-esteem.  Neither has even the slightest caring about this woman who has placed all her trust and faith in them. Much of the paradoxical humor can be credited to John D. F. Black, here in his first filmed script. Black later rose to fame as an associate producer on ten of Star Trek's first season shows, and was a highly successful writer both in comedy and drama on television.  One of the film's fans was Woody Allen, who sends the movie and John Carradine up in Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)  (1972) .  In this film Carradine portrays Dr. Bernardo, continuing the same Dr. Conway madness. This time he's an ex- Masters and Johnson scientist - wanting to see what happens when \"a man from the telephone company makes love to a large rye bread\". Jordan Peele sends the movie up in Get Out (2017) . In the operation sequence, Peele uses the same unholy reverence for science in the film's wacky brain transplant. Here, not only the doctor is mad but he has a society of white followers who use black people as a source of eternal youth and sexual prowess. The group sees nothing of trapping and kidnapping their victims, whose \"purpose\" in life is \"of course\", to benefit the new society."

A 1907 earthquake caused the city to sink beneath the waves.

Before arriving on the island, thugs local to the area plan to steal all the gold when Port Royal becomes visible. They attack Tony, leaving him hospitalized and steal his research material in their quest to find the rumored pirate's gold. Tony escapes the hospital, and arranges passage to the island. He is forced to take Joan with him, and she is disgruntled having been forced to accompany an exhibition whose theory she finds unlikely. The ruins are now visible as predicted and the criminals obtain the treasure. The two groups happen to meet and are suddenly attacked by giant crabs.

The make-up effects were created by Jack Pierce, known for his Universal Pictures' classic monster makeup for Boris Karloff's Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), and Lon Chaney Jr.'s The Wolf Man (1941). Baer, who played Vargas the Giant in this film, also played a giant in Jack and the Beanstalk (1952), starring Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. The film was shot in the San Bernardino National Forest. Giant from the Unknown was featured in 1996's late night TV show, \"Nightmare Theater's Chill-O-Rama Horror Show\"."

        "content": "The citizens of mountain town Pine Ridge, California, are concerned about a series of livestock mutilations in nearby Devil's Crag. A local, Harold Banks, is also found dead there, killed in the same manner as the livestock. Sheriff Parker orders everyone to stay away. Local speculation is that the deaths are supernatural in origin. Native American, \"Indian Joe\", confirms their fears of a tribal curse, but is driven out of town by the sheriff. Local geologist Wayne Brooks is told of Banks' death by friends Anne and Charlie Brown, two Pine Ridge siblings. Sheriff Parker is suspicious of Brooks, having heard about a recent confrontation between Brooks and Banks. As the sheriff is questioning him, Dr. Cleveland and his daughter Janet arrive in town. Cleveland is planning to do archaeological research in the area. While Brooks helps Janet pick up supplies, Parker warns Cleveland about the Banks murder. While at dinner with Cleveland and Janet, Brooks, formerly Cleveland's student, offers to be his area guide. Brooks tells Cleveland of a local Native American legend that evil spirits will rise up in Devil's Crag. He also says that Native American artifacts have been found there and that he has them. Dr. Cleveland reveals that he is searching for the remains of a Spanish expedition that he believes reached Devil's Crag 500 years earlier. The specific group Cleveland is tracing, known as the \"Diablo Brigade\", split off from the main expedition and was led by a huge man named Vargas, also known as the \"Diablo Giant\". After dinner, Janet agrees to go on a date with Brooks after he takes Cleveland to his field laboratory. At the laboratory, Cleveland is examining Brooks' artifacts when Janet opens a box with a small lizard inside. Brooks found it inside a rock, where it had been in a state of suspended animation for a long time. Cleveland continues examining it and the artifacts, as Indian Joe peers through a window, watching closely. When Brooks and Janet return, Cleveland excitedly calls them inside. He pieced together broken fragments into a cross and now theorizes that the Conquistadors influenced the locals hundreds of years before. The next morning all three go to Devil's Crag, and Sheriff Parker follows them in his police car. Parker pulls up and chastises Brooks for leaving town because he knows that Devil's Crag is off limits. Cleveland produces a permit from the Commissioner of Public Lands that allows him to conduct his research. Cleveland assures Parker that they are armed and can defend themselves. Unconvinced, Sheriff Parker leaves, and the small group sets up camp. The next day, while Brooks is examining the area, Indian Joe fires his rifle in Brooks' direction. Joe tells him that he is just hunting rabbits, but pointedly asks if they are there to rob Native American graves. Brooks assures him that they are only after Spanish artifacts, so Joe agrees to hunt elsewhere, warning Brooks that the place is evil. Brooks returns to camp and informs Cleveland that the area is changed. He theorizes that a recent electrical storm disturbed the whole area. They begin using their metal detectors to search but without success. Janet encourages Cleveland to give up, and he agrees to stop. She uses one of the detectors and by chance detects something. The spot is excavated and a cache of Spanish artifacts, armor, weapons, and bones are found. Brooks finds a rock formation similar to the one in which the lizard was entombed and discovers the handle of a massive, still intact axe he believes belonged to the \"Diablo Giant\". Brooks is forced to leave because of a large electrical storm, just before the \"Diablo Giant\" Vargas rises from the site's detritus. The next day, the group finds a large indentation in the ground and giant-sized armor and other artifacts. They discuss the possibility that like the lizard Vargas has been in a state of suspended animation and is still alive. Later that night, the body of the 500-year-old Vargas, revived by a lightning strike, stalks the group and eventually kills Anne Brown. Sheriff Parker accuses and arrests Brooks for Anne's murder because a medallion (one of his excavated artifacts) was found clenched in her hand. It is later revealed that the giant Vargas is roaming the wilderness after causing another brutal death. Local men from Pine Ridge help the sheriff hunt down the giant, who is causing more damage and deaths. Brooks is eventually able to kill Vargas, forcing him to fall to a watery death from a bridge spanning a raging waterfall."

It was produced by Associated Talking Pictures. It is also known as Call a Cop. The film features the songs, \"I'm the Ukulele Man\", \"On the Beat\", \"I Wish I Was Back on the Farm\" and \"I'm Shy\". Beryl Reid makes her film debut in an uncredited role, while Ronald Shiner appears similarly uncredited, in the role of the Piano Mover and Tuner. Working on the film as associate producer and writer, this production was an early assignment for director Basil Dearden: \"it was relatively easy to fit the Formby films into the new demands thrown up by the war: whereas George had typically had to overcome rogues and villains in his 1930s films, these were now simply replaced by spies and saboteurs\". The film title is a pun, using the colloquial term \"copper\" meaning a policeman, with the longer phrase \"spare a copper\" used by beggars - meaning can you spare a penny (which I might have)."

George Perry wrote in \"Forever Ealing\", \"the notion of unsuspected German spies in respectable positions was to recur in more serious Ealing films such as The Foreman Went to France and Went the Day Well?

        "content": "The film's working title was 365 Days. Mikhail Romm assembled a team of people with whom he had never previously worked before. Popular actors Yury Yakovlev and Alexey Batalov were hired for the main roles. Before the filming started, Yakovlev was hospitalized and had to be replaced with Innokenty Smoktunovsky. For the main female part a young and little-known actress Tatyana Lavrova of the Sovremennik Theatre was invited. The role of Lyolya was Tatiana\u2019s best known role in her film career, later she mainly devoted herself to the theater. The screenplay was written by Romm jointly with Khrabrovitsky. The cinematographer of the film was a newcomer German Lavrov. In many respects, the picture became a new word in the Soviet cinema. Experts have noted an unusual interpretation of the theme song and sound engineering - in fact there is almost no music, there is only a certain sound accompaniment of the technological sense. The sets of the film were also innovative. The filming took 6 months. The premiere was on 5 March 1962 at the Rossiya Theatre in Moscow. 7 actors participated in the film who were later awarded the title of People's Artist of the USSR: Batalov (1976), Smoktunovsky (1974), Plotnikov (1966), Blinnikov (1963), Gerdt (1990), Evstigneev (1983), Durov (1990). The director Mikhail Romm became the People's Artist of the USSR in 1950. Alexey Batalov witnessed that numerous dark parts which were conceived by the authors were removed from the film per censorship requirements. As a result, an episode was removed where Gusev visits his mother's grave, a possible indication that in the finale the disease leads to Gusev becoming blind."

Eugene Pavlovich Adamov, general of the royal army and professor at the Military Academy of Law, is arrested and placed in a kind of \"room\" which is arranged as a prisoner's cell. However, it does not only contain the king's soldiers, officials and aristocrats, but also ordinary criminals. Every day prisoners who are shaking from fear are being taken away for \"trial\" from the horrible room. And the verdict is almost always the same \u2013 execution by the firing squad. Adamov has no illusions as he quietly waits for death, but suddenly a miracle happens: he is freed. Being an honest and principled man, Adamov in 1905 refused to bring charges against two sailors, who had disobeyed their captain's criminal orders. Now the new government considered this sufficient grounds for release of the old tsarist general. However, Adamov has no place to go: his apartment with numerous rooms has been given to other people a long time ago, and the general has to go back to the place of his recent confinement where he finds a job as a launderer. Some time later Adamov is offered a job as an investigator and he begins to serve the new government. However, as he investigates the murders of the military confiscation unit (\"prodotryad\") members, the general is faced with an attempt of lawlessness on the part of the \"reds\" and resolutely tries to prevent this. Alas, no one listens to Adamov, innocent people are shot without trial, and the general himself falls into the hands of the \"whites\". Adamov tries to explain to the officer of the detachment his reasons for him going over to the Bolshevik side, but he sees only a traitor in Adamov, and he orders the old law professor to be shot."

        "content": "The Reenactment (), also known as Reconstruction, is a 1968 black-and-white film by Romanian director Lucian Pintilie. It is based on a novel by Horia P\u0103tra\u015fcu, which in turn reflects real-life events witnessed by the author. Produced under the communist regime, which it indirectly criticizes, it is a tragicomedy about incompetence, indifference and misuse of power. Structured as a film within a film and largely shot as a mockumentary, The Reenactment stars George Constantin as a prosecutor who keeps in custody two minor delinquents, Vuic\u0103 and Nicu, played respectively by George Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103 and Vladimir G\u0103itan. He makes them reenact their drunken brawl at a restaurant, and is helped in this effort by the militiaman Dumitrescu (played by Ernest Maftei) and a film crew. Two bystanders watch upon the youngsters' degradation at the hands of the prosecutor. They are The Miss (Domni\u015foara in the original), played by Ileana Popovici, who is amused by the succession of events, and the pedantic alcoholic Paveliu (Emil Botta). The recipient of much critical acclaim and considered in retrospect one of the most notable contributions to Romanian cinema, The Reenactment was released at a time when the communist regime was in its liberalization phase, coinciding with the first decade of rule by Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu. Nevertheless, its political implications irritated communist officials, and the censorship apparatus decided to withdraw the film from cinemas only months after its premiere. In 1969, Pintilie was pressured to work outside Romania, and focused mainly on stage production for the following twenty years of his career. The Reenactment was again screened at home in 1990, one year after the Romanian Revolution toppled communism."

        "content": "Both Horia P\u0103tra\u015fcu's novel and the screenplay (co-authored by P\u0103tra\u015fcu and Pintilie) are closely based on real-life events. The incident was witnessed by P\u0103tra\u015fcu during the early 1960s, and took place in his native town of Caransebe\u015f, shortly before a celebration of August 23 (Communist Romania's national holiday, commemorating the 1944 coup). The militiamen involved had detained two youths with no prior criminal record, accusing them of having been drunk and disorderly, and had decided to make them reenact the scene in order to educate the public about the perils of alcohol. In a 1999 interview, P\u0103tra\u015fcu acknowledges that, as a university student and part-time activist at a local culture house, he was a member of the original crew. Like in the film, the militiamen's decision seems to have outweighed the punishment proscribed for such offences: they made the youths film the same scene over and over, and, in the process, exposed them to public humiliation. P\u0103tra\u015fcu, who credits German writer Erich Maria Remarque and his All Quiet on the Western Front with having inspired his narrative, states: \"At the actual, filmed reenactment I for one had a terrible shock. They were children, they were just children. The police made them do what they had previously done. But that was a beach, a pool, there were girlies wearing bathing suits, some of them were connected with those girlies, and the [militiamen] were making them do what they had done when they were drunk, which was absurd, which made me shiver.\" In both story and film, Vuic\u0103 dies after his friend, pressured by the authorities into making the reenactment look more authentic, hits him over the head with a stone. There was a significant gap between the story's publishing and the start of production. Filmmaker Mircea S\u0103ucan recalls repeatedly urging P\u0103tra\u015fcu to turn his text into a screenplay. Before Pintilie took up the project, Horia P\u0103tra\u015fcu says, he was approached by two other directors. The first was Radu Gabrea, who abandoned it once he decided to resettle in West Germany; the second was Liviu Ciulei, who disagreed with the writer over the plot's tragic outcome, and eventually ended talks. Also according to P\u0103tra\u015fcu, Pintilie was enthusiastic about making the film, and anxiously approached the author just as he was taking his final exams. George Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103, Vladimir G\u0103itan and Ileana Popovici were debuting actors in their early twenties. As Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103 recalls, he and G\u0103itan were cast after a brief interview with Pintilie. Poet and actor Emil Botta was fifty-seven at the time, while George Constantin was thirty-five and Ernest Maftei forty-eight. Despite the marked age difference, Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103 remembers, the communication on the set was smooth and the atmosphere playful. The film was shot on location in the Southern Carpathian resort of Sinaia, but preserves some elements from the intended setting, including the restaurant's name of Pesc\u0103ru\u015f (\"Seagull\"), which had been borrowed from its Caransebe\u015f model."

        "content": "In addition to its factual content, The Reenactment stands as a metaphor for the people's inability to control their own destinies under the grip of a totalitarian regime, and, through its cultural implications, is also seen as a retrospective condemnation of Socialist realism and its didacticism (see Socialist realism in Romania). To a certain degree, Pintilie's film also criticizes the indifference with which such persecution is received by the public. A recurring motif in the film is the background noise of crowds rooting for their squad during a soccer match, in what the director explains is a satirical allusion to the Greek choir's role in cheering the performers, in this case transfigured by \"human dumbness\". In 2004, Lucian Pintilie wrote that his decision to shoot the film was also motivated by his disgust in respect to the invasive practices of communist authorities, having previously been informed that one of his friends, a closeted gay actor, was denounced for breaking Romania's sodomy law, and, in order to avoid the prison sentence, was forced to have intercourse with his wife while investigators watched. Pintilie also stated his objection to the very notion of an inquiry, noting that such a procedure \"is the most effective way of veiling reality\", and indicated that the film was in part an allusion to the tradition of torture and repeated interrogation, enforced by the Securitate secret police in the previous decade. George Constantin's character was thus supposed to be a Securitate officer, but, Pintilie claims, the institution was scandalized by the possibility of an exploration into its past, and appealed to Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu personally to prevent this from happening; as a consequence, Pintilie turned the protagonist into a prosecutor. Although the reference to Militia practices was the result of such pressures, it became one of the most valued attributes of the film. The portrayal of militiamen as brutal and irresponsible contrasted with their sympathetic portrayal in films approved of by the Ceau\u015fescu regime, and especially with the post-1970 series Brigada Diverse. In a 2007 article for G\u00e2ndul, journalist Cristian Tudor Popescu writes that, by exposing the torment which could be caused even by routine Militia interventions, The Reenactment \"had discarded the urban legend of 'militiamen so stupid that they make one laugh with tears when seeing how stupid they are'.\" \"Harshness\" was identified by Mircea S\u0103ucan as a main characteristic of the film. Stressing that he does not find this trait to be a defect, he states that, had he directed the film, he would have insisted more on the \"cold\" aspect of the inquiry, to stand in contrast with the melodrama-like aspect of some scenes. Commenting on such traits, Cristian Tudor Popescu wrote: \"37 years ago, a prosecutor and two militiamen were organizing, on the terrace of an isolated pub, the reenactment of a brawl between two guys. Under the eye of Lucian Pintilie, the tremendous actor George Constantin, together with George Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103, Vladimir G\u0103itan and Ernest Maftei, were reconstructing [...], starting from a beer mug crashing into a head, the whole monstrous skeleton of the kitschy evil on which Romanian communist authorities were relying.\" In 1965, Pintilie had directed the film Duminic\u0103 la ora \u015fase, which dealt in part with similar themes, but, as the director indicates, only hinted in that direction. It was showcased and acclaimed at the Pesaro Film Festival in Italy. He recalls: \"The film's prologue clearly placed the plot in the years of [Romanian] socialism. [...] Who are the youths from the film's prologue? I was asked directly by the audience [...] Aren't today's youths these youths in the film? No, I shamelessly lied, for there was clearly a possibility for prevarication, no, I said in order to be able to return to Romania and make The Reenactment.\" George Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103 recounts not realizing at first the importance of his role: \"The best proof of [our] sublime unawareness was that, when shooting was over, I asked Pintilie\u2014joking more or less\u2014when he was going to give me a more important part to play... He smiled and said just this: 'Wait and see the movie!' \""

        "content": "The Reenactment 's release coincided with the peak of liberalization policies in Romania, and with a moment when Ceau\u015fescu appeared to be pursuing an independent path within the Eastern Bloc. However, the film caused consternation among communist officials. P\u0103tra\u015fcu recalls that the film was only shown sporadically as the censorship apparatus was deciding its fate: it premiered at the Luceaf\u0103rul Cinema in Bucharest, where \"the projectionist was driven out of his mind\" because it ran as the main feature for two months on end. Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103 recalls: \"the film's presentation was stripped of all ceremony. Better put, the film was introduced through 'the back door' at Luceaf\u0103rul... It stood there, without any comments, for about a month, before being withdrawn as discreetly as it had appeared.\" The Reenactment was also shown in Timi\u0219oara, but, P\u0103tra\u015fcu indicates, no program or promotional material given approval for publishing; it was only shown with discretion in several other main cities, \"until people had heard about it\", then withdrawn. The writer also remembers being \"glad\" upon learning that the film managed to raise public awareness, and that it incited viewers to engage in rioting against Militia forces. Early in 1969, the authorities took the decision to withdraw the film from cinemas, a ban which lasted until the regime came to an end two decades later. According to George Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103: \"It's worth knowing that, upon viewing, some comrade [that is, communist official]\u2014it no longer matters what his name was!\u2014said 'this film ought to be stored in a room and someone should swallow the key'...!\" It was as a result of the scandal that communist officials began investigating Romanian cinema in general, and intervened to stop filming on Pragul albastru, which was based on a screenplay by Ion Dezideriu S\u00eerbu, a former political prisoner who was undergoing rehabilitation. Pintilie's Securitate file, made available for the public in the 2000s (decade), contains lengthy and minute reports on the film, and documents the negative reaction of official critics (quoted saying that the film is \"mediocre\" or \"mean\"), but also the appreciation from the part of more rebellious intellectuals. For instance, it describes how, moments after having seen the film in Bucharest, the avant-garde author and former communist Geo Bogza scribbled in the snow set on the director's car the words: \"Long live Pintilie! The humble Geo Bogza.\" In May 1970, the Cannes Film Festival offered to show The Reenactment during its Une Quinzaine des R\u00e9alisateurs event. As Pintilie notes, the invitation was intercepted by the Securitate and never reached him. In a fragment of his 1970 diary, published in 2003, he reflected his frustration over this issue, comparing the censorship apparatus with the bureaucrats sarcastically depicted in the works of 19th century writer Nikolai Gogol: \"the Gogolian clerks have decided to strike me out of Romanian cinema for good. For as long as I am alive, they have not won their bet.\" The same year however, he was able to return to the Pesaro Film Festival, where he was celebrated with a retrospective and a special trophy. Pintilie confesses that the ceremony failed to impress him at the time, due to his feelings of dissatisfaction and his determination to continue filming in Romania. Such events were also organized in other cities, among them London and Bologna, but Pintilie refused to attend them. Another clash between Pintilie and the communist system occurred in 1972, when he satirized officials by staging a subversive version of Gogol's The Government Inspector, which was suspended soon after its premiere. In an interview with The New York Times, he records a meeting he had with the censors: \"I was told, 'If you want to continue working here, you have to change your conception of the world.' I answered, 'But I've just started formulating it. [...] All I can do is develop it.' \" During the following period, Pintilie only worked sporadically in Romania and was pressured to seek employment abroad (notably, in the United States, where he served as artistic director for Minneapolis' Guthrie Theater and Washington, D. C.'s Arena Stage). His only other film released at home before 1989, the 1981 De ce trag clopotele, Mitic\u0103?, was loosely based on stories by Ion Luca Caragiale. Noted for subtly criticizing the Ceau\u015fescu regime at a time when it had return to a hard-line stance (see July Theses), it was itself censored by the officials. Film critic Doinel Tronaru argues that both productions are equally accomplished. P\u0103tra\u015fcu, dissatisfied by the new restrictive guidelines, avoided contributing screenplays, and instead focused on cultural activities with Adrian P\u0103unescu's Cenaclul Flac\u0103ra, whose shows still maintained a degree of artistic independence."

        "content": "Pintilie made his comeback in Romania only after the Romanian Revolution, and served as head of the Ministry of Culture's Cinema Creation Studio. He resumed film directing and producing, with titles such as Balan\u0163a, An Unforgettable Summer, Lumi\u00e8re and Company, and the 1996 Too Late (nominated for Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival, the same year). Many of them revisit Romania's communist past, and, in his later production Dup\u0103-amiaza unui tor\u0163ionar, he focuses on a more obvious treatment of the Securitate and its repression tactics. After being again made available for public viewing, The Reenactment again was the subject of critical interest. It was recovered together with similarly censored films by Radu Gabrea (Beyond the Sands) and Dan Pi\u0163a (The Contest). It was likened to Mircea S\u0103ucan's 1973 production 100 de lei, and, alongside Pintilie's other films, is credited with having inspired the post-Revolution \"Romanian New Wave\". Cristian Tudor Popescu also argued that the invasive techniques which stand at the center of the film have a continued presence in post-1989 Romanian society. He proposes that they are similar to a sensationalist trend in Romanian television, which sees stations competing for ratings by closely following cases of suicide and murder. At the Berlin International Film Festival 2002 edition, it was shown as part of a retrospective on 1960s cinema, alongside films such as Lindsay Anderson's if...., John Schlesinger's Billy Liar, Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence and Jean-Pierre Mocky's Solo. In 2007, Romanian-born historian Irina Livezeanu and the Romanian Cultural Institute organized the festival Romanian Cinema on the Edge. The Reenactment was the only pre-1989 film to be aired alongside works by \"New Wave\" directors: Corneliu Porumboiu (12:08 East of Bucharest), Radu Muntean (The Paper Will Be Blue), Cristian Mungiu (Occident), Cristi Puiu (Stuff and Dough) and Cristian Nemescu (California Dreamin'). In January 2008, the copy kept by the Romanian National Gallery was presented at the Palm Springs Festival's Archival Treasures Program, being introduced by Chicago Public Radio's Milos Stehlik. Alongside other major Romanian productions, it was shown as part of two Romanian film festivals in Canada: at Montreal (May 2007) and Toronto (February 2008)."

To prevent this, he leaves detailed instructions to the family and his staff, but when he is found, his greedy family\u2014eager to claim their inheritance\u2014have him quickly interred. Rufus leaves specific instructions on how to be buried, which are violated and the family lawyer, while reading the will, lets them know they will die from what they fear most: Bruce will have his face disfigured; the widow Abigail will die by fire; asthmatic and alcoholic son Philip will suffocate; Philip's frustrated wife Vivian will drown; faithful manservant Seth will \"join me in my tomb\"; and all-around-nice-guy nephew James will lose that which is most dear to him, his pretty wife Deborah. Abigail reveals she left a diamond brooch on Rufus's coffin, Bruce, needing the money, and family maid and lover Lettie recover it, though Bruce is perturbed to find it on the floor. He leaves Lettie at the crypt against her wishes, saying they need to return separately\u2014and she is beheaded by a masked killer\u2014seemingly Rufus returned from the grave. He leaves the head to be discovered by Bruce and others on a dinner tray. Bruce vows to stop Rufus while forcing Vivian to help him. Bruce is maimed in the face by the masked killer\u2014who then drags him to his death behind a horse. Vivian reveals that Lettie was murdered; Seth tells the remaining family members that Bruce's corpse is at the stable. Phillip finds Abigail's diamond pin on Bruce's body, and Abigail runs away in tears. The family lawyer sends Robert into town for the police. Phillip is named the new family patriarch and vows to do his best. Abigail says she's glad Rufus is alive so he can pay for the two murders. Seth feels he's in the clear, until Phillip reminds Seth that he violated the terms of the will and is \"one of them now.\" The police arrive, and Phillip informs him that the family believes Rufus was buried alive. The lawyer agrees and says that Rufus will now be totally insane. Phillip and the rest of the family give the police Rufus's description, and the police vow to find him. After Abigail has a panic attack, Phillip stays with her on her request, but then ducks out to get a drink, which he shares with one of the policemen. They get drunk, and Phillip tells him that Abigail has a morbid fear of fire. The masked figure later enters Abigail's room, chloroforms her, binds her to the bed\u2014and sets her aflame. The family is unable to save her. The men then search with dogs, leaving Vivian and Deborah at the house. Seth enters the crypt, apologizing for failing in his task of lighting the torches. He attempts to do so, and is murdered when the figure pulls a sword from the cane, fulfilling the will's threat he would die in the crypt. Deborah convinces Vivian that they should dress up for Phillip and Robert. Phillip and Robert wander from the search party and Robert finds Seth's corpse. The masked killer knocks out the policeman on guard and then strangles Vivian while she's bathing. Deborah walks in, and the masked killer drags her away to the bog. Robert chases after them. The killer is revealed to be Phillip, upset with his treatment by his father and the rest of the family, the forgotten child. Phillip says he did not wish to kill her, but must now. Robert arrives and the two fight. Robert gains the upper hand, and Phillip sinks into the bog\u2014dying as the will foretold. Robert and Deborah leave happily. The two policemen decide to share Phillip's remaining booze, while lamenting over his ability to commit all the murders. They discover that the alcohol was merely tea, and that Phillip was not an alcoholic at all, just playing one so he could get away with the crimes."

        "content": "Reportedly the film was based on a script called The Unseen by Tom Filer. Roger Corman was attracted to the project because in the original draft of the script, no monster was seen, which meant the film could be done cheaply. Executive producer Arkoff insisted on a visible monster and space ship, but there was very little in the budget to realize these effects. Corman's original idea was an alien that was incapable of being seen. In April 1955 it was announced in Variety the film would be the first for Pacemaker Productions, a new company formed by Roger Corman. By that stage the film had been renamed The Beast with a Million Eyes. It would be produced and directed by David Kamarsky, Corman's former aide, while Corman would executive produce. Corman was meant to direct Cobra in India instead, but that film was never made. Paul Birch's casting was announced in April 1955. The Beast with a Million Eyes was the third of a three-picture deal Roger Corman had with the American Releasing Company following The Fast and the Furious (1955) and Five Guns West (1955). Reportedly, cost over-runs on Five Guns West meant only $29,000 remained to make the film for Pacemaker Productions. The title, Beast with a Million Eyes, reportedly came from American Releasing Company president James H. Nicholson. His title and treatment had film exhibitors signed on before seeing the finished film. The million eyes of the title refers to the alien's ability to see through the eyes of the animals and people it controls. Reportedly, The Beast with a Million Eyes was a non-union filming of a script originally titled The Unseen, with Lou Place set to direct. After one day's filming, the union threatened to shut down the production unless everyone signed with the Guild. Roger Corman, who was producing, took over the film's directing chores and replaced the cinematographer with Floyd Crosby; Corman took no official screen credit.  However, another version of this story has Corman allocating directing duties to Dave Kramarsky, his associate director on Five Guns West. Filming took place in Indio and the Coachella Valley, California. Corman shot 48 pages of interiors in just two days at a studio on La Cienega Blvd. in Los Angeles. The movie is also noteworthy for its promotional poster. It features an eye-catching monster different from that seen in the movie."

Paul Blaisdell, responsible for the film's special effects, was hired to create a three-foot-tall spaceship (with \"beast\" alien) for a meager $200. Notably, the Art Director was Albert S. Ruddy, who would later win two \"Best Picture\" Academy Awards for The Godfather (1972) and Million Dollar Baby (2004). It was Blaisdell's first monster made for the movies. He later said: The creature seen in  the last reel\u00a0... was actually the slave of The Beast, which had no physical being. It used a being from another star system to pilot its ship, but that fact doesn't come across very well in the script. The creature was an automaton and he was quite capable of doing a lot more than he was allowed to do in the film. He was about eighteen inches high\u00a0\u2014 built to the same scale as King Kong. Unfortunately, all of his scenes were shot in about ten minutes, with the wrong camera angles and everything. But it's just one of those  things which happens on a low-budget picture. According to Alex Gordon, when the film was first shown, Joseph E. Levine, then a distributor, offered Nicholson $100,000 to junk the movie and make a new one more in line with the advertising campaign. Gordon says James Nicholson spent two weeks analyzing the film and scratching over the negative to make it seem like lightning strikes to add to the dramatic qualities of the film."

The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction found the movie to be minimal and the effects unconvincing, but noted this was one of, if not the first, movie to feature animals attacking humans, predating The Birds. TV Guide called the movie a turkey. Moria gave the movie 2.5 stars, liking the idea and the setting, however the animal attacks are not viewed as scary and the direction was seen as pedestrian. It did however also note the similarities with Hitchcock's movie The Birds."

The privates are assigned to a scouting mission that requires the inspection of a newly discovered cavern that was located near the base.  Philbrick and Penn are part of an expeditionary squad, but become separated from their fellow soldiers. The privates are attacked by seven-foot-tall vegetable-like creatures that take them into the cavern, which is actually an alien base commanded by two statuesque women from the planet Kalar. The alien women, Dr. Puna and Professor Tanga, reveal that they arrived on Earth with the goal of conquering the planet. Philbrick and Penn find that their fellow soldiers have been placed in suspended animation by the aliens. Philbrick eventually discovers that kissing Puna leaves her temporarily powerless, allowing him and Penn to escape from the cavern and its inhabitants. After an encounter with an American Indian band, the two soldiers race back to their base to rally a defense of the Earth against the Kalar aliens. They succeed in saving the Earth by prematurely launching the alien spaceship, but are captured by the aliens. However, Puna convinces Tanga not to kill them as they have no way of returning home now and they need to rely on the two soldiers. Tanga accepts this, kisses Penn and the sparks fly. At the end of the film, the soldiers receive medals for their actions and they drive away with the aliens, now their wives."

        "content": "The tarpan became extinct in the wild in 1879, due to hunting, and in 1909 the last captive horse died in Russia. The Heck horse was created by the German zoologist brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck, director of the Berlin Zoo, at the Tierpark Hellabrunn (Munich Zoo) in Germany in their attempt to breed back the tarpan. The Hecks believed they could recreate the extinct tarpan subspecies by back breeding living descendants. They believed they could combine and rearrange the genetic material from these living descendants into a recreation of the extinct horse. Other breeders had the same idea, and used different genetic stock to attempt to recreate the tarpan or a reasonable look-alike. One result was a line of horses bred from American Mustangs by breeder Harry Hegardt. The Heck brothers bred together several European small horse and pony breeds hypothesized to be descended from the tarpan. They eventually integrated mares of the Konik, Icelandic horse, and Gotland breeds. These mares were bred to stallions of a wild horse type known as Przewalski's horse. The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares. The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares (who, in the view of the Heck brothers, visually closely resembled the tarpan, especially in the shape of the head) and Przewalski's horse stallions (who provided the desired dun coloration and upright mane), and the offspring were then bred to each other. The first foal born from the program who had the desired coloration was a colt born on May 22, 1933 at the Tierpark Hellabrunn. The breeding program continued, using only those horses showing the desired skull shape, bone structure and coloration. Relatively quickly, the breed's conformation and coloration became set, with parents reliably passing their characteristics to their offspring. During World War II, horses of the desired type were taken from German-occupied countries to use in the Hecks' breeding program. Tadeusz Vetulani, a Polish biologist, had been working with Konik horses, at that point believed to be descended from tarpans, with the goal (like the Hecks) of recreating the tarpan. Some of the horses from his program had been reintroduced to the forests of Bia\u0142owie\u017ca, Poland. During the war, the Hecks removed the animals from the forest and used them in their own breeding programs. Vetulani considered this a \"baffling campaign of destruction\", and the Hecks' actions effectively ended his breeding program. Some of the resulting Heck horses were sent back to Bia\u0142owie\u017ca, to become part of a hunting preserve for Nazi government officials. The land, and the horses, were returned to Polish management after the war ended. As of 2007, a small herd of the horses remained, living with little interference from humans, in Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, Europe's last remaining area of primeval lowland forest. The Hecks had conducted a similar breeding program in hopes of recreating the aurochs, resulting in what would become Heck cattle."

A third mare was imported by the Fort Worth Zoological Park in Texas in 1962.  All four horses came from the Munich Zoo and in the early 1990s, all Heck horses in the United States traced back to these animals. Several private breeders in the United States now use these horses for riding and light driving. In the early 1960s, the North American Tarpan Association was founded by Heck horse enthusiasts to promote the breed. In 2002, there were fewer than 100 Heck horses in the United States, most of them having descended from the six foundation horses, all imported from Germany. As of 2013, a small number of Heck horses lived in a feral state in Latvia. Several breeders have crossed the Heck horse with other breeds to get a larger horse with some of the primitive characteristics. Breeds commonly crossed with the Heck horse are the Welsh pony and Arabian horse, and a new breed of pony, called the Canadian Rustic Pony, has been developed from these three breeds.  In Europe, many breeders cross Heck horses with Thoroughbreds to produce hunters."

One of the residents recognizes him as a \"town tamer\", a gun for hire who cleans up lawless communities. After 14 killings and 31 robberies in past year, followed by the (non-fatal) shooting of Jeff Castle (who does not like Tollinger's methods) and the unwillingness of the town marshal to oppose powerful rancher Dade Holman and his gang, the town council reluctantly hires Tollinger for $500. Tollinger has the marshal deputize him, then insists on doing things his way without interference. Tollinger begins by warning the Harkness brothers, who are known Holman gunmen, to leave town. He goes on to disarm a leading citizen, \"Frenchy\" Lescaux, the manager of the saloon which is owned by the corrupt rancher, making it clear that nobody will be allowed weapons inside town limits. The Harkness brothers, still in town, are then both shot dead by Tollinger. Four men ride in looking for Tollinger. He gets the drop on them with a shotgun and orders them to drop the guns in their hands, which they do. When Tollinger puts down his shotgun, one outlaw reaches for a holstered pistol, only to discover that the town tamer is faster on the draw. Reedy (an uncredited Claude Akins), their leader, takes off his hat - inside of which there is a gun. While trading small talk with Tollinger, Reedy reaches for the weapon, but Tollinger recognizes the ruse and shoots him dead. At a social event, one of the town women advises Tollinger that his job will not be finished until the dance hall girls also leave town. Unaware that he personally knows Nelly - the girls' madam -  the woman is openly critical about the dancing and carrying on. When Tollinger warns Nelly about the new curfew he is instituting, she tells him she and the girls will be moving on further west and asks him for the name of any town where he will not be. Two men ride into town to tell Tollinger that they have detained Castle for trespassing on Holman's property; they suggest the young man can be picked up at the ranch. Instead, Tollinger arrests the two for carrying guns in town and, after some tense hours of waiting, an exchange for Castle is made. It is eventually revealed that Nelly is Tollinger's wife, but she left him because she could not bear being married to a gunfighter. He only wants to know how their daughter Beth is doing. Jealous of the growing attraction of Stella Atkins, Jeff's girlfriend, to Tollinger, Nelly finally tells him that Beth is dead. Tollinger takes it badly. His patience and steadfast demeanor suddenly gone, he burns down Holman's saloon, killing Lescaux when he tries to knife him in the back. Holman's lawyer, Zender, who has been in town a few days watching Tollinger, sets a trap. When, by chance, Nelly learns who Zender is, she tries to warn Tollinger. Holman rides into town - for the first time in years - in a surrey, to be in on the kill. Tollinger kills his would-be murderer, but is shot in the shoulder by Holman. Castle kills Holman. Tollinger tells Nelly he is getting out of the business, and the two kiss and reconcile."

Three years later, McKane was taking lands from their owners by intimidation and treachery. Words reach Judge Ward Young (Heydt) and his son Marshal Faron Young (Young). After a talk with Pardee (Van Cleef), they investigate with Diego (Colmans), a farmer and an old veteran with Sebastian, and then they investigate with McKane, and learn about a witness in the deal named Johnson (Lauter). Pardee tries to threaten Johnson to keep him from saying anything. Johnson tells Judge Young about the deal and agrees to testify in court. McKane's men ambush the lawmen and Johnson receives a dangerous wound, but tells them to look for Sebastian, who is still alive. They are overheard by Pardee, who goes to interrogate Diego and then kills him. McKane's men follow Marshal Young and watch him survive an attack from the Comanches. They try to kill him, but he manages to shoot them first. He mortally wounds Boyle and takes him to the town priest. Dying Boyle identifies the priest as Miguel Sebastian himself. Pardee arrives in town and inquires about Sebastian from a drunk named Pepe (Diamond). He tries to kill Sebastian, but is gunned down by Young. Upon this new finding, McKane is ordered to be in court. He sends his men to kill Sebastian, but he dodges them through underground passage. McKane plans a cattle stampede through town. In the trial, Sebastian testifies that he was forced to give his land to McKane under death threat, and that Johnson refused to sign as a witness because it was extortion and collaboration with the enemy, but he was forced to sign. Sebastian testifies that although he was permitted by McKane to then leave for Mexico, Pardee had tracked him and pushed him off a cliff, thinking he had left him for dead. Judge Young rules that the grant was illegal because McKane bargained with the enemy at war time, and that McKane will be sent to be court-martialed. The court is interrupted by the coming of the stampede, and McKane is caught in the stampede and killed, along with the sheriff. Father Sebastian agrees to give the lands to the farmers."

Produced during the Great Depression, the film's theme was intensely socialist, covering the poor living conditions of the workers and coal miners of Belgium's industrialised Borinage region. It is considered a classic work of political cinema and has been described as \"one of the most important references in the documentary genre\". Mis\u00e8re au Borinage was shot in black and white and is a silent film with intertitles in French and Dutch. It opens with a title card, bearing the slogan: \"Crisis in the Capitalist World. Factories are closed down, abandoned. Millions of proletarians are hungry!\" and shows footage of the repression of a 1933 strike in Ambridge, Pennsylvania in the United States. The film then shifts to the Borinage, an industrial region in Belgium's Hainaut Province, during and after the general strike of 1932. The majority of the film focuses on the plight of Borinage coal miners who have been evicted from their houses and made unemployed following their participation in the strike. It also shows the poor living conditions of the miners and their families. The film makes the argument that strike action could be justified by the poor conditions in which Belgian workers lived. The film was made against the context of the Great Depression and premiered in Brussels in March 1934. According to Robert Stallaerts, Storck's work as director of Mis\u00e8re au Borinage justified his status as \"father of Walloon cinema\" even though he was actually Flemish. In 2000, a new documentary was made about the Borinage as a tribute to Storck: \"Les Enfants du Borinage - Lettre \u00e0 Henri Storck\"."

Bernds says the script was written on \"spec\" by Daniel Mainwaring and George Worthing Yates. Bernard Glasser bought it and director Bernds rewrote the script without credit because the original was written for a feature film with a larger budget and a longer running time. Bernds said the film's total budget was $ 90,000. Glasser, however, recalled that Space Master X-7 was budgeted at $125,000, with $25,000 going to the screenwriters. The film was rushed into production to take advantage of the Explorer I satellite space launch. Regal's head of publicity, Marty Weiser, recommended they change the title from Missile into Space to the more exciting-sounding Space Master X-7. Harry Spalding, who was Robert L. Lippert's story editor, recalls the filmmakers went over budget but did a good job, so good they were hired for The Return of the Fly (1959). Moe Howard, who made a cameo appearance in the film in a notable departure from his slapstick performances, had worked previously with Bernds on his Three Stooges shorts and asked if the production crew had a position for his son-in-law Norman Maurer. Maurer would work as the film's production assistant received $1,000.00 for his efforts. In fact, Glasser was so impressed with Maurer's work that he recommended him to producer Sidney Pink for Pink's upcoming science fiction film, The Angry Red Planet (1959)."

Robert and Dora's mother (Jane Marken) rush to the hospital to which she has been taken.  Believing she is about to die, Dora spitefully asks her mother \u2013 a vulgar, tawdry and heavy-drinking woman \u2013 to put Robert in the picture regarding the true nature of the marriage, so that she can die gloating over his distress. As Dora is taken to the operating theatre, her mother takes vicious pleasure in informing Robert \u2013 who has been reflecting with sadness about happy times and the prospect of losing his wife \u2013 that the marriage has been a sham from the start.  Via a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Dora is a manipulative, conniving and amoral gold-digger.  Encouraged by her equally unprincipled mother, she set out to snare Robert purely for access to his finances in order that she (and her mother, to whom she has siphoned off significant amounts of money) could live a life of ease and outward respectability.  In fact she has always despised Robert, mocking his unsuspicious nature and gullibility while amusing herself with a string of lovers.  With the riding school business recently failing, Dora had decided that she had taken Robert for as much as she could, and had been planning to leave him for Fran\u00e7ois, a richer lover who could further her social-climbing ambitions. But Fran\u00e7ois goes away without warning, leaving Dora devastated. News comes through from the operating theatre that Dora will live, but is permanently paralysed.  Robert states his intention to abandon her to her fate, leaving the mother alone with the prospect of having to care for her disabled daughter in straitened financial circumstances."

A policeman (played by Hepworth himself) happens to be passing, takes out a telescope and looks up to the sky.  After a lapse of several seconds he has to dodge out of the way as torsos and severed limbs (but no heads) start to rain down around him.

The show was sponsored by the Ford Motor Company, whose founders shared a last name with the host but had no known relation. Beginning in September 1958, the show was telecast in color, and was broadcast from NBC Studios at 3000 W. Alameda Avenue in Burbank, California. Ford first gained attention as the host of Hometown Jamboree in Los Angeles. In 1954, he hosted a brief revival of Kay Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge, a quiz show on NBC. His subsequent The Ford Show was frequently among the Top 20 programs, finishing in the Nielsen ratings at #19 for the 1956\u20131957 season, #14 in 1957\u20131958, #20 in 1958\u20131959, #14 in 1959\u20131960 and #24 in 1960\u20131961.

        "content": "Despite the objection of studio bosses, Ford closed all but 18 of the 121 episodes of his program with a hymn or other spiritual song. It became one of the most popular segments of his show. In 1959, Gisele MacKenzie became the only guest star to close the Ford program with a hymn. Ford often used the country refrain, \"Bless your pea-pickin' hearts!\" In the first season, the choral group called \"The Voices of Walter Schumann\" served as backup. After Schumann's death, the group was made more contemporary, renamed \"The Top Twenty,\" and performed in the four later seasons of the show. On October 8, 1958, Ford introduced the 1959 Ford vehicle models on the program, with the singer/ actress Ann Blyth as his guest. On January 7, 1960, Ford had two big-name guests, Dean Martin and Jack Bailey, host of the Queen for a Day daytime series. In the skit Martin drops by as Ford and Bailey poke fun at Martin's Rat Pack friends. Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper was among the many guests on the program. On June 8, 1961, South African golfer Gary Player, then twenty-five, guest-starred in a comedy skit in which Player presumes to give Ford golfing lessons. On April 28, 1960, Ford presented one of his only five programs without guest stars at Drury College (since University), a Congregationalist institution in Springfield, Missouri. He sang his trademark \"Sixteen Tons\" and the hymn \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\". In his series finale, Ford had no guests. Therefore, singer Anita Bryant, and Joe Flynn, later Captain Binghamton on ABC's McHale's Navy, hold the distinction of having been the final guests on The Ford Show, in the episode which aired on June 22, 1961. On March 30, 1961, Flynn had also appeared on the show in a patriotic episode set at sea aboard the U.S.S. Yorktown."

Where there was wide sand and the sound of water lapping, there is now a truck, chairs, hoops, stools, ropes, goats, a lioness, a pair of fat girls, some bicycles, and an old man with a philosopher's dignity, putting on white paste. Across a dirt road, the circus truck comes to a village. The tent goes up. Schoolboys run to the tent. Village women come and watch an acrobat roll a hoop across a tightrope. A lion leaps from the edge of one stool - across darkness - on to another stool. A gap-toothed old woman gazes at a goat on a tight rope; her eyes are wide with curiosity. For three days the circus makes small ripples in the life of this village. Municipal permits are required. At a toddy shop, a soldier befriends the circus strongman; a pump attendant sits on a rock each day watching a village girl bathe and dry her hair. The dwarf brings back to the circus a watermelon larger than his head. In the film's three days, we, the viewers, learn the geography of the village: the banyan tree with leaves like transparent film, the shining water, the light on the sand at sunset. When the circus leaves the village, it leaves us. The narrative says: The circus comes and leaves; life goes on."

Coat colours are bay or seal brown. It is used mainly for trekking. It was recognised as a breed by the Haras Nationaux, the French association of horse breeders in December 2012. The standard is published by a breeders' association, the Association Nationale du Cheval de Race Auvergne. This breed has been crossbred several times throughout its history, with several distinct breeds sharing the name \"Auvergne horse\".  A small riding horse known as the \"half-blood of Auvergne\" was primarily ridden by the cavalry at the beginning of the 19th century, but has since disappeared.  Other work horses of Auvergne were used as a means of transportation before the advent of modern roads.  The work horse was crossbred to become a light draught horse and subsequent ancestor of the modern Auvergne horse.  It was used for varying field work by the inhabitants of the region. As with most of Europe's draught breeds, the Auvergne almost disappeared with the spread of mechanized transportation in the 1960s and 70s.  It was crossed with other draught horses, such as the Comtois horse, and was used as a source of horsemeat.  In 1994, an association was created to save the last remaining animals and to fight for the recognition of the breed in France.  Since then, several actions have been levied to promote the continued existence of the Auvergne horse.  However, the breed is still extremely rare outside of Auvergne.  200 were represented in a census at the beginning of the 21st century."

It stands at  at the withers and weighs between  with an average of about .  The head is very expressive, rather small, short with a square nose, nostrils well open, a straight or slightly concave muzzle, eyes bright and expressive and almond-shaped highlighted by prominent eyebrows, a broad forehead, short and mobile ears. Light heads are well-regarded. The neck is short and slightly round, generally arched, the shoulder rather straight and strong. The withers are quite prominent and tends to be noy\u00e9, the point of shoulder is open, the chest goes down and the flanks are rounded. The back is short, and wide, the loins short, powerful and well attached. The Croup is double, slightly tilted but not bent. The legs fine enough for a cavalry horse, but have short cannons, with slender hocks and often a little closed, ending with round feet well proportioned in relation to the weight of the horse. Leg feathering is normally abundant but sometimes there may be little. The mane is very thick, slightly wavy, and can be single or double, the tail is also very thick and rather long. The Aubergne horse has a coat of fine hair which can be bay in all possible variants, including Seal brown. Black points are well marked and can be traced high along the legs. Significant white markings, such as high stockings, are prohibited. This feature is one of the criteria for the recognition of these animals. The Association intends to maintain this and to reject all stallions with white markings for breeding. \"Fox nose\" coloration is highly regarded. The Auvergne horse is reputed to have good weight-carrying ability, docile and energetic, lively and generous, and sure-footed. It is a sociable horse, rustic, and multi-purpose. Evelyn Carpentier, breeder of these animals in La Ferme Equestre des Roches in Rochefort-Montagne, said that \"it has the character of Auvergne. It does what it wants, but it is very gentle...\". It costs little in production and breeding. According to Muriel Ronez, permanent association staff, \"the idea is not to make a sports horse but rather [a horse for] equestrian tourism, harness, and small agricultural work\"."

        "content": "As with other local draught horses, the use of the Auvergne horse has declined with the rise of mechanized travel. Defining the horse is difficult in the absence of recent scientific publications.  Documents mentioning the \"cheval d'Auvergne\" actually speak of many different breeds which have rarely, or never, been recognized as an independent breed throughout their history. No scientific studies exist concerning the origin of the Auvergne horse, but  there are several theories: According to the Association of the Auvergne Breed, the breed is the distant descendant of the oriental breeds abandoned by the Saracens on the plains of Vouill\u00e9 circa 732.  Their horses remained in the same area (the departments of Corr\u00e8ze, of Creuse, and of Haute-Vienne) until the barons of the country took possession of them.  The horses would presumably been the root of those which had spread over the course of the following centuries into all of Limousin, followed by Auvergne, to become the ancestors of the Limousin horse, a close relative of the Auvergne horse. According to L\u00e6titia Bataille, a specialist in equine management in France, the Auvergne horse was the product of the ancient Navarrin horse's crossbreeding with the Thoroughbred. According to the inhabitants of the Auvergne region, the breed is native to the region, and lived there \"depuis la nuit des temps\" (since the dawn of time).  According to their theory, it is descended from prehistoric animals who had simply wandered into the region. There seems to have been two types of Auvergne horses throughout the region's history: the smaller horse, or \"half-blood Auvergne horse\", was a riding horse destined for the light cavalry; the communal, \"all-purpose\" horse was used by locals until the improvement of automobile roads, at which time it was crossbred again to better handle a wider range of agricultural duties."

        "content": "If one believes the inhabitants of Auvergne, Vercingetorix used an \"Auvergnat cob\" for his battles.  True or not, the Auvergne horse seems to have been popular in the Middle Ages. In 1577, the Duke of Bouillon mentioned, in a Classical French text, that he rode an animal from Auvergne in leaving Turenne: \"I'm leaving Turenne, and I'm coming to sleep at M. de Beynac's home with Bousolles, Alagnac, La Vilatte, and Annal to whom I have given pages, Bouschant of Auvergne, all without any arms other than our swords, and all having this strong, bad horse; Bouschant had a little, rather good horse from Auvergne; my horse went with a large gate, not knowing how to turn and even less how to run ....\" The existence of the Auvergne horse is suggested in documents from the 17th century which describe a small, rustic, mountain horse of oriental build and rather closely related to oriental breeds.  Under the rule of Henry IV, the \"barbe auvergnat\" was a prized mount for cavaliers and, according to tradition, the famous white horse of the king himself came from a farm in Barra, near Aurillac. It was Louis XIV who, with the creation of the French National Breeding Farm during the 17th century, tried to better the horse in the hopes of using it in his cavalry.  To breed the horse, he called upon stallions of Turkish and Barbary descent, and upon the Frisian and Dutch stallions. The cross-breeding however was largely unsuccessful, mostly because of poor breeding management."

This was very low and reflected the poor quality of the population of Auvergne horses at that time. The Auvergne horse long remained disreputable. As a result, at the end of the 18th century these animals were described as \"with a large head, large ears and a little neck\" and as \"heavy, unhealthy and without nerves\". In 1788 2,660 foals were born in the Auvergne region and their sales value was reported at some 60,000 livres. After the suppression of the National Stud in 1790 the horses quickly regained their old features because of the disappearance of foreign Stallions which were stationed there. During the French Revolution General Houchard raised a regiment of light cavalry from Aurillac and, during the First Empire, the cavalry were mounted on Auvergne horses. At that time Auvergne produced many horses bred for economic use and sold them at four years old for saddling. Wars, however, resulted in the re-creation of the National Stud and the best horses disappeared."

Following these huge requisitions, by 1815 the horse population was decimated and weakened. Local horse farmers resumed their activities but the horses were no longer uniform. The method of raising Auvergne horses was frequently criticized. In Cantal the Auvergne gravid mare was worked until the tenth month of gestation and was not better fed in the winter. Five or six days after parturition she was sent with her foal to pasture where she often spent the night. Nursing of foals lasted five to six months. After weaning some of them were sold and exported to neighboring departments while others remained in pasture until November when the foals were returned to the stable. Their stabling lasted until April and foals were only let out to drink. In the first days of spring the foals were returned to the pasture to stay, night and day, until the month of November. At two years, the colts were castrated and all are saddled twelve months later. The horse population was more numerous in Cantal than in other departments of the old Auvergne. In Puy-de-D\u00f4me horses had the same conformation and the same qualities as in Cantal but were deemed to be \"less fine and less numerous\" although the farming system was the same. In Aveyron, Auvergne mares were crossed with stallions from Rodez and gave birth to a small horse (1.47 m) which formed the \"country breed\". In summer he lived in pastures where there was abundant food. In winter he returned to the stable \"where he received any food, the waste from the feeding of cattle\"."

The head is fine, short, and expressive with hollows above the eyes, keen eyes, ears very straight and very mobile, and with wide nostrils. It seems stronger than the Limousin horse because it is smaller. The neckline is arched or reversed but rather short. The mane is abundant and fine. Eugene Gayot said that when the wind blows the mane and forelock of the horses, it gives them a disheveled and very strange look. The withers are high and good-looking, sharp-edged and often separated from the neck by a sharp line. The chest and body are narrow but the chest is deep, a condition for speed. The back and loins conform well, but the back can be long. The flanks are turned up or cord\u00e9s. The hips are protruding and the haunch is sharp, short, angular and low -  slightly aval\u00e9e or en pupitre. The leg is fine and muscular with a wide and well articulated knee, smooth cannons and well detached tendons - almost as big as the bone. Members are spotless, dry and nervous, and free of defects but sometimes they have defects of plumb. The hock is hooked and closed but big enough, the pastern is short. The foot is small and well formed terminated by a very hard black hoof."

        "content": "The half-bloods of Auvergne were one of three breeds used for light cavalry at the beginning of the 19th century, along with the Navarrin horse and the Limousin horse. It is reputed to be \"the best breed in the Republic for light troops, dragoons, hussars, and cavalry officers\". The best animals in the service are found in Mont-Dore: \"well dimensioned, nervous, and never prone to sore eyes or legs\". The National Stud in Aurillac then purchased their Auvergne horses in the departments of Cantal, Puy-de-D\u00f4me, Corr\u00e8ze, and Aveyron at various fairs. The breeding of Auvergne horses for light cavalry was managed by the National Stud and associated farmers. As the size of the Auvergne horse was too small for light cavalry it was crossed with the Thoroughbred and Anglo-Norman resulting in the \"half-blood Auvergne\" a horse of \"light size\" destined for war and widely used during the wars of empire. It had little in common with the old type of breed. Farmers were reluctant to cross with Thoroughbreds, preferring the Arabian. Although Eugene Gayot defended the usefulness of these crosses, they often had poor results from creating horses with slender limbs, long kidneys, flat ribs, and a lot less hardy than the original Auvergne horse According to Andre Sanson they had strong ancestral qualities of the Auvergne horse. In addition rearing conditions were so bad that a third of the population was infected by periodic ophthalmia. The Auvergne horse from Quercy and Rouergue was often bay with a strong and thick mane and a head resembling that of Merens. Sober, strong, and agile: excellent for the dry and rocky slopes of those regions. They provided very good service in the cavalry for many years and consumed very little. They were sold at fairs in Cantal, Lot, and Aveyron. The old Auvergne horse was never a luxury horse - it is a true mountain horse used as a saddle horse, for war, and for hunting. It is exclusively intended for riding and \"eminently suited for saddling\" because his physiognomy is poorly suited to the harness. It is also a fast animal that has \"sometimes defeated good English race horses\": the races in Aurillac at the beginning of the 19th century led some owners to be more selective although the Auvergne horse often remains in the shadow of its neighbour - the Limousin horse."

        "content": "At the end of the 18th century and throughout the 19th century farmers in the Auvergne region raised a light communal horse with the ability to work and withstand harsh mountain winters. This horse was a great success throughout the 19th century with the breed becoming a Draft horse with a popular character and rusticity. According to a report in 1873 the old Auvergne \"light\" breed was then considered lost due to the development of roads suitable for motor vehicles in the region from the 1830s. This had the effect of reducing the need to own a saddle horse and promoted the breeding of a light driving draft horse more useful for local farmers as it allowed them to work with it in the fields. Horse breeding for saddle horses was only slightly profitable for farmers. Draft horses were then imported from Perche, Normandy, Brittany, and Poitou and crossed with the light breed in the country which gave the Auvergne \"communal\" horse. The communal Auvergne horse is an animal that is \"dual purpose\" intended primarily to pull carts but lacking the strength to plough. It is only used to do agricultural and farm work and sometimes is used in the production of mules: in the 1850s about 6,500 mares were covered each year in Auvergne, 5,827 were given a Donkey for only 673 covered by horses. Mares also carried out the threshing of wheat. At two and a half years foals from mares from Aveyron were employed threshing grain, ploughing, and carrying Pack saddles."

Mr. Li\u00e9geard, the Director of Aurillac National Stud, said a year later that \"if the Auvergne breed existed, one knows that this breed unfortunately does not live other than in the memory of those who have lived in the country 20 or 25 years ago\"."

        "content": "From the beginning of the 20th century progress and improvement of roads caused a decline in the production of Auvergne horses. Half-blood types disappeared with the end of cavalry in the army. The horses bred in the region were, according to a study in 1908, \"locked in unhealthy stables and poorly fed\". A letter from the National Stud at Aurillac to the Minister of Agriculture dated 4 April 1932 reported a \"very mixed stock of mares, so disparate as to exclude any notion of a fixed breed\". Two-thirds of Auvergne horses were of a light mountain type with a strong temperament and an average height not exceeding 1.55 m with a dark coat. The population of working horses decreased and the end of animal traction for field work threatened the extinction of the breed. The remaining animals were descendants of the old Auvergne work horse and the Limousin horse which also disappeared. In the 1960s and 1970s some horses were bred with Breton and Comtois traits for meat production but despite these crosses the Auvergne horse retained its characteristics. In 1997 the Association for the Preservation and Revitalization of the Auvergne horse was created to save the breed. In 2006 it received financial support of \u20ac3,000 from the Regional Council. It was recognised as an organisation of general interest in September 2009 and was then located in the Moidas area at Orbeil next to Issoire. Efforts are being focused on rebalancing the workforce and the preservation of the qualities of hardiness of these mountain horses. The association also tries to obtain official recognition to benefit from aid to save endangered breeds. The purpose of the association for the Auvergne breed is to increase the number of births by twenty to fifty per year. For this purpose, it proposed in 2006 \u20ac150 in assistance for owners of mares close to the characteristics of the breed to encourage them to breed their animals by one of eight approved stallions to cover part of the costs of travel and board for the stallion. The Regional Natural Park of Volcanoes in Auvergne, the National Stud of Aurillac, and the general councils support the association in its actions. In 2008 it created a catalogue of standards to conform to the breed standard and to follow up the herd. In the following year the first competition for appearance for the breed was organized. In April 2010 the association changed its name to the National Association of Auvergne breed horse (ANCRA). In October of the same year an agreement was signed with the Institut fran\u00e7ais du cheval et de l'\u00e9quitation (French Institute for the Horse and Horse riding or IFCE) for management of the brand Cheval Auvergne (Auvergne Horse). The homogeneity of the animals in their morphology, their psychology, and their expression north and south of the Massif Central is the main argument for fixing the dominant genes. The studbook project, monitored by the National Stud of Aurillac has led to the official recognition of the breed in December 2012."

It may have a future in both activities as its morphology allows it to be mounted with a light carriage The significant development of equestrian tourism in the region is another plus. The horse excels in Combined driving according to its fans. Very versatile, Auvergne horses are likely to give good service in riding schools through their physiognomy and good character that reassures beginners. They are also good in Competitive trail riding competitions. The horse can be used as a work horse in Market gardening for the maintenance of vines and hauling logs. Mares are bred for their milk at the Ferme \u00c9questre des Roches located in Rochefort-Montagne who market soap and mare's milk of Auvergne. From 19 to 23 September 2007 the Regional Natural Park of the Volcanoes of Auvergne organised for its 30th anniversary a traveling caravan of saddled and mounted Auvergne horses carrying local products through its territory."

They are also occupied in promoting the Auvergne horse and herd management. They organise two competitions each year on style and appearance: one is at Saint-Bonnet-le-Chastel on the fourth Sunday of October. In 2006 150 horses had been identified, mainly in Puy-de-D\u00f4me and Cantal. In December 2007 the number had risen to 184. Forty mares were projected in 2006, 25 foals were reported, and 21 foals were recorded under the titles of descent. Some horses that are close to the traits of the Auvergne horse were reported in the Alps in 2006. In 2012, the total number of horses is about 300 head with 50 births per year."

Assuredly, war is accompanied by a great deal of noise, and in that respect the producer, Sol Wurtzel, has gone all-out for realism. With all the enthusiasm of a youngster on the Fourth of July, he has filled his film with loud reports, concussions, flame and explosion. Machine guns chatter violently and at length. Actors grow hoarse shouting at each other above the uproar. If Mr. Wurtzel's tribute to the guerrillas of the Philippines could be measured by decibels alone, he would have a triumph. But drama, even in a disastrous inferno, sometimes has a still, small voice. In 'Manila Calling' it would been a hard time making itself heard\". \"As a man who keeps up with the headlines, Mr. Wurtzel has seized upon the idea of using the Japanese invasion of the Philippines as the background for a story similar to that of 'Lost Patrol.' A small band of fighting men seize a commanding height and after being augmented by several assorted civilians hold the position until their ranks are thinned out, one by one, and the last survivors blasted from the rock by bombers\u2014the last two being Mr. Lloyd Nolan, a hard-bitten fellow, and Miss Carole Landis, erstwhile Ping Girl, who pops into the story without reasonable cause. Together they broadcast a brave message to the world before they are wiped out\". \"But neither the authors nor the director have capitalized on a sound dramatic device. They have simply made use of the clich\u00e9s which require (a) that one man go berserk from the strain, (b) that one man try to escape at the expense of the others, and (c) that the tight-lipped hero has a heartbreaking story locked in his memory somewhere. From time to time Mr. Nolan does succeed in creating a credible hero, but for the most part the characters are hackneyed in writing and performance. As an action film of the more rudimentary kind, 'Manila Calling' is continuously noisy. \"...considering the subject and the times, that hardly seems enough\".

Scott of The New York Times wrote that the film was \"sly, daring, genuinely original and at times perversely brilliant\", while also stating that it was  \"a singularly unpleasant movie\" that had \"scramble[d his] signals ... effectively, overriding deeply ingrained habits of response and judgment.\" Eric Kohn of Indiewire praised the film, writing that it was \"a sheer delight of sarcasm and uneasy wit.\" Writing in The Village Voice, Nick Pinkerton described The Color Wheel as \"a movie that's consistently unafraid to get confrontational and plain weird, with Colin's is-it-or-isn't-it-ironic racism, abrupt smothering close-ups, and scenes pushed past the boundaries of plausible motivation until they nosedive into absurdity. Like Howard Hawks's Twentieth Century, it's a travelogue movie about a couple whose impossible, porcupine personalities leave them safe, finally, for nobody's company but each other's.\" In his personal blog, MSN film critic Glenn Kenny stated that \"there's a sense in which the unpleasantness of the characters, all of the characters, is so oppressively overwhelming that one gets a sense of an Ionesco-style absurdism put into a contemporary hyperdrive, with a bit of sneering near-Letterist technical crudity thrown in. The effect, at certain other times, is of a Which Way to the Front?-era Jerry-Lewis-written-and-starring incest comedy directed by Carnival Of Souls''' Herk Harvey.\" David Edelstein of New York Magazine chose the film as a Critic's Pick, citing it as \"the most entertaining unpleasant film I\u2019ve seen in years.\" For a New York Times feature on the film, Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma editor St\u00e9phane Delorme wrote that the film \"reminds us of a New York independent cinema that we loved \u2014 black and white, shot on film, spontaneous, with funny and intelligent dialogue \u2014 and that seemed to no longer exist.\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe similarly praised the film, writing: \"There aren\u2019t enough of these truly independent movies anymore.\" A notable early champion of the film was critic Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who was the first to write about The Color Wheel during its festival run. Vishnevetsky wrote that, \"despite (or maybe because of?) its detours into broad comedy, The Color Wheel manages to invest both characters with vulnerability, depth and even a perverse dignity; it's better at being a drama than most dramas.\" Reviewing the film in Variety, Ronnie Scheib wrote: \"Hard to swallow but impossible to ignore, this nihilistic comedy may emerge as a cult touchstone.\" Other critics were not as impressed. Peter Keough of The Boston Phoenix gave the film 1 1/2 out of 4 stars, comparing the film unfavorably to The Puffy Chair and writing that \"Alex Ross Perry's self-consciously coy indulgence reminds me of the work of Diablo Cody, but slighter and more irritating.\" Shawn Levy of The Oregonian complained about the film's style, writing: \"There\u2019s handmade and then there\u2019s amateurish.  This, alas, is the latter.\" David Fear of Time Out New York gave the film a negative review, writing that \"Some will call The Color Wheel'' daring. Others will remember that it takes more than desperate shocks to add substance to the sloppy diddlings of a dilettante.\" Even more negative was the review written by Ryan Brown for IonCinema.com, who stated: \"The fact that the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York could recently sanctify its movie screens with epiphanic Bresson and Zulawski retros, only to smear them now with a full week\u2019s run of this tripe only goes to demonstrate how haywire and scatterbrained 21st century film culture has become. Maybe the most appalling thing about Perry\u2019s movie is his obnoxious swipe at a truly great American film artist, Julian Schnabel, by conspicuously associating the character of a fatuous 'broadcasting' professor with a book of Schnabel\u2019s paintings.\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds a 78% rating based on reviews from 27 critics."

        "content": "The film was based on the novel Atlantida by Pierre Benoit, which had been previously filmed in 1921 and 1932. The latter version had been directed by G.W. Pabst and produced by Seymour Nebenzal in Berlin with German and French dialogue. In September 1946 it was announced Nebenzal bought the rights to film the novel and had signed Maria Montez to star. The film would be distributed through United Artists. Jay Dratler was originally signed to write the screenplay. A number of other writers also worked on it, including an uncredited Douglas Sirk. Sirk says he was approached to direct the film by Rudi Joseph, who had been Pabst's assistant. Sirk turned it down claiming the Pabst version was a very good film that simply should have been re-released. He was also a worried producer: Didn't have the money to do the necessary fantastic sets. You know, Atlantis depends on inspiring people's fantasies. The old Pabst picture had great sets, but you do need money to construct a hidden city and that kind of thing. It's no good trying to shoot this sort of film on a small budget, as Nebenzal wanted \u2013 and then he wanted me to use some of the long-shot material from the old Pabst and so on. Sirk did agree to do some uncredited work on the screenplay with Rowland Leigh but said he was \"fairly sure I didn't do any shooting\" on the film. It proved difficult to come up with a screenplay that satisfied the censors. In the novel, the queen had an insatiable appetite for male lovers and turns them into statues when she has finished with them. The Joseph Breen office wrote to Nebenzal complaining about the depiction of \"hasheesh and illicit sex\". As a result, adjustments to the screenplay were made. Montez's husband Jean Pierre Aumont was borrowed from MGM to appear opposite his wife. Dennis O'Keefe was then signed to support them. Filming was to start in December 1946 but was postponed because Montez needed to have surgery and was also required to star in another film for Universal."

It was filmed at Samuel Goldwyn Studios. Aumont later wrote that \"the decors were a fantastic mishmash, including naugahyde doors which seemed to have come right out of the office of the frenetic producer rather than the mysterious palace of Antinea.\" He also said the filmmakers made him wear three-inch heels so that he was taller than Dennis O'Keefe, who was two-inches taller than Aumont. Montez said during filming that she hoped to give a good performance along with the \"sex and stuff people expect of me... Not that I have anything against glamour. But I would like a role I could get my teeth into. After all, I have two years typing to overcome, of going from one to another until I was groggy. And it is the hardest thing to do that sort of vamp \u2013 like Theda Bara \u2013 and not be laughable.\" Aumont recalls that dromedaries were imported from a neighboring zoo. Camels were needed, however, so a second hump was attached to each of them using rubber cement. A leopard, who acted in the film, was dosed with tranquilizers and sent to live with Aumont and Montez for a few days to become accustomed to them. After filming wrapped, both Aumont and Montez signed three year contracts with the producer to make one film a year. \"It is a picture of which I am very proud\", said Montez. Aumont wrote that the film \"for some mysterious reason, didn't fare too badly.\""

Morris Carnovsky's role was reduced since he was not available and his character was replaced with a new one played by Henry Daniell. Maria Montez and Aumont returned and \"violence and movement\" was introduced, according to the producer. Neither Ripley nor Brahm were willing to take credit for the final version, so the editor Gregg G. Tallas, who put together the two versions, was credited as the film's director.

Her life is upended when Sophie tells her she plans to relocate from Brooklyn to Tribeca, which Sophie considers her dream neighborhood. Frances, a struggling would-be dancer working as an apprentice at a dance company, is unable to afford the move and is forced to find someplace else to live. She moves to Chinatown and shares an apartment with her friends Lev and Benji for a brief period. Sophie and Frances's relationship struggles as Sophie and her boyfriend, Patch, grow closer. Frances learns that the dance company does not need her to work their Christmas show, which means Frances can no longer afford the apartment. She visits her hometown of Sacramento for Christmas where she sees her family and reconnects with high school friends. Rachel, a fellow dancer in the company, lets Frances stay with her for a few weeks. During dinner with Rachel's family, Frances discovers that Sophie has quit her job at Random House and is moving to Tokyo with Patch. Frances, on a whim, decides to spend an uneventful couple of days in Paris that she pays for with a credit card. She returns to Vassar, her alma mater, to work as a waitress and summer resident assistant. Overworked and not allowed to take classes, Frances reads Sophie's blog of her life in Tokyo, Japan. One night, Sophie and Patch are at an alumni auction which Frances is waitressing for. Frances learns they are engaged and sees the couple get into a fight. She lets a drunk Sophie stay with her in the dorm room she's been given, where Sophie reveals that she suffered a miscarriage while in Japan and is unhappy in her relationship. Sophie goes back to New York City the next morning, leaving a note for Frances. Some time later, Frances returns to Washington Heights in Manhattan. She laments her dire financial situation, her poor prospects as a professional dancer, and her increasingly strained relationship with Sophie. Frances eventually reconciles with Sophie and enjoys a modest but satisfying existence as a fledgling choreographer, teaching dance to young children, and as a bookkeeper for her former dance company. She starts exploring a potential relationship with Benji and rents her own apartment. Upon moving in, Frances writes her name down onto a slip of paper in order to mark her new mailbox. Her full last name does not fit, so she folds the paper to read: \"Frances Ha.\""

Gerwig, who also stars in the film, announced it in April 2012, though Baumbach's involvement was not revealed until the film's listing in the Telluride Film Festival's lineup. Gerwig had starred in Baumbach's 2010 film Greenberg, and they decided to collaborate again. They exchanged ideas, developed characters, and eventually co-wrote the script. Gerwig has stated that she did not anticipate starring in the film as well, but Baumbach thought she suited the part. Filming locations included New York City, Sacramento, Paris, and Vassar College, which is Baumbach's alma mater. In the bonus features of the physical media release, the filmmakers reveal that the film was shot both in the style of French New Wave cinema and with the tools of a student filmmaker. Even though the production had both the budget for and access to professional cinema cameras and lenses, they opted to shoot the entire film on the Canon EOS 5D Mark II, a consumer photographic camera that has a high-definition video feature. Instead of adapting professional cinema lenses onto the camera, as other cinematographers have done when working with that camera, the production team chose Canon L-Series prime and zoom lenses that were designed for photography. They shot most of the movie on a 50mm prime lens and a 70\u2013200mm zoom lens, rarely using the 35mm and 85mm prime lenses that they brought with them. These lenses lacked the mechanics and features common among cinema lenses, which (when paired with the large \"full-frame\" sensor) made it difficult to keep the image in focus. The benefit of using an incredibly small camera and extremely limited lighting equipment was that the production team could quickly and easily move around to different filming locations without attracting attention. Because the film did not spend money on large crews, elaborate sets, or visual effects, they could afford to shoot in Paris, New York City, and in California despite having a small budget."

Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice praised Gerwig's performance, writing, \"It's a relief that Frances Ha isn't as assertively frank, in the 'Look, ma, no shame!' way, as Girls. And this is partly Gerwig's vision, too. No other movie has allowed her to display her colors like this. Frances is a little dizzy and frequently maddening, but Gerwig is precise in delineating the character's loopiness: Her lines always hit just behind the beat, like a jazz drummer who pretends to flub yet knows exactly what's up.\" Peter Debruge, reviewing for Variety, described Frances Ha, \"This modest monochromatic lark doesn't present a story\u2014or even a traditional sequence of scenes\u2014so much as it offers spirited glimpses into the never-predictable life of Frances, a 27-year-old dancer.\" He said Frances was \"a character whose unexceptional concerns and everyday foibles prove as compelling as any New York-set concept picture, delivering an affectionate, stylishly black-and-white portrait of a still-unfledged Gotham gal\". The Los Angeles Times highlighted Gerwig's foray as part of a trend of female actors becoming writers or co-writers; other examples include Zoe Kazan with Ruby Sparks and Rashida Jones with Celeste and Jesse Forever. Baumbach filmed Frances Ha with his cinematographer Sam Levy digitally and in black-and-white, the latter to emulate in part collaborations by Woody Allen and his cinematographer Gordon Willis, in films like Manhattan (1979). CBS News compared Frances Has style to the works of Woody Allen, Jim Jarmusch and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut."

They hid underground for months, cold and numb, far too close for comfort\u2014just like the potatoes to which the title refers.

Djoekri's son Joesoef (Mohamad Sani), however, leads a life of plenty. Soon Djoekri's activities are targeted by a masked man known as the \"Black Wolf\" (\"Srigala Item\"), who also foils Joesoef's attempts to woo Soehaemi (Hadidjah), whom Mochtar loves. Djoekri tires of the Black Wolf's interference and takes him on in a battle. Though Djoekri almost wins, ultimately the Black Wolf emerges victorious. It is later revealed that Mardjoeki remains alive and Mochtar was the Black Wolf."

        "content": "The film was written and directed by Tan Tjoei Hock for Action Film, a subsidiary of producer The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film (JIF). Tan, who had made his directorial debut in 1940, based Srigala Item on the stories surrounding Johnston McCulley's fictional bandit Zorro; as with the American bandit, the Black Wolf used a whip and wore all black. The black-and-white film was shot by The Teng Chun's brother Teng Gan, with Hajopan Bajo Angin as artistic designer. The film starred Hadidjah and Mohamad Mochtar, who had first acted together in JIF's Alang-Alang (Grass; 1939) and were promoted as a celebrity couple in competition with Raden Mochtar and Roekiah of Tan's Film. It also featured Bissoe, Tan Tjeng Bok, and Mohamad Sani. Bissoe had made his feature film debut with JIF's Oh Iboe in 1938, while Sani had made his debut for JIF in 1940. Tan Tjeng Bok, a former stage star with Dardanella, made his feature film debut through Srigala Item. Music for Srigala Item was done in the kroncong (traditional music with Portuguese influences) style, popular at the time, by Mas Sardi. Hadidjah is credited as singing two songs, \"Ja. Ja. Ja. Ja.\" (\"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\") and \"Termenoeng-Menoeng\" (\"Pensive\"); Tan Tjeng Bok is also recorded as performing a song."

It was advertised, sometimes under the Dutch name of De Zwarte Wolf, as sensational, full of action, and mysterious\" and marketed for all ages. The film was released in Batavia (modern day Jakarta), the capital of the Indies, and by July 1941 it had reached Surabaya, in Eastern Java, and Singapore, then part of British Malaya. An anonymous review of Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film would be a commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences\u00a0\u2013 mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth who is able to control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers to be able to see themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them. Action Film and JIF continued producing films until the beginning of the Japanese occupation of the Indies began in early 1942, leading to the closing of all but one film studio. The cast of Srigala Item remained with JIF until the company closed, as did Tan. According to JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Catalogue of Indonesian Films), a copy of Srigala Item is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta. The reels have been damaged by acid, leading to part of the film being excised."

        "content": "In 1958, recent history is presented in the form of a documentary about a crashed Soviet space capsule near the border with East Germany. Inside the capsule is a chimpanzee cosmonaut, taken and subjected to tests by West German scientists. Soon after the discovery, the same scientists and their assistants get sick. The sickness spreads, and within a month, the first of the infected begin to die. A struggle to find a cure ensues, resulting in a hybrid creature referred to as a chimera, genetically engineered from a green sea turtle, medicinal leech, and ocellated lizard whose purpose is to perform a kind of bleeding on the sick, effecting a limited cleansing of the patient's systems. The treatment extends survival by about ten months, but everyone, even those so treated, must wear gas masks to avoid new infections, which is the present state of things at the end of the documentary, in which a nuclear family is shown at home, each of them wearing a mask and living a \"normal life\"."

        "content": "Javier Chillon's main inspiration was the \"Hollywood look of the 50s and the educational films of that time, documentaries with an enormous propagandistic content\". He was also inspired by the period's American newsreels and science fiction B movies, such as those by Roger Corman, and European classics such as Chris Marker's La Jet\u00e9e (there is a flat shot done as an homage), and Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Die Schneider Krankheit shares a number of themes with Javier Chill\u00f3n's second short film, Decapoda Shock: monstrous creatures resulting from \"spatial\" mutations or genetic manipulation, primarily derived from the science fiction B movies of the 1950s, the \"atomic age\". The mockumentary attempts to make its viewers \"believe what they are watching\" and to recreate a time period \"without using any archival footage.\" Scholar  remarks that this kind of \"retro-inflected material enjoys significant popularity\" in twenty-first century science-fiction short films, citing Die Schneider Krankheit, Matthew Savage's Reign of Death (2009), and Johan L\u00f6fstedt's Kometen (The Comet, 2004)."

Chillon obsessed over that aspect. The only professional actor in Die Schneider Krankheit is Paco Casares, the narrator. Chillon saw the stage actor in a play and said to himself, this is the voice; he was easy to direct, and the entirety of his spoken text was recorded in one afternoon. Most of Chillon's small crew were made up of either members of his family or friends: his father (a painter and sculptor) worked alongside his mother in special effects; his cinematographer Luis Fuentes is a close friend, while make-up was done by a friend who is a professional make-up artist and hairdresser."

For the most part the sets such as the tiled walls and floors, microscopes, hospital room, had to be constructed. Despite the aim at realism, it is still a science fiction film and could not be made without special effects, \"however we tried not to use info graphics whenever it was possible.\"The criterion was clear: using the same techniques used by filmmakers of that time. Models, make-up effects, animations from pictures previously shot and superimposition  effects are some of the techniques that helped  to set Die  Schneider  Krankheit in a very specific style and period."

Most sequences were shot on a tripod, but in an effort to simulate an older documentary, they also included a few hand-held shots, Fuentes using Tri-X or Plus-X film depending on the amount of light for each shot. They used high contrast film and film grain, which are distinctive of the genre, along with automatic exposure and deliberate \"velatures\" to reinforce the documentary style:The real challenge is to achieve the balance between the realism of longer shots with little editing and a more cinematic look: distinctive camera angles and hand-held camera shots. A delicate balance which will guide the audience during the journey through the threatened world of Die Schneider Krankheit.As most of the cast were not professional actors, they were not put off by the look of the Sankyo camera, until shooting began: it makes a lot of noise, and this led to some of the actors being surprised and not moving."

        "content": "Critics were impressed by the realism of Die Schneider Krankheit, which \"painstakingly recreates an alternate history through a seamlessly authentic aesthetic.\" The editors at Sin Final en el Guion suggest it is probably one of the best first films by any director. The realism achieved is of such a high degree that it was rejected by some early festivals because selectors believed archival footage had been used. As a result, disclaimers were placed at the beginning of the film to \"let the viewer know that the images are original, and not extracted from real documentaries.\" The opening sequence and end credits, along with the dual Spanish-German soundtrack, appear to have been convincing enough to lead some viewers to believe the film is genuinely of German origin (and in one case, Russian). It even won a Best Documentary award at the . Once the initial misunderstanding about archival footage had been cleared up, the short caught on very quickly, and received \"raves on the festival circuit\". Virginie S\u00e9lavie calls the short \"inventive, intelligent\", and \"fantastic\": the \"50s newsreel style is perfectly reproduced, while the reasonable tone of the reporter is brilliantly contrasted with the outlandish events depicted.\" Christopher Webster calls the short a \"perfect blend of newsreel, visual FX and creative storytelling\". Artie Knapp was impressed right from the first shots, \"with the camera tilting down through the trees to show us the crash site at long range ... a nearly prefect rendition of old documentary style right down to how the camera would move.\"This is science fiction that is a deadly accurate portrayal of the calm, governmental, ponderous yet urgent, carefully-framed and full-of-import quality found in mid-century documentary films.  The humor is sly and builds its effect gradually. It's also somewhat frightening.Reviewing the film at the Flatpack Festival, Alex King calls it a highlight of the event, but found it more than \"somewhat frightening\": \"it captures perfectly the dark, clunky feel of old newsreels yet every single shot is created through original footage.\"The scene where an innocent 50s nuclear family sit around the television all wearing sinister WWII gas-masks while the narrator explains how \"normal family life\" has continued despite the epidemic is one of the most chilling things I have ever seen on film.The special effects were likewise good enough to give a French reviewer goosebumps, who also suggested the short could have made a good story segment on The Twilight Zone.  A reviewer on Ain't It Cool News called the film \"without a doubt, one of the very oddest \u2013 and very best \u2013 bits of film that I've come across this year,\" advising: \"Don't try to understand, just enjoy.\" A Canadian reviewer at the Fantasia International Film Festival expected that a short mockumentary \"should be awful, but this 10 minute gem shot on 8mm Tri-X stock is brilliant.\" Tim Hall, of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, gives the short a grade of \"C\", finding it \"somewhat enjoyable if \"a little bizarre\"; he \"wasn't sure where they were going with this film\"."

Simultaneously, the elite continued to increase their wealth, the poor sunk further in status. The subservient poor were under the \"Yoke of Gold,\" i.e., the yoke of the aristocracy. Luis Lopez is smarting under this aristocratic yoke. The fiery Luis wants to become the champion of the poor. Luis fancies himself as a local Robin Hood. Luis claims he wants to rob the rich and redistribute wealth among the poor. Jose Garcia is content to live out his life in the sleepy outskirts of San Gabriel Mission. The gullible Jose falls under the spell of Luis's fiery rhetoric. Jose also becomes determined to find a way to help the less fortunate. Luis is sensing Jose's frustration, enlists Jose to assist him in pursuing his evil designs. Since they now share common goals, the two become fast friends. Luis and Jose start developing a plan to achieve their aims. The plan comes together. Jose will rob wealthy landowner Don Ortega portrayed by Frank Whitting. Don Ortega lives in Santa Barbara, California. Luis will rob the wealthy Don Mendoza, who resides in \"the valley of the seven moons.\" After the men have completed both break-ins, they will travel back to San Gabriel.  They both swear to distribute all their ill-gotten gains to the poor. Before Jose departs, he informs his devoted mother and Padre Amador of his plans.  Padre Amador and leads the Santa Barbara Mission. Since he happens to be San Gabriel visiting friends, the padre gives Jose his blessing. The priest also slips a crucifix into Jose's backpack for good luck. Jose has a significant obstacle. Before he can rob Don Ortega, he must first cross a burning desert to reach Santa Barbara. Jose starts a journey under the blistering sun. Soon, overcome with thirst, Jose stops for a drink of water. He discovers he has lost his canteen. Jose starts to search his backpack and finds the crucifix that Padre Amador had concealed. He grabs the cross and throws it into the sand. Jose realizes his fate is sealed and lays down in the sand, waiting for death. As luck would have it, another party was traveling behind Jose and headed in the same direction. Castro Arrellanes and his beautiful daughter \u2013 Carmen, are traveling to visit Castro's cousin. In a bit of irony, Castro's cousin is none other than Don Ortega. They come across the crucifix half-buried in the sand. Later they discover the half-dead Jose. Jose is on the edge of death. Castro and Carmen decide to finish their journey and take Jose to Don Ortega's home to recover. After they arrive at Don Ortega's home, Carmen starts nursing Jose back to good health. Now we turn our focus to Luis Lopez. Luis arrived at the home of Don Mendoza in the valley of the seven moons.  He convinces Don Mendoza he has lost his way and requests lodging. The Mendozas take him in. After waiting for Mendoza and his wife to fall asleep, Lopez sneaks into the living room. He knows Don Mendoza has hidden bags of gold in a large chest. While stealing the gold, Mendoza's wife catches him in the act. Lopez attacks the woman, but the ensuing struggle wakes-up Don Mendoza. He rushes to his wife's aid and forces Lopez to flee. Lopez takes his gold and heads back to San Gabriel to meet up with Jose. Jose continues to recuperate in Don Ortega's home under Carmen's tender care. But during Jose's healing process, Jose falls in love with Carmen. Now a man in love, Jose renounces his plans to rob the rich and give to the poor. Recovered, Jose heads back home to confront Luis and tell him of his change of heart. Jose arrives in San Gabriel. Luis Lopez confronts him. Luis learns Jose had failed in his attempt to rob Ortega. Luis is beside himself with rage. Luis vows to steal Ortega's gold himself. In another starling turn, Jose learns, Lopez never intended to give the gold to the poor. From the start, Lopez had planned to keep all the gold for himself. Jose promises himself; he will not be complicit in robbing those who had befriended him. Before Luis retires for the evening, he stashed the gold he stole from Mendoza under his pillow. Luis falls to sleep. Later in the evening, Jose sneaks into Lopez's room, takes the gold, and escapes into the darkness. Jose then secures a horse and heads for Don Ortega's home in Santa Barbara. Luis discovers what has happened. He vows to pursue the traitorous Jose and kill him. Even though Jose has a head start, Luis believes he can beat Luis to Don Ortega's home. Both Jose and Luis ride hard and fast across the desert to Santa Barbara - the home of Don Ortega. Jose wins the race and arrives before Luis. He warns Ortega of the impending robbery, and then both men lay a trap for Lopez. They catch him in the act. Carmen enters the picture. She believes a caring heart is beneath Luis Lopez's wicked veneer. Carmen thinks Luis can be redeemed. She pleads with Luis to turn his life around. At Carmen's bidding, padre Amador has returned to Santa Barbara. He joins Carmen in trying to convince Luis to forsake his sinful life and repent. Suddenly, Luis sees the light, heeds the call, and reforms his evil ways. Luis decides to become a monk. He enters the  Mission at Santa Barbara under Padre Amador's guidance. He will spend the rest of his days as a priest at the mission. Later, Jose and Carmen get married and live in wedded bliss."

Carleton arrived with impeccable credentials, having directed some 60 films for the likes of Thanhouser, Lubin, Fox, and Selig.

Emory Johnson acted in all 16 of these films. Of Carleton's total 1916 output, 11 were feature films, and the rest were two-reel shorts. In 1916, Carleton directed 13 films pairing Dorothy Davenport and Emory Johnson. This film would be the eighth in the 13-film series.

She had acted in hundreds of movies by the time she starred in this film. The majority of these films were 2-reel shorts, as was the norm in Hollywood's teen years. She had been making movies since 1910. She started dating Wally Reid when she was barely 16, and he was 20. They married in 1913. After her husband died in 1923, she used the name \"Mrs. Wallace Reid\" in the credits for any project she took part in.  Besides being an actress, she would eventually become a film director, producer, and writer. Emory Johnson (1894-1960) was  years old when he starred in this movie as Jose Garcia. In January 1916, Emory signed a contract with Universal Film Manufacturing Company. Carl Laemmle of Universal Film Manufacturing Company thought he saw great potential in Johnson, so he chooses him to be Universal's new leading man. Laemmle's hope was Johnson would become another Wallace Reed. A major part of his plan was to create a movie couple that would sizzle on the silver screen. Laemmle thought Dorothy Davenport and Emory Johnson could create the chemistry he sought. Johnson and Davenport would complete 13 films together. They started with the successful feature production of Doctor Neighbor in May 1916 and ended with The Devil's Bondwoman in November 1916. After completing the last movie, Laemmle thought Johnson did not have the screen presence he wanted. He decided not to renew his contract. Johnson would make 17 movies in 1916, including eight shorts and 11 feature-length Dramas. 1916 would become the second-highest movie output of his entire acting career. Emory acted in  25 films for Universal, mostly dramas with a sprinkling of comedies and westerns. Alfred Allen (1866-1947) was  years old when he was selected to play Luis Lopez.  Allen was highly educated, had a commanding presence and stood six feet, and weighed two hundred pounds. He got his start in the film industry at Universal city in 1913.  He landed his first role in 1915. His roles were character parts, and he played mostly fathers, villains, or ranch owners. Alfred Allen appeared in 69 features from 1916 through 1929. After acting in Heartaches he would appear in four more Davenport-Johnson projects: A Yoke of Gold, The Unattainable, The Human Gamble and Barriers of Society. Richard Morris (1862-1924) was a  year-old actor when he played Padre Amador. He was a character actor and former opera singer known for Granny (1913). He would eventually participate in many Johnson projects, including  |In the Name of the Law (1922),  The Third Alarm (1922),  The West~Bound Limited (1923), The Mailman (1923) until his untimely death in 1924."

Universal films decided to label their films according to the size of their budget and status. Universal, unlike the top-tier studios, did not own any theaters to market its feature films. Universal gave theater owners and audiences a quick reference guide by branding their product.  Branding would help theater owners judge films they were about to lease and help fans decide which movies they wanted to see. Universal released three different types of feature motion pictures:B movies (Hollywood Golden Age)#Roots of the B movie: 1910s\u20131920s"

In the September issue of the Moving Picture World,  Robert C. McElravy reviewed this movie and stated: A weak story is its main drawback, and this is the more noticeable because so many strong tales have been woven about the early days of California There is a great deal of quiet beauty in these offerings and a strong moral purpose in the story.  But these things do not compensate for the slow action and lack of dramatic strength In the September issue of the Motion Picture News,  Peter Milne was more upbeat in his review.  He observed: Aided by some beautiful scenes and good photography, the picture leaves little to be desired from an artistic standpoint . . .  With Emory Johnson and Dorothy Davenport in the roles of lovers and Alfred Allen as the bandit, the picture has been well-acted."

It was directed by David Fincher based on a screenplay by his late father Jack Fincher, and was produced by Ce\u00e1n Chaffin, Douglas Urbanski, and Eric Roth. It stars Gary Oldman in the title role, alongside Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, Arliss Howard, Tom Pelphrey, Sam Troughton, Ferdinand Kingsley, Tuppence Middleton, Tom Burke, Joseph Cross, Jamie McShane, Toby Leonard Moore, Monika Gossman, and Charles Dance. Jack Fincher wrote the script in the 1990s, and David originally intended to film it after he completed The Game (1997), with Kevin Spacey and Jodie Foster as the leads. It never came to fruition, and Jack Fincher died in 2003. Eventually, the project was officially announced in July 2019, and filming took place around Los Angeles from November 2019 to February 2020. To pay homage to the films of the 1930s, Mank was shot in black-and-white using RED cameras. Mank had a limited theatrical release on November 13, 2020, and began streaming on Netflix on December 4. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised Fincher's direction, as well as the acting (particularly Oldman and Seyfried), cinematography, production values, and musical score. The film earned a leading ten nominations at the 93rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Oldman), and Best Supporting Actress (Seyfried), and won for Best Production Design and Best Cinematography. It also  received a leading six nominations at the 78th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama."

        "content": "In 1940, Orson Welles is given complete creative freedom for his next project by RKO. For the screenplay, Welles recruits Herman J. Mankiewicz, who is in Victorville, California, recovering from a broken leg he sustained in a car crash. Herman dictates the script to his secretary, Rita Alexander, who notices similarities between the main character (Charles Foster Kane) and William Randolph Hearst. Producer John Houseman is concerned about Herman's dense, nonlinear screenplay, while Herman's brother Joseph worries that it may anger the powerful Hearst. In 1930, Herman visits an MGM location where he and the female lead, Marion Davies, recognize each other. She introduces him to Hearst, her benefactor and lover, who takes a liking to Herman. In 1933, Herman and his wife Sara attend Louis B. Mayer's birthday party at Hearst Castle with many Hollywood bigwigs. They discuss the rise of Nazi Germany and the upcoming gubernatorial election, in particular candidate Upton Sinclair. Herman and Marion go for a stroll, where they bond over discussions on politics and the film industry. In 1940, Houseman grows impatient over Herman's lack of progress. Rita is also concerned with the timing of the writing and Herman's alcoholism. He does finish the screenplay in time. Houseman is impressed but reminds Herman that he will receive no credit for his work. In 1934, Herman and Joseph begin working at MGM under Mayer. Studio executives, including Irving Thalberg, actively work against Sinclair's gubernatorial campaign. The studio produces propaganda films for a smear campaign, funded by Hearst, against Sinclair. Herman approaches Marion to pull the films but is unsuccessful as she has already left the studio for Warner Bros. Herman and Sara later attend an election night watch party at the Trocadero Nightclub, where Mayer announces the winner, Frank Merriam. Herman's colleague, director Shelly Metcalf, shoots and kills himself after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and guilt-ridden over his role in the smear campaign, despite personally supporting Sinclair. In 1940, Charles Lederer picks up the screenplay from Herman to deliver to the studio. Joseph visits Herman after reading it, warning him of Hearst's reaction and how it might affect Marion. He does, however, believe that it's the finest thing Herman has ever written. Marion also visits and does her best to persuade Herman to change the screenplay but to no avail. She tells Herman she will try to stop the picture from getting made. In 1937, Herman crashes a party at Hearst Castle, where he drunkenly pitches the idea for the film he will later write, offending everyone present, including Hearst, Mayer, and Marion. An enraged Mayer reveals that Herman is on Hearst's payroll and calls him a court jester. Hearst tells him an allegory about a monkey and an organ grinder and sees him out. In 1940, despite pressure from Hearst, Welles is determined to make the film and intends to do a re-write without Herman. He visits Herman and offers him a buyout from the studio. However, reneging on the terms of his contract, Herman requests credit for the script, declaring it his greatest work. An upset Welles tells Herman that he has gone to bat for him before leaving angrily. Herman ultimately receives joint credit with Welles, and they win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film (Citizen Kane) two years later."

The article angered many critics, including Welles's friend and fellow filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich who rebutted Kael's claims point by point in \"The Kane Mutiny\", an October 1972 article for Esquire. Her argument was discredited by several film scholars through the years, including Robert L. Carringer in his study of \"The Scripts of Citizen Kane.\" Mank producer Eric Roth reportedly polished the script prior to filming, with David Fincher saying he felt early drafts were too anti-Welles. When asked about the controversy surrounding authorship, Fincher stated that his movie does not aim to settle the issue: \"It was not my interest to make a movie about a posthumous credit arbitration. I was interested in making a movie about a man who agreed not to take any credit. And who then changed his mind. That was interesting to me.\""

Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a \"B+\" and wrote: \"However much credit Mankiewicz deserves for Kane, Fincher's remarkable movie makes a compelling argument for appreciating the prescience behind its conception. His life had a rough ending, but the movie about it gives him one last bitter laugh.\" Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang said, \"Mank demands your surrender, but also your heightened attention. It's a pleasurably discombobulating experience, sometimes playing like mordant drawing-room comedy and sometimes flirting with expressionist nightmare, as when Welles' dark silhouette looms over a bedridden Mank and his mummified leg.\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised the performances and production design, saying, \"Mank is a tale of Old Hollywood that's more steeped in Old Hollywood \u2013 its glamour and sleaze, its layer-cake hierarchies, its corruption and glory \u2013 than just about any movie you've seen, and the effect is to lend it a dizzying time-machine splendor.\" Peter Travers, reviewing the film for ABC News, wrote: \"Mank is the most gorgeous piece of cinema you'll see anywhere. Brilliantly shot in black-and-white by Erik Messerschmidt, with costumes to die for by Trish Summerville and a period-authentic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that somehow isn't defeated by the retro mono sound, Mank is meant to match the look and feel of its era, as if it's eight decades ago and you just bought a ticket.\" Jason Bailey of The Playlist was more mixed and gave the film a \"C+\" grade, calling it a \"gorgeously mounted but ultimately distant biopic\". The A.V. Club'''s Ignatiy Vishnevetsky thought it was \"conventional to a fault\", writing that parts of the film \"bear an uncanny resemblance to the kind of awards-bait middlebrow drama usually essayed by BBC-trained hacks.\"Mank appeared on 50 critics' year-end top-10 lists, including four first-place rankings and five second place ones."
