        "content": "Some parts of the GNU Manifesto began as an announcement of the GNU Project posted by Richard Stallman on September 27, 1983, in form of an email on Usenet newsgroups. The project's aim was to give computer users freedom and control over their computers by collaboratively developing and providing software that is based on Stallman's idea of software freedom (although the written definition had not existed until February 1986). The manifesto was written as a way to familiarize more people with these concepts, and to find more support in form of work, money, programs and hardware. The GNU Manifesto possessed its name and full written form in 1985 but was updated in minor ways in 1987."

        "content": "The GNU Manifesto opens with an explanation of what the GNU Project is, and what is the current, at the time, progress in creation of the GNU operating system. The system, although based on, and compatible with Unix, is meant by the author to have many improvements over it, which are listed in detail in the manifesto. One of the major driving points behind the GNU project, according to Stallman, was the rapid (at the time) trend toward Unix and its various components becoming proprietary (i.e. closed-source and non-libre) software. The manifesto lays a philosophical basis for launching the project, and importance of bringing it to fruition \u2014 proprietary software is a way to divide users, who are no longer able to help each other. Stallman refuses to write proprietary software as a sign of solidarity with them. The author provides many reasons for why the project and software freedom is beneficial to users, although he agrees that its wide adoption will make a work of programmer less profitable. A large part of the GNU Manifesto is focused on rebutting possible objections to GNU Project's goals. They include the programmer's need to make a living, the issue of advertising and distributing free software, and the perceived need of a profit incentive."

        "content": "\"Ozymandias\" () is a sonnet written by the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792\u20131822). It was first published in the 11 January 1818 issue of The Examiner of London. The poem was included the following year in Shelley's collection Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue; with Other Poems, and in a posthumous compilation of his poems published in 1826. Shelley wrote the poem in friendly competition with his friend and fellow poet Horace Smith (1779\u20131849), who also wrote a sonnet on the same topic with the same title. The poem explores the fate of history and the ravages of time: even the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion."

        "content": "In antiquity, Ozymandias was a Greek name for the pharaoh Ramesses II (r. 1279\u20131213 BC), derived from a part of his throne name, Usermaatre. In 1817, Shelley began writing the poem Ozymandias, after the British Museum acquired the Younger Memnon, a head-and-torso fragment of a statue of Ramesses II, which dated from the 13th century BC. Earlier, in 1816, the Italian archeologist Giovanni Battista Belzoni had removed the  statue fragment from the Ramesseum, the mortuary temple of Ramesses II at Thebes, Egypt. The reputation of the statue fragment preceded its arrival to Western Europe; after his Egyptian expedition in 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte had failed to acquire the Younger Memnon for France. Although the British Museum expected delivery of the antiquity in 1818, the Younger Memnon did not arrive in London until 1821. Shelley published his poems before the statue fragment of Ozymandias arrived in Britain. The book Les Ruines, ou m\u00e9ditations sur les r\u00e9volutions des empires (1791) by Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney (1757\u20131820), first published in an English translation as The Ruins, or a Survey of the Revolutions of Empires (London: Joseph Johnson, 1792) by James Marshall, was an influence on Shelley. Shelley had explored similar themes in his 1813 work Queen Mab. Typically, Shelley published his literary works either anonymously or pseudonymously, under the name \"Glirastes\", a Graeco-Latin name created by combining the Latin gl\u012bs (\"dormouse\") with the Greek suffix \u1f10\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (erast\u0113s, \"lover\"); the Glirastes name referred to his wife, Mary Shelley, whom he nicknamed \"dormouse\"."

        "content": "The banker and political writer Horace Smith spent the Christmas season of 1817\u20131818 with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. At this time, members of the Shelleys' literary circle would sometimes challenge each other to write competing sonnets on a common subject: Shelley, John Keats and Leigh Hunt wrote competing sonnets about the Nile around the same time. Shelley and Smith both chose a passage from the writings of the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus  in Bibliotheca historica, which described a massive Egyptian statue and quoted its inscription: \"King of Kings Ozymandias am I. If any want to know how great I am and where I lie, let him outdo me in my work.\" In Shelley's poem, Diodorus becomes \"a traveller from an antique land.\" The poem was printed in The Examiner, a weekly paper published by Leigh's brother John Hunt in London. Hunt admired Shelley's poetry and many of his other works, such as The Revolt of Islam, were published in The Examiner. Shelley's poem was published on 11 January 1818 under the pen name \"Glirastes\". It appeared on page 24 in the yearly collection, under Original Poetry. Shelley's poem was later republished under the title \"Sonnet. Ozymandias\" in his 1819 collection Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue; with Other Poems by Charles and James Ollier and in the 1826 Miscellaneous and Posthumous Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley by William Benbow, both in London."

        "content": "Delos David \"D. D.\" Harriman, \"the last of the Robber Barons\", is obsessed with being the first to travel to\u2014and possess\u2014the Moon. He asks his business partner, George Strong, and other tycoons to invest in the venture. Most dismiss Harriman's plans as foolhardy: Nuclear rocket fuel is scarce as the space station that produces it blew up, also destroying the only existing spaceship. The necessary technology for a chemical-fueled rocket stretches the boundaries of current engineering. The endeavor is both incredibly costly and of uncertain profitability. One skeptic offers to sell \"all of my interest in the Moon...for fifty cents\"; Harriman accepts and tries to buy the other associates' interests as well. Strong and two others agree to back his plans. The technical problems are solvable with money and talent. To solve the tougher financial problems, Harriman exploits commercial and political rivalries. He implies to the Moka-Coka company, for example, that rival soft drink maker 6+ plans to turn the Moon into a massive billboard, using a rocket to scatter black dust on the surface in patterns. To an anti-Communist associate, he suggests that the Russians may print the hammer and sickle across the face of the Moon if they get to it first. To a television network, he offers the Moon as a reliable and uncensorable broadcasting station. Harriman seeks to avoid government ownership of the Moon. As it passes directly overhead only in a narrow band north and south of the equator, he uses a legal principle that states that property rights extend to infinity above a land parcel. On that basis, Mexico, Central and parts of South America, and other countries in those latitudes around the world, have a claim on the Moon. The United States also has a claim due to Florida and Texas. By arranging for many countries to assert their rights Harriman persuades the United Nations to, as a compromise, assign management of the Moon to his company. Money remains the main difficulty. Harriman liquidates his assets, risks bankruptcy, damages his marriage, and raises funds in numerous legitimate and semi-legitimate ways; \"I\", he says, \"would cheat, lie, steal, beg, bribedo anything to accomplish what we have accomplished\". Children donate money for a promise of all contributors' names engraved on a plaque left on the Moon. The names, however, will be microscopic in size. Harriman sells land and naming rights to craters, and plans to sell postal covers canceled on the Moon to collectors. He starts rumors that diamonds exist in moondust, intending to secretly place gems in the rocket to convince people that the rumors are true. Harriman will strenuously deny that the diamonds are from the Moon, being merely part of a scientific experiment; he expects people not to believe him, but he will not be guilty of actual fraud. Harriman wants to be on the first flight of the Pioneer but the ship only has room for one pilot, Leslie LeCroix. The multistage rocket launches from Peterson Field, near Colorado Springs, Colorado, lands on the Moon, and returns to Earth. Harriman is the first to open the rocket's hatch; the canceled postal covers were left behind to save weight and he needs to get them aboard surreptitiously. While doing so, he asks LeCroix for the \"lunar\" diamonds. The pilot complies, then produces real lunar diamonds as well. As Harriman predicted, once the first flight succeeds, many seek to invest in his venture to make more flights using a catapult launcher built on Pikes Peak. The next flight will begin a lunar colony. Harriman intends to be on the ship, but the majority owners of the venture object to his presence on the flight; he is too valuable to the company to risk in space. The rocket leaves without Harriman, who \"looks as Moses must have looked, when he gazed out over the promised land\"."

Although the science fiction film Destination Moon is generally described as being based on Heinlein's novel Rocket Ship Galileo, the story in fact bears a much closer resemblance to The Man Who Sold the Moon. However, the technology of The Man Who Sold the Moon is very different: its rocket is multi-staged, while Destination Moon uses a single-stage-to-orbit spaceship that takes off and lands vertically, both on Earth and the Moon. (Dialogue in the film makes it very clear that the spaceship is nuclear powered.)

At the invitation of a senior partner, he joins a strange men's club where the members, in addition to reading, chatting and playing pool and chess, like to tell stories, some of which range into the bizarre and macabre.  The club and its butler are also featured in King's short story \"The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands\". One Thursday before Christmas, the elderly physician Dr. Emlyn McCarron tells a story about an episode that took place early in his long and varied career: that of a patient, Sandra Stansfield, who was determined to give birth to her illegitimate child, no matter what, despite financial problems and social disapproval.  McCarron comes to admire her bravery and humor, and the implication is that he has even fallen a bit in love with her. Sandra masters Dr. McCarron's unusual (for the 1930s) breathing method intended to help her through childbirth. However, when she goes into labor and is on the way to the hospital on an icy winter night, her taxi crashes and she is decapitated.  McCarron arrives at the crash site and realizes that Sandra is somehow still alive.  Her lungs in her decapitated body are still pumping air, as her head, some feet away, is working to sustain the breathing method so that the baby can be born. McCarron manages to deliver the infant alive and well. On a sweet but haunting end note, Sandra whispers \"Thank you\"\u2014her severed head mouthing the words, which are distortedly heard from the throat jutting from her headless body.  McCarron is able to tell her that her baby is a boy and to see that she has registered this before she dies.  McCarron and his office nurse pay for the woman's burial, for she has no one else. The child is adopted, but despite the confidential nature of adoption records, McCarron is able to keep track of him over the years. When the man is \"not yet 45\", and an accomplished college professor, McCarron arranges to meet him socially. \"He had his mother's determination, gentlemen,\" he tells the club members, \"and his mother's hazel eyes.\""

After Jesus described the \"abomination that causes desolation\", he warns that the people of Judea should flee to the mountains as a matter of such urgency that they shouldn't even return to get things from their homes. Jesus also warned that if it happened in winter or on the Sabbath fleeing would be even more difficult. Jesus described this as a time of \"Great Tribulation\" worse than anything that had gone before. Jesus then states that immediately after the time of tribulation people would see a sign, \"the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken\". The statements about the sun and moon turning dark sound quite apocalyptic, as it appears to be a quote from the Book of Isaiah. The description of the sun, moon and stars going dark is also used elsewhere in the Old Testament. Joel wrote that this would be a sign before the great and dreadful Day of the Lord. The Book of Revelation also mentions the sun and moon turning dark during the sixth seal of the seven seals, but the passage adds more detail than the previous verses mentioned. Jesus states that after the time of tribulation and the sign of the Sun, Moon, and stars going dark the Son of Man would be seen arriving in the clouds with power and great glory. The Son of Man would be accompanied by the angels and at the trumpet call the angels would \"gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other\".() Although most scholars, and almost all Christians, read this as meaning that the gathering would include people not only from Earth but also from heaven, a few Christians, mostly modern American Protestant Premillennialists, have interpreted it to mean that people would be gathered from Earth and taken to heaven\u2014a concept known in their circles as the rapture. Most scholars see this as a quotation of a passage from the Book of Zechariah in which God (and the contents of heaven in general) are predicted to come to Earth and live among the elect, who by necessity are gathered together for this purpose."

        "content": "In the Olivet Discourse, Jesus was reported to have told his disciples, There is considerable debate about the correct translation of the word genea. The most common English translation is currently \"generation\", which seem to suggest that the author of the olivet discourse expected Jesus' second coming to be witnessed by Jesus' contemporaries. In most German Bibles however, genea is instead translated as \"family/lineage\" (geschlecht). Likewise for Danish, Swedish and Norwegian (sl\u00e6gt, sl\u00e4kte and slekt, respectively). The Danish linguist Iver Larsen argues that the word \"generation\" as it was used in the English King James Version of the Bible (1611) had a much wider meaning than it has today, and that the correct current translation of genea (in the specific context of the second coming story) should be \"kind of people.\" (specifically the \"good\" kind of people; the disciple's kind of people, who, like the words of Jesus, will endure through all the tribulations). In Psalm 14, the King James version clearly uses \"generation\" in this now outdated sense, when it declares that \"God is in the generation of the righteous.\" According to Larsen, the Oxford Universal Dictionary state that the latest attested use of genea in the sense of \"class, kind or set of persons\" took place in 1727. Larsen concludes that the meaning of \"generation\" in the English language has narrowed considerably since then. Bible scholar Philip La Grange du Toit argues that genea is mostly used to describe a timeless and spiritual family/lineage of good or bad people in The New Testament, and that this is the case also for the second coming discourse in Matthew 24. In contrast to Larsen however, he argues that the word genea here denotes the \"bad\" kind of people,\" because Jesus had used the word in that pejorative sense in the preceding context (chapter 23.) He also lists the main competing translation alternatives, and some of the scholars that supports the different views: \u2018This generation\u2019 refers to Jesus\u2019 contemporaries who would witness \u2018all these things\u2019 [\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c4\u03b1] as outlined in verses 4\u201331, including Jesus\u2019 second coming (Davies & Allison 1997:367\u2013368; Hare 1993:281; Maddox 1982:111\u2013115). Because Jesus\u2019 contemporaries did not witness his second coming, some contend that Jesus erred in his predictions (Luz 2005:209; cf. Schweitzer 1910:356\u2013364). \u2018This generation\u2019 refers to Jesus\u2019 contemporaries who would witness \u2018all these things\u2019 as outlined in verses 4\u201322 or 4\u201328, pointing to the destruction of the temple in 70 CE and everything leading up to it. Jesus\u2019 second coming (vv. 29\u201331) is thus excluded from \u2018all these things\u2019 (Blomberg 1992:364; Carson 1984:507; France 2007:930; Hagner 1995:715). \u2018This generation\u2019 points to the \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 (Jews or Judaeans), implying that they as a race would last until the Parousia (Hendriksen 1973:868\u2013869; Schweizer 1976:458). In patristic opinion, \u2018this generation\u2019 points to the church against which the gates of Hades would not prevail (cf. Chrysostom, Hom. Matt. 77:1; Eusebius, Frag. in Lc. ad loc). \u2018This generation\u2019 points to some future generation, from Matthew\u2019s perspective, that sees \u2018all these things\u2019 (Bock 1996:538\u2013539; Conzelmann 1982:105). The words \u2018take place\u2019 or \u2018have happened\u2019 [\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9] is interpreted as an ingressive aorist: \u2018to begin\u2019 or \u2018to have a beginning\u2019. In other words, \u2018all these things\u2019 would start to happen in the generation of Jesus\u2019 present disciples, but would not necessarily finish in their time (Cranfield 1954:291; Talbert 2010:270). \u2018This generation\u2019 points to a certain kind of people in accordance with the pejorative connotations to \u2018generation\u2019 [\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03ac] elsewhere in the gospel (Morris 1992:613; Nelson 1996:385; Rieske 2008:225; see, e.g., Mt 11:16; 12:39, 41\u201342, 45; 16:4; 17:17; 23:36). While DeBruyn (2010:190) and Lenski (1943:953) interpret the expression in a similar way, they connect \u2018this generation\u2019 to a certain kind of people from the \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 who resisted Jesus (cf. view 3 discussed earlier). In the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, Paul seems to envisage that he and the Christians to whom he was writing would see the resurrection of the dead within their own lifetimes: \"For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. (ESV)\" The Gospel of John however seems to downplay a rumor that one disciple (John) would live to see the second coming:"

        "content": "There are four quite different Christian eschatological views. Preterism is the belief that all of these predictions were fulfilled by the time Jerusalem fell in 70 AD. Preterism considers that most, if not all, prophecy has been fulfilled already, usually in relation to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70CE. Partial preterism says that most (but not all) Bible prophecy, including everything within Matthew 24, Daniel, and Revelation up to chapters 19 or 20, has already been fulfilled when Jerusalem was destroyed. Since it still includes belief in a future physical Second Coming of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the last judgment, partial preterism falls within the parameters of orthodoxy because it conforms to the early Christian creeds. Full preterism says all biblical prophecy was fulfilled by 70CE. It does not hold to a future judgment, return of Christ, or resurrection of the dead (at least not for non-Christians). Due to the belief that all biblical prophecy has been fulfilled, it is sometimes considered \"radical\" and usually described as \"unorthodox\" because it goes against the ecumenical creeds of early Christianity. Historicism considers that most prophecy has been or will be fulfilled during the present church age. It was the chief view of Protestants from the Reformation until the mid-19th century. Only among Seventh-day Adventists is historicism applied to current conservative Christian interpretation of Tribulation understanding. Futurism is the belief that the future Jesus predicted is the unfolding of events from trends that are already at work in contemporary human society. Futurism typically holds that all major unfulfilled prophecies will be fulfilled during a global time of catastrophe and war known as the Great Tribulation, in which many other prophecies will be fulfilled during or after the Millennium Reign of Jesus Christ. According to many futurists, many predictions are currently being fulfilled during the Church Age, in which lawlessness and apostasy are currently plaguing secular society. This is seen as a major sign of the approaching fulfillment of all other prophecies during the Tribulation. Within evangelical Christianity over the past 150 years, futurism has come to be the dominant view of prophecy. However, around the 1970s evangelical preterism\u2014the polar opposite of futurism\u2014was seen as a new challenge to the dominance of futurism, particularly within the Reformed tradition. Yet, futurism continues as the prevalent view for the time being. Futurists anticipate many coming events that will fulfill all eschatological prophecy: the seven-year period of tribulation, the Antichrist's global government the Battle of Armageddon, the Second Coming of Jesus, the millennial reign of Christ, the eternal state, and the two resurrections. In his popular book, The Late Great Planet Earth,  first published in 1970, evangelical Christian author Hal Lindsey argued that prophetical information in Matthew 24 indicates that the \u201cgeneration\u201d witnessing the \u201crebirth of Israel\u201d is the same generation that will observe the fulfillment of the \u201csigns\u201d referred to in \u2014and that would be consummated by the second coming of Christ in approximately 1988. He dated it from the \u201crebirth of Israel\u201d in 1948, and took a generation to be \u201csomething like forty years. \u201d Lindsey later stretched his forty-year timetable to as long as one hundred years, writing that he was no longer certain that the terminal \"generation\" commenced with the rebirth of Israel. Another detailed analysis, one written by evangelical pastor Ray Stedman, calls it the \"Olivet Prophecy: The most detailed prediction in the Bible\". According to Stedman: \"There are many predictive passages in both the Old and New Testaments, but none is clearer or more detailed than the message Jesus delivered from the Mount of Olives. This message was given during the turbulent events of the Lord's last week before the cross\". The Idealist sees no evidence of timing of prophetic events in the Bible. Thus they conclude that their timing cannot be determined in advance. Idealists see prophetic passages as being of great value in teaching truths about God to be applied to present life. Idealism is primarily associated with liberal scholarship, and is not a major factor in current evangelical Christian deliberation over when prophecy will be fulfilled. Within conservative, evangelical Christian thought, two opposite viewpoints of the Great Tribulation have been expressed in a debate between theologians Kenneth L. Gentry and Thomas Ice."

It was published under a pseudonym in the Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik (NZM) of Leipzig in September 1850 and was reissued in a greatly expanded version under Wagner's name in 1869.

In an April 1851 letter to Franz Liszt, Wagner gave the excuse that he used a pseudonym \"to prevent the question being dragged down by the Jews to a purely personal level\". At the time Wagner was living in exile in Zurich, on the run after his role in the 1849 revolution in Dresden. His article followed a series of essays in the NZM by his disciple Theodor Uhlig, attacking the music of Meyerbeer's opera Le proph\u00e8te and depicting its composer as a representative of \"Hebraic art-taste\". Wagner was particularly enraged by the success of Le proph\u00e8te in Paris, all the more so because he had earlier been an admirer of Meyerbeer, who had given him financial support and used his influence to get Wagner's early opera Rienzi, his first real success, staged in Dresden in 1841. Wagner was also emboldened by the death of Mendelssohn in 1847, the popularity of whose conservative style he felt was cramping the potential of German music. Although Wagner had shown virtually no sign of anti-Jewish prejudice previously (despite the claims by Rose in his book Wagner, Race and Revolution, and others), he was determined to build on Uhlig's articles and prepare a broadside that would attack his artistic enemies, embedded in what he took to be a populist Judeophobic context."

        "content": "explain to ourselves the involuntary repellence possessed for us by the nature and personality of the Jews, so as to vindicate that instinctive dislike which we plainly recognise as stronger and more overpowering than our conscious zeal to rid ourselves thereof. Wagner holds that Jews are unable to speak European languages properly and that Jewish speech took the character of an \"intolerably jumbled blabber\", a \"creaking, squeaking, buzzing snuffle\", incapable of expressing true passion. This, he says, debars them from any possibility of creating song or music. He also states: Although the peculiarities of the Jewish mode of speaking and singing come out the most glaringly in the commoner class of Jew, who has remained faithful to his father's stock, and though the cultured son of Jewry takes untold pains to strip them off, nevertheless they shew an impertinent obstinacy in cleaving to him. There is little novelty in these ideas, which are largely lifted from the theories of language and speech of the French Philosophes of the 18th century. They also follow on from ideas expressed in Wagner's earlier essay The Artwork of the Future, to the effect that those who are outside the Volk (community) are inimical to true Art. The music produced by composers such as Mendelssohn, whom Wagner damns with faint praise, is \"sweet and tinkling without depth\". Meyerbeer, who was still alive at the time of publication, is attacked savagely for his music (and for the fact that audiences enjoy it) but without being expressly named. The essay is riddled with the aggressiveness typical of many Judeophobic publications of the previous few centuries. However Wagner did introduce one striking new image, which was to be taken up after him by many later antisemitic authors: So long as the separate art of music had a real organic life-need in it [\u2026] there was nowhere to be found a Jewish composer... Only when a body\u2019s inner death is manifest, do outside elements win the power of lodgement in it\u2014yet merely to destroy it. Then, indeed, that body\u2019s flesh dissolves into a swarming colony of insect life: but who in looking on that body\u2019s self, would hold it still for living? Wagner gives some convoluted near-endorsements of the Jewish-born writers Heinrich Heine and Ludwig B\u00f6rne, stating that the former became a poet only because German culture had become inauthentic. It could thus be represented by a Jew, who understood from his very nature its cultural inauthenticity, but who also excoriated its corruption. In this, he was the \"conscience of Judaism\", just as Judaism is \"the evil conscience of our modern civilisation\". Wagner then goes on to refer to B\u00f6rne, a Jewish writer and journalist who converted to Christianity. He tells Jews to follow his example, recommending that they follow B\u00f6rne by helping to \"redeem\" German culture by abandoning Judaism. Without once looking back, take ye your part in this regenerative work of deliverance through self-annulment; then are we one and un-dissevered! But bethink ye, that only one thing can redeem you from your curse; the redemption of Ahasuerus \u2014 Going under! In the original version of 1850, instead of the word 'self-annulment', Wagner used the words 'the bloody struggle of self-annihilation' - displaying a rather more aggressive approach which was perhaps too blatant for the more widely known figure he had become by 1869, the date of the second version."

(Brendel had taught music history at the Conservatory since 1846.)  Apart from Moscheles' letter, Fischer has found virtually no other substantial response. The article, which Wagner had hoped would be a sensation, and bring him some money as a journalist, sank like a stone.

Although Wagner's personal letters contain occasional jibes about Jews and Judaism, there was no suggestion over future years that he was likely to return to the attack or revive his earlier anonymous article. However, in his notebook for 1868 (known as the 'Brown Book') there appear the ominous words \"Consider Judentum.\" It is not clear what provoked this. Among the contributing factors may be the death of his \u2018enemy\u2019 Meyerbeer in 1864, Wagner's own relative security under the patronage of the King of Bavaria, and increase in his personal confidence now that his Ring cycle was under way and he had completed his operas Tristan und Isolde and Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. An intriguing possibility is that, having received his mother's correspondence (which he subsequently burnt) from his sister in 1868, he discovered that his biological father was the actor and musician Ludwig Geyer, and feared that Geyer was Jewish (which he was not) and that he himself might be Jewish as well. He may therefore also have been influenced by thoughts of his wife Cosima, who was more stridently antisemitic than him."

        "content": "For reasons which remain unclear, in 1869 Wagner republished the essay with an addendum as long as the original, and under his own name. The first part was reprinted as in 1850, with some references toned down, as in the example already given. With a confidence lacking in the original frenetic effort, the second (new) part seeks to contextualise Wagner's anti-Jewish feelings in the setting of later nineteenth-century German politics, while continuing to snipe at the dead Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer and bringing in other dead musicians, including Schumann, on Wagner's side. He also attacked by name the critic Eduard Hanslick, bringing in reference to the latter's Jewish descent (which Hanslick then attempted to deny). Once again many of Wagner's supporters were in despair at the provocation. Even Cosima doubted that it was wise. By this time of course Wagner was a well-known figure and the reprint brought many counter-attacks, including: Joseph Engel, \"Richard Wagner, Jewishness in Music, a Defense\" (\"Richard Wagner, das Judentum in Musik, eine Abwehr\"); E. M. Oettinger, \"An Open Love-Letter to Richard Wagner\" (\"Offenes Billetdoux an Richard Wagner\", Dresden, 1869); and A. Truhart, \"Open Letter to Richard Wagner\" (\"Offener Brief an Richard Wagner\" St. Petersburg, 1869). However the fuss about the reprint was little more than a storm in a teacup. Far more important, in terms of publicising Wagner's anti-Jewish feelings, was his stream of essays and newspaper articles over the following years, up to and including that of his death in 1883, which directly or indirectly criticised Jewish individuals or the Jews as a whole. These coincided with the growth of antisemitism\u2014in the sense of a movement to withdraw the civic rights extended to Jews during the 19th century, and particularly on the unification of Germany in 1870\u2014as a significant force in German and Austrian politics. Antisemitic leaders indeed made approaches to Wagner requesting his support; although he never offered such support officially, neither did he dissociate himself from their policies."

        "content": "The article's first translator into English, W. Ashton Ellis, gave it the title 'Judaism in Music'. This translation has seemed unsatisfactory to some scholars. For example, the writer Barry Millington refers to it as 'Jewishness in Music'; David Conway argues for 'Jewry in Music'. There are two principal reasons for concern about Ashton's translation of the title. Firstly, 'Judaism' in English carries the meaning of 'the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or the polity of the Jews', a topic on which Wagner does not touch. 'Judentum' however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning\u2014roughly analogous to the nonce English word 'Jewdom' (cf. Christendom) and including the concept of the social practices of the Jews. In particular it carried the pejorative sense of 'haggling' or 'marketeering'\u2014it was used in this sense for example by Karl Marx. Wagner may have wished to refer to this sense, in effect using the word as a pun, as the commercialism implied forms the topic of the essay as a whole. It is therefore important to bear in mind the full range of implications of the title-word 'Judentum' in considering the essay as a whole. 'Jewishness', while not ideal, is perhaps a closer English approximation to 'Judentum' than 'Judaism'."

Included amongst these were his favorite conductor Hermann Levi, the pianists Carl Tausig and , the writer Heinrich Porges and very many others. In his autobiography, written between 1865 and 1870, he declared that his acquaintance with the Jew Samuel Lehrs whom he knew in Paris in the early 1840s was \u2018one of the most beautiful friendships of my life\u2019. There remain, therefore, elements of the enigmatic, and of the opportunist, in Wagner's personal attitude towards Jews. The notoriety in Germany of Wagner's animus against Jews is attested to in Theodor Fontane's novel Effi Briest (1895). Effi's husband Baron von Instetten asks her to play Wagner because of \"Wagner's stand on the Jewish question\"."

        "content": "'Das Judenthum' was an embarrassment to the early Wagnerites and was rarely reprinted in the early 20th century, except as part of his collected works. Fischer has found no significant critical comment on the essay. Before the Nazi period there was just one reprint of the essay itself, in Weimar in 1914. It is therefore very unlikely that it was read by Adolf Hitler or any of the Nazi hierarchy during the development of the Nazi movement (or later) and there is no evidence of this. During the Nazi period there were just two publications: in Berlin in 1934 and in Leipzig in 1939. Neither of these seems to have been a large edition. 'Das Judenthum' is not quoted or mentioned by early writers on Nazism in the 1950s such as Hannah Arendt; the interpretation that he intended murder was never attributed to him before the Nazi policy of physical extermination. Wagner may have meant no more than 'Jews must sacrifice their separate identity for the common good'. Interest in the work seems to have revived in the 1960s with new awareness of the Holocaust following the Eichmann trial. In this context some have suggested that Wagner's  advice for Jews to 'go under' 'like Ahasuerus' was intended as a call for their extermination, as planned by the Nazi regime, but there is no justification for this. In fact the 'Ahasuerus' Wagner may have had in mind was a character from a play (Halle und Jerusalem) by Achim von Arnim, a 'good' Jew who voluntarily sacrifices himself saving other characters from a fire. The essay was omitted from the 'complete' edition of Wagner's prose works issued in 1983 on the centenary of his death, because of its perceived link with Nazi antisemitism. A scholarly critical edition, with background material and contemporary comments, was prepared by Jens Malte Fischer in 2000. Some writers (for example, Bryan Magee) have sought to make a qualified defence of Wagner's originality of thought in 'Das Judenthum', despite acknowledging its malevolence. However, a full consideration of 'Das Judenthum' 's contents weakens this argument. Whether 'Das Judenthum' is to be regarded as a major milestone in German antisemitism remains a subject for debate. Wagner's attitude to the Jews in general was highly equivocal. His later writings, published when he was a well-known and influential figure, frequently contain aggressive anti-Jewish comments, although at the same time he maintained a circle of Jewish-born colleagues and admirers. Adolf Hitler presented himself as an admirer of Wagner's music, and is said to have claimed that \"there is only one legitimate predecessor to National Socialism: Wagner\". Wagner's music was frequently played during Nazi rallies (as was the music of Beethoven, also 'appropriated' by the Nazis), and other Nazi events. Germans of the Nazi era, even if they knew nothing about music and nothing of Wagner's writings, were presented with a clear image of Wagner as a great German. Wagner's daughter-in-law, Winifred Wagner, (who never met the composer), was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and ran the Bayreuth Festival of Wagner's music from the death of her husband, Siegfried, in 1930 until the end of World War II, when she was ousted. During the Nazi regime, the Nazi hierarchy was frequently required to attend performances of Wagner operas (although they did not necessarily respond enthusiastically). Because of these factors, performances of Wagner's works in the modern state of Israel did not occur during the twentieth century, by consensus. In recent years many Israelis have argued that it is possible to appreciate his musical talents, without implying acceptance of his political or social beliefs. A public performance in Tel Aviv in 2001 of Wagner's prelude to Tristan und Isolde, conducted as an unprogrammed encore by Daniel Barenboim, left its audience partly delighted, partly enraged. A version of the essay title's translation, Jewry in Music is deliberately used by the music historian David Conway as the title of his history of Jewish musicians in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Jonas Karlsson has commented \"Admittedly  [Conway's book] comes some hundred years too late as a reply to Wagner, yet in its form it may nevertheless be one of the most effective replies imaginable\"."

Its 374 individual chapters were published in 34 tank\u014dbon volumes. It tells the story of Ataru Moroboshi, and the alien Lum, who believes she is Ataru's wife after he accidentally proposes to her. The series makes heavy use of Japanese mythology, culture and puns. It was adapted into an anime television series produced by Kitty Films and broadcast on Fuji Television affiliates from 1981 to 1986 with 195 episodes. Twelve OVAs and six theatrical films followed, and the series was released on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, and Blu-ray Disc in Japan. The manga series was republished in different formats in Japan. Viz Media released the series in North America in the 1990s under the names Lum and The Return of Lum, but dropped it after nine volumes. They re-licensed the manga and began releasing an omnibus edition under its original title with new translations in 2019. The television series, OVAs, and five of the films were released in North America with English subtitles, as well as a dub for the films by AnimEigo. They provided extensive notes on the series to allow people to understand the many cultural references and jokes in the series that would not normally be understood by non-Japanese. The remaining film, Beautiful Dreamer, was released bilingually by Central Park Media. Five of the films, as well as the OVAs, are available from MVM Films in the United Kingdom.

        "content": "An alien race known as the Oni arrive on Earth to invade the planet. Instead of taking over the planet by force, the Oni give humans a chance to fight for the rights to the planet by taking part in a competition. The competition is a variant of the game of tag (known as \"the game of the Oni\" in Japanese), in which the human player must touch the horns on the head of the Oni player within one week. The computer-selected human player is Ataru Moroboshi, a lecherous, unlucky and academically unsuccessful high school student from the fictional  in Nerima, Japan, and the Oni player is Princess Lum, daughter of the leader of the alien invaders. Despite his initial reluctance to take part in the competition, Ataru becomes interested in the game when he meets Lum. When the competition begins, Lum surprises everyone by flying away and Ataru finds himself unable to catch her. Before the last day of the competition, Ataru's girlfriend Shinobu Miyake encourages Ataru by pledging to marry him if he wins. On the final day of the competition, Ataru wins the game by stealing Lum's bikini top, which prevents her from protecting her horns in favor of protecting her modesty. In celebrating his victory, Ataru expresses his joy at being able to get married; however, Lum misinterprets this as a proposal from Ataru and accepts on live television. Despite the misunderstanding, Lum falls in love with Ataru and moves into his house. Despite Ataru's lack of interest in Lum and attempts to rekindle his relationship with Shinobu, Lum frequently interferes and Shinobu loses interest in Ataru. Still, Ataru's flirtatious nature persists despite Lum's attention. Lum attempts to stop him from flirting, which results in Ataru receiving powerful electric shock attacks from Lum as punishment. Two characteristics of Ataru are particularly strong: his pervertedness and his bad luck that draws to him all weirdos of the planet, the spirit world and even the galaxy. Later Lum begins attending the same school as Ataru despite his objections. Lum develops a fan base of admirers among the boys of the school, including Shutaro Mendo, the rich and handsome heir to a large corporation that all the girls from Tomobiki have a crush on. Despite their romantic interest, none of Lum's admirers will risk upsetting Lum by trying to force her and Ataru apart, although this does not stop them from trying to get Ataru punished due to his bad behavior, and interfering every time they get close to him."

        "content": "In 1977, Rumiko Takahashi created the short story Those Selfish Aliens that was nominated for Shogakukan's Best New Comic Artist award. This would serve as the basis for creating Urusei Yatsura which was first published a year later when Takahashi was 21 years old. The series was her first major work, having previously only published short stories and is a combination of romantic comedy, science fiction, suburban life, and Japanese folktales. The title of the series roughly translates to \"Those Obnoxious Aliens\". The title is written using specific kanji instead of hiragana to create a Japanese pun. The series first appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday in September 1978. At the start of the series it was only scheduled to run for 5 chapters. Ataru was the central character and each chapter would feature a different strange character. The character of Lum was only going to appear in the first chapter and was not in the second chapter; however, Takahashi decided to re-include her in the third chapter. The series was not an instant success and chapters were initially published sporadically. Between May and September 1978 she simultaneously worked on a series called Dust Spot; however, the increasing popularity of Urusei Yatsura caused her to focus on Urusei and the series became a regular serialization from the middle of 1979. Takahashi said that she had been dreaming about the overall universe of Urusei Yatsura since she was very young. She said that the series \"really includes everything I ever wanted to do. I love science fiction because sci-fi has tremendous flexibility. I adopted the science fiction-style for the series because then I could write any way I wanted to\". She wanted the reader to be completely surprised by the next panel and used slapstick comedy to create a reaction in the reader. When Takahashi ran out of ideas she would create new characters. Takahashi shared a small 150-square-foot apartment with her assistants, and slept in a closet due to a lack of space. While writing Urusei Yatsura she also began work on Maison Ikkoku and used this experience as well as her university experience as the basis for the setting of that series. Character names often carry extra meanings used to describe a characters personality or other traits. For example, the name Ataru Moroboshi refers to being hit by a star, a reference to the aliens and other people who gather around him. The name Shinobu suggests a patient character; however, this in contrast to the character's actual personality. In a similar way, the setting for the series is \"Tomobiki\", which means \"friend taking\". Tomobiki is also the name of a superstitious day in the old Japanese calendar system considered to have \"no winners or losers\" and occurred on every sixth day. Funerals rarely took place on this day as it was believed more deaths would soon follow. Lum was named after Agnes Lum, a bikini model during the 1970s. Lum's use of the English word \"Darling\" in reference to Ataru was to emphasize her status as a foreigner, as well as a play on the name Darrin, the husband figure from Bewitched. In 1994, Takahashi stated that she will not produce any more content for the series. The characters of Megane, Perm, Kakugari and Chibi are recurring characters throughout the anime adaptation; however, in the manga they are nameless fans of Lum who appear less after Mendo is introduced. In contrast the character Kosuke Shirai plays a large role in the manga, but does not appear in the anime series. His role is often performed by Perm. The second half of the anime is closer to the manga than the first half."

It ended in 1987's eighth issue on February 4, after publishing 374 chapters and almost 6,000 pages. A total of 34 individual volumes with 11 chapters each were released in tank\u014dbon format between 1980 and March 1987. After the tenth anniversary of start of the series, it was printed in 15 wideban editions between July 1989 and August 1990. Each volume contained around 25 chapters, and were printed on higher-quality paper, with new inserts. A bunkoban edition of the series was released over 17 volumes between August 1998 and December 1999. Each volume contains forewords by other manga creators discussing the influence the series had on them. A \"My First Big\" edition was printed between July 2000 and September 2004. This edition was similar to the tank\u014dbon but used low-quality paper and were sold at a low price. A shinsoban edition over 34 volumes was released between November 17, 2006 and March 18, 2008. This edition was also similar to the tank\u014dbon but used new cover artwork and included a section that displayed artwork from current manga artists. After requests from fans, Viz Media licensed the series for release in English across North America under the title of Lum * Urusei Yatsura. Despite a strong start, the series was dropped after 8 issues. The series was then reintroduced in the monthly Viz publication Animerica and because of the long gap the series was retitled The Return of Lum. To start, chapters were published monthly in Animerica; however, due to reader feedback and an increased popularity of the series it was decided to release it as an individual monthly publication. The English release finished in 1998 and is now out of print. The first 11 volumes of the Japanese release were covered, but several chapters were excluded and a total 9 English volumes of the series were released. On July 19, 2018, Viz announced that they re-licensed the manga with plans to release it in a 2-in-1 omnibus edition with new translations. Based on the Japanese shinsoban, the first volume was published on February 19, 2019."

The series' peak readership figures were with 15-year-olds, but the distribution of readers was skewed towards older males. She said that this was \"very easy\" for her since the ages of the readers were similar to her own age; Takahashi expressed happiness that people from her generation enjoy the series. Takahashi added that she felt disappointment that Urusei Yatsura did not gain much interest from children, believing that the series may have been too difficult for them. She believed that \"manga belongs fundamentally to children, and maybe Urusei Yatsura just didn't have what it took to entertain them\". The manga received the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1980. In 1985, the franchise generated  () in merchandise sales. In Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson referred to Urusei Yatsura as \"A slapstick combination of sci-fi, fairy-tale and ghost-story elements with plenty of cute girls.\" He also noted that Lum is \"the original otaku dream girl.\" He awarded the series four stars out of four. Graham Higgins of The Independent praised the series. He further wrote that the experience of reading Urusei Yatsura is \"a bit like channel-hopping between The Outer Limits, Neighbours, and Star Trek.\" In an interview with Ex.org, Fred Schodt expressed surprise at the popularity of the original English release of the manga as he believed the cultural differences would be a problem. Reviewing the 2019 English release of the manga, Arpad Lep of Comics Beat called Urusei Yatsura an impressive, essential debut by a living legend of comics, where \"many themes and archetypes integral to her whole body of writing emerge already very well-developed.\" He compared its story to those by Shigeru Mizuki and its art, which he had strong praise for and noted gets better in just the first two volumes alone, to that of Go Nagai. Lep said Takahashi nails the many gags and physical comedy, with the series' stability from the never-changing sitcom elements of \"Disappointed parents. Put-upon girlfriend. Insatiable yokai. Weird uncle. And our hero, a total loser\" being fun and always staying fresh. RightStuf wrote that Takahashi excels at creating characters who play off of each other perfectly and Urusei Yatsuras normally \"calm [and] innocent\", but hot-tempered, Lum serves as a wonderful foil to the \"idiotic, lecherous, and lazy\" Ataru. Nick Benefield of Operation Rainfall enjoyed that each chapter stands on its own and can largely be read in any order, as well as the manga's \"heavy-handed usage\" of puns, visual gags, and parodies of other works. He took issue with some of Viz's English translation decisions, not enjoying the amount of American slang used and feeling that terms such as \"Oni\" and \"Karasutengu\" should have been left untranslated, but acknowledged its improvement over their original 1990s translation. In a more critical review of the first volume, Elias Rosner of Multiversity Comics felt it is obviously a debut work where Takahashi does not find her footing until chapter six. He praised her clear artwork, facial expressions and comedic timing for slapstick comedy, but noted a lack of character development due to episodic chapters and felt the verbal jokes did not translate well. He gave it a 6.8 out of 10 explaining that it \"does a brilliant job of introducing the absurdity of the world and the endearing obnoxiousness of its characters while being mired by the dated nature of its portrayal of Ataru's lechery, its flimsy story, and its simplistic characterizations.\""

In 1984, the film Urusei Yatsura: Only You took fifth and the TV anime took sixth. While the TV series did not appear in the 1985 Anime Grand Prix, the film Beautiful Dreamer came in third. In 1986, the show reappeared in sixth place and the third film Remember My Love took third place. In 1987, the series went down to eighth place. The series received two additional awards as part of the Anime Grand Prix. In 1982, its theme song \"Lum no Love Song\" was voted best anime song. In 1983, the sixty-seventh episode was voted best episode. A 2019 NHK poll of 210,061 people saw Urusei Yatsura named Takahashi's fourth best animated work, with Beautiful Dreamer in fifth. Christina Carpenter of THEM Anime Reviews praised the anime adaptation's characters and humor and noted the influence the series had on other series over the years. Carpenter summarized the series as an \"Original and unapologetically Japanese classic that earns every star we can give\" and awarded the series five stars out of five. In The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917, Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy viewed the anime as \"a Japanese Simpsons for its usage of domestic humor and made note of AnimEigo's attention to providing notes for those unfamiliar with Japanese culture. They summarized the series as \"a delight from beginning to end\" that \"absolutely deserves its fan favorite status.\" In reviewing AnimEigo's home video releases, Peter Nichols of The New York Times thought that the series was \"relatively restrained\" compared to their other releases. In a feature on the series for Anime Invasion, McCarthy recommended it as being \"the first, the freshest and the funniest\" of Takahashi's works and for its large cast, stories and use as a cultural and historical resource. Writing in Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke: Experiencing Contemporary Japanese Animation, Susan J. Napier dedicated several pages to discussion of the series, regarding it as \"a pioneering work in the magical girlfriend genre.\" Napier contrasted the series to Western shows such as Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie, highlighting their harmonious resolution to the chaos in comparison to Urusei Yatsuras \"out of control\" ending to each episode. Napier later compared the series to other magical girlfriend series such as Ah! My Goddess and Video Girl Ai. Fred Patten writing in Watching Anime, Reading Manga: 25 Years of Essays and Reviews credited the series with being the first program to inspire translations from fans. Patten also credited the series for introducing the phenomenon of using anime to advertise pop songs, claiming it was a deliberate decision by Kitty Films. Writing further about the series for the website Cartoon Research, Patten noted that the series was aimed at adults who could buy their own merchandise, as opposed to being subsidized by toy sales like many other shows at the time. Like Napier, Patten compared the series to Bewitched, but also to Sabrina the Teenage Witch."

Tokyo Movie Shinsha produced the series Galaxy High School for CBS as an attempt to create a similar series for the American market. The school scenario is reversed to be based around humans attending a high school for aliens. In 1992, the singer Matthew Sweet released the single \"I've Been Waiting\", the video of which features images of Lum from the series. Lum also makes smaller appearances in his videos for \"The Ugly Truth\", as a keychain and \"Sick of Myself\", in a framed picture on his wall. In 1993, a band from Glasgow formed under the name \"Urusei Yatsura\" as a tribute. On Star Trek: The Next Generation, anime references were frequently added as in-jokes and homages by Senior Illustrator Rick Sternbach. In the episode \"Up the Long Ladder\", two ships named Urusei Yatsura and Tomobiki can be seen on a graphical display. Another reference appears in the episode \"The Icarus Factor\" where William Riker and his father have an Anbo-Jitsu match, a fictional futuristic sightless sport that takes place in a ring where each fighter uses a stick to attack the other.

The series makes heavy use of Japanese literature, folklore, history and pop culture. Examples of literature and folklore include The Tale of Genji and Urashima Tar\u014d. Many of the characters in the series are derived from mythological creatures. In some cases the creatures themselves appeared, and in other cases a character was designed to incorporate the characteristics of a mythological creature. Stories and situations made use of these mythological elements to create jokes and draw comparisons with the original mythology. For example, the Oni choose tag to decide their contest with Earth because the Japanese word for Tag, Onigokko, means \"game of the Oni\". When Ataru grabs Lum's horns during their contest and she misunderstands his statement that he can get married, it is a reference to the myth that grabbing the horns of an Oni will make your dream come true."

        "content": "The first seed of the story's first chapter The Horror in Clay came from one of Lovecraft's own dreams he had in 1919, which he described briefly in two different letters sent to his friend Rheinhart Kleiner on May 21 and December 14, 1920. In the dream, Lovecraft is visiting an antiquity museum in Providence, attempting to convince the aged curator there to buy an odd bas-relief Lovecraft himself had sculpted. The curator initially scoffs at him for trying to sell something recently made to a museum of antique objects. Lovecraft then remembers himself answering the curator with the response \"Why do you say that this thing is new? The dreams of men are older than brooding Egypt or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon, and this was fashioned in my dreams.\" This can be compared to what the character of Henry Anthony Wilcox tells the main character's uncle while showing him his sculpted bas-relief for help in reading hieroglyphs on it which came through Wilcox's own fantastical dreams: \"It is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon.\" Lovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own Commonplace Book at first in August 1925, which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted. In a footnote for his writing down of his own dream, Lovecraft then finished with the suggestion \"Add good development & describe nature of bas-relief\" to himself for future reference. Cthulhu Mythos scholar Robert M. Price claims the irregular sonnet \"The Kraken\", published in 1830 by Alfred Tennyson, was a major inspiration, since both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age. S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz cited other literary inspirations: Guy de Maupassant's \"The Horla\" (1887), which Lovecraft described in Supernatural Horror in Literature as concerning \"an invisible being who...sways the minds of others, and seems to be the vanguard of a horde of extraterrestrial organisms arrived on Earth to subjugate and overwhelm mankind\"; and Arthur Machen's \"The Novel of the Black Seal\" (1895), which uses the same method of piecing together of disassociated knowledge (including a random newspaper clipping) to reveal the survival of a horrific ancient being. It is also assumed he got inspiration from William Scott-Elliot's The Story of Atlantis (1896) and The Lost Lemuria (1904), which Lovecraft read in 1926 shortly before he started to work on the story. Price also notes that Lovecraft admired the work of Lord Dunsany, who wrote The Gods of Pegana (1905), which depicts a god constantly lulled to sleep to avoid the consequences of its reawakening. Another Dunsany work cited by Price is A Shop in Go-by Street (1919), which stated \"the heaven of the gods who sleep\", and \"unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber\". The \"slight earthquake\" mentioned in the story is likely the 1925 Charlevoix\u2013Kamouraska earthquake. S.T. Joshi has also cited A. Merritt's novella The Moon Pool (1918) which Lovecraft 'frequently rhapsodied about'. Joshi says that, 'Merritt's mention of a \"moon-door\" that, when tilted, leads the characters into a lower region of wonder and horror seems similar to the huge door whose inadvertent opening by the sailors causes Cthulhu to emerge from R'lyeh'. Edward Guimont has argued that H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds was an influence on \"The Call of Cthulhu\", citing the thematic similarities of ancient, powerful, but indifferent aliens associated with deities; physical similarities between Cthulhu and the Martians; and the plot detail of a ship ramming an alien in a temporarily successful but ultimately futile gesture."

        "content": "The story's narrator, Francis Wayland Thurston, recounts his discovery of various notes left behind by his great uncle, George Gammell Angell, a prominent professor of Semitic languages at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who died during the winter of 1926, suspecting eldritch goings-on after being bumped into by a \"nautical-looking negro\". The first chapter, \"The Horror in Clay\", concerns a small bas-relief sculpture found among the notes, which the narrator describes: \"My somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature. ... A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings.\u201d The sculpture is the work of Henry Anthony Wilcox, a student at the Rhode Island School of Design, who based his creation on a  delirious dream of \"great Cyclopean cities of titanic blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror.\u201d References to both Cthulhu and R'lyeh are included in letters written by Wilcox. Angell also discovers reports of \"outre mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania\" around the world (in New York City, \"hysterical Levantines\" mob police; in California, a Theosophist colony dress in white robes while awaiting a \"glorious fulfillment\"). The second chapter, \"The Tale of Inspector Legrasse\", discusses the first time the Professor had heard the word \"Cthulhu\" and seen a similar image. At the 1908 meeting of the American Archaeological Society in St. Louis, Missouri, a New Orleans police official named John Raymond Legrasse asked the assembled antiquarians to identify an idol carved from a mysterious greenish-black stone. Legrasse had discovered the relic months before in the swamps south of New Orleans, during his raid on a supposed voodoo cult. The idol resembles Wilcox's sculpture, and represented a \"thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters.\u201d On November 1, 1907, Legrasse led a party of fellow policemen in search of several women and children who disappeared from a squatter community. The police found the victims' \"oddly marred\" bodies being used in a ritual where 100 men\u2014all of a \"mentally aberrant type\"\u2014were \"braying, bellowing, and writhing\" and repeatedly chanting the phrase: \"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn\". After killing five of the participants and arresting 47 others, Legrasse interrogated the men before learning \"the central idea of their loathsome faith\": \"They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men ... and ... formed a cult which had never died ... hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were ready, and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him.\" The prisoners identify the confiscated idol as Cthulhu himself, and translate their mysterious phrase as \"In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\" One particularly talkative cultist, known as Old Castro, named the center of their cult as Irem, the City of Pillars in Arabia, and referred to a phrase in the Necronomicon: \"That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die.\u201d One of the academics present at the meeting, William Channing Webb, a professor of anthropology at Princeton, states that during an 1860 expedition to the western coast of Greenland, he encountered \"a singular tribe of degenerate Eskimos whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness\". Webb claims the Greenland cult possessed both the same chant and a similar \"hideous\" fetish. Thurston, the narrator, reflects that \"My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as I wish it still were.\u201d In the third chapter, \"The Madness from the Sea\", Thurston reads an article dated April 18, 1925, from the Sydney Bulletin, an Australian newspaper. The article reports the discovery of a derelict ship in the Pacific Ocean with only one survivor\u2014a Norwegian sailor named Gustaf Johansen, second mate on board the Emma, a schooner which originally sailed from Auckland, New Zealand. On March 22, the Emma encountered a heavily armed yacht, the Alert, crewed by \"a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes\" from Dunedin. After being attacked by the Alert without provocation, the crew of the Emma killed everyone aboard, but lost their own ship in the battle. Commandeering their opponent's vessel, the surviving crewmembers travel on and arrive at an uncharted island in the vicinity of . With the exception of Johansen and a fellow sailor (who then died as they made their way back to Auckland, New Zealand due to madness from seeing whatever was on that uncharted island), the remaining crewmembers perish on the island. Johansen never reveals the cause of their death. Thurston travels to New Zealand and then Australia, where at the Australian Museum he views a statue retrieved from the Alert with a \"cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal\". While in Oslo,  Thurston learns that Johansen died suddenly during an encounter with two Lascars near the Gothenburg docks. Johansen's widow provides Thurston with a manuscript written by her late husband, which reveals the fate of everyone aboard the Emma. The uncharted island is described as \"a coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror\u2014the nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh\". The crew struggle in comprehending the non-Euclidean geometry of their surroundings. When one of the sailors accidentally opens a \"monstrously carven portal\", he releases Cthulhu: \"It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway. ... The stars were right again, and what an age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by accident. After vigintillions of years, Great Cthulhu was loose again and ravening for delight.\" Before fleeing with his crewmembers, almost all of whom are killed, Johansen describes Cthulhu as \"a mountain [that] walked or stumbled\". Johansen and a sailor named Briden climb aboard the yacht before sailing away. However, Cthulhu dives into the ocean and pursues their fleeing vessel. Fortunately, Johansen turns his yacht around and rams it into the creature's head, which bursts with \"a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish\"\u2014only to immediately begin regenerating. The Alert escapes from R'lyeh, with Briden having gone insane and dying soon afterwards. After finishing the manuscript, Thurston realizes he's now a possible target, thinking: \"I know too much, and the cult still lives.\""

        "content": "Lovecraft regarded the short story as \"rather middling\u2014not as bad as the worst, but full of cheap and cumbrous touches\". Weird Tales editor Farnsworth Wright first rejected the story, and only accepted it after writer Donald Wandrei, a friend of Lovecraft's, falsely claimed that Lovecraft was thinking of submitting it elsewhere. The published story was regarded by Robert E. Howard (the creator of Conan) as \"a masterpiece, which I am sure will live as one of the highest achievements of literature.... Mr. Lovecraft holds a unique position in the literary world; he has grasped, to all intents, the worlds outside our paltry ken\". Lovecraft scholar Peter Cannon regarded the story as \"ambitious and complex...a dense and subtle narrative in which the horror gradually builds to cosmic proportions\", adding \"one of [Lovecraft's] bleakest fictional expressions of man's insignificant place in the universe\". French novelist Michel Houellebecq, in his book H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life, described the story as the first of Lovecraft's \"great texts\". Canadian mathematician Benjamin K. Tippett noted that the phenomena described in Johansen's journal may be interpreted as \"observable consequences of a localized bubble of spacetime curvature\", and proposed a suitable mathematical model. E. F. Bleiler has referred to \"The Call of Cthulhu\" as \"a fragmented essay with narrative inclusions\"."

        "content": "Parts of the story were adapted in Eerie #4 by Archie Goodwin and Gray Morrow and in The Avengers #88 by Harlan Ellison, Roy Thomas, and Sal Buscema. In 1981, Chaosium published the tabletop role-playing game \"Call of Cthulhu\" by Sandy Petersen based on the story as well as other Cthulhu mythos writing by Lovecraft and others. Alberto Breccia illustrated an eleven-page story in 1974. In the season 2 episode of The Real Ghostbusters, \"Collect Call of Cthulhu,\" the Ghostbusters encounter the cult of Cthulhu and Cthulhu himself after the Necronomicon is stolen from an exhibit at The New York Public Library.  In order to learn how to defeat Cthulhu, Ray Stantz goes to a dealer in old pulps to obtain a copy of the Weird Tales issue, which he had read when he was a child, but the copy is missing the last page. Ray remembers Cthulhu being electrocuted, and they trap Cthulhu at the Wonder Wheel and electrocute it with their proton packs.  \"Uh oh, we just killed their god,\" Peter Venkman says as the angry cultists attack, but  NYPD arrives and arrests the cultists.  The episode was written by Michael Reaves. The story was produced as a silent film of the same name in 2005, and as a 1920s-style radio drama, Dark Adventure Radio Theatre: The Call of Cthulhu, in 2012. In 2005, the survival horror video game Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth was released for Xbox and Windows PC. Indie game developer Zeboyd Games created the role-playing game Cthulhu Saves the World, which was released on December 30, 2010 on Xbox Live.  Cthulhu, the squid-faced, winged god created by H. P. Lovecraft emerges from the sea after centuries of slumber only to find his dark powers immediately sealed away by a mysterious holy wizard. A narrator then informs the player that the only way to break the curse is to become a true hero. Quickly breaking the fourth wall, Cthulhu informs the narrator that he was eavesdropping and now knows how to break the curse. Zeboyd officially announced Cthulhu Saves Christmas, a prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World, on their personal website on July 29, 2019. It was subsequently released on PC on December 23, 2019. In the side-scrolling JRPG, Cthulhu teams up with Santa Claus\u2019s granddaughter to stop Jack Frost before Christmas is cancelled forever. Along the way he fights Krampus, Mari Lwyd, and other \u201cChristmas League of Evil villains\u201d in turn-based combat. He also builds \u201cR'lyehtionship\u201d levels with his friends. Call Girl of Cthulhu, released in 2014, was an indie horror film directed by Chris LaMartina, loosely based on Lovecraft's writings. Thrash metal band Metallica released an instrumental track called \"The Call of Ktulu\" on their 1984 album Ride the Lightning. In addition, they released \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" on their 1986 album Master of Puppets, \"All Nightmare Long\" on 2008's Death Magnetic, and \"Dream No More\" on 2016's Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, all dedicated to Lovecraft's Cthulhu, as well as the band's ex-bassist, Cliff Burton, who died in a bus accident in 1986, while touring in support of their album Master of Puppets. Metal Band Iron Maiden used the text \"That is not dead which can eternal lie, yet with strange aeons even death may die\" as an inscription on a gravestone on the cover of their album \"Live After Death\" (1985).  Also H.P. Lovecraft is mentioned as the writer. In 2018, a survival horror role-playing video game called Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game was developed for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows PC. In 2020, elements of The Call of Cthulhu were adapted in the science fiction horror film Underwater, directed by William Eubank and released by 20th Century Fox. In 2018, the villain Black Manta in the movie Aquaman directed by James Wan and released by DC quotes \"The Call of Chulthu\": \"loathsomeness waits, and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men\"."

The stress of this way of life gets to him and he suffers a nervous breakdown. Though he improves, he can't stand to see or hear about money, as he now associates it with all the troubles that got him to this point. In order to heal, he searches for a place where money has no influence. Tralla La may be such a place, where a peaceful society without a monetary system is rumored to exist. Scrooge and his nephews, who are there to support his healing, finally locate the mythical place in a deep valley high in the Himalayas and arrive by parachute. There, they get acquainted with a more peaceful existence than to which they were accustomed. However, as Scrooge seems to be healing, he doesn't realize  he brought his troubles with him. He brought bottles of his medication along. The bottle caps he discards are considered rare treasures in Tralla La and become the basis of a new monetary system. The inhabitants of Tralla La become obsessed with these new treasures. To solve the issue, Scrooge has planes drop one billion bottle caps, but this becomes too many, and the inhabitants become angry, as their fields are now covered with caps. The Ducks must flee, as they apparently cannot find peace even in an Earthly paradise."

        "content": "A number of previous stories by Barks presented Scrooge's way of life as rather stressful, but this is the first story where this seems to be getting on his nerves. This is certainly not the last, but subsequent stories rarely focus on it. Scrooge's effort this time is not to gain treasure, but find some peace and regain his health. However, as so often presented in Barks tales, in trying to escape his problems he only manages to carry them with him. Tralla La's (based on Shangri-La) inhabitants prove to share the human characteristic of greed, while Barks is allowed some bitter commentary on human nature and the impact of \"inventing\" money. The theme of never finding peace no matter how hard the characters try is a running theme in Barks' tales, but here it takes center place. It is considered among Barks' most memorable because of its view of humanity, paradise, and the vulnerability of his characters. This story features the first appearance of that inexhaustible font of knowledge, The Junior Woodchucks' Guidebook. The story was later adapted into an episode of DuckTales. Don Rosa wrote a sequel to the story, Return To Xanadu, in which Tralla La is revealed to be the valley of Xanadu. Return to Xanadu was first published in the United States in Uncle Scrooge #261-262 (October\u2013November 1991) and reprinted in #357 (September, 2006)."

The British cultural-artifact status of the poem is evidenced by the parodies of the poem, and by its popularity among Britons. T. S. Eliot included the poem in his 1941 collection A Choice of Kipling's Verse. In India, a framed copy of the poem was affixed to the wall before the study desk in the cabins of the officer cadets at the National Defence Academy at Pune and the Indian Naval Academy at Ezhimala. In Britain, the third and fourth lines of the second stanza of the poem: \"If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster / and treat those two impostors just the same\" are written on the wall of the players' entrance to the Centre Court at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, where the Wimbledon Championships are held. These same lines appear at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York, where the US Open was played. The first verse is set, in granite setts, into the pavement of the promenade in Westward Ho! in Devon. The Indian writer Khushwant Singh considered the poem \"the essence of the message of The Gita in English.\" Charles McGrath, a former deputy editor of The New Yorker and a former editor of the New York Times Book Review, wrote that when he was in school, \"they had to recite Kipling's 'If\u2014' every day, right after the Pledge of Allegiance: 'If you can fill the unforgiving minute / With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, / Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, / And\u2014which is more\u2014you'll be a Man, my son! Pablo Neruda\u2014like Kipling, a Nobel laureate\u2014found a framed ornamental copy of the poem near the Duke of Alba's bedside in the Palacio de Liria. However, his view was not favourable, and he referred to it as \"that pedestrian and sanctimonious poetry, precursor of the Reader's Digest, whose intellectual level seems to me no higher than that of the Duke of Alba's boots\".

During the Shaman Fight, Yoh encounters his estranged twin brother Hao Asakura, a strong shaman who wishes to eradicate humans and create a world for shamans. At the end of the shaman battles, the remaining teams consist of Yoh and his friends, the X-Laws and Hao's team. The remaining teams choose to forfeit the tournament, crowning Hao with the title of Shaman King. As Hao is led away, Yoh and his allies decide to attack Hao while he is merging with the Great Spirit, which is in a coma. To conquer Hao, Yoh and his friends must defeat The Patch Tribe members who are obligated to serve under the new Shaman King.

As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers. He chose shamanism as the principal topic of the series because he wanted to choose a subject that had never been approached in manga before. He said he incorporated his own personality and beliefs in Shaman King. He has an interest in the topic, and \"choosing shamanism as the subject of this story seemed like a natural extension of that.\" For the title, he said he used \"shaman\", an English word, due to the fact that \"the nuance is really great\" and because he could not find a Japanese word with the accurate meaning of the word \"shaman\". Another reason to have shamanism as the main subject was because he could explore elements from different cultures and their relationship with the dead and the spirits. Takei created the stories after he created the characters because he believed the \"stories are born because of the existence of the characters\". In addition, he felt that \"the most important thing [to create a character] is to have originality\". Through his characters he wanted to show different cultures, backgrounds and values. When asked \"how do shamans of pacifistic religions ever win the Shaman Fight?\" he answered that the Shaman Fight is fought using the \"strength of the soul\".

In 2007, he revealed he was planning to end the series with the finale he initially envisioned, to be published in another Shueisha magazine at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or \"Perfect Edition\"), concluding with the \"true ending\" to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008 with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, \"After making the readers  so much for this, the last thing I wanted to do was to disappoint them\". He thought the ending was a \"huge responsibility\". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something \"fun,\" as it was different from scratch. Shaman King has also been published as part of the Shueisha Jump Remix series of magazine-style books. Sixteen volumes of Shaman King were released under the Shueisha Jump Remix series between April 1, 2011 and October 28, 2011. Viz Media licensed the series for an English-language release in North America; the chapters initially serialized in the American Shonen Jump, beginning in third issue in 2003 and ceasing its serialization in the August 2007 issue. From then, it was exclusively published through graphic novel format and Viz said it was done in order to speed up the series' publication. Volume 1 was released in August or September 2003, and volume 32 was released to conclude the series on January 4, 2011. In Australasian region, Madman Entertainment licensed and published the series between February 10, 2009 and September 10, 2011. The manga has also been licensed in some countries such as in Brazil by Editora JBC, in France by Kana, in Germany by Carlsen Comics, in Italy by Star Comics, in Norway by Schibsted Forlagene, in Russia by Comix-ART, in Singapore by Chuang Yi, in Spain by Editores de Tebeos, in Sweden by Bonnierf\u00f6rlagen, and in Vietnam by Kim \u0110\u1ed3ng Publishing House."

Lori Henderson of Manga Life cited the fact every character, even the villains, \"has a reason for fighting\" and their \"internal struggles\" as well as the fights itself as the main reason why Shaman King is \"an enjoyable title.\" A reviewer for The Star declared, praised the characters' development and Takei's capacity to create \"new interesting ones each volume,\" commending \"their backgrounds and unique personalities.\" Writing for ANN, John Jakala commented that he was struck with the \"unique\", \"graffiti-style\" visual of the series. Although labeled its art as \"silly\", Sheena McNeil from Sequential Start expressed that \"it's smooth and nicely detailed with excellent expressions.\" McNeil deemed Takei did \"a wonderful job of bringing shaman into the modern day but keeping it a story of fantasy\". Ellingwood stated the series' \"vibrant action\", \"imaginative plot twists and a creative world\" makes it \"a unique and stylish sh\u014dnen series.\" Mania's Eduardo Chavez said that, Shaman King can \"hit all the right buttons one volume\" but \"it could be a complete bore\" in the next. School Library Journals Cathleen Baxter commented that Shaman King has \"nonstop action\" with \"typical sh\u014dnen characters and battle styles\". The storyline is \"easy to follow and will hold the reader's interest.\" Margaret Veira of Active Anime, however, argued that the storyline gets more complex as the series progresses, while comics critic Jason Thompson commented that from volume 20 it \"seemed to veer off tracks\". In addition of a decline on artwork in his opinion, the numbers of fights also decreased; Thompson wrote, \"their enemy ... may be unbeatable by force alone, so the plot shifts away from battles and towards unexpected betrayals, character relationships, and clever (and confusing) schemes\u2014rather than mere fighting techniques.\" The last volume, especially, \"may leave some readers feeling cheated,\" said Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin. Thompson was also disappointed by the 2004 conclusion but he wrote that the kanzenban version has \"a great ending\", whose \"transcendental climax is not too different from Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira'', or for many American comics about beings with ultimate power.\""

        "content": "The Parable of the Prodigal Son (also known as the parable of the Two Brothers, Lost Son, Loving Father, or of the Forgiving Father) is one of the parables of Jesus in the Bible, appearing in Luke 15:11\u201332. Jesus shares the parable with his disciples, the Pharisees and others. In the story, a father has two sons. The younger son asks for his portion of inheritance from his father, who grants his son's request. This son, however, is  (i.e., wasteful and extravagant), thus squandering his fortune and eventually becoming destitute. As consequence, he now must return home empty-handed and intend to beg his father to accept him back as a servant. To the son's surprise, he is not scorned by his father but is welcomed back with celebration and a welcoming party. Envious, the older son refuses to participate in the festivities. The father tells the older son: \"you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours, but thy younger brother was lost and now he is found.\" The Prodigal Son is the third and final parable of a cycle on redemption, following the parable of the Lost Sheep and the parable of the Lost Coin. In Revised Common Lectionary and Roman Rite Catholic Lectionary, this parable is read on the fourth Sunday of Lent (in Year C); in the latter it is also included in the long form of the Gospel on the 24th Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year C, along with the preceding two parables of the cycle. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the Sunday of the Prodigal Son."

        "content": "The parable begins with a man who had two sons, and the younger of them asks his father to give him his share of the estate. The implication is the son could not wait for his father's death for his inheritance, he wanted it immediately. The father agrees and divides his estate between both sons. Upon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country, where he indulges in extravagant living. It's implied that he drinks, gambles, and sleeps with prostitutes, during this time. However, it isn't long before he has exhausted all his money, and immediately thereafter, a famine strikes the land; leaving him desperately poor. He is forced to take work as a swineherd (which would have been abhorrent to Jesus' Jewish audience, who considered swine unclean animals) where he reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is tending to. At this time, he finally comes to his senses:. This implies the father was hopefully watching for the son's return. The son starts his rehearsed speech, admitting his sins, and declaring himself unworthy of being his father's son, but in most versions of Luke, the son does not even finish, before his father accepts him back wholeheartedly without hesitation as the father calls for his servants to dress the son in the finest robe available, get a ring for his finger, and sandals for his feet, and to slaughter the \"fatted calf\" for a celebratory meal. The older son, who was at work in the fields, hears the sound of celebration, and is told by a fellow servant about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed, and becomes angry. He also has a speech for his father: The parable concludes with the father explaining that while the older son has always been present, and everything the father owns also belongs to the older son, because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary:"

        "content": "The opening, \"A man had two sons\" is a storyteller's trope and would immediately bring to mind Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, and Jacob and Esau. Jesus then confounds the listeners' expectations when the younger son is shown to be foolish. While a number of commentators see the request of the younger son for his share of the inheritance as \"brash, even insolent\" and \"tantamount to wishing that the father was dead,\" Jewish legal scholar Bernard Jackson says \"Jewish sources give no support to [the idea] that the prodigal, in seeking the advance, wishes his father dead.\" The young man's actions do not lead to success; he squanders his inheritance and he eventually becomes an indentured servant, with the degrading job of looking after pigs, and even envying them for the carob pods they eat. This recalls Proverbs 29:3: \"Whoever loves wisdom gives joy to his father, but whoever consorts with harlots squanders his wealth.\" Upon his return, his father treats the young man with a generosity far more than he has a right to expect. He is given the best robe, a ring for his finger, and sandals for his feet. Jewish philosopher Philo observes: Parents often do not lose thought for their wastrel (asoton) children.\u2026 In the same way, God too\u2026takes thought also for those who live a misspent life, thereby giving them time for reformation, and also keeping within the bounds His own merciful nature.The Pesikta Rabbati has a similar story:A king had a son who had gone astray from his father on a journey of a hundred days. His friends said to him, 'Return to your father.' He said, 'I cannot.' Then his father sent word, 'Return as far as you can, and I will come the rest of the way to you.' So God says, 'Return to me, and I will return to you.'The older son, in contrast, seems to think in terms of \"law, merit, and reward,\" rather than \"love and graciousness.\" He may represent the Pharisees who were criticizing Jesus. The last few verses of the parable summarize the tale in accordance with the Jewish teaching of the two ways of acting: the way of life (obedience) and the way of death (sin). God, according to Judaism, rejoices over and grants more graces to repentant sinners than righteous souls who don't need repentance. Following the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Lost Coin, this is the last of three parables about loss and redemption that Jesus tells after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with \"sinners.\" The father's joy described in the parable reflects divine love: the \"boundless mercy of God,\" and \"God's refusal to limit the measure of his grace.\""

(The Labourers in the Vineyard also appears in Early Medieval works.) From the Renaissance, the numbers shown widened slightly, and the various scenes of the Prodigal Son\u2014the high living, herding the pigs, and the return\u2014became the clear favourite. Albrecht D\u00fcrer made a famous engraving, the Prodigal Son amongst the Pigs (1496), a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance. Rembrandt depicted several scenes from the parable, especially the final episode, which he etched, drew, or painted on several occasions during his career. At least one of his works\u2014i.e., The Prodigal Son in the Tavern, a portrait of himself as the Son revelling with his wife\u2014is, like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene (if the title was indeed the original intention of the artist). His late Return of the Prodigal Son (1662\u20131669) is one of his most popular works. The Prodigal Son is a sculpture in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, by George Grey Barnard that depicts the loving reunion of the father and son from the \"Parable of the Prodigal Son.\""

        "content": "Another literary tribute to this parable is Dutch theologian Henri Nouwen's 1992 book, The Return of the Prodigal Son: A Story of Homecoming, in which he describes his own spiritual journey infused with understanding, based on an encounter with Rembrandt's painting that depicts the son's return. The book deals with three personages: the younger, prodigal son; the self-righteous, resentful older son; and the compassionate father\u2014all of whom the author identifies with personally. An earlier work with similarities to the parable is \"Le retour de l'enfant prodigue\" ('The Return of the Prodigal Son'), a short story by Andr\u00e9 Gide. Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem giving an interpretation of the younger brother's perspective. The poem appears as the heading to the fifth chapter, titled \"The Prodigal Son\", of his 1901 novel Kim. The Parable is a recurring theme in the works of Rainer Maria Rilke, who interpreted it in a different way to the conventional reading. Rilke's version is not so concerned with redemption and the forgiveness of family: the love of the family, and human love in general, was seen as less worthy than unreciprocated love, which is the purest form of love. In loving the family less, the Son can love God more, even if this love is not returned. The theme of the Prodigal Son plays a major role in Anne Tyler's novel A Spool of Blue Thread. The parable is also referred to in two comedies by William Shakespeare, specifically The Merchant Of Venice and As You Like It, as well as in Shakespeare's romance, The Winter's Tale. In one of his clemency petitions to the British government in 1913, the Indian independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar described himself as a \"prodigal son\" longing to return to the \"parental doors of the government\"."

        "title": "Parable of the Prodigal Son_Similar parable in Mahayana Buddhism",
        "content": "A parable of a lost son can also be found in the Mahayana Buddhist Lotus Sutra. The two parables are so similar in their outline and many details that several scholars have assumed that one version has influenced the other or that both texts share a common origin. However, an influence of the biblical story on the Lotus sutra is regarded as unlikely given the early dating of the stratum of the sutra containing the Buddhist parable. Despite their similarities, both parables continue differently after the two meet for the first time at the son's return. In the biblical story, there is an immediate reunion of the two. In contrast, in the Lotus sutra, the poor son does not recognize the rich man as his father. When the father sends out some attendants to welcome the son, the son panics, fearing some kind of retribution. The father then lets the son leave without telling him of their kinship. However, he gradually draws the son closer to him by employing him in successively higher positions, only to tell him of their kinship in the end. In the Buddhist parable, the father symbolises the Buddha, and the son symbolises any human being. Their kinship symbolises that any being has Buddha nature. The concealment of the kinship of the father to his son is regarded as a skillful means (Sanskrit: up\u0101ya)."

        "content": "On 20 March 1888, Dr. Watson is visiting Sherlock Holmes when a masked gentleman arrives at 221B Baker Street. Initially introducing himself as Count von Kramm, he reveals himself as Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia, after Holmes deduces his true identity. The King explains that, five years earlier, he engaged in a secret relationship with American opera singer Irene Adler, who has since retired and now lives in London. He is set to marry a young Scandinavian princess but worries that her strictly principled family will call the marriage off should they learn of this impropriety. The King further explains that he seeks to regain a photograph of Adler and himself together which he gave to her as a token. His agents have failed to recover the photograph through various means, and an offer to pay for it was also refused. With Adler now threatening to send the photograph to his fianc\u00e9e's family, the King requests Holmes and Watson's help in recovering it. The next morning, a disguised Holmes goes to Adler's house. He discovers Adler has a gentleman friend, barrister Godfrey Norton, who calls at least once a day. On this particular day, Norton visits Adler and soon afterward takes a cab to a nearby church. Minutes later, the lady herself gets into her landau, bound for the same place. Holmes follows in a cab and enters the church, where he is unexpectedly asked to be a witness to Norton and Adler's wedding. Curiously, the newly-weds go their separate ways after the ceremony. Returning to Baker Street, Holmes recounts his tale to Watson and expresses his amusement at his role in Adler's wedding. He also asks whether or not Watson is willing to participate in an illegal scheme to figure out where the picture is hidden in Adler's house. Watson agrees, and Holmes changes into another disguise as a clergyman. They depart Baker Street for Adler's house. When Holmes and Watson arrive, a group of jobless men meanders throughout the street. When Adler's coach pulls up, Holmes enacts his plan. A fight breaks out between the men on the street over who gets to help Adler. Holmes rushes into the fight to protect Adler and is seemingly struck and injured, though it is later revealed that this is a self-inflicted splatter of red paint. Adler takes him into her sitting room, where Holmes motions for her to have the window opened. As Holmes lifts his hand, Watson recognizes a pre-arranged signal and tosses in a plumber's smoke rocket. While smoke billows out of the building, Watson shouts \"Fire!\" and the cry is echoed up and down the street. Holmes slips out of Adler's house and tells Watson what he saw. As Holmes expected, Adler rushed to get her most precious possession at the cry of \"fire\"\u2014the photograph of herself and the King. Holmes observes that the picture was kept in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull. He was unable to steal it at that moment, however, because the coachman was watching him. The following morning, Holmes explains his findings to the King. When Holmes, Watson, and the King arrive at Adler's house at 8 am, her elderly maidservant sardonically informs them she had left the country via train earlier that morning. Holmes quickly goes to the photograph's hiding spot, finding a photo of Irene Adler in an evening dress and a letter addressed to him, dated at midnight. In the letter, Adler tells Holmes he did very well in finding the photograph and taking her in with his disguises. Adler has left England with Norton, \"a better man\" than the King, adding she will not compromise the King, despite being \"cruelly wronged\" by him; she had kept the photo only to protect herself from further action he might take. Thanking Holmes effusively, the King offers a valuable emerald ring from his finger as a further reward. Holmes declines and says there is something he values even more highly: the photograph of Adler, which he keeps as a reminder of her cleverness. Watson concludes the story by noting that, since their meeting, Holmes always referred to Adler by the honourable title of \"the woman.\" In the short story's opening paragraph, Watson calls her \"the late Irene Adler,\" suggesting she is deceased. However, it has been speculated that the word \"late\" might actually mean \"former.\" She married Godfrey Norton, making Adler her former name. (Doyle employs this same usage in \"The Adventure of the Priory School\" in reference to the Duke's former status as a cabinet minister.)"

        "content": "Adler earns Holmes' unbounded admiration. When the King of Bohemia says, \"Would she not have made an admirable queen?  Is it not a pity she was not on my level?\" Holmes replies that Adler is indeed on a much different level from the King, implying that she was superior to the King all along. The beginning of \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" describes the high regard in which Holmes held Adler: This \"memory\" is kept alive by a photograph of Irene Adler, which had been deliberately left behind when she and her new husband took flight with the embarrassing photograph of her with the King. Holmes had then asked for and received this photo from the King, as payment for his work on the case. In \"The Five Orange Pips\" he comments to a client that he has been defeated on a mere handful of occasions and only once by a woman. In derivative works, she is frequently used as a romantic interest for Holmes, a departure from Doyle's novels where he only admired her for her wit and cunning. In his Sherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes \"the Canon provides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.\""

        "title": "A Scandal in Bohemia_Fictional monarchies",
        "content": "Rather than creating a fictional country for the King in his story, Conan Doyle chose to place a fictional dynasty in a real country. The Kingdom of Bohemia was at the time of writing a possession of the House of Habsburg and the Austrian Emperors held the title \"King of Bohemia\". Although Bohemian nobles had offered the crown to other Germanic families twice since the Middle Ages (Frederick of the Palatine in 1618 and Charles of Bavaria in 1741), claiming the title formally had elective succession. On the other hand, there had never been a \"Kingdom of Scandinavia\". The closest instance was the personal union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden under the Kalmar Union, which was never formalised like the British Acts of Union and broke down in the 16th century. However after the Kalmar Union was dissolved by Gustav Vasa's coronation the Kingdom of Norway remained in personal union with Denmark before the Napoleonic Wars changed that to a union with Sweden, which existed until 14 years after publication (the whole time under King Oscar II) and this might have been the \"Kingdom of Scandinavia\" Conan Doyle meant. The surname of the King's fianc\u00e9e was that of the actual ruling house of the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. At publication ruled by George II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, a cadet member of the Ernestine duchies ruled by various cousins from the House of Wettin, whose Saxe-Coburg line produced Queen Victoria's mother Victoria and husband Albert. There was also no \"Grand Duchy of Cassel-Felstein\" and in fact there was no major title with the name Felstein. The closest match is a collective municipality named Feldstein. But there was a possible inspiration in the former Landgraviate of Hesse, which was partioned into four parts in the 16th century. While two went extinct swiftly and were divided by the remaining pair, both of those probably inspired the title. One was the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, which was spelled with \"Cassel\" before the 20th century spelling reform of German changed the city's name. This title was elevated to the Electorate of Hesse during the Napoleonic Wars, but by the time of publication had been annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia for 25 years as the Province of Hesse-Nassau. The Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt also has a probable connection to the fictional title, since it was elevated to the Grand Duchy of Hesse in 1806. At the time of publication its ruler was Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, whose first wife had been Queen Victoria's third child Princess Alice of the United Kingdom."

Her photograph was taken by National Geographic Society photographer Steve McCurry, on Kodachrome 64 color slide film, with a Nikon FM2 camera and Nikkor 105mm Ai-S F2.5 lens. The pre-print retouching of the photograph was done by Graphic Art Service, based in Marietta, Georgia. McCurry did not record the name of the person he had photographed. The photograph, entitled Afghan Girl, appeared on the June 1985 cover of National Geographic. The image of her face, with a red scarf draped loosely over her head and her eyes staring directly into the camera, was named \"the most recognized photograph\" in the magazine's history, and the cover is one of National Geographic's most famous. American Photo magazine says the image has an \"unusual combination of grittiness and glamour\". Gula's green eyes have been the subject of much commentary. McCurry made several unsuccessful attempts during the 1990s to find her. In January 2002, a National Geographic team traveled to Afghanistan to find her. Upon learning that the Nasir Bagh refugee camp was soon to close, McCurry inquired of its remaining residents, one of whom knew Gula's brother and was able to send word to her hometown. But several women falsely identified themselves as the famous Afghan Girl. In addition, after being shown the 1984 photograph, several young men erroneously identified her as their wife. The team found Gula, then around age 30, in a remote region of Afghanistan; she had returned to her native country from the refugee camp in 1992. Her identity was confirmed by John Daugman using iris recognition. She recalled being photographed. She had been photographed on only three occasions: in 1984 and during the search for her when a National Geographic producer took the identifying photographs that led to the reunion with McCurry. She had never seen Afghan Girl until it was shown to her in 2002."

Active Anime also gave praise to the series, saying that it \"holds some surprising twists to the regular sports drama formula\", and praised the suspenseful matches and innovative techniques. Despite the reviews, the series is popular in Japan. When TV Asahi, a television network in Japan, conducted a survey for the one hundred most popular animated television series, The Prince of Tennis anime came in twenty-seventh place.

In the story, a Wall Street lawyer hires a new clerk who, after an initial bout of hard work, refuses to make copies or do any other task required of him, refusing with the words \"I would prefer not to.\" Numerous critical essays have been published about the story, which scholar Robert Milder describes as \"unquestionably the masterpiece of the short fiction\" in the Melville canon."

He already employs two scriveners, Turkey and Nippers, to copy legal documents by hand, but an increase in business leads him to advertise for a third. He hires the forlorn-looking Bartleby in the hope that his calmness will soothe the other two, each of whom displays an irascible temperament during an opposite half of the day. An office boy nicknamed Ginger Nut completes the staff. At first, Bartleby produces a large volume of high-quality work, but one day, when asked to help proofread a document, Bartleby answers with what soon becomes his perpetual response to every request: \"I would prefer not to.\" To the dismay of the narrator and the irritation of the other employees, Bartleby begins to perform fewer and fewer tasks and eventually none. He instead spends long periods of time staring out one of the office's windows at a brick wall. The narrator makes several attempts to reason with Bartleby or to learn something about him, but never has any success. When the narrator stops by the office one Sunday morning, he discovers that Bartleby is living there. He is saddened by the thought of the life the young man must lead. Tension builds as business associates wonder why Bartleby is always present in the office, yet does not appear to do any work. Sensing the threat to his reputation, but emotionally unable to evict Bartleby, the narrator moves his business to a different building. The new tenant of his old office comes to ask for help in removing Bartleby, and the narrator tells the man that he is not responsible for his former employee. A week or so after this, several other tenants of the narrator's former office building come to him with their landlord because Bartleby is still making a nuisance of himself; even though he has been put out of the office, he sits on the building stairs all day and sleeps in its doorway at night. The narrator agrees to visit Bartleby and attempts to reason with him. He suggests several jobs that Bartleby might try and even invites Bartleby to live with him until they figure out a better solution. Bartleby replies that he would \"prefer not to make any change\", and declines the offer. The narrator leaves the building and flees the neighborhood for several days, in order not to be bothered by the landlord and tenants. When the narrator returns to work, he learns that the landlord has called the police. The officers have arrested Bartleby and imprisoned him in the Tombs as a vagrant. He goes to visit Bartleby, who spurns him, and bribes a cook to make sure Bartleby gets enough food. The narrator returns a few days later to check on Bartleby and discovers him dead of starvation, having preferred not to eat. Months later, the narrator hears a rumor that Bartleby had once worked in a dead letter office and reflects on how this might have affected him. The story ends with the narrator saying, \"Ah Bartleby! Ah humanity!\""

        "content": "Melville's major source of inspiration for the story was an advertisement for a new book, The Lawyer's Story, printed in the Tribune and the Times on February 18, 1853. The book, published anonymously later that year, was written by popular novelist James A. Maitland. This advertisement included the complete first chapter, which started: \"In the summer of 1843, having an extraordinary quantity of deeds to copy, I engaged, temporarily, an extra copying clerk, who interested me considerably, in consequence of his modest, quiet, gentlemanly demeanor, and his intense application to his duties.\" Melville biographer Hershel Parker said nothing else in the chapter besides this \"remarkably evocative sentence\" was notable. Critic Andrew Knighton said Melville may have been influenced by an obscure work from 1846, Robert Grant White's Law and Laziness: or, Students at Law of Leisure, which features an idle scrivener. Melville may have written the story as an emotional response to the bad reviews garnered by Pierre, his preceding novel. Christopher Sten suggests that Melville found inspiration in Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays, particularly \"The Transcendentalist\", which shows parallels to \"Bartleby\"."

More specifically, he has been described as a copyist \u201cwho obstinately refuses to go on doing the sort of writing demanded of him.\" During the spring of 1851, Melville felt similarly about his work on Moby-Dick. Thus, Bartleby may represent Melville's frustration with his own situation as a writer, and the story is \"about a writer who forsakes conventional modes because of an irresistible preoccupation with the most baffling philosophical questions.\" Bartleby may also represent Melville's relation to his commercial, democratic society. Melville made an allusion to the John C. Colt case in Bartleby. The narrator restrains his anger toward Bartleby by reflecting upon \"the tragedy of the unfortunate Adams and the still more unfortunate Colt and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams ... was unawares hurled into his fatal act.\""

The narrator screens off Bartleby in a corner, which has been interpreted as symbolising \"the lawyer's compartmentalization of the unconscious forces which Bartleby represents.\" Psychoanalyst Christopher Bollas says the main focus of the story is the narrator, whose \"willingness to tolerate [Bartleby's] work stoppage is what needs to be explained ...

Both Edwards and Priestley wrote about free will and determinism. Edwards states that free will requires the will to be isolated from the moment of decision, in which case Bartleby's isolation from the world would allow him to be completely free. He has the ability to do whatever he pleases. The reference to Priestley and Edwards in connection with determinism may suggest that Bartleby's exceptional exercise of his personal will, even though it leads to his death, spares him from an externally determined fate. \"Bartleby\" is also seen as an inquiry into ethics. Critic John Matteson sees the story (and other Melville works) as explorations of the changing meaning of 19th-century \"prudence.\" The story's narrator \"struggles to decide whether his ethics will be governed by worldly prudence or Christian agape.\" He wants to be humane, as shown by his accommodations of the four staff and especially of Bartleby, but this conflicts with the newer, pragmatic and economically based notion of prudence supported by changing legal theory. The 1850 case Brown v. Kendall, three years before the story's publication, was important in establishing the \"reasonable man\" standard in the United States, and emphasized the positive action required to avoid negligence. Bartleby's passivity has no place in a legal and economic system that increasingly sides with the \"reasonable\" and economically active individual. His fate, an innocent decline into unemployment, prison, and starvation, dramatizes the effect of the new prudence on the economically inactive members of society."

On his third day at the office, Bartleby is asked to proofread legal documents. He refuses a direct order from his employer for the first time. His employer considers firing Bartleby, but changes his mind when he notices Bartleby's \"perfect composure\". Days later, Bartleby refuses a similar order. His employer demands an explanation, but Bartleby offers none. The employer points out that his initial order was reasonable, and tries to appeal to Bartleby's common sense. When Bartleby again fails to obey, the employer has his three other employees work on persuading Bartleby. Bartleby's behavior does not change. As days pass, Turkey offers to beat up Bartleby for his employer. The employer refuses to resort to violence. By chance, the employer finds out that Bartleby has moved into the legal office. Bartleby has no other home of his own. The employer pities Bartleby for his loneliness, but he also feels fear and revulsion for Bartleby.

There is nothing to indicate that the Bohemian writer was at all acquainted with the work of Melville, who remained largely forgotten until some time after Kafka's death.

        "content": "The story was adapted for the radio anthology series Favorite Story in 1948 under the name \"The Strange Mister Bartleby.\" William Conrad plays the Narrator and Hans Conried plays Bartleby. In a BBC radio adaptation from 1953, Laurence Olivier plays the narrator. This was produced as an episode of \"Theatre Royal\", a series of radio dramas, which was the only radio series in which Lord Olivier took a major role. The York Playhouse produced a one-act opera, Bartleby, composed by William Flanagan and James J. Hinton, Jr. with a libretto by Edward Albee, from January 1 to February 28, 1961. The first filmed adaptation was by the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Educational Corporation in 1969. It was adapted, produced & directed by Larry Yust and starred James Westerfield and Patrick Campbell, with Barry Williams of The Brady Bunch fame in a small role. The story has been adapted for film four other times: in 1970, starring Paul Scofield; in France, in 1976, by Maurice Ronet, starring Michel Lonsdale; in 1977, by Israel Horovitz and Michael B Styer for Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting, starring Nicholas Kepros, which was an entry in the 1978 Peabody Awards competition for television; and in 2001, as Bartleby, by Jonathan Parker, starring Crispin Glover and David Paymer. The story was adapted and reinterpreted by Peter Straub in his 1997 story \"Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff.\" It was also used as thematic inspiration for the Stephen King novel Bag of Bones. The BBC Radio 4 adaptation dramatised by Martyn Wade, directed by Cherry Cookson, and broadcast in 2004 stars Adrian Scarborough as Bartleby, Ian Holm as the Lawyer, David Collings as Turkey, and Jonathan Keeble as Nippers. The story was adapted for the stage in March 2007 by Alexander Gelman and the Organic Theater Company of Chicago. In 2009, French author Daniel Pennac read the story on the stage of La P\u00e9pini\u00e8re-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre in Paris. Bartleby, The Scrivener, an opera in two acts, with music by Daniel Steven Crafts and libretto by Erik Bauersfeld."

In Chapter 12 of the 1992 novel Mostly Harmless by Douglas Adams in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, Arthur Dent decides to move to Bartledan, whose population does not need or want anything. Reading a novel of Bartledanian literature, he is bewildered to find that the protagonist of the novel unexpectedly dies of thirst just before the last chapter. Arthur is bewildered by other actions of the Bartledans, but \"He preferred not to think about it.\" (page 78). He notes that \"nobody in Bartledanian stories ever wanted anything.\" In 2001, Spanish writer Enrique Vila-Matas wrote Bartleby & Co., a book which deals with \"the endemic disease of contemporary letters, the negative pulsion or attraction towards nothingness.\" In her 2016 book My Private Property, Mary Ruefle's story \"Take Frank\" features a high school boy assigned to read Melville's Bartleby. The boy unwittingly mimics Bartleby when he declares he would \"prefer not to.\" In his 2017 book Everybody Lies: big data, new data, and what the Internet can tell us about who we really are, Seth Stephens-Davidowits mentions that one-third of horses bred to be racehorses never, in fact, race. They simply \"prefer not to,\" the author explains, as he draws an allusion to Melville's story. In her 2019 book How to Do Nothing, Jenny Odell references Bartleby as an example of resisting the demands of capitalism, and cultivating an ethic of refusal. In his 2018 book \"Hiking With Nietzsche: Becoming Who You Are\", John Kaag references the Bartleby story as a consideration of the Nietzschean possibility that freedom is realised in a self-destructive refusal to submit. In \"Farrington the Scrivener: A Story of Dame Street,\" Morris Beja compares \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\" with  \"Counterparts\", a story in Dubliners, by James Joyce. The essay is published in Coping With Joyce: Essays from the Copenhagen Symposium, edited by Morris Beja and Shari Benstock (Ohio State University Press, 1989), pp. 111-122."

Though Poe was referring to an ancient connection between worms and death, he may have been inspired by \"The Proud Ladye\", a poem by Spencer Wallis Cone which was reviewed in an 1840 issue of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine. That poem contained the lines \"Let him meet the conqueror worm / With his good sword by his side\". \"The Conqueror Worm\" also uses the word \"evermore\", which would later evolve into \"nevermore\" in Poe's famous poem \"The Raven\" in 1845."

Also, the inclusion of the bitter poem may have been meant to be ironic or a parody of the convention at the time, both in literature and in life.

        "content": "The \"X Article\" is an article, formally titled \"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\", written by George F. Kennan and published under the pseudonym \"X\" in the July 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. The article widely introduced the term \"containment\" and advocated for its strategic use against the Soviet Union. The piece expanded on ideas expressed by Kennan in a confidential February 1946 telegram, formally identified by Kennan's State Department number, \"511\", but informally dubbed the \"long telegram\" due to its length. Kennan composed the long telegram to respond to inquiries about the implications of a February 1946 speech by Joseph Stalin. Though the speech was in line with previous statements by Stalin, it provoked fear in the American press and public; Time magazine called it \"the most warlike pronouncement uttered by any top-rank statesman since V-J Day\". The long telegram explained Soviet motivations by recounting the history of Russian rulers as well as the more recent ideology of Marxism\u2013Leninism. It argued that the Soviet leaders used the ideology to characterize the external world as hostile, allowing them to justify their continued hold on power despite their lack of popular support. Washington bureaucrats quickly read the confidential message and accepted it as the best explanation of Soviet behavior. The reception elevated Kennan's reputation within the State Department as one of the government's foremost Soviet experts. After hearing Kennan speak about Soviet foreign relations to the Council on Foreign Relations in January 1947, international banker R. Gordon Wasson suggested that he express his views in an article for Foreign Affairs. Revising a piece he had submitted to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal in late-January 1947, Kennan's role in government precluded him from publishing under his name. His superiors granted him approval to publish the piece provided it was released anonymously; Foreign Affairs attributed the article only to \"X\". Expressing similar sentiments to that of the long telegram, the piece was strong in its anti-communism, introducing and outlining a basic theory of containment.  The article was widely read and, though it does not mention the Truman Doctrine, having mostly been written before Truman's speech, it quickly became seen as an expression of the doctrine's policy. Retrospective commentators dispute the impact of the article; Henry Kissinger referred to it as \"the diplomatic doctrine of the era\", while some historians write that its impact in shaping governmental policy has been overstated."

        "content": "Joseph Stalin, General Secretary and de facto leader of the Soviet Union, spoke at the Bolshoi Theatre on 9 February 1946, the night before the symbolic 1946 Supreme Soviet election. The speech did not discuss foreign policy, but instead made pledges to expand industry. He justified the expansion by pointing to Marxist\u2013Leninist theory, warning that capitalism possessed a predisposition towards conflict. Stalin's speech provoked fear in the American press and public, with Time magazine calling it \"the most warlike pronouncement uttered by any top-rank statesman since V-J Day.\" George F. Kennan, then working for the US State Department as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Moscow, found the speech routine and reflective of previous statements from Stalin. With this in mind, he issued only a quick summary of the speech for the State Department. Despite the familiar statements from Stalin, the context in which they were made \u2013 including the Soviet Union's recent rejection of Bretton Woods and evidence of atomic espionage in the United States and Canada \u2013 alarmed officials in Washington. In a 1982 interview, former diplomat Elbridge Durbrow expressed that Stalin's speech had in effect said, \"to hell with the rest of the world.\" US President Harry Truman was confused by the Soviet's policies, at times appearing belligerent and at others exercising self-restraint. Leaders were increasingly coming to the conclusion that the existing quid pro quo strategy was ineffective against the Soviets, but had no replacement strategy. Durbrow and other diplomat H. Freeman Matthews \u2013 both readers of Kennan's earlier telegrams \u2013 were confused by Kennan's relative silence about the speech. On 13 February, Matthews drafted a message, signed by Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, asking for an analysis. The message described the press and public's reaction having been, \"to a degree not hitherto felt\", and expressed: \"We should welcome receiving from you an interpretive analysis of what we may expect in the way of future implementation of these announced policies.\" W. Averell Harriman, having recently return from his ambassadorship to the Soviet Union, spoke to Kennan and encouraged him to write a thorough analysis."

        "content": "Kennan probably wrote out rough drafts of a message before dictating a final version to his secretary, Dorothy Hessman, on 22 February 1946. Finishing late at night, he took the message to the Mokhovaya code room in Moscow and had it telegraphed back to Washington. The message was quickly dubbed the \"long telegram\" because, at a little over 5,000 words, it was the longest telegram ever sent in the history of the State Department. Identified as \"511\" by Kennan's State Department number, the message is divided into five sections, covering the Soviet Union's background, current features, future prospects and the implications these would have for the United States. It opens with an apology for its length but qualifies the necessity of responding to all the then pressing concerns at once. Kennan begins by laying out the world from the Soviet perspective, splitting it into socialist and capitalist sectors. The alliance between the United States and Great Britain was destined to fail, and would either lead to war between them or a joint attack on the Soviet Union. The Soviets believed they would ultimately prevail in such a conflict, but would need to grow their strength and exploit the capitalist's tendency towards conflict amongst one another in the meantime. Kennan described these ideas as absurd, pointing out that capitalist countries were not failing and were not always in conflict. Further, he described the idea that the United States and Great Britain would deliberately enter into a war against the Soviets as the \"sheerest nonsense\". The Soviet leaders reached these illogical sentiments, he explained, because, \"...at the bottom of the Kremlin's view of world affairs is a traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity.\" The authority of previous Russian rulers was \"archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison or contact with political systems of western countries.\" This understanding of Russian history was joined with the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. Their obstinacy in dealing with the West was born out of necessity; seeing the rest of the world as hostile provided an excuse \"for the dictatorship without which they did not know how to rule, for cruelties they did not dare not to inflict, for sacrifices they felt bound to demand.\" Until the Soviet Union either experienced consistent failures or their leader was persuaded that they were negatively impacting their nation's interest, the West could not expect any reciprocity from the Soviets. The Soviet government, Kennan continued, could be understood as occupying two distinct spaces: an official, visible government and another operating without any official acknowledgement. While the former would participate in international diplomacy, the latter would attempt to undermine the capitalist nations as much as possible, including efforts to \"disrupt national self confidence, to hamstring measures of national defense, to increase social and industrial unrest, to stimulate all forms of disunity.\" He concludes that the Soviets ultimately have no expectation of reconciliation with the West. Kennan concludes not by offering specific courses of action, but instead offers more general solutions, such as the necessity of maintaining courage and self-confidence in interactions with the Soviets. Managing the threat would require \"the same thoroughness and care as solution of major strategic problem in war, and if necessary, with no smaller outlay in planning effort.\" He writes that, compared to Nazi Germany, the Soviets are much more patient and often risk averse. Being weaker than the West, not having regular procedures for replacing leaders, having absorbed too many territories, failing to inspire its people and being overly reliant on negative propaganda meant \"we may approach calmly and with good heart [the] problem of how to deal with Russia.\" Kennan emphasizes the need of educating the American public about the threat of international communism. Keeping Western society strong was important to ward off the expansive tendencies of communism: \"The greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem of Soviet communism, is that we shall allow ourselves to become like those with whom we are coping.\""

        "content": "Matthews sent Kennan a cable praising the telegram, describing it as \"magnificent\", adding, \"I cannot overestimate its importance to those of us here struggling with the problem.\" Byrnes praised it as well, writing he had read it \"with the greatest interest\" and describing it as \"a splendid analysis\". Harriman was less enthused, calling it \"fairly long, and a little bit slow reading in spots.\" He nonetheless sent a copy to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. Forrestal was largely responsible for the spread of the long telegram, sending copies across Washington. It gained a larger readership than was typical for a classified document, with readers including ambassador to Cuba Henry Norweb, British diplomat Frank Roberts, General George C. Marshall and President Truman. The long telegram was quickly read and accepted by Washington bureaucrats as the best explanation of Soviet behavior. Policymakers, military officials and intelligence analysts generally came to understand that the Soviet Union's primary foreign policy goal was world domination under a Communist state. Historian John Lewis Gaddis writes that the ultimate impact of the long telegram is that it \"became the basis for United States strategy toward the Soviet Union throughout the rest of the Cold War\", and that it \"won [Kennan] the reputation of being the government's foremost Soviet expert\". In 1967, Kennan reflected \"My reputation was made. My voice now carried.\" In mid-April 1946, at Forrestal's insistence Kennan received an appointment in the National War College as Deputy for Foreign Affairs. The Truman administration quickly accepted Kennan's conclusions, understanding that the Soviet's had no reasonable grievances with the West and would never cooperate with capitalist states. It was therefore senseless to try and address the Soviet's concerns, leaving a policy of containing Russian interests as the best response. Historian Louis Halle writes that the timing of the long telegram's appearance was important, \"[coming] right at a time when the Department... was floundering about, looking for new intellectual moorings.\" He continues that the telegram served as \"a new and realistic conception to which it might attach itself.\" Gaddis and historian Wilson D. Miscamble both believe that Halle overstates Kennan's impact on State Department thinking, emphasizing that the Department was already moving towards a more adversarial position against the Soviets, though Miscamble concedes, \"there can be no doubt that Kennan's cable exercised a catalytic effect upon departmental thinking especially as regards the possibility of the United States achieving any non-adversary relationship with the Soviet Union.\" Offering a different perspective, Matthews notes in a 12 March 1946 letter that the administration had already moved in the direction of not catering to Soviet interests before the long telegram, pointing to a speech Byrnes delivered on 28 February, drafted before Byrnes had read Kennan's message. In the speech, Byrnes explains: \"We will not and we cannot stand aloof if force or threat is used contrary to the purposes of the [United Nations] Charter.... If we are to be a great power we must act as a great power, not only in order to ensure our own security but in order to preserve the peace of the world.\" Matthews explains that long telegram would instead serve as the administration's rationale for subsequent actions. Historian Melvyn P. Leffler points out that before the long telegram had circulated widely, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had already resolved in February 1946 that \"collaboration with the Soviet Union should stop short not only of compromise of principle but also of expansion of Russian influence in Europe and in the Far East."

Stalin was among its readers and called on his American ambassador, Nikolai Novikov, to send a similar telegram from Washington to Moscow. Ghostwritten by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, the piece was sent on 27 September 1946. Representative of Stalin's opinions, Novikov's telegram argued in part: \"The foreign policy of the United States reflects the imperialistic tendencies of American monopolistic capitalism, [and] is characterized... by a striving for world supremacy.\" America would attempt to achieve supremacy by cooperating with Great Britain, but their cooperation was \"plagued with great internal contradictions and cannot be lasting... It is quite possible that the Near East will become a center of Anglo-American contradictions that will explode the agreements now reached between the United States and England.\" Kennan provided commentary on Novikov's telegram in a 1991 piece for the journal Diplomatic History. He wrote in part, \"These poor people, put on the spot, produced the thing,\" but \"it was only a way of saying to their masters in Moscow: 'How true, sir!."

        "content": "On 7 January 1947, Kennan spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations, based at the Harold Pratt House in New York City. The theme of the meeting was \"Soviet Foreign Relations\", presented to a small group and designated as \"not for attribution\". Kennan did not prepare a written speech, having given dozens of similar talks in the years before. In his talk, he discussed the Soviet leaders' perspectives on the rest of the world, rooted in both their Marxist-Leninist ideology and Russian history. The Soviets justified their dictatorship by pointing to external enemies, most of which were imaginary. For change to occur, the United States and its allies would need to \"contain\" the Soviets in a \"non-provocative way\". International banker R. Gordon Wasson attended the discussion and was impressed by Kennan, suggesting that the Council revise the talk for publication in their journal Foreign Affairs. Journal editor Hamilton Fish Armstrong had not attended the discussion but requested on 10 January that Kennan revise his talk into an article. Kennan responded to Armstrong in a 4 February letter, writing, \"I really can not write anything of value on Russia for publication under my own name. If you would be interested in an anonymous article, or one under a pen name,... I might be able to make the necessary arrangements.\" Armstrong replied on 7 March, agreeing to Kennan's suggestion, writing that the \"disadvantage of anonymity\" was outweighed by the potential importance of the article. Taking time off from the State Department, Kennan worked as a lecturer at the National War College. His work left him little time to write a new essay, so he searched for previous work to repurpose. In January 1946, Forrestal had asked Kennan for an analysis of a piece by Smith College professor Edward F. Willett entitled \"Dialectical Materialism And Russian Objectives\". Kennan was unimpressed with the work, but decided that rather than denigrating the piece he would instead publish a new analysis. The paper, titled \"Psychological Background of Soviet Foreign Policy\", was around six-thousand words. In late-January 1946, he sent it to Forrestal, who described it as \"extremely well-done\" before sending it on to General Marshall. In a 10 March letter to John T. Connor, an aide of Forrestal, Kennan inquired as to whether it would be appropriate to publish this piece anonymously in Foreign Affairs. Forrestal agreed, as did the State Department's Committee on Unofficial Publications. Kennan made several minor corrections to the piece, along with scratching his name out and writing \"X\" in its place. He added a note on authorship, writing: \"The author of this article is one who has had long experience with Russian affairs, both practically and academically, but whose position makes it impossible for him to write about them under his own name.\" Armstrong published Kennan's piece under the title \"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\", removing Kennan's note and leaving only the \"X\" as an identifier."

        "title": "X Article_\"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\"",
        "content": "Kennan's piece opens with a description of how the Soviet leaders were shaped by Marxism-Leninism, serving as the \"pseudo-scientific justification\" for why Stalin and the other leaders ought to remain in power despite lacking popular support. At times quoting Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, he writes that the Soviet leaders' \"aggressive intransigence\" against the outside world compelled them \"to chastise the contumacy\" which they had provoked. To maintain power, the Soviet leaders would need to maintain the illusion of external threats: The Soviets, however, were not prepared to attempt an immediate overthrow of the West, it being implicit in their ideology that capitalism would inevitably fail. They would instead turn their focus to the long-term goal of \"[filling] every nook and cranny available to it in the basin of world power.\" To oppose them, the United States would need long-term strategies to contain Soviet expansionary ambitions. Containment against the Soviets, Kennan explains, would require an application of \"counter-force\" along shifting points of geographical and political interests. This \"perimeter defense\" concept, wherein all geographic area were considered of equal importance, required the United States \"to confront the Russians with unalterable counter-force at every point where they show signs of encroaching upon the interests of a peaceful and stable world.\" Containment would prove its success in the long-term because the Soviet economy was rudimentary and the government leadership lacked procedures for orderly succession. Any disruption in Soviet politics held the possibility of \"[changing the state] overnight from one of the strongest to one of the weakest and most pitiable of national societies.\" Containment was particularly suited for use against the Soviets, Kennan thought, because of their Marxist-Leninist ideology, which encourages a patience not evident with leaders like Napoleon or Adolf Hitler. He continues: \"...the Kremlin is under no ideological compulsion to accomplish its purposes in a hurry. Like the Church, it is dealing in ideological concepts which are of long-term valididty... It has no right to risk the existing achievements of the revolution for the sake of vain baubles of the future.\" The end result of containment would allow for \"either the break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power.\" The indefinite frustration the Soviets were bound to face would necessitate their adjustment to the reality of their situation. The strategy would require the United States to manage its own issues successfully, with Kennan concluding: \"To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation. Surely, there was never a fairer test of national quality than this."

I only wish for your sake as well as for ours that it could carry your name.\" The long delay between its writing and publication \u2013 some five months \u2013 meant the piece did not discuss either of the recent communist uprisings in Greece and Turkey, nor did it mention the Truman Doctrine. The piece was due for inclusion in Foreign Affairs next issue, July 1947. With a little over 19,000 subscribers and an expensive cover price for the time of $1.25 (), the magazine did not circulate widely. The July issue did not deviate from regular buying trends, until journalist Arthur Krock drew attention to the \"X\" article in an 8 July The New York Times column. Krock suggested that the main thrust of \"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\" was \"exactly that adopted by the American government after appeasement of the Kremlin proved a failure\", and wrote that the piece's author had clearly studied the Soviet Union \"at the closest range possible for a foreigner.\" Krock concludes that the author's views \"closely resemble those marked 'Top Secret' in several official files in Washington.\" Krock's column resulted in a rush for copies of Foreign Affairs. He had not identified Kennan as \"X\" in his column, but proved responsible for revealing Kennan's identity; Forrestal had let Krock see the draft copy sent to Foreign Affairs which still contained Kennan's name at its end. Other diplomats suspected Kennan's authorship due to the piece's distinct prose as well as the quoting of Edward Gibbon. As the rumor spread, the State Department offered no comment. The Daily Worker, the newspaper of the Communist Party of the United States, broke the story on Kennan's identity, with a headline on 9 July reading: X' Bared as State Dep't Aid : Calls for Overthrow of Soviet Government\". Kennan's role in the State Department lent the article the authority of an official policy declaration. Though he had not intended for the article to be a comprehensive statement on American foreign policy, a piece in the 21 July issue of Newsweek explained that the \"X\" article provided a rationale for both the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan and \"[charted] the course that this country is likely to pursue for years to come.\" Marshall, concerned by the amount of attention both Kennan and the article were drawing, spoke with Kennan in a private meeting. Kennan's explanation that the article had been \"cleared for publication by the competent official committee\" satisfied Marshall, \"[b]ut it was long, I suspect, before he recovered from his astonishment over the strange ways of the department he now headed.\""

Lippmann's analysis was widely read and collected in his 1947 book, The Cold War. Lippmann critiqued the article as having presented a \"strategic monstrosity\", providing the Soviets with the initiative in any conflict, resulting in the United States depending on \"a coalition of disorganized, disunited, feeble or disorderly nations, tribles and factions.\" Lippmann incorrectly concluded that Kennan's article had inspired the Truman Doctrine, which Lippmann opposed. Kennan's article was completed in late January 1947 and Truman announced his Doctrine in a 12 March 1947 speech. Despite this chronology, Gaddis writes: \"there is no evidence that it influenced the drafting of that address and abundant evidence that Kennan had sought to remove the language in it to which Lippmann later objected.\" For Lippmann, however, the piece was \"not only an analytical interpretation of the sources of Soviet conduct. It is also a document of primary importance on the sources of American foreign policy \u2013 of at least that part of it which is known as the Truman Doctrine.\" Because of the rushed nature in which Kennan had written the article, he regretted some views expressed within and agreed with some of Lippmann's critiques. Though Kennan did not send the final draft of the piece until 11 April \u2013 a month after the announcement of the Truman Doctrine \u2013 he did not revise it despite having qualms with sections of the Doctrine. Kennan's position in the State Department made him hesitant to offer any public clarification, and he would not respond until the publication of the first volume of his memoirs in 1967."

Kennan reassessed his views on perimeter defense after the article was published, instead shifting to the idea of \"strongpoint defense\", where defense was instead focused on particular areas. In Kennan's memoirs he recalled that his \"entire diplomatic experience took place in rather high northern latitudes.\" Thomas Borstelmann writes that Kennan's few experiences outside of Europe contributed to his detestation of the people of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America: \"He tended to lump them together as impulsive, fanatical, ignorant, lazy, unhappy, and prone to mental disorders and other biological deficiencies.\" In the first of his memoirs, published in 1967, Kennan links Soviet despotism to its leaders \"attitude of Oriental secretiveness and conspiracy.\" In a 1942 lecture, he explained that the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 revealed the Russians were not \"westernized\" but instead \"17th century semi-Asiatic people.\" Borstelmann further writes that Kennan's perspectives on race were not unique to him but were instead common in his contemporary American policymaking circles."

        "content": "\"The Quest of Erebor\" is written in the first person, from the perspective of Frodo Baggins. However, nearly all the text consists of narration by Gandalf, who was telling the story at Frodo's request in Minas Tirith after the coronation of King Elessar. Gandalf knew that Smaug the dragon could pose a serious threat if used by Sauron, then dwelling in Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. He was thinking about the matter when he met Thorin Oakenshield at Bree. Thorin too was concerned about Smaug, but had different motives: he wanted to reclaim the dwarves' treasure in the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf agreed to help Thorin, though he insisted that his party must make use of stealth rather than open confrontation; for that, they would need a burglar, to whom he would take them. Gandalf thought Bilbo to be a suitable companion to Thorin and his Dwarves for a number of reasons. First, he had observed that Bilbo took more of an interest in the world at large than was usual for hobbits, and was thus more likely to be adventurous. Another reason was that Smaug would not recognize the scent of a hobbit, advantageous to a stealthy operation and likely to distract the dragon's attention. Finally, Gandalf thought that putting a hobbit in the company would prevent Thorin, who did not think much of hobbits and doubted Bilbo's skills, from doing anything rash, such as openly confronting Smaug. Thorin objected to Bilbo's inclusion in the quest, and Gandalf had a difficult time convincing him. Thorin believed that Bilbo was incapable of helping their adventure and that Gandalf might be simply meddling in his affairs for his own reasons.  After much debate, Gandalf managed to convince Thorin, aided by slight misunderstandings on Thorin's part which Gandalf was able to exploit, that Bilbo would be a worthy member.  Additionally, Gandalf's show of loyalty to his friendship with the hobbit appealed to Thorin's sensibilities (as Dwarves respect loyalty to friends), leading him to be at least receptive to meeting the hobbit. The story serves several purposes for readers.  Since The Hobbit is written almost entirely from the perspective of Bilbo Baggins and contains little that he does not directly experience or at least witness, \"The Quest of Erebor\" provides additional insight into the events during and preceding the story.  It provides an explanation of why Gandalf wished to include Bilbo in Thorin's business, and why the Dwarves were willing to accept him.  This assists in placing The Hobbit on a more equal footing with The Lord of the Rings; as The Hobbit is essentially a children's fantasy tale, the level of suspension of disbelief is already somewhat high and such matters do not require much explanation.  The Lord of the Rings, on the other hand, has a more serious tone, and so the additional information provided in \"The Quest of Erebor\" helps to explain the otherwise questionable motives of the characters in The Hobbit."

That book, she states, uses a third-person, limited-knowledge narrator, supposedly written from Bilbo's diary after the adventure. Where Bilbo is interested in food and comfort, and sometimes other familiar things such as riddles, she writes, Gandalf is concerned with defending the West against the Shadow (Sauron). Further, the Quest actually pretends to be Frodo's memory of a conversation he had with Gandalf, rather than Gandalf actually writing, so there is uncertainty about how much of what Gandalf said may have been recorded. And when Frodo asks if he has now heard the full story, Gandalf replies \"Of course not\", so the narration is explicitly incomplete. From the reader's point of view, the point of the story is to explain how The Hobbit fits into the background of The Lord of the Rings, or more precisely, in Barkley's words, \"why Bilbo was included in the dwarves' plans at Gandalf's suggestion.\" Frank P. Riga and colleagues, also in Mythlore, write that Peter Jackson used the Quest to enrich the story when transforming The Hobbit from novel to film, along with Tolkien's 1960 partial version of The Hobbit which he had intended to make consistent with The Lord of the Rings. In their view, the Quest \"closely and thoroughly connects the action of The Hobbit with the larger, cosmic concerns of the sequel, showing how the Dwarves' struggle to regain their homeland became crucial in frustrating Sauron's plan to attack Lorien and Rivendell.\" They explain that the quest had to succeed or the actions described in The Lord of the Rings could not have occurred. Jackson made use of the connections, for instance, they state, making Saruman order Gandalf to stop the quest, and making Gandalf refuse, supported by Galadriel."

        "content": "Richard \"Dick\" Morrison, a middle-aged smoker, is at John F. Kennedy International Airport when he encounters Jimmy McCann, his old college roommate and advertisement agency coworker. McCann, who had been a heavy smoker in college, credits a firm called Quitters, Inc. for helping him kick the habit and recommends that Dick try their services. The firm has a 98% success rate and guarantees that the person will never smoke again. Dick, who works in advertising, is reluctant as he has never seen this firm advertised in billboards or print media, to which McCann says it is a small firm with all the clients they can handle solely by word of mouth. Before leaving, McCann gives a business card to Dick, who promptly pigeonholes it. A month later, when Dick is not happy in his job, he resorts to drinking, and Jimmy McCann's business card falls out of Dick's wallet when he pays the bartender. As the address is close to the bar, Dick decides to go to Quitters, Inc. on a lark. Dick is introduced to Victor Donatti, who will be his quitting counselor. Donatti tells the history of Quitters, Inc., that it was founded by a New Jersey mob boss who had been a heavy smoker and realized, before he died of lung cancer, that he must aid others in quitting. Dick is still uneasy, especially as Donatti asks many questions about the Morrison family without revealing the methods used. The following day, Donatti states to Morrison that they have found out all the relevant information about his family. Although Donatti assures Morrison that Quitters, Inc. holds clients' personal information in the strictest confidence, Dick is disgusted and shocked at what has been discovered. Donatti then shows Dick their method: aversion training, demonstrated by electrocuting a rabbit so it would be trained not to eat. Donatti warns Dick that he will be under surveillance and if he is caught smoking, Dick's family will be sent to the \"rabbit room\". For the first month, Dick will have round-the-clock surveillance to ensure he is not smoking and for the second and third months, the surveillance drops down to 18 hours a day (\"but you will never know which eighteen\", cautions Donatti). During the fourth month (when relapses often occur) the surveillance goes back up to 24 hours. From the fifth month until one year in the program, the surveillance will be reduced to 12 hours a day. After that, the surveillance consists of random checks for the remainder of his life. The brutal enforcement methods used by Quitters, Inc. are non-fatal electric shocks of increasing intensity to his wife, Cindy, a second infraction to him, and the third the both of them. A fourth infraction would involve beatings to his son, and subsequent infractions would result in more trips to the shock room with higher voltage, and more painful beatings of his son and wife. After the ninth infraction, his son's arms would be broken. Finally, if Dick commits a 10th infraction, he would be shot to death, with Donatti remarking \"he would become part of the unregenerate 2%\". Donatti says Morrison should not worry too much about the torture, as 40% of Quitters, Inc. clients never violate the agreement at all, and only 10% are subject to a fourth or greater infraction. Donatti says Morrison's greatest problem will probably be temptation as a result of availability, as there is a newspaper stand in the lobby of the very building Quitters, Inc. is situated, and they sell all cigarette brands. Dick's desire to relapse is overcome by fear of the surveillance and torture, which he conceals from his wife in order not to frighten her. Months go by and Dick is faithful to his resolve to quit smoking, even during a point when he drank excessively at a party; he is still sober enough to decline an offer for a smoke. He gradually loses the physical jitters of quitting, but the psychological craving for tobacco stays strong. One day during a stressful traffic jam, Dick's desire overtakes him and he finds an old pack of cigarettes in the glove compartment, lights a cigarette, but stubs it out after only three drags. After the traffic clears, Dick comes home to an empty house and a call from Donatti informing him that they have his wife. Dick heads to Quitters, Inc. only to be restrained by a Mafia enforcer and watches as Cindy is shocked at a low setting. After the shocking, Dick speaks with Cindy in private, who is forgiving and supportive that, according to her, Donatti has \"let him out of a prison\". Shortly after the shocking, Dick has gained weight and Donatti obtains some prohibited diet pills for him to achieve a target weight. If Dick strays from this goal, Donatti threatens that his wife's right little finger will be cut off. Morrison exercises and keeps in shape, and gives the business card to a barfly, echoing the start of the story. The story ends when Dick and Cindy meet the McCanns, and Dick realizes Jimmy's wife is missing her little finger on her right hand."

        "content": "Stephen King connects his classic horror style with humor in \"Quitters, Inc.\", as he tells the story of how the threat of radical punishment can curb smoking addiction quickly. The names of the main characters of the text, Dick Morrison and Jimmy McCann refer to the tobacco company Philip Morris and the advertising company, McCann. The story portrays the upper-middle-class in the late 1970s, particularly the way in which smoking was widespread in popular culture. When King was writing this story, the movement to quit smoking was starting to become increasingly popular in the United States. This began with the affluent in upper management roles who, like King, could \u2018afford\u2019 the effort to quit smoking. Although King previously wrote about blue-collar characters, there is a shift here in \"Quitters, Inc.\", where King explores the horrors of the upper class. Dr. Katherine Hawley says that through the tale, Stephen King questions how social accountability strategies raise ethical dilemmas around self-control. She writes that outright promises and contracts generate new moral obligations, and when we put other people\u2019s interests on the line, we must be realistic about our prospects of success. The formalization of this by promising, like Morrison does to Donatti, adds an ethical dimension. This is to say that, in \"Quitters, Inc.\", even if Morrison succeeds in quitting, the danger he places his family in is morally abhorrent and outrageous, Hawley says. Quitters, Inc. has been utilized to discuss approach to communication of characters in modern American literature. According to Dr. Tatjana Rusko, Mr. Donatti uses an emotional approach to impression management when attempting to intimidate Morrison. She says that when Morrison is at Quitters, Inc. for the first time, Mr. Donatti\u2019s speech is unshakable and persuasive. He uses an assertive tone and repetition of the personal pronoun \u2018we\u2019 to present a desired image and, as Rusko writes, a hypnotic effect. She writes that the reference to the well-known guru Dale Carnegie is a hook that Mr. Donatti uses to manipulate Morrison. Mark Browning says that \"Quitters, Inc.\" can be more accurately described as a story of the unexpected. He also draws a link between this story and Roald Dahl\u2019s 1954 story \"Man from the South\",<ref>Dahl, R. (1948). Man from the South; A short story from Roald Dahl's 'Someone Like You''' [Ebook]. Penguin Books Limited. Retrieved from https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Man_from_the_South.html?id=CgcmML7iBPsC&redir_esc=y</ref> especially as both feature the wife of a minor character having her pinky cut off. Tony Magistrale says that King's fiction is largely satirical in nature, that \"reveals a collective cultural fears and fantasies which go unspoken in everyday life. He writes that Stephen King's work mostly aims to critique a loss of dignity through a lack of self-control and powerlessness. Ben P. Idick says that the terror of King's works, like \"Quitters, Inc.\", is that he combines fear and realism."

        "content": "Stephen King has criticized psychoanalysis several times throughout his career. King tries to convey the evil of behavioral psychology specialists from his point of view, says Dr. Lenore C. Terr. She says that King developed his childhood fear of psychiatry despite the possibility that it could have helped him. In \"Quitters, Inc.\", this manifests in the terrifying addiction counselor Vincent Donatti, and the satire of self-improvement 'guru' Dale Carnegie. This is similar to another story in Night Shift,  \"The Boogeyman\", where a boogeyman that has murdered three young children disguises itself as a psychiatrist. Additionally, as King suffered from insomnia and nightmares in his youth, Terr says that he translated these nightmares to others through his horror fiction. In the early 1970s, King developed a severe alcohol addiction that would persist for more than a decade. His addiction to alcohol, drugs and cigarettes was so severe that King says he barely recalls writing his 1981 novel Cujo. Like Dick Morrison in \"Quitters, Inc.\", Stephen King was dependent on nicotine for decades. He thought of cigarettes as a stimulant for his imagination and says that quitting smoking caused his writing to \u2018slow down\u2019. As a result of this lifelong struggle, addiction was a key theme that appeared in several of King\u2019s works, notably Misery (1987) and \"Quitters, Inc.\" (1978)."

This dramatization features James Woods as Dick Morrison, and Alan King as Dr. Vincent Donatti, produced by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. Like the other adaptations, this film downplays the horror from the original, by elevating the humour in the work. The film opens in New York with a cat having escaped and is captured by an agent for Quitters, Inc. The main difference between the adaptation is the replacement of the rabbit from the original text with a cat, which like the rabbit, is later electrocuted to disturb Morrison \u00a0The film ends just like the text, with the threat that if Morrison compensates for smoking with overeating, his wife\u2019s little finger will be cut off. Moving onto Atlantic City, the cat is adopted by Cressner, a gangster who has just become aware of his wife\u2019s affair (the beginning of \"The Ledge\") In Cat\u2019s Eye, Morrison\u2019s attempt to smoke secretly leads to a chain of horror clich\u00e9s; thunder and lightning, creeping around the house at night, a shocking glimpse in his own reflection and a golf bag that jumps out at Morrison from a wardrobe. In one scene, a party that is full of cigarette smoke leads to vivid hallucinations and surrealism where Morrison sees a strange figure sit on the couch and exhale smoke slowly. The final scene, in which we get a close-up of Jerry\u2019s wife\u2019s missing finger, is when we receive confirmation that Morrison\u2019s experiences were real, Mark Browning says."

Different instructors answer the question, in different ways, but cut to its base level, the answer is always another question: How badly does the patient want to survive?\" \"Survivor Type\" is written as the diary of a disgraced surgeon, Richard Pine, who, while attempting to smuggle a large amount of heroin aboard a cruise ship, is abruptly interrupted when an explosion occurs deep within the ship and it rapidly sinks. After barely escaping the sinking vessel, while encountering a storm in his empty lifeboat, Pine finds himself marooned on a tiny island in the Pacific with very limited supplies and no food. A self-proclaimed \"survivor\" type, Pine bitterly whittles away the time by using a logbook and pencil as his diary, detailing his rise and fall in the medical profession and his determination to survive this ordeal, get even with the people that \"screwed him over,\" and return to prosperity. Over time, the diary entries documenting Pine's day-to-day activities become more and more disjointed and raving, revealing his slow mental decay and eventual insanity caused by starvation, isolation, and drug use. Determined to hold out for rescue, he goes to horrifying lengths to survive. He eats insects, kelp and seagulls. After breaking his ankle while attempting to signal an airplane, he amputates his own foot, then realizes he has to eat it to survive. He continues to amputate his own limbs to use as a food source, ingesting the heroin as a crude anesthetic during these operations. Although he initially keeps track of the dates (the entries begin January 26), his increasing mental instability causes him to lose perception of the exact number of days passed (finally ending his entries with \"Febba\" and \"Fe/40?\").  His last few diary entries, barely comprehensible, indicate that Pine has sliced off and eaten both legs, as well as his earlobes, and drools uncontrollably as he ponders which body part to consume next. The diary entries end when he cuts off his left hand to eat it (\"lady fingers they taste just like lady fingers\")."

Originally, the article was published as a piece of factual reporting. However, around the time of the 20th anniversary of the film in 1996, Cohn revealed that it was actually a work of fiction. After persuading New York editor Clay Felker to let him write an article about the 1970s disco scene, Cohn, a newcomer to the United States, set about researching the American working-class subculture he was trying to cover. One night he travelled to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to visit the disco 2001 Odyssey. However when he arrived a drunken fight was taking place outside the club, and one of the participants rolled over in the gutter and threw up on Cohn's trouser leg, leading him to return to Manhattan. Despite this brief visit, Cohn did notice that the scene was surveyed by one clubgoer standing in the doorway and calmly watching events. Cohn returned to the club subsequently but the young man wasn\u2019t there. To overcome his lack of familiarity with the New York disco scene, Cohn combined the image of the figure outside the club with people he knew from his youth, including a gang member from the Northern Ireland city of Derry, where Cohn had grown up, and a young man he knew in England. \u201cMy story was a fraud,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019d only recently arrived in New York.

On the 40th anniversary of the article\u2019s publication in 2016, Cohn said that he thought that such a fictionalised piece would not be published in the contemporary press:"

During the exam, Gon meets and befriends three of the other applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who wishes to become a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing eyes that were plucked from their corpses by a band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician who, in order to pay for medical school, desires the financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the world's most notorious assassin family. Among many other examinees, Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him. After many trials together, Gon and his friends end up passing the exam except for Killua, who fails after killing another applicant due to the influence of his brother, Illumi, and runs away to his family's estate in shame. After Gon and the others convince Killua to rejoin their side, Leorio and Kurapika depart temporarily for their own personal reasons, while Gon and Killua set for the , a skyscraper where thousands of martial artists compete daily in fighting tournaments, seeking to improve themselves and gain monetary rewards. There they meet Zushi, a fellow Heavens Arena applicant, who has a kung fu master named Wing who trains them in utilizing Nen, a Qi-like life energy used by its practicers to manifest parapsychological abilities, and is also considered to be the final requirement to pass the Hunter Exam.

During the occasion, two from the band of thieves are killed by Kurapika and he is forced to give up the chance of hunting down the rest in order to rescue Gon and Killua from captured, but not without succeeding in sealing the powers of their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer. A few days later, Gon and Killua achieve their objective and begin playing Greed Island, an extremely rare and expensive video game with Nen-like properties following some clues about Ging's whereabouts. While exploring the game, it is revealed that its scenario is actually set somewhere in the real world, created with Nen by a team led by none other than Ging himself. Outclassed by the challenges in the game at first, they are soon joined and trained by Biscuit Krueger, an experienced teacher of Nen and kung fu master. With Biscuit's help, Gon and Killua train their Nen and learn to shape their abilities to their traits. Killua takes a short break from Greed Island to apply for the Hunter Examination again, this time passes with success. The trio then complete the game together against all odds and Gon obtains the right to choose the artifacts from the game necessary to reunite with his father. Gon decides to have Killua accompany him to meet his father using the artifacts, but the duo are sent to meet Kite instead. They decide to help with Kite's research of a man-sized Chimera Ant queen, an insect that devours other creatures and then gives birth to progeny that inherit the characteristics of the different species it has eaten. The queen washes up onto an island nation called the Neo-Green Life (N.G.L.) Autonomous Region, where she quickly develops a taste for humans and builds a colony powerful enough to overcome the population, especially after her offspring learn the power of Nen from consuming Hunters. Upon facing the Royal Guard of the Chimera Ants, Kite sacrifices himself to allow Gon and Killua to flee and alert the Hunter Association. After weeks of preparation, the Association sends a team of some of their most powerful Hunters, including Netero, the president of the Association himself to defeat the Ants and their king Meruem, whose subjects secretly overthrew the government of the nearby  as part of their plan of subduing all of mankind.

After the Chimera Ant incident is resolved, the Hunter Association's top echelons the Zodiacs, from which Ging is a member, begin the process of choosing Netero's replacement as Chairman, while Killua returns home to ask for his younger sister Alluka to save Gon's life. His family is unwilling to risk losing Alluka or having her dangerous powers used against them, but after evading his older brother Illumi's attempts to intercept him, Killua manages to bring Alluka to Gon's side and have him fully restored. He then attempts to seal away Alluka's alter ego which grants them their power (Nanika, likely a creature from the Dark Continent), but at the last moment decides to revert the process rather than seal away Nanika Alluka's only other friend. Killua then parts ways with Gon to travel the world with Alluka, while Gon himself finally meets his father and learns the true nature of his quest. Some time later, Netero's son Beyond assembles an expedition to the , the forbidden, vast area outside of the known world; he is sponsored by the Kingdom of Kakin. Fearing that the expedition may bring disaster, just like in all previous attempts, the world's five greatest powers accept that Kakin join their ranks in exchange for full authority over its findings. To accompany Beyond and ensure his compliance, the Zodiacs decide to watch over him and invite Kurapika and Leorio to join them, replacing Ging and former Vice-Chairman Pariston Hill, who assembled their own Dark Continent exploration teams by Beyond's request. Meanwhile, Chrollo regains his powers and fulfills Hisoka's wish to have a duel with him, which ends with Hisoka defeated and killed. After reviving through Nen, Hisoka starts killing off the Phantom Troupe members one by one, who have boarded Kakin's ship to the Dark Continent to rob it. Aboard the ship, Nasubi, the king of Kakin, starts a battle to the death between his heirs to decide his successor. Kurapika, who also infiltrated the ship with other Hunters, takes part in the succession war as the bodyguard of Fourteenth Prince Wobble, Kakin's youngest prince and a toddler.

Due to fans' unsatisfied reactions to the conclusion of the television series, three subsequent OVAs were produced by Nippon Animation. These carried the plot from where the broadcast left off during the Yorknew City arc and covered the Greed Island arc. The first OVA series was directed by Satoshi Saga and ran for eight episodes in four released volumes from January 17 to April 17, 2002. The second OVA series, Hunter \u00d7 Hunter: Greed Island, was directed by Yukihiro Matsushita and ran for eight episodes in four released volumes from February 19 to May 21, 2003. The third OVA series, Hunter \u00d7 Hunter: G.I. Final, was directed by Makoto Sato and ran for 14 episodes in seven released volumes from March 3 to August 18, 2004. After the original anime's initial run on Animax, the OVAs were aired successively. Viz has shown no intention of releasing English versions of the OVAs."

This number had grown to 66.3 million copies by 2014. The manga had over 72 million copies in circulation in Japan as of December 2018, and over 79 million copies in circulation as of November 2021. Several individual volumes have topped Oricon's list of the best-selling manga in Japan during their release week; such as volumes 30 through 36. Volumes 24, 27, and 30 through 34 were some of the top-selling volumes for their respective years. Hunter \u00d7 Hunter was the eighth best-selling manga series of both 2012 and 2013, with 3.4 and 4.6 million copies sold those years respectively. In North America, volumes 23 through 27 have ranked within the top 300 best-selling graphics novels list of sales estimates by Diamond Comic Distributors. In November 2014, readers of Media Factory's Da Vinci magazine voted Hunter \u00d7 Hunter number 11 on a list of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jumps greatest manga series of all time. In 2019, the series ranked seventh on Da Vincis 19th annual \"Book of the Year\" list. On TV Asahi's Manga S\u014dsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150.000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, Hunter \u00d7 Hunter ranked #11. The Hunter \u00d7 Hunter manga has received much praise for its plot and characters. In his 2007 book Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson described its storyline as \"an almost random collection of psych-outs, battles, puzzles, and trickery\" that works on both a chapter-by-chapter basis and a larger scale. Thompson elaborated that with all the goals and subplots of each of the main characters, the story could seemingly go on forever and is unpredictable enough to hold reader interest. In a different review for Anime News Network in 2012, Thompson wrote that it was hard to summarize the story because \"it is every sh\u014dnen manga in one, with training sequences, tournament battles, a crime-mystery story arc, and a virtual-reality, RPG-style story arc\". But unlike most sh\u014dnen manga, he called Hunter \u00d7 Hunter \"incredibly dense.\" Examples being its fictional nen ability, which is explained \"so thoroughly that you almost think it could exist,\" and the little challenges and games the characters face; \"Over and over Togashi invents some little closed system or rules just so the heroes can break them; if he ever wants to change careers, I'd suggest game designer.\" Thompson praised the character art as great, pointing out how instead of alternating between realistic and chibi like other artists, Togashi has cartoony and realistic characters interacting in the same panels. Thompson did note how the artwork during its magazine run is often \"sketchy\" and missing backgrounds, but that Togashi goes back and fixes it for its collected tank\u014dbon release. Mentioning Togashi's love of gore he stated \"the whole manga is about the mixture of childish adventure and creepy, adult themes\" and noted how some panels later in the manga are apparently censored for gore by being covered with screentone. Reviewing the first story arc, Chris Sims of ComicsAlliance called Hunter \u00d7 Hunter one of the most \"fun, ridiculous, and ludicrously violent comics I've ever read.\" He stated that while it has every stereotypical idea about sh\u014dnen manga in force, what sticks out the most is the violence. Sims summed it up as \"full of clever setups and characters that, while simple to the point of almost seeming one-dimensional at times, still manage to be solid and entertaining based on their reaction to the increasingly strange, increasingly deadly events around them\". Charles Solomon, a writer for The New York Times and Los Angeles Times, praised the moral seriousness of Gon, a quality that gives the protagonist \"an appeal his relentlessly upbeat counterparts lack\". Publishers Weekly gave a positive review to the first volume of the manga, stating that Togashi \"shows a deft touch\" with its standard story, calling his artwork \"clear and graceful\", and mentioning that his characters are \"endearing and complex\". While Rika Takahashi of EX.org and Claude J. Pelletier of Protoculture Addicts found the art style in Hunter \u00d7 Hunter to be much simpler than Togashi's two previous serializations, Level E and Yu Yu Hakusho, both reviewers appreciated the intricate narrative and characters."

Newtype listed it as having a Japanese television rating of 10.5 for the fourth quarter of 2000. The show's viewership was ranked number six among the top ten anime television series in Japan for February 2001. The series was voted as the 16th best anime of 2000 in the Animage Anime Grand Prix, but rose to fourth place the following year. In 2001, the staff of the magazine listed Hunter \u00d7 Hunter as the 94th most important anime of all time. In a 2006 web poll conducted in Japan by the network TV Asahi, the Hunter \u00d7 Hunter television series was voted 28th best anime of all time. In 2010, Mania.com's Briana Lawrence listed Hunter \u00d7 Hunter at number nine of the website's \"10 Anime Series That Need a Reboot\". Critical reception for the first Hunter \u00d7 Hunter television adaptation has been generally favorable. Miyako Matsuda of Protoculture Addicts, Carl Kimlinger of the Anime News Network (ANN), and Derrick L. Tucker of THEM Anime Reviews all expressed positive views of the series' narrative and characters. Matsuda admired the adventure-filled world of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter and the practical character qualities of friendship, effort, and victory inserted by Togashi. Beginning with the second Viz DVD volume, Kimlinger summarized, \"Togashi's plotting is canny and occasionally insightful and Furuhashi's visuals inventive yet attuned to the measured pacing of the series. Together they create a shonen action series that is both fun to watch and curiously respectful of its audience's intelligence. A strange combination indeed.\" Tucker admitted to being \"bewitched\" by the series mainly due to the remarkable and original characters, especially the interplay between the vastly different personalities of the Phantom Troupe members. Kimlinger gave particular praise to the characteristics of the complex villain Hisoka and the deep, emotional transformation of Kurapika in the latter half of the series. Theron Martin, also of ANN, contrastingly found the plot of the earliest episodes to be clich\u00e9, called the protagonist Gon \"an obvious Son Goku derivative\", and stated that many of the story's aspects have already been covered by other sh\u014dnen series such as Dragon Ball Z a decade earlier. Martin was also displeased by an alleged lack of character development on the main protagonists' parts in the initial episodes. The art and animation of the Hunter \u00d7 Hunter anime have also been commended by the press. Kimlinger and Tucker were impressed by the art direction of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter, the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togashi's work by Furuhashi as having \"understated energy and flair, making the most of the era's (1999) mix of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends' physical feats to fluid, exhilarating life.\" Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design. \"The artistry not only shows its age but, in fact, looks older than it actually is,\" the reviewer commented, \"hearkening back to a day when digital coloring and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a rougher look were greater.\" Opinions of the series' sound and music have been somewhat mixed. Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production point of Hunter \u00d7 Hunter, and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Ocean's voice overs. Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed, but did not think it lived up to its potential. Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances, but criticized the English dub as \"a letdown since day one\"."

Digital Fox Media's Michael Basile of Fox Sports Digital Media praised the animation quality of the new adaptation, \"the animation actually appears to get better and better as the series progresses. The color palette can shift from vibrant and inviting to grim and menacing at the drop of a hat, the character designs are unique and appealing, the CG is very minimal, and the action sequences are some of the best that the shonen genre has ever produced, on-par with the best works of Studio Bones. It's almost miraculous how consistently beautiful this anime is.\" He also considered it to be \"one of the best anime of all time.\" Nick Creamer held similar sentiments, writing \"the show's fantastic aesthetics elevate it above almost everything out there \u2013 in direction, in sound design, in pacing, in animation, in basically every relevant aesthetic metric, Hunter x Hunter triumphs. That it's been maintaining this level of quality for well over a hundred episodes is nothing short of astonishing.\" In 2019, Polygon named the series as one of the best anime of the 2010s, and Crunchyroll listed it in their \"Top 25 best anime of the 2010s\".

        "content": "The paper examines the coastline paradox: the property that the measured length of a stretch of coastline depends on the scale of measurement. Empirical evidence suggests that the smaller the increment of measurement, the longer the measured length becomes. If one were to measure a stretch of coastline with a yardstick, one would get a shorter result than if the same stretch were measured with a  ruler. This is because one would be laying the ruler along a more curvilinear route than that followed by the yardstick. The empirical evidence suggests a rule which, if extrapolated, shows that the measure length increases without limit as the measurement scale decreases towards zero. This discussion implies that it is meaningless to talk about the length of a coastline; some other means of quantifying coastlines are needed. Mandelbrot discusses an empirical law discovered by Lewis Fry Richardson, who observed that the measured length L(G) of various geographic borders was a fractal curve of the measurement scale G. Collecting data from several different examples, Richardson conjectured that L(G) could be closely approximated by a function of the form where M is a positive constant and D is a constant, called the dimension, greater than or equal to 1. Intuitively, if a coastline looks smooth it should have dimension close to 1; and the more irregular the coastline looks the closer its dimension should be to 2. The examples in Richardson's research have dimensions ranging from 1.02 for the coastline of South Africa to 1.25 for the West coast of Britain. Mandelbrot then describes various mathematical curves, related to the Koch snowflake, which are defined in such a way that they are strictly self-similar. Mandelbrot shows how to calculate the Hausdorff dimension of each of these curves, each of which has a dimension D between 1 and 2 (he also mentions but does not give a construction for the space-filling Peano curve, which has a dimension exactly 2). He notes that the approximation of these curves with segments of length G have lengths of the form . The resemblance with Richardson's law is striking. The paper does not claim that any coastline or geographic border actually has fractional dimension. Instead, it notes that Richardson's empirical law is compatible with the idea that geographic curves, such as coastlines, can be modelled by random self-similar figures of fractional dimension. Near the end of the paper Mandelbrot briefly discusses how one might approach the study of fractal-like objects in nature that look random rather than regular. For this he defines statistically self-similar figures and says that these are encountered in nature. The paper is important because it is a \"turning point\" in Mandelbrot's early thinking on fractals. It is an example of the linking of mathematical objects with natural forms that was a theme of much of his later work."

This book was addressed particularly to clergymen to aid them in teaching their congregations. Luther's Large Catechism is divided into five parts: The Ten Commandments, The Apostles' Creed, The Lord's Prayer, Holy Baptism, and The Sacrament of the Eucharist. The Catechism, along with related documents, was published in the Book of Concord in 1580. The Large Catechism typifies the emphasis which the churches of the Augsburg Confession placed on the importance of knowledge and understanding of the articles of the Christian faith. Primarily intended as instruction to teachers, especially to parents, the Catechism consists of a series of exhortations on the importance of each topic of the Catechism. It is meant for those who have the capacity to understand, and is not meant to be memorized but to be repeatedly reviewed so that the Small Catechism could be taught with understanding. For example, the author stipulates in the preface: Therefore it is the duty of every father of a family to question and examine his children and servants at least once a week and to ascertain what they know of it, or are learning and, if they do not know it, to keep them faithfully at it. The catechism, Luther wrote, should consist of instruction in the rule of conduct, which always accuses us because we fail to keep it (Ten Commandments), the rule of faith (Apostles' Creed), the rule of prayer (Lord's Prayer), and the sacraments (Baptism, Confession, and Communion).Luther adds:However, it is not enough for them to comprehend and recite these parts according to the words only, but the young people should also be made to attend the preaching, especially during the time which is devoted to the Catechism, that they may hear it explained and may learn to understand what every part contains, so as to be able to recite it as they have heard it, and, when asked, may give a correct answer, so that the preaching may not be without profit and fruit."

        "content": "In this story, Asimov describes U.S. Robots' attempt to introduce robots on the planet Earth. Robots have already been in use on space stations and planetary colonies, where the inhabitants are mostly highly trained scientists and engineers.  U.S. Robots faces the problem that on Earth, their robots will encounter a wide variety of people, not all of whom are trustworthy or responsible, yet the Three Laws require robots to obey all human orders and devote equal effort to protecting all human lives.  Plainly, robots must be programmed to differentiate between responsible authorities and those giving random, whimsical orders. The Director of Research designs a new series of robots, the JG series, nicknamed \"George\", to investigate the problem.  The intent is that the George machines will begin by obeying all orders and gradually learn to discriminate rationally, thus becoming able to function in Earth's society.  As their creator explains to George Ten, the Three Laws refer to \"human beings\" without further elaboration, but\u2014quoting Psalm 8:4\u2014\"What is Man that thou art mindful of Him?\" George Ten considers the issue and informs his creator that he cannot progress further without conversing with George Nine, the robot constructed immediately before him. Together, the two Georges decide that human society must be acclimated to a robotic presence.  They advise U.S. Robots to build low-function, non-humanoid machines, such as electronic birds and insects, which can monitor and correct ecological problems.  In this way, humans can become comfortable with robots, thereby greatly easing the transition.  These robotic animals, note the Georges, will not even require the Three Laws, because their functions will be so limited. The story concludes with a conversation between George Nine and George Ten.  Deactivated and placed in storage, they can only speak in the brief intervals when their power levels rise above the standby-mode threshold.  Over what a human would experience as a long time, the Georges discuss the criteria for what constitutes 'responsible authority'- that (A) an educated, principled and rational person should be obeyed in preference to an ignorant, immoral and irrational person, and (B) that superficial characteristics such as skin tone, sexuality, or physical disabilities are not relevant when considering fitness for command.  Given that (A) the Georges are among the most rational, principled and educated persons on the planet, and (B) their differences from normal humans are purely physical, they conclude that in any situation where the Three laws would come into play, their own orders should take priority over that of a regular human.  That in other words, that they are essentially a superior form of human being, and destined to usurp the authority of their makers."

One such treatment considers the poem to be allegory, in which interpretation the lamenting speaker represents the Church as Bride of Christ or as an otherwise feminine allegorical figure. Another dissenting interpretation holds that the speaker, who describes herself held within an old earth cell (eald is \u00fees eor\u00f0sele) beneath an oak tree (under actreo), may indeed literally be located in a cell under the earth, and would therefore constitute a voice of the deceased, speaking from beyond the grave. Both the interpretations, as with most alternatives, face difficulties, particularly in the latter case, for which no analogous texts exist in the Old English corpus. The status of the poem as a lament spoken by a female protagonist is therefore fairly well established in criticism. Interpretations that attempt a treatment diverging from this, though diverse in their approach, bear a fairly heavy burden of proof. Thematic consistencies between the Wife's Lament and its close relative in the genre of the woman's song, as well as close neighbour in the Exeter Book, Wulf and Eadwacer, make unconventional treatments somewhat counterintuitive. A final point of divergence, however, between the conventional interpretation and variants proceeds from the similarity of the poem in some respects to elegiac poems in the Old English corpus that feature male protagonists. Similarities between the language and circumstances of the male protagonist of The Wanderer, for example, and the protagonist of the Wife's Lament have led other critics to argue, even more radically, that the protagonist of the poem (to which the attribution of the title \"the wife's lament\" is wholly apocryphal and fairly recent) may in fact be male. This interpretation, however, faces the almost insurmountable problem that adjectives and personal nouns occurring within the poem (geomorre, minre, sylfre) are feminine in grammatical gender. This interpretation is at the very least dependent therefore on a contention that perhaps a later Anglo-Saxon copyist has wrongly imposed feminine gender on the protagonist where this was not the original authorial intent, and such contentions almost wholly relegate discussion to the realm of the hypothetical. It is also thought by some that The Wife's Lament and The Husband's Message may be part of a larger work. The poem is also considered by some to be a riddle poem.  A riddle poem contains a lesson told in cultural context which would be understandable or relates to the reader, and was a very popular genre of poetry of the time period.  Gnomic wisdom is also a characteristic of a riddle poem, and is present in the poem's closing sentiment (lines 52-53). Also, it cannot be ignored that contained within the Exeter Book are 92 other riddle poems.  According to Faye Walker-Pelkey, \"The Lament's placement in the Exeter Book, its mysterious content, its fragmented structure, its similarities to riddles, and its inclusion of gnomic wisdom suggest that the \"elegy\"...is a riddle.\""

        "content": "Interpreting the text of the poem as a woman's lament, many of the text's central controversies bear a similarity to those around Wulf and Eadwacer. Although it is unclear whether the protagonist's tribulations proceed from relationships with multiple lovers or a single man, Stanley B. Greenfield, in his paper \"The Wife's Lament Reconsidered,\" discredits the claim that the poem involves multiple lovers. He suggests that lines 42-47 use an optative voice as a curse against the husband, not a second lover. The impersonal expressions with which the poem concludes, according to Greenfield, do not represent gnomic wisdom or even a curse upon young men in general; rather this impersonal voice is used to convey the complex emotions of the wife toward her husband. Virtually all of the facts integral to the poem beyond the matter of genre are widely open to dispute. The obscurity of the narrative background of the story has led some critics to suggest that the narrative may have been one familiar to its original listeners, at some point when this particular rendition was conceived, such that much of the matter of the story was omitted in favour of a focus on the emotional drive of the lament. Constructing a coherent narrative from the text requires a good deal of inferential conjecture, but a commentary on various elements of the text is provided here nonetheless. The Wife's Lament, even more so than Wulf and Eadwacer, vividly conflates the theme of mourning over a departed or deceased leader of the people (as may be found in The Wanderer) with the theme of mourning over a departed or deceased lover (as portrayed in Wulf and Eadwacer). The lord of the speaker's people (min leodfruma, min hlaford) appears in all likelihood also to be her lord in marriage. Given that her lord's kinsmen (\u00fe\u00e6t monnes magas) are described as taking measures to separate the speaker from him, a probable interpretation of the speaker's initial circumstances is that she has been entered into an exogamous relationship typical within the Anglo-Saxon heroic tradition, and her marital status has left her isolated among her husband's people, who are hostile to her, whether due to her actions or merely due to political strife beyond her control.  Somewhat confusing the account, however, the speaker, longing for her lover, has apparently departed (Ic me feran ge\u01bfat) either to seek out her lord or merely to seek exile, and the relationship, chronologically or causally, between this act and the hostility of her and/or her husband's people is unclear. She is told by her lord (hlaford min) to take up a particular dwelling place, where she encounters a man of unclear identity, who is or was \"suitable\" (ful gem\u00e6cne) to her, and they declare they will not be separated by anything save death. This, however, does not last, seemingly as a consequence of prior difficulties concerning her marriage. The remainder of the narrative concerns her lamentable state in the present of the poem. She is commanded to dwell in a barrow within the earth (\u00fees eor\u00f0sele), wherein she is compelled to mourn the loss of her lord and her present exile. The poem concludes with what begins as a gnomic exhortation admonishing youth to adopt a cheerful aspect, even in grief, but subsequently develops into an expression of the grief of the speaker's beloved. More recent interpretations have disputed this gnomic exhortation. According to John Niles, in this \u201cgenteel\u201d reading, it seems less consequential whether the wife has been scorned by one husband or two; it is her \u201cdignified passivity\u201d as well as her gnomic wisdom on which scholars focus. In \u201cvindictive\u201d readings, however, the wife is generally seen to burn with anger toward one man \u2013 her husband. In such views, The Wife\u2019s Lament begins as a bold statement of misery, transitions into a description of her misfortunes in which she nostalgically recalls happy days with her husband, and ends in a bitter curse upon this same man who has now abandoned her. One proponent of this approach is Barrie Ruth Straus, author of \u201cWomen\u2019s Words as Weapons: Speech as Action in \u2018The Wife\u2019s Lament.\u2019\u201d Straus bases her analysis of the poem on the speech act theory of J.L. Austin and John Searle, which regards speech as an action. Strauss breaks the poem into sections and shows how the language or \u201cillocutionary acts\u201d of each can be seen as an assertive act of telling. In a world in which women have little control, Straus emphasizes how speech could be an act of power; thus in the first section, the narrator deliberately establishes an intent to tell her story. She then persuasively presents her story as one of being wronged by her husband, avenging herself in the telling. In light of this speech act theory, Straus concludes that the final ten lines of the poem should be construed as a curse upon the husband, as this is the \u201cleast problematic interpretation\u201d. Like Straus, Niles views the poem as an aggressive act of speech. While arguing that the poem presents certain philological evidence to support an optative reading, the bulk of his support comes from contextual analysis of the act of cursing within the Anglo-Saxon culture. His article, \u201cThe Problem of the Ending of the Wife\u2019s \u2018Lament\u2019 \u201d provides an intriguing overview of curses, discussing biblical influences of cursing as seen in Psalms 108 and the book of Deuteronomy. He also examines the act of cursing in charters and wills, quoting examples such as the following: \u201cIf anyone ever alters or removes anything in this will, may God\u2019s grace and his eternal reward be taken from him forever\u2026\u201d. The Exeter Book itself is inscribed with such a curse. The Anglo-Saxon culture that took all acts of \u01bfearg-c\u01bfedol (evil speaking) very seriously and even warily watched for potential witches, Niles argues, would have little trouble accepting the poem as a curse. Whether intended as a formal malediction or an emotional vituperation is less important."

        "content": "Various efforts have been made to link this poem to later works featuring innocent, persecuted heroines, but its lyrical nature and brevity of information make establishing such links difficult.  For instance, the Crescentia cycle, a series of chivalric romances such as Le Bone Florence of Rome featuring a woman persecuted by her brother-in-law and would-be seducer, has been said to traced to it; however, the woman herself complains only of malevolent relatives, not the specific brother-in-law that is the distinctive trait of the Crescentia cycle. Similarly, attempts have been made to link it to the Constance cycle, where the heroine is persecuted by her wicked mother-in-law, which has English instances of Vitae duorum Offarum, Emar\u00e9, and The Man of Law's Tale, but no definitive conclusion can be made."

        "content": "\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" is one of 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the eighth story of twelve in the collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. It was originally published in Strand Magazine in February 1892. \"The Speckled Band\" is a classic locked-room mystery that deals with the themes of parental greed, inheritance and freedom. Tinged with Gothic elements, it is considered by many to be one of Doyle's finest works, with the author himself calling it his best story. The story, alongside the rest of the Sherlock Holmes canon, has become a defining part of detective fiction. It has been adapted for television, film, theatre, radio, and a video game. It is also part of the exhibit at the Sherlock Holmes Museum. The theatrical adaptation was written and produced by Doyle himself, directed by and starring Lyn Harding as Grimesby Roylott. The role of Sherlock Holmes was played by H. A. Saintsbury. Doyle famously clashed with Harding over several details of the script, but later reconciled with him after the universal success of the play."

        "content": "Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson rise unusually early one morning to meet a young woman named Helen Stoner who fears that her stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, is threatening her life. Roylott is a doctor who practised in Calcutta, India, and was married to Helen's late mother when she was a widow living there. He is also the impoverished last survivor of what was once a wealthy but violent, ill-tempered and amoral Anglo-Saxon aristocratic family of Surrey, and has already served a jail sentence for killing his Indian butler in a rage. Helen's twin sister died almost two years earlier, shortly before she was to be married. Helen had heard her sister's dying words, \"The speckled band!\" but could not decode their meaning. Helen herself, troubled by the perplexing death of her sister, is now engaged. She has begun to hear strange noises and observe strange activities around Stoke Moran, the impoverished and heavily mortgaged estate where she and her stepfather live. Dr. Roylott also keeps strange company at the estate. He is friendly with a band of gypsies on the property and has a cheetah and a baboon as pets. For some time, he has been making changes to the house. Before Helen's sister's death, he had modifications made inside the house and is now having the outside wall repaired, forcing Helen to move into the room where her sister died. Holmes listens carefully to Helen's story and agrees to take the case. He plans a visit to the manor later in the day. Before he can leave, he is visited by Dr. Roylott himself, who threatens him should he interfere. Undaunted, Holmes proceeds to the courthouse, where he examines Helen's late mother's will, and then to the countryside. At Stoke Moran, Holmes scrutinizes the premises inside and out. Among the strange features that he discovers are a bed anchored to the floor, a bell cord that is not attached to any bell, and a ventilator hole between Helen's temporary room and that of Dr. Roylott. Holmes and Watson arrange to spend the night in Helen's room. In darkness, they wait until about three in the morning; suddenly, a slight metallic noise and a dim light through the ventilator prompt Holmes to action. Quickly lighting a candle, he discovers on the bell cord the \"speckled band\"\u2014a venomous snake. He strikes at the snake with his riding crop, driving it back through the ventilator. Agitated, it fatally attacks Roylott, who had been waiting for it to return after killing Helen. Holmes identifies the snake as an Indian swamp adder and reveals to Watson the motive: the late wife's will had provided an annual income of \u00a3750 sterling, of which each daughter could claim one third upon marriage. Thus, Dr. Roylott plotted to remove both of his stepdaughters before they married to avoid losing most of the fortune he controlled when the daughters took with them their share of money left for them by their mother. Holmes admits his attack on the snake may make him indirectly responsible for Roylott's demise, but he doesn't foresee it troubling him since his action saved Helen's life."

In the article, a captain tells how he was dispatched to a remote camp in [West Africa] to stay in a tumbledown cabin that belonged to a Portuguese trader. On the first night in the cabin, he is awoken by a creaking sound, and sees \"a dark queer-looking thing hanging down through the ventilator above it\". It turns out to be the largest [Boa constrictor] he has seen (more likely a python because there are no boas in Africa). He is paralysed with fear as the serpent comes down into the room. Unable to cry out for help, the captain spots an old bell that hung from a projecting beam above one of the windows. The bell cord had rotted away, but by means of a stick he manages to ring it and raise the alarm."

However, the congregation is met with an unusual sight: Mr. Hooper is wearing a black semi-transparent veil that obscures all of his face but his mouth and chin from view. This creates a stir among the townspeople, who begin to speculate about his veil and its significance. As he takes the pulpit, Mr. Hooper's sermon is on secret sin and is \"tinged, rather more darkly than usual, with the gentle gloom of Mr. Hooper's temperament\". This topic concerns the congregation who fear for their own secret sins as well as their minister's new appearance. After the sermon, a funeral is held for a young lady of the town who has died. Mr. Hooper stays for the funeral and continues to wear his now more appropriate veil. It is said that if the veil were to blow away, he might be \"fearful of her glance\". Mr. Hooper says a few prayers and the body is carried away. Two of the mourners say that they have had a fancy that \"the minister and the maiden's spirit were walking hand in hand\". That night another occasion arises, this time a joyous one\u2014a wedding. However, Mr. Hooper arrives in his veil again, bringing the atmosphere of the wedding down to gloom. By the next day, even the local children are talking of the strange change that seems to have come over their minister. Yet, no one is able to ask Mr. Hooper directly about the veil, except for his fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth. Elizabeth tries to be cheerful and have him take it off. He will not do so, even when they are alone together, nor will he tell her why he wears the veil. Eventually, she gives up and tells him goodbye, breaking off the engagement. The one positive benefit of the veil is that Mr. Hooper becomes a more efficient clergyman, gaining many converts who feel that they too are behind the black veil with him. Dying sinners call out for him alone. Mr. Hooper lives his life thus, though he is promoted to Father, until his death. According to the text, \"All through life the black veil had hung between him and the world: it had separated him from cheerful brotherhood and woman's love, and kept him in that saddest of all prisons, his own heart; and still it lay upon his face, as if to deepen the gloom of his dark-some chamber, and shade him from the sunshine of eternity\". Even though Elizabeth broke off their engagement, she never marries and still keeps track of the happenings of Hooper's life from afar. When she finds out that he is deathly ill she comes to his death bed to be by his side. Elizabeth and the Reverend ask him once again to remove the veil, but he refuses. As he dies, those around him tremble. He tells them in anger not to tremble, not merely for him but for themselves, for they all wear black veils. Father Hooper is buried with the black veil on his face."

A clergyman named Joseph Moody of York, Maine, nicknamed \"Handkerchief Moody\", accidentally killed a friend when he was a young man and wore a black veil from the man's funeral until his own death. The story was published as \"The Minister's Black Veil, a Parable\" and credited \"by the author of Sights from a Steeple\" in The Token and Atlantic Souvenir for 1836; the issue also included Hawthorne's \"The May-Pole of Merry Mount\" and \"The Wedding Knell\". It was later included in the collection Twice-Told Tales."

        "content": "Like many of Hawthorne's works, the setting of the story is a town in Puritan New England. The scene provides the backdrop for a psychological exploration of the themes of sin, repentance, and morality. Much of the story focuses on the acrimonious reaction of the congregation to the seemingly benign veil. Hawthorne uses their reaction as a critique of the Puritan image of original sin, using the veil as a representation not of \"secret sin\" but the inherent sinful nature of all people. The story is both allegorical and didactic. The main themes are hidden sin and underlying guilt, with Hooper's method of preaching being to wear his sin on his face in a literal way. The townspeople grow uncomfortable with him because they start to become aware of their own sin. Hawthorne keeps the motive of the veil unknown to the reader. But the interpretation of the story generally rests on some moral assessment or explanation of the minister's symbolic self-veiling. Literary critic Edgar Allan Poe proposed that the issue of the minister's self-veiling was a mystery conceived to be solved or inferred by the reader. While Poe proposed this, Hawthorne never lets the reader know the reasoning behind the veil. While the veil is the main symbol in the story, it is also ironic. Hooper, in his stubborn use of the veil parable of one sin, is unconsciously guilty of a greater sin: that of egotistically warping the total meaning of life. In addition to standing for a man's concealment or hypocrisy and for Hooper's own sin of pride with its isolating effects, it stands also for the hidden quality of second sin. Hawthorne's use of ambiguity can be portrayed in many different ways: the manipulation of setting, manipulation of lighting and effects, and the use of an unreliable narrator to weave a shocking story that could or could not be likely. The narrator's credibility tends to be questionable because it is not a direct source. In using a third-person narrator, the minister's motives are never solidified, which keeps up the suspense. Hidden nature of guilt: Hooper arouses in a sermon the notion of secret sin and the sad mysteries in which we hide from our nearest and dearest. Hooper acknowledges the problem of sin, the guilt that is admitted openly, and the guilt of sin that is repressed or hidden from the world. When the Reverend Hooper makes the people aware of the darkness within his being, he  dissolves the barrier between his repugnant, repressed self and his conscious self. This barrier is characterized by the veil, which is transferred into the expression of hidden guilt. Hooper, in the story, announces to the congregation at his bedside that everyone wears a black veil; he implies that everyone has some form of secret guilt. Communion of sinners: Hooper leads the townspeople in realizing that everyone shares sin no matter how much they try to avoid facing it. All people sin and it is up to them whether they face their sin or ignore it.  Hooper tries to teach a lesson.  In content, the lesson may be very much like the sermon on \"secret sin\" Hooper was scheduled to teach, but the townspeople are uncomfortable with the medium. The veil is something they have to see every day, rather than a sermon just once or twice a week. Morality: Hawthorne's use of Hooper's veil teaches that whether we face it or not, we all sin and must accept what we have done, because judgment will come for everyone. Hooper decides to represent hidden sin and guilt in a literal way to reach out to his followers. John H. Timmerman notes that because of Hawthorne's writing style Hooper's insistent use of the black veil, Hooper stands as one of his arch-villains. This is from Hooper's act of separating himself from the rest of humanity and denying his love for Elizabeth in favor of the veil."

        "content": "The black veil is a symbol of secret sin and how terrible human nature can  be. This could represent the secret sin that all people carry in their hearts, or it could be a representation of Mr. Hooper's specific sin, which some readers think to be adultery. Hooper as Everyman bearing his lonely fate in order to portray a tragic truth; and there is the implicit one of human imbalance, with Hooper's actions out of all proportion to need or benefit. Edgar Allan Poe speculated that Minister Hooper may have committed adultery with the lady who died at the beginning of the story, because this is the first day he begins to wear the veil, \"and that a crime of dark dye, (having reference to the young lady) has been committed, is a point which only minds congenial with that of the author will perceive.\" Minister Hooper also seems to be unable to tell his fianc\u00e9e why he wears the veil due to a promise he has made, and is not willing to show his face to the lady even in death. Finally, two funeral attendees see a vision of him walking hand in hand with the girl's spirit. In a different view, the black veil could represent the Puritan obsession with sin and sinfulness.  Puritans held beliefs of predestination and that only \"God's elect\" will be saved when the day of judgement comes, and this weeding out process of finding the saved versus not saved was a large part of Puritan life.  The reaction to the minister's veil is one of annoyance and fear, \"'I don't like it,' muttered an old woman, as she hobbled into the meetinghouse.  'He has changed himself into something awful, only by hiding his face.'\"  We are given no clues in the story up to this point as to how or why or when the minister came to have the black veil over his face, it is just there, and as far as we are told the minister is doing nothing different from his normal routine.  The one and only difference is a simple veil covering his face and the way his congregation thinks about him now.  This is Hawthorne criticizing the overly judgmental nature of the Puritans belief on sin, for them sin was an undeniable mistake, \"Hooper need not have committed any specific sin; for the hardened Puritan, his humanity was sinful enough, and he wore it the way the medieval penitent would his hair shirt.  Anything less than absolute perfection was absolute corruption\" On the next page following the old woman's quote Hawthorne uses the narrator to point out what the congregation is really feeling on the inside, even though their outward reaction displays something entirely different, \"A subtle power was breathed in his words.  Each member of the congregation, the most innocent girl, and the most hardened of breast, felt as if the preacher had crept upon them, behind his awful veil, and discovered their hoarded iniquity of deed or thought.\"  This \"iniquity of deed or thought\" seems to hark back to the Spanish inquisition (hence the use of iniquity) and suggests the Puritan congregation is starting to realize their own faults: that being the overly harsh judgement they put on the minister and anyone else for superstitious things such as a black veil.  The fear ultimately draws from the congregation's thoughts over being saved or not being saved.  They sound loud and proud in being critical of the minister for his veil, but they are clearly weak and not confident inside their own minds about their personal salvation, so the harsh judgement of others could possibly be seen as a way to relieve themselves  for a people were never sure about whether they were really going to heaven."

        "content": "When the story was published in Twice-Told Tales, an anonymous reviewer in the Boston Daily Advertiser for March 10, 1837, noted that he preferred \"the grace and sweetness of such papers as 'Little Annie's Ramble,' or 'A Rill from the Town-pump,' to those of a more ambitious cast, and in which the page glows with a wider and more fearful interest, like 'The Minister's Black Veil' and 'Dr. Heidegger's Experiment.'\" Edgar Allan Poe offered a few critiques of Nathaniel Hawthorne's tales. Hawthorne received a mixed review from Poe, who writes that \"high imaginations gleam from every page\". He notes, however, that versatility is lacking in Hawthorne's tone and character development. Poe claims that Hawthorne is a man of \"truest genius\" but needs to work on subject areas of his writing. In his review of Twice-Told Tales, Poe also reveals a disdain for allegory, a tool which Hawthorne uses extensively."

The novel purports to be a commentary on the thought and early life of a German philosopher called Diogenes Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh (which translates as 'Zeus-born devil-dung'), author of a tome entitled Clothes: Their Origin and Influence. Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's Transcendentalist musings are mulled over by a sceptical English Reviewer (referred to as Editor) who also provides fragmentary biographical material on the philosopher. The work is, in part, a parody of Hegel, and of German Idealism more generally."

        "content": "Archibald MacMechan surmised that the novel's invention had three literary sources. The first of these was A Tale of a Tub by Jonathan Swift, whom Carlyle intensely admired in his college years, even going by the nicknames \"Jonathan\" and \"The Dean\". In that work, the three main traditions of Western Christianity are represented by a father bestowing his three children with clothes they may never alter, but proceed to do so according to fashion. Carlyle's second influence, according to MacMechan, was his own work in translating Goethe, particularly Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and Faust, all of which Carlyle quotes and explicitly refers to, especially when Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh names his own crisis \"The Sorrows of Young Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh\". The third major influence was Tristram Shandy from which Carlyle quotes many phrases, and to which he referred in earlier letters. Carlyle worked on an earlier novel, Wotton Reinfred, which MacMechan refers to as \"[t]he first draft of Sartor.\" Carlyle finished seven chapters of the semi-autobiographical novel depicting a young man of deeply religious upbringing being scorned in love, and thereafter wandering. He eventually finds at least philosophical consolation in a mysterious stranger named Maurice Herbert, who invites Wotton into his home and frequently discusses speculative philosophy with him. At this point, the novel abruptly shifts to highly philosophical dialogue revolving mostly around Kant. Though the unfinished novel deeply impressed Carlyle's wife Jane, (n\u00e9e Welsh) Carlyle never published it and its existence was forgotten until long after Carlyle's death. MacMechan suggests that the novel provoked Carlyle's frustration and scorn due to the \"zeal for truth and his hatred for fiction\" he speaks of in his letters of the time. Numerous parts of Wotton appear in the biographical section of Sartor Resartus, where Carlyle humorously turns them into Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's autobiographical sketches, which the editor constantly complains are overly fragmented or derivative of Goethe. Though widely and erroneously reported as having been burned by Carlyle, the unfinished novel is still extant in draft form; several passages were moved verbatim to Sartor Resartus, but with their context radically changed. Carlyle had difficulty finding a publisher for the novel, and he began composing it as an article in October 1831 at Craigenputtock. Fraser's Magazine serialised it in 1833\u20131834. The text would first appear in volume form in Boston in 1836, its publication arranged by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who much admired the book and Carlyle. Emerson's savvy dealing with the overseas publishers would ensure Carlyle received high compensation, which the novel did not attain in Britain.  The first British edition would be published in London in 1838."

        "content": "The novel takes the form of a long review by a somewhat cantankerous unnamed Editor for the English Publication Fraser's Magazine (in which the novel was first serialized without any distinction of the content as fictional) who is, upon request, reviewing the fictional German book Clothes, Their Origin and Influence by the fictional philosopher Diogenes Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh (Professor of \"Things in General\" at Weissnichtwo \"Know not where\" University). The Editor is clearly flummoxed by the book, first struggling to explain the book in the context of contemporary social issues in England, some of which he knows Germany to be sharing as well, then conceding that he knows Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh personally, but that even this relationship does not explain the curiosities of the book's philosophy. The Editor remarks that he has sent requests back to Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's office in Germany for more biographical information hoping for further explanation, and the remainder of Book One contains summaries of Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's book, including translated quotations, accompanied by the Editor's many objections, many of them buttressed by quotations from Goethe and Shakespeare. The review becomes longer and longer due to the Editor's frustration at the philosophy, and his desire to expose its outrageous nature. At the final chapter of Book One, the Editor has received a reply from Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's office in the form of several bags of paper scraps (rather esoterically organized according to the  signs of the Latin Zodiac) on which are written autobiographical fragments. At the writing of Book Two, the Editor has somewhat organized the fragments into a coherent narrative. As a boy, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh was left in a basket on the doorstep of a childless couple in the German country town of Entepfuhl (\"Duck-Pond\"); his father a retired Sergeant of Frederick the Great and his mother a very pious woman, who to Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's gratitude, raises him in utmost spiritual discipline. In very flowery language, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh recalls at length the values instilled in his idyllic childhood, the Editor noting most of his descriptions originating in intense spiritual pride. Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh eventually is recognized as being clever, and sent to Hinterschlag (slap-behind) Gymnasium. While there, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh is intellectually stimulated, and befriended by a few of his teachers, but frequently bullied by other students. His reflections on this time of his life are ambivalent: glad for his education, but critical of that education's disregard for actual human activity and character, as regarding both his own treatment and his education's application to politics. While at University, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh encounters the same problems, but eventually gains a small teaching post and some favour and recognition from the German nobility. While interacting with these social circles, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh meets a woman he calls Blumine (Goddess of Flowers; the Editor assumes this to be a pseudonym), and abandons his teaching post to pursue her. She spurns his advances for a British aristocrat named Towgood. Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh is thrust into a spiritual crisis, and leaves the city to wander the European countryside, but even there encounters Blumine and Towgood on their honeymoon. He sinks into a deep depression, culminating in the celebrated Everlasting No, disdaining all human activity. Still trying to piece together the fragments, the Editor surmises that Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh either fights in a war during this period, or at least intensely uses its imagery, which leads him to a \"Centre of Indifference\", and on reflection of all the ancient villages and forces of history around him, ultimately comes upon the affirmation of all life in \"The Everlasting Yes\". The Editor, in relief, promises to return to Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's book, hoping with the insights of his assembled biography to glean some new insight into the philosophy."

Both professor and book are fictional. The Editor: The narrator of the novel, who in reviewing Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's book, reveals much about his own tastes, as well as deep sympathy towards Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh, and much worry as to social issues of his day. His tone varies between conversational, condemning and even semi-Biblical prophecy. The Reviewer should not be confused with Carlyle himself, seeing as much of Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's life implements Carlyle's own biography. Hofrath: Hofrath Heuschrecke (i. e. State-Councillor Grasshopper) is a loose, zigzag figure, a blind admirer of Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's, an incarnation of distraction distracted, and the only one who advises the editor and encourages him in his work; a victim to timidity and preyed on by an uncomfortable sense of mere physical cold, such as the majority of the state-counsellors of the day were. Blumine: A woman associated to the German nobility with whom Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh falls in love early in his career. Her spurning of him to marry Towgood leads Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh to the spiritual crisis that culminates in the Everlasting No. Their relationship is somewhat parodic of Werther's spurned love for Lotte in The Sorrows of Young Werther (including her name \"Goddess of Flowers\", which may simply be a pseudonym), though, as the Editor notes, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh does not take as much incentive as does Werther. Critics have associated her with Kitty Kirkpatrick, with whom Carlyle himself fell in love before marrying Jane Carlyle. Towgood: The English aristocrat who ultimately marries Blumine, throwing Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh into a spiritual crisis. If Blumine is indeed a fictionalization of Kitty Kirkpatrick, Towgood would find his original in Captain James Winslowe Phillipps, who married Kirkpatrick in 1829."

        "content": "Sartor Resartus was intended to be a new kind of book: simultaneously factual and fictional, serious and satirical, speculative and historical. It ironically commented on its own formal structure, while forcing the reader to confront the problem of where \"truth\" is to be found. In this respect it develops techniques used much earlier in Tristram Shandy, to which it refers. The imaginary \"Philosophy of Clothes\" holds that meaning is to be derived from phenomena, continually shifting over time, as cultures reconstruct themselves in changing fashions, power-structures, and faith-systems. The book contains a very Fichtean conception of religious conversion: based not on the acceptance of God but on the absolute freedom of the will to reject evil, and to construct meaning. This has led some writers to see Sartor Resartus as an early existentialist text. One of the recurring jokes is Carlyle giving humorously appropriate German names to places and people in the novel, such as Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's publisher being named Stillschweigen and Co. (meaning Silence and Company) and lodgings being in Weissnichtwo (meaning Know-not-where). Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's father is introduced as an earnest believer in Walter Shandy's doctrine that \"there is much, nay almost all in Names.\" According to Rodger L. Tarr, \"The influence of Sartor Resartus upon American Literature is so vast, so pervasive, that it is difficult to overstate.\" Upon learning of Carlyle's death in 1881 Walt Whitman remarked: 'The way to test how much he has left us all were to consider, or try to consider, for the moment the array of British thought, the resultant and ensemble of the last fifty years, as existing to-day, but with Carlyle left out.  It would be like an army with no artillery.'\"  Tarr suggests the influence of Sartor Resartus on American writers including  Ralph Waldo Emerson, Emily Dickinson, Henry David Thoreau, Herman Melville, Margaret Fuller, Louisa May Alcott and Mark Twain.  Both Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe, however, read and objected to the book. Jorge Luis Borges greatly admired the book, recounting that in 1916 at age 17  \"[I] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read Sartor Resartus, and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart.\" Many of Borges' first characteristic and most admired works employ the same technique of intentional pseudepigraphy as Carlyle, such as \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" and \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\". The novel has been identified as containing the first appearance in English of the proverb \"Speech is silver, silence is golden\". Scottish literary critic Alastair Fowler used the book as an example of his term \"poioumenon\", a work that addresses the process of its own creation."

The song would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. American actress and recording artist Vanessa Williams's adult contemporary cover of the song was released as the lead single on May 23, 1995, by Walt Disney Records, from the film's soundtrack, and became a top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100.

Schwartz wanted to write a song for the film wherein Pocahontas confronts the Eurocentrism of John Smith. \"Colors of the Wind\" was the first song written for Pocahontas. According to Schwartz, the song \"influence[d] the development of the rest of the film.\" Schwartz said that \"a story-board outline was in place before we wrote [the track]. This is often the process in animation, at least as I've experienced it, where everybody works from an outline and each succeeding piece of material, whether it is a song or drawings, influences the next.\" The track was inspired by Native American poetry, music and folklore, as well as a now-debunked  letter that Schwartz believed was sent to the United States Congress by Chief Seattle regarding humanity's relationship with nature but was in fact a fabrication. Part of the letter reads: \"The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also received his last sigh. The wind also gives our children the spirit of life. So if we sell our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow flowers.\" This portion of the letter inspired the song's title, which Schwartz liked because he saw it as paradoxical and thought-provoking. Schwartz also drew inspiration for \"Colors of the Wind\" from the music of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick, as it deals with issues of prejudice. Menken said that while \"Colors of the Wind\" was \"born out of the modality of Native American music...it quickly moved to its own place, which is hard to define.\" Menken has noted that the song lacks humor, which he and Schwartz attempted to inject into Pocahontas and failed. Initially, the final lines of the song were \"For your life's an empty hull/till you get it through your skull/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Menken disapproved of these lyrics and asked Schwartz to rewrite them; Schwartz changed the lines to \"You can own the Earth, and still/all you'll own is earth until/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Schwartz preferred the altered lyrics. Schwartz said that this incident taught him the lesson: \"If your collaborator is unhappy, it's probably because [the song] needs to be better,\" adding that he may not have won an Academy Award if he did not change the lyrics. Menken views \"Colors of the Wind\" as one of the most important songs he has written. Schwartz believed that the Walt Disney Company would reject \"Colors of the Wind\" for being philosophical and different from previous Disney songs. Judy Kuhn sang the song to help \"pitch\" Schwartz's score to Disney, and the studio embraced the track. Schwartz and Menken became friends, and later wrote music for the Disney films The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) and Enchanted (2007) together."

        "content": "\"Colors of the Wind\" is a pop ballad written by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz and performed by Judy Kuhn. It has a length of three minutes and thirty-four seconds. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the song does not resemble Native American music. Nonetheless, adding a twist of creative license, the sentiment of First Nation Peoples' relationship to the land and its animals, as well as the contrast between colonialist and indigenous mindsets, are strikingly well portrayed, considering the lyricist's non-indigenous background. The song is about animism and having respect for nature. It features lyrics about \"painting with all the colors of the wind\" and listening to \"the voices of the mountains sing.\" Madhurya Gajula of The Odyssey Online opined that the song's lyrics about nature's interconnectivity bears similarity to transcendentalism, specifically the philosophy of Henry David Thoreau; similarly, Justyna Fruzi\u0144ska wrote in Emerson Goes to the Movies: Individualism in Walt Disney Company's Post-1989 Animated Films that the lyrics of \"Colors of the Wind\" are reminiscent of the writings of transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson and New Age spirituality.  The staff of Billboard likened the lyrics of \"Colors of the Wind\" to a public service announcement about embracing diversity. Sonically, Rita Kempley of The Washington Post found \"Colors of the Wind\" akin to music from Busby Berkeley films and The Little Mermaid (1989). The song also features a mention of a \"blue corn moon\"; there is no such thing according to Charisse. Responding to a fan inquiry, Schwartz admitted that he coined the phrase after reading a Native American love poem which read: \"I will come to you in the moon of green corn\"; Native Americans referred to months as \"moons\" and named them after events that happened seasonally, such as the sprouting of green corn. Schwartz disliked the phrase \"green corn moon\" due to the sound of the word \"green\" and because he felt it might evoke the urban legend that the Moon is made of green cheese. Instead, Schwartz used the phrase \"blue corn moon\" as it reminded him of both blue moons and blue corn tortillas. Schwartz thought that the phrase might evoke the Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands rather than the Algonquian people depicted in Pocahontas, but was satisfied with it anyway."

Jordan Appugliesi of Mic ranked it the sixth best song from a Disney soundtrack, saying that it is \"a poignant, memorable ballad\" in the vein of \"Reflection\" from Mulan (1998). Rita Kempler of The Washington Post felt that the \"stirring anthem\" is the song from Pocahontas which \"comes closest to a show-stopper.\" The staff of Billboard called the song \"artistic\" and \"wistful\" and ranked it the ninth best song of the Disney Renaissance. Writing for The Austin Chronicle, Hollis Chacona opined \"Unlike so many film composers of late, Menken knows when to keep quiet and when to let loose his powerful score. That power soars through its centerpiece (and no doubt Oscar-bound) song, 'Colors of the Wind,' performed by Judy Kuhn.\" Dorkys Ramos of Time Out said that the song and \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" from Pinocchio (1940) are \"at the top of our list when it comes to songs we don't tire of hearing again and again.\"  Spin Andrew Unterberger criticized the track's \"patronizing\" portrayal of Native American beliefs, but said that \"man...Judy Kuhn's voice soars, with those little trills and sweeping highs. It makes it much easier to get behind what's ultimately an agreeable message of environmental awareness and acceptance.\" Aylin Zafar of BuzzFeed ranked \"Colors of the Wind\" the ninth best Disney song, commending it for \"encourag[ing] people to appreciate the world around them and to seek to understand others before judging them.\" Gregory E. Miller of the New York Post deemed it one of Disney's best songs and an \"iconic hit\" which is \"flashier\" than another song from Pocahontas, \"Just Around the Riverbend\". Screen Rant's Turner Minton viewed \"Colors of the Wind\" as the tenth best Disney song and \"an anthem about the harmonious nature of the shared world which embraces all races of people.\" Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times viewed \"Colors of the Wind\" and \"When She Loved Me\" from Toy Story 2 (1999) as the only Disney songs released since Howard Ashman's death which \"approached the standards\" of the music from Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). The staff of People said that the track is \"performed effectively within the body of the film by Kuhn\".  CollegeHumor's Willie Muse wrote that \"even though Pocahontas as a whole is completely forgettable, I guarantee everyone reading this knows every single lyric of [\"Colors of the Wind\"]. Beautiful to listen to and epic in its scope, 'Colors of the Wind' transcends the movie that birthed it to earn its place as an undeniable classic.\"  Janet Maslin of The New York Times deemed the song \"heartfelt\" but less catchy than previous Disney songs. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly stated that Pocahontas \"Alan Menken-Stephen Schwartz songs have all the flavor of uncooked dough\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone criticized the song for its \"political correctness\" and for \"sermoniz[ing] about ecology by using pedestrian conceits\". The track won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media."

She tans easily and her hair is bleached out; unfortunately, she is stereotyped by her ignorant classmates and is forced to endure rumors about being an \"easy girl\" who has had many sexual relationships. Her only friend is Sae, who is actually responsible for spreading the nasty gossip due to her jealousy of Momo. Momo is in love with Toji, a taciturn baseball player, but the scheming Sae also has her sights set on the boy. Momo's life is further complicated with the introduction of Kairi Okayasu, a wise-cracking playboy who is determined to make her his. He reveals to Momo that she had saved him from drowning the summer before high school started. Things become even more complicated when Sae, in an attempt to make Momo miserable, spreads rumors about Momo and Kairi making out. The rumor about the kiss between the two is true, but it was Kairi who initiated it while Momo remained stunned by the interaction. When Toji is hospitalized, Sae convinces Toji to break up with Momo. Thanks to Kairi, he finds out about all the lies and rumors Sae has made up. Toji saves Momo from being bullied (thanks to Sae's lies again) and tells the truth about him and Momo, resulting in the students apologizing to Momo and hating Sae. Toji and Momo get back together, but Sae later tries to complicate their relationship again by threatening to discredit Momo with her newly acquired access to the mass media. Though Toji is initially defiant, he reluctantly breaks up with Momo to protect her. Momo is heartbroken at first, particularly due to not knowing that it is part of Sae's schemes. However, she eventually begins dating Kairi, whom she had previously considered annoying, and soon begins to fall in love with him. When it is revealed to Momo why Toji broke up with her, Momo is left to choose between Toji and Kairi. More problems arise and the love triangle intensifies. In \"Sae's Story\", Sae is left back a year, for she was always skipping classes. She is too stubborn so she goes to Momo's and Kairi's university every day. Toji goes to a good university by himself. Sae then meets one of her childhood sweethearts, Kanji (or Monkey Boy), who left for Malaysia when they were young, and promised to marry Sae when he was back. In love with Sae, Kanji follows her around, trying to win her over. He takes care of Sae's dog, Sora, when her parents would no longer let her keep it. The dog walks with a little limp; one day when Sora tried to follow Sae, she threw a rock at its paw and injured it. Sae starts modeling and pretends she goes to college with Momo, when she is really still in high school. She meets Honda and works for CC as a model. She meets a guy named Takuma, and he later turns her down. Sae meets another guy named Shinji but realizes he never really liked her. All these ups and downs make Sae realize that Momo, Kairi, and Kanji are the only people who care for her."

On the contrary, Momo is a shy, insecure girl. She has loved Toji for many years, although later on she finds herself falling in love with Kairi. When she found out Toji disliked girls with tan skin, she started to avoid swimming pools and wore a lot of sunblock to get her skin to its original color (presumed to be fair).

        "content": "The 1890 Manifesto (also known as the Woodruff Manifesto or the Anti-polygamy Manifesto) is a statement which officially advised against any future plural marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Issued by church president Wilford Woodruff in September 1890, the Manifesto was a response to mounting anti-polygamy pressure from the United States Congress, which by 1890 had disincorporated the church, escheated its assets to the U.S. federal government, and imprisoned many prominent polygamist Mormons. Upon its issuance, the LDS Church in conference accepted Woodruff's Manifesto as \"authoritative and binding.\" The Manifesto was a dramatic turning point in the history of the LDS Church. It advised church members against entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it possible for Utah to become a U.S. state. Nevertheless, even after the Manifesto, the church quietly continued to perform a small number of plural marriages in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, thus necessitating a Second Manifesto during U.S. congressional hearings in 1904. Though neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early-to-mid 20th century. The Manifesto was canonized in the LDS Church standard works as Official  Declaration 1 and is considered by mainstream Mormons to have been prompted by divine revelation (although not a revelation itself), in which Woodruff was shown that the church would be thrown into turmoil if they did not comply with it. Some Mormon fundamentalists rejected the manifesto."

        "content": "The Manifesto was issued in response to the anti-polygamy policies of the federal government of the United States, and most especially the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act of 1887. This law disincorporated the LDS Church and authorized the federal government to seize all of the church's assets. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the provisions of the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act in Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States in May 1890. In April 1889, Woodruff, the president of the church, began privately refusing the permission that was required to contract new plural marriages. In October 1889, Woodruff publicly admitted that he was no longer approving new polygamous marriages, and in answer to a reporter's question of what the LDS Church's attitude was toward the law against polygamy, Woodruff stated, \"We mean to obey it. We have no thought of evading it or ignoring it.\" Because it had been Mormon practice for over 25 years to either evade or ignore anti-polygamy laws, Woodruff's statement was a signal that a change in church policy was developing. In February 1890, the Supreme Court had already ruled in Davis v. Beason that a law in Idaho Territory which disenfranchised individuals who practiced or believed in plural marriage was constitutional. That decision left the Mormons no further legal recourse to their current marriage practices and made it unlikely that without change Utah Territory would be granted statehood. Woodruff later said that on the night of September 23, 1890, he received a revelation from Jesus Christ that the church should cease the practice of plural marriage. The following morning, he reported this to some of the general authorities and placed the hand-written draft on a table. George Reynolds would later recount that he, Charles W. Penrose, and John R. Winder modified Woodruff's draft into the current language accepted by the general authorities and presented to the church as a whole. Woodruff announced the Manifesto on September 25 by publishing it in the church-owned Deseret Weekly in Salt Lake City. On October 6, 1890, it was formally accepted by the church membership, though many held reservations or abstained from voting. Utah ratified its constitution in November 1895 and granted statehood on January 4, 1896. One of the conditions for granting Utah statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into their state constitution."

We are not teaching polygamy or plural marriage, nor permitting any person to enter into its practice, and I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any other place in the Territory. One case has been reported, in which the parties allege that the marriage was performed in the Endowment House, in Salt Lake City, in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who performed the ceremony; whatever was done in this matter was without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence the Endowment House was, by my instructions, taken down without delay. Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I hearby declare my intention to submit to those laws, to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise. There is nothing in my teachings to the Church or in those of my associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably construed to inculcate or encourage polygamy; and when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey such teaching, he has been promptly reproved. And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land."

At a general conference of the church in Salt Lake City on October 6, 1890, the Manifesto was read, after which Lorenzo Snow, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, made the following motion: I move that, recognizing Wilford Woodruff as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the only man on the earth at the present time who holds the keys of the sealing ordinances, we consider him fully authorized by virtue of his position to issue the Manifesto which has been read in our hearing, and which is dated September 1890, and that as a Church in General Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning plural marriages as authoritative and binding. The conference proceedings recorded that \"the vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous.\" However, a modern author reports that \"at least some voted against the Manifesto and perhaps a majority abstained\". Some members, including apostle Moses Thatcher, only reluctantly supported the Manifesto and interpreted it as a sign that the Second Coming of Jesus was imminent, after which plural marriage would be reinstated."

I did not, I could not, and would not promise that you would desert your wives and children. This you cannot do in honor.\" Despite Woodruff's explanation, some church leaders and members who were polygamous did begin to live with only one wife. However, the majority of Mormon polygamists continued to cohabit with their plural wives in violation of the Edmunds Act."

        "content": "Within six years of the announcement of the Manifesto, Utah had become a state and federal prosecution of Mormon polygamists subsided. However, Congress still refused to seat representatives-elect who were polygamists, including B. H. Roberts. D. Michael Quinn and other Mormon historians have documented that some church apostles covertly sanctioned plural marriages after the Manifesto. This practice was especially prevalent in Mexico and Canada because of an erroneous belief that such marriages were legal in those jurisdictions. However, a significant minority were performed in Utah and other western American states and territories. The estimates of the number of post-Manifesto plural marriages performed range from scores to thousands, with the actual figure probably close to 250. Today, the LDS Church officially acknowledges that although the Manifesto \"officially ceased\" the practice of plural marriage in the church, \"the ending of the practice after the Manifesto was ... gradual.\" Rumors of post-Manifesto marriages surfaced and began to be examined by Congress in the Reed Smoot hearings. In response, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a \"Second Manifesto\" in  1904 which reaffirmed the church's opposition to the creation of new plural marriages and threatened excommunication for Latter-day Saints who continued to enter into  or solemnize new plural marriages. Apostles John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley both resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles due to disagreement with the church's position on plural marriage. Plural marriage in violation of local law continues to be grounds for excommunication from the LDS Church. The cessation of plural marriage within LDS Church gave rise to the Mormon fundamentalist movement."

        "content": "The Manifesto has been canonized by the LDS Church, and its text appears in the Doctrine and Covenants, one of the church's books of scripture. However, when the Manifesto was issued, it was not apparent that Woodruff or the other leaders of the LDS Church viewed it as the result of a divine revelation. Approximately one year after he declared the Manifesto, Woodruff began to claim that he had received instructions from Jesus Christ that formed the basis of what he wrote in the text of the Manifesto. These instructions were reportedly accompanied by a vision of what would occur if the Manifesto were not issued. Following Woodruff's death in 1898, other church leaders began to teach that the Manifesto was the result of a revelation of God. Since that time, church leaders have consistently taught that the Manifesto was inspired of God. In 1908, the Manifesto was printed in the LDS Church's Doctrine and Covenants for the first time, and it has been included in every edition since. A non-Mormon observer of the church has stated that \"[t]here is no question that, from a doctrinal standpoint, President Woodruff's Manifesto now has comparable status with [Joseph Smith's] revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants\". Similarly, another writer has stated bluntly that \"contemporary Latter-day Saints regard the Manifesto as a revelation\". The Manifesto is currently published as \"Official Declaration 1\" in the Doctrine and Covenants."

Holmes, Watson and Pycroft travel by train to Birmingham, where the job is initially to be based, and Pycroft explains that he was recently made redundant from a stockbroking house. He eventually secured a new post with another group of stockbrokers, Mawson and Williams, in Lombard Street in the City. Before taking up the job, he was approached by Arthur Pinner, who offered him a managership with a newly established hardware distribution company, to be based in France. Pycroft is sent to Birmingham to meet Pinner's brother and company co-founder, Harry Pinner. He is offered a very well-paid post with \u00a3100 in advance, and is asked to sign a document accepting the post, and is also asked not to send a letter of resignation to his current employers. He immediately commences his duties, but he is concerned about the unprofessional aspects of the business and their sparse offices, as well as the suspicious fact that the two Pinners have a distinctive gold filling in their teeth in the same place, suggesting that they might be the same man. When the trio arrive at the office, on Corporation Street, Birmingham, with Holmes and Watson presented as fellow job-seekers, Pinner is reading a London newspaper and is clearly in shock. As they leave, he attempts suicide, but Watson is able to revive him. Holmes concludes that the story of the brothers is a fabrication and that there is only one 'Pinner'; lacking enough men to make their attempt to deceive Pycroft convincing, Pinner had attempted to pose as his brother to make up the numbers in the hope that Pycroft would dismiss the similarities between them as a family resemblance. He further deduces that the whole point of the exercise was to obtain an example of Pycroft's handwriting so that a 'fake' Pycroft may be employed at Mawsons (hence why they asked him to not officially resign his post). Mawsons was keeping a vast stock of valuable securities, and 'Pycroft' was to be a safebreaker. From the newspaper, they learn that Mawson & Williams have suffered an attempted robbery, but that the criminal had been captured, although the weekend watchman has been murdered. Beddington, the forger and cracksman, was the miscreant, masquerading as Pycroft, and his brother was masquerading as Pinner.  American railway bonds worth nearly \u00a3100,000 were taken, together with a large amount of scrip in mines and other companies, but the police recovered them from the thief. As the police are called to arrest 'Pinner', Holmes observes that \"Human nature is a strange mixture, Watson. You see that even a villain and murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited\"."

However, in contrast to these other two cases, the 'inconvenient person' in this case proves insightful enough to realize at least some of the deception on his own accord, whereas the other cases see Holmes being brought in to investigate more peripheral matters.

The title bears a strong resemblance to the word Leithien, the name for England in earlier versions of Tolkien's legendarium. The author translated the title as release from bondage, without making explicit who was released from what form of bondage. There are, accordingly, several possible interpretations. One likely meaning of the title might be found at one of the key moments in the poem, the point at which one of the Silmarils, the magical gems of F\u00ebanor, is cut from the crown of Morgoth by Beren:"

        "content": "from iron to mortal hand it passed. This moment is also central to the overarching story-line of The Silmarillion, in which the gem is used to bring hope to the scattered peoples of Middle-earth and is ultimately set in the heavens by the mariner E\u00e4rendil as a sign of their coming salvation. The name of the poem is therefore likely an attempt to underscore the importance of the Lay relative to other tales from the First Age. Though honor, bravery and vengeance drive the Elven hosts forward to war with Morgoth, it is only love that can overcome all obstacles to wrest a Silmaril from his crown. Another interpretation is that L\u00fathien is released from the bonds of the Eldar to the physical world (the world that is, Arda). In The Silmarillion it is said that L\u00fathien alone among the elves has died indeed, and left the world. By contrast, it is basic to Tolkien's Christian and Catholic conception of Arda that Men, the younger children of Il\u00favatar (God), by means of the Gift of Men (death) are able to escape the confines of the world. Note the comfort offered by the mortal King Elessar to his elvish bride Arwen as his death approaches: \"we are not bound forever to the circles of the world.\" Indeed, the theme of release from imprisonment runs like a thread throughout the story: L\u00fathien's escape from Doriath, her release from Nargothrond with the aid of Huan, Beren's release from Gaurhoth Isle. In every instance it is love that is the liberating factor: L\u00fathien's love for Beren drives her on to find some escape from imprisonment by her father, Huan's love for L\u00fathien is what frees her from Nargothrond, Beren's rescue by L\u00fathien. One could hazard an interpretation of the title as being suggestive of the immense power of love. Hence, the theme might find an echo in line 2978 of Canto X, spoken by Beren:"

The hero of the story, whose parents have been murdered, grows up to use his peculiar powers to take revenge. The original Skull Man was one of the first antiheroes to be seen in manga, someone who would sacrifice the lives of innocents in his quest for vengeance. While developing the Kamen Rider (Masked Rider) TV series along with producer Toru Hirayama, Ishinomori created this manga as his own personal version, which the producers at Toei Company Ltd. used as the basis for the show. They made several changes to the content, as Ishinomori's original 100-page one-shot story was too dark and gruesome (even cerebral) for a show for all ages at the time. In the late 1990s, after he had fallen ill, Ishinomori contacted manga artist Kazuhiko Shimamoto to do a remake (ambiguously a continuation) of his original one-shot manga. This remake boasted an extensive, continuing storyline and more complex artwork (along with a tribute to Ishinomori in the final issue, with several of his famous characters gathered together). This was the manga that was presented in the US by Tokyopop. The original 1970 version was digitally released in English by Ishimori Productions in 2012.

Tatsuo, the Skull Man, threateningly demands Tachiki that he tell him the name of the mastermind. After muttering the culprit's family name, Chisato, the Skull Man shoots him in the head. Skull Man and Garo then race to the estate of a reclusive old man named Kogetsu Chisato, who lives with a girl named Maya, who is mute and blind (she is always seen with her eyes closed). Overcome with psychotic rage, Skull Man threatens to kill Chisato, who not only kindly welcomes him, but has been looking forward to his arrival. Maya, however, telepathically persuades him not to kill Chisato, and reveals a shocking secret: Chisato is Skull Man's grandfather and Maya is his younger sister. Chisato tells his shocked grandson the whole story: his own son, Tatsuo's father, was a scientific genius beyond geniuses. In fact, he was so intelligent and unearthly that he was a mutant, a being of Newmanity (Shinjinrui - similar to that in Ishinomori's later creation, Inazuman). His wife, whom he married and had Tatsuo with, was a mutant as well. The couple conducted bizarre experiments that were capable of destroying humanity. Chisato feared this greatly, so, when Maya was born, he killed his own son and daughter-in-law, and sought to kill his grandson Tatsuo, who ended up being rescued and raised by Garo. He could not bring himself to kill Maya, however, and raised her to be his faithful servant. Maya then tells Skull Man that Chisato wanted to bring him back before he could do anything. Chisato traps himself, Skull Man, Garo and Maya in glass walls, and sets himself and all the others ablaze, sadly stating that \"We were born in the wrong era!\". Along with his entire \"family\", Tatsuo dies a tragic, horrible death in the inferno."

        "content": "The 1998 manga is a remake of the original manga. Skull Man revolves around Tatsuo Kagura, who early in his life was subjected to several mutating science experiments that ended up giving him amazing powers and skills. Longing revenge for the murder of his parents, he becomes Skull Man, a shadowy crusader who battles The Syndicate and its evil leader Rasputin. The story begins abruptly with a woman who possesses immense psychic powers killing a man, only to then be attacked herself by a man who can shapeshift into a bat, a wolf or an alligator named Garo. Garo is revealed to be Skull Man's childhood protector and present ally in the war against Rasputin and his hordes of evil mutants. Skull Man makes allies, loses comrades and dies in combat with a lethal mutant as in the first book. What follows is a trip into the world of shadows and the evil within all of us. While based on Ishinomori's original manga story, the 1990s version was put together by well-known manga artist Kazuhiko Shimamoto, who had been a fan of Ishinomori's work since childhood. Ishinomori contacted Shimamoto towards the end of the former's life, requesting him to work with him on reviving the story of The Skull Man. In accomplishing this, Ishinomori faxed Shimamoto the story premise and plot notes, while Shimamoto put it all together and did the artwork. A few years earlier, Shimamoto worked on a manga adaptation of the movie Kamen Rider ZO, which included a short story about a struggling manga artist who completely idolized a fictional version of Ishinomori. This manga features a myriad of cameos of other famous Ishinomori heroes, although this is mainly contained in the final pages of the manga's last chapter. They include: Joe Shimamura: Joe Shimamura/Cyborg 009 makes his appearance in Chapter 36 and is seen punching out a mugger after rescuing a hostage. During this event, he and Ryuusei, the Skull Man, meet and debate evil and the nature of man over coffee. After the two part company for the evening, they meet again by chance at the docks to stop an illegal deal between corrupt politicians, Ryuusei in his Skull Man garb and Joe in his 00 Cyborg uniform (albeit only seen in a silhouette aside from close-ups on his face). Kamen Rider: Detective Hioka, who pursued the Skull Man, was mutated into a Reconstructed Human by the Syndicate. After being rescued by Maria and brought back to Tatsuo/the Skull Man, he then further reconstructed him to be more advanced than the other grasshopper mutants the Syndicate created. In his original mutant form Hioka closely resembles the designs of Kamen Riders ZO and J, and grows his antennas after a battle with Syndicate grunts; his upgraded form is based heavily on the designs of Kamen Rider #1, Hongo Takeshi, Hioka's Kamen Rider rides a motorcycle very much like the original Cyclone motorcycle, possesses a scarf around his neck, and his head appears to be a helmet instead of physically mutating into the grasshopper head. However, unlike Kamen Rider #1, his costume is much closer to a motorcycle jacket and pants than the cloth pants and \"armored\" tunic that costumed Kamen Rider #1, and is seen using a laser pistol in his rescue of The Skull Man. Henshin Ninja Arashi: In the Skull Man manga, A young ninja in the city who is almost killed by an apelike Syndicate mutant, who stabs him in the chest with a knife. He is found on the brink of death by the Skull Man, and taken back to his laboratory. As the Skull Man hopes to revive him with cyborg technology, the panels reveal feathers flown over indicating that this man is a descendant of Arashi, it is possible that he received the powers like his ancestor and went along with the Skull Man to fight against evil. Gorenger: The five members of Himitsu Sentai Gorenger can be seen in the hero collage at the end of the manga's final chapter. Robot Detective: Robot Detective K, in his civilian clothing, can be seen directly in front of Ki Ranger in the hero collage at the end of the manga's final chapter. Inazuman: Inazuman can be seen directly in front of Momo Ranger in the hero collage at the end of the manga's final chapter. Kikaider: Kikaider can be seen in his android form in front of and between both Robot Detective K and Inazuman in the hero collage at the end of the manga's final chapter. Space Ironmen Kyodain: Skyzel and Groundzel can both be seen behind and to the right of Henshin Ninja Arashi in the hero collage at the end of the manga with Sky Zero on the right and Ground Zero on the left."

He is believed to be the missing Tatsuo Kagura at first, but later in the series, Father Yoshio Kanzaki, a close friend of Hayato's, reveals himself as the true Skull Man and explains that the only people he has been killing are those who are members of a new cult who mutate into monsters. After Yoshio's death, Hayato becomes Skull Man himself and saves Maya from the ritual, for Yoshio's sake. The Skull Man is actually not a person, but an ancient helmet that grants the user supernatural abilities and deadly weapons. At one point, Kiriko's brother Jin dresses up in a fake Skull Man suit and uses it to commit murders, but the real Skull Man shows up later and confronts him. Hayato Mikogami once lived in the orphanage in \u014ctomo City. After being adopted and raised, he left \u014ctomo to move to Tokyo so he can work for a famous newspaper. Years later at 23 years old, he is working for a second rate newspaper and with permission leaves to go back to \u014ctomo City to search for the legendary figure, Skull Man who by rumors had recently killed an actress. While on the train trip, he meets a young Kiriko who doesn't have the correct passport to get into the city and he helps her in by presenting a business card of G\u014dz\u014d. Later, after getting comfortable into his old house, he gets locked outside due to Kiriko's tantrum. Without realizing, he breaks the midnight curfew and witnesses a man who is running away from someone. The man injures Hayato after he tries to help him but the man is killed by the Skull Man. Hayato collapses on scene, pinning him to the murder but is let off due to his ties with G\u014dz\u014d. Hayato is a care-free guy who smokes and is constantly annoyed by Kiriko. Later he develops a close friendship with her. At the end of the series, Hayato takes up the mantle of the Skull Man against the original's warning, mortally wounding himself when he overuses the mask's powers. For reasons unexplained, the white mask turns black in the rising sunlight before a mysterious group, later revealed to be Black Ghost, picks him up and converts him into a cyborg."

        "content": "The Unreality of Time is the best-known philosophical work of the Cambridge idealist J.\u00a0M.\u00a0E. McTaggart (1866\u20131925). In the argument, first published as a journal article in Mind in 1908, McTaggart argues that time is unreal because our descriptions of time are either contradictory, circular, or insufficient. A slightly different version of the argument appeared in 1927 as one of the chapters in the second volume of McTaggart's greatest work, The Nature of Existence. The argument for the unreality of time is popularly treated as a stand-alone argument that does not depend on any significant metaphysical principles (e.g. as argued by C.\u00a0D. Broad 1933 and L.\u00a0O. Mink 1960). R.\u00a0D. Ingthorsson disputes this, and argues that the argument can only be understood as an attempt to draw out certain consequences of the metaphysical system that McTaggart presents in the first volume of The Nature of Existence (Ingthorsson 1998 & 2016). It is helpful to consider the argument as consisting of three parts. In the first part, McTaggart offers a phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time, in terms of the now famous A- and B-series (see below for detail). In the second part, he argues that a conception of time as only forming a B-series but not an A-series is an inadequate conception of time because the B-series does not contain any notion of change. The A-series, on the other hand, appears to contain change and is thus more likely to be an adequate conception of time. In the third and final part, he argues that the conception of time forming an A-series is contradictory and thus nothing can be like an A-series. Since the A- and the B- series exhaust possible conceptions of how reality can be temporal, and neither is adequate, the conclusion McTaggart reaches is that reality is not temporal at all."

        "title": "The Unreality of Time_The phenomenological analysis: the A- and B-series",
        "content": "To frame his argument, McTaggart initially offers a phenomenological analysis of how time appears to us in experience. Time appears, he says, in the form of events standing in temporal positions, of which there are two kinds. On the one hand events are earlier than and later than each other, and on the other hand they are future, present, and past, and continually changing their position in terms of futurity, presentness, and pastness. The two kinds of temporal positions each represent events in time as standing in a certain order which McTaggart chooses to call the A-series and the B-series. The A-series represents the series of positions determined as future, present, and past, and which continuously pass from the distant future towards the present, and through the present into the remote past. The B-series represents the series of positions determined as earlier than or later than each other. The determinations of the B-series hold between the events in time, and never change. If an event ever is earlier or later than some other event, then their respective position in time never changes. The determinations of the A-series must hold to something outside of time, something that does not itself change its position in time, but in relation to which the events in time pass from being future, present, and past. Surprisingly, McTaggart does not suggest the present, or NOW, as this something whose position in time is fixed and unchanging. He just says that it will be difficult to identify any such entity (seeing as it is outside time). Broad explains that McTaggart believed that the difficulty of identifying this entity was serious enough in its own right to be persuaded that time is unreal, but thinks that the contradiction of the A-series is still more convincing; for that reason he leaves this particular difficulty aside."

        "title": "The Unreality of Time_The atemporality of the B-series",
        "content": "McTaggart argues that the conception of time as only forming a B-series is inadequate because the B-series does not change, and change is of the essence of time. If any conception of reality represents it as changeless, then this is a conception of an atemporal reality. The B-series does not change because earlier-later relationships never change (e.g. the year 2010 is always later than 2000). The events that form a B-series must therefore also form an A-series in order to count as being in time, i.e. they must pass from future to present, and from present to past, in order to change. The A- and B-series are not mutually exclusive. If events form an A-series they automatically also form a B-series (anything in the present is earlier than anything in the future, and later than everything past). The question is not therefore whether time forms an A- or a B-series; the question is whether time forms both an A- and a B-series, or only a B-series. The proponents of the B-view of time typically respond by arguing that even if events do not change their positions in the B-series, it does not follow that there can be no change in the B-series. This conclusion only follows if it is assumed that events are the only entities that can change. There can be change in the B-series in the form of objects bearing different properties at different times (Braithwaite 1928; Gotshalk 1930; Marhenke 1935; Smart 1949; Mellor 1981 & 98; Oaklander 1984; LePoidevin 1991; Dyke 2002). The suggestion that the B-view of time can escape the problem by appealing to particulars that endure through time and have different properties at different times is controversial in its own right, but it is generally assumed that this is a controversy that has nothing to do with McTaggart. Instead it is treated as a separate issue, the question of whether things can endure in B-time. However, as Ingthorsson has argued, McTaggart does discuss variation in the properties of persistent entities in the 1st Volume of The Nature of Existence, and there comes to the conclusion that variation in the properties of things between times is not change but mere variation between the temporal parts of things (Ingthorsson 2001)."

        "title": "The Unreality of Time_The contradiction of the A-series",
        "content": "Attacking the A-series, McTaggart argues that any event in the A-series is past, present, and future, which is contradictory in that each of those properties excludes the other two. McTaggart admits that the contradictory nature of the A-series may not be obvious, because it would appear that events never are simultaneously future, present, and past, but only successively so. However, there is a contradiction, he insists, because any attempt to explain why they are future, present, and past, at different times is (i) circular because we would need to describe the successive order of those \"different times\" again by invoking the determinations of being future, present or past, and (ii) this in turn will inevitably lead to a vicious infinite regress. The vicious infinite regress arises, because to explain why the second appeal to future, present, and past, doesn't lead again to the same difficulty all over, we need to explain that they in turn apply successively and thus we must again explain that succession by appeal to future, present, and past, and there is no end to such an explanation. It is the validity of the argument in favour of a vicious infinite regress that has received the most attention in 20th Century philosophy of time. In the later version of the argument, in The Nature of Existence, McTaggart no longer advances the circularity objection. This is, arguably, because by then he has come to treat tense as a simple and indefinable notion, and thus cannot contend that the terms need to be explained at all in order to be applied. He now instead argues that even if it is admitted that they are simple and indefinable, and thus can be applied without further analysis, they still lead to contradiction. Philosophers who favour the B-view of time tend to find McTaggart's argument against the A-series to demonstrate conclusively that tense involves a contradiction. On the other hand, philosophers who favour the A-view of time struggle to see why the argument should be considered to have any force. Two of the most commonly invoked objections are, first, that McTaggart is mistaken about the phenomenology of time; that he is claiming to see a contradiction in the appearance of time, where none is apparent. Second, that McTaggart is mistaken about the semantics of tensed discourse. The idea here is that claims like \"M is present, has been future, and will be past\" can only imply a contradiction if it is interpreted as saying that M is all at once future in the past, present in the present, and also past in the future. This reading, it is argued, is absurd because \"has been\" and \"will be\" indicate that we are not talking about how M currently is, but instead of how M once was, but is no longer, and how it will be, but is not yet. Hence it is wrong to think of the expression as an attribution to M of futurity, presentness, and pastness, all at once (Marhenke 1935; Broad 1938; Mink 1960; Prior 1967; Christensen 1974; Lloyd 1977; Lowe 1987). Ingthorsson has argued that the reason for this incommensurability between the proponents of the A- and B-views is found in the prevailing view that McTaggart's argument is a stand-alone argument. If it is read in that way, the proponents of each view will understand the argument against the background of their respective views of time, and come to incompatible conclusions (1998 & 2016). Indeed, on closer scrutiny it will be found that McTaggart explicitly claims that in \"The Unreality of Time\" he is inquiring whether reality can have the characteristics it appears to have in experience (notably being temporal and material) given his earlier conclusions about what reality must really be like in Absolute Reality. In the introduction to the 2nd Volume of The Nature of Existence, he says: Starting from our conclusions as to the general nature of the existent, as reached in the earlier Books, we shall have to ask, firstly which of these characteristics can really be possessed by what is existent, and which of them, in spite of the prim\u00e2 facie appearance to the contrary, cannot be possessed by anything existent (1927: sect. 295).And he continues:It will be possible to show that, having regard to the general nature of the existent as previously determined, certain characteristics, that we consider here for the first time, cannot be true of the existent (1927: sect. 298).As Ingthorsson notes, the most central result of McTaggart's earlier inquiry into the general nature of the existent in Absolute Reality, an inquiry McTaggart claims is based entirely on a priori arguments (i.e. such as do not rely on any empirical observations), is that existence and reality coincide and have no degrees: either something exists and thus is real, or it does not. It immediately follows that for the future and past to be real, they must exist. This is why he interprets the statement \"M is present, has been future, and will be past\" as a statement about M existing in the present bearing the property of being present, and existing in the past bearing the property of being future, and existing in the future bearing the property of being past. This interpretation of the expression, if correct, does say that M is future, present, and past, which is contradictory. However, since it starts from the premise that the future and past can only be real by existing, then it remains to show that this is what the A-view of time assumes."

        "content": "Having come to the conclusion that reality can neither form an A- nor a B-series, despite appearances to the contrary, then McTaggart finds it necessary to explain what the world is really like such that it appears to be different from what it appears to be. Here is where the C-series comes into play. McTaggart does not say much about the C-series in the original journal article, but in The Nature of Existence he devotes six whole chapters to discuss it (1927: Chs. 44\u20139). The C-series is rarely given much attention. When it is mentioned, it is described as \"an expression synonymous with 'B-series' when the latter is shorn of its temporal connotations\" (Shorter 1986: 226). There is a grain of truth in this, but there is more to the C-series than this. Stripping the temporal features from the B-series only gives what the C- and B-series have minimally in common, notably the constituents of the series and the formal characteristics of being linear, asymmetric, and transitive. However, the C-series has features that the B-series does not have. The constituents of the C-series are mental states (a consequence of McTaggart's argument in Ch. 34 of The Nature of Existence that reality cannot really be material), which are related to each other on the basis of their conceptual content in terms of being included in and inclusive of (1927: sect. 566 & Ch. 60). These atemporal relations are meant to provide what the earlier/later than relation cannot, notably explain why an illusion of change and temporal succession can arise in an atemporal reality."

        "content": "McTaggart's argument has had an enormous influence on the philosophy of time. His phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time has been accepted as good and true even by those who firmly deny the end conclusion that time is unreal. For instance, J. S. Findlay (1940) and A. Prior (1967) took McTaggart's phenomenological analysis as their point of departure in the development of modern tense logic. McTaggart's characterisation of the appearance of time in terms of the A- and B-series served to sharpen the contrast between the two emerging and rival views of time that we now know as the A- and B-views of time. The assumption is that the A-view, in accepting the reality of tense, represent time as being like an A-series, and that the B-view, in rejecting the reality of tense, represent time as being like a B-series. The two objections that McTaggart develops against the conception of time as forming an A- and a B-series are still the two main objections with which the A- and B-views of time struggle. Is the A-view contradictory, and is the B-view able to incorporate an account of change. The controversy about McTaggart's argument for the unreality of time continues unabated (see, for instance, Smith 2011; Cameron 2015; Mozersky 2015; Ingthorsson 2016)."

Hlad\u00edk is arrested and charged with being Jewish as well as opposing the Anschluss, and sentenced to die by firing squad. Although he at first experiences simple terror at the prospect of death, Hlad\u00edk's main concern soon turns to his unfinished play, titled The Enemies. His previous works he feels to be unsatisfactory, and wants to complete this play, which he feels to be the one by which history will judge and vindicate him. With two acts left to write and his death sentence to be carried out in a matter of days, however, it seems impossible that he could complete it in time. On the last night before his death, Hlad\u00edk prays to God, requesting that he be granted one year in which to finish the play. That night, he dreams of going to the Clementinum library, where one of the books contains God within a single letter on one of the pages, which the old, bitter librarian has been unable to find despite looking for most of his life. Someone returns an atlas to the library; Hlad\u00edk touches a letter on a map of India and hears a voice that says to him, \"The time for your labor has been granted\". The next day at the appointed time, two soldiers come for Hlad\u00edk, and he is taken outside and the firing squad is lined up before him. The sergeant calls out the order to fire, and time stops. The entire world freezes motionless, including Hlad\u00edk himself, standing in place before the firing squad; however, although he is completely paralyzed, he remains conscious. After a time, he understands: God has granted him the time he requested. For him, a year of subjective time will pass between the sergeant's order and the soldiers firing their rifles, though no one else will realize that anything unusual has happened \u2013 hence, the \"secret miracle\" of the story's title. Working from memory, Hlad\u00edk mentally writes, expands and edits his play, shaping every detail and nuance to his satisfaction. Finally, after a year of labor, he completes it; only a single epithet is left to be written, which he chooses, and time begins again and the volley from the soldiers' rifles kills him."

In order to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter Jadwiga, he agreed to abolish all but one tax the szlachta was required to pay. The Koszyce Privilege also forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights, and obliged him to pay indemnities to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders. The privileges granted by Ladislaus II at Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski (April 25, 1425), Jedlnia (March 4, 1430) and Krak\u00f3w (January 9, 1433) introduced or confirmed the rule known as Neminem captivabimus nisi iure victum which prevented a noble from being arrested unless found guilty. On May 2, 1447, the same king issued the Wilno Privilege which gave the Lithuanian boyars the same rights as those possessed by the Polish szlachta. In September and October 1454, Casimir IV granted the Cerkwica and Nieszawa Privileges which forbade the king to set new taxes, laws or draft nobles for war unless he had the consent of local diets (sejmiki). These privileges were demanded by the szlachta as a compensation for their participation in the Thirteen Years' War. As a compensation for the unsuccessful incursion on Moldavia which had decimated the szlachta, John Albert granted the Piotrk\u00f3w Privilege on April 26, 1496 which prohibited serfs from leaving their owners' land, and banned city dwellers from buying land. In the spring of 1505 king Alexander signed a bill adopted by the Diet of Radom known as Nihil novi nisi commune consensu (\"Nothing new without a common agreement\"). The Nihil novi act transferred legislative power from the king to the Diet (Sejm), or Polish parliament. This date marked the beginning of the First Rzeczpospolita, the period of a szlachta-run \"republic\". Until the death of Sigismund Augustus, the last king of the Jagiellonian dynasty, monarchs could only be elected from within the royal family. However, starting from 1573, practically any Polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could become a Polish\u2013Lithuanian monarch. Every newly elected king was required sign two documents \u2013 the Pacta conventa (\"agreed pacts\") \u2013 a confirmation of the king's pre-election promises, and Henrican articles (artyku\u0142y henrykowskie, named after the first freely elected king, Henry of Valois). The latter document served as a virtual Polish constitution and contained the basic laws of the Commonwealth:"

It was instituted by the Government Act (Polish: Ustawa rz\u0105dowa) adopted on that date by the Sejm (parliament) of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the federative Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and its Golden Liberty. The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility (szlachta) and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which at one time had placed the sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm. The May 3rd Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's reactionary magnats, with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy. The adoption of the May 3rd Constitution provoked the active hostility of the Polish Commonwealth's neighbors. In the War in Defense of the Constitution (1792), Poland was betrayed by its Prussian ally Frederick William II and defeated by the Imperial Russia of Catherine the Great, allied with the Targowica Confederation, a cabal of Polish magnates who opposed reforms that might weaken their influence. Despite the defeat, and the subsequent Second Partition of Poland, the May 3rd Constitution influenced later democratic movements in the world. Ultimately, Prussia, Austria and Russia partitioned Poland in 1795.  It remained, after the demise of the Polish Kingdom in 1795, over the next 123 years of Polish partitions, a beacon in the struggle to restore Polish sovereignty.  In the words of two of its co-authors, Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj, it was \"the last will and testament of the expiring Fatherland.\""

Knatterton always dresses in a Sherlock Holmes-style green plaid overcoat and cap, and smokes a pipe. He is presented as the embodiment of a competent and effective private detective. He is not extraordinarily physically strong (although he keeps in good shape) and does not possess many fancy gadgets, but his mental capabilities, such as his power of deduction, his senses, his memory and knowledge of various topics, are incredibly good, to the point of caricature. As an example, Knatterton was once able to pinpoint his location after being thrown tied and blindfolded into the back of a van, thanks to memorising the entire map of the city and feeling the van's momentum with his body when turning corners."

One day and without warning, he finds himself summoned to the mysterious world of M\u00c4R Heaven, which he has only seen before in his dreams and in his mother's books. In this fairy tale world, Ginta's physical weakness is replaced with superior physical strength, incredible stamina and endurance, being able to see without his glasses. Upon meeting a mysterious 16-year-old witch named Dorothy, Ginta is introduced to the powerful magical accessories and weapons called \"\u00c4RMs\". Dorothy plans to steal the mysterious \u00c4RM Babbo, from a trap-guarded cave, and brings Ginta along to assist her, intrigued by his unusual strength and abilities. Babbo is revealed to be an extremely special and unique \u00c4RM, as he possesses a will of his own and the ability to speak. Displeased with the fact that Babbo is so cumbersome, Dorothy gives Babbo to Ginta instead, departing with a warning that others will try to steal Babbo from him. Ginta continues on a journey of discovery, reveling in this new world. When Ginta encounters the farmer Jack and his mother, who are troubled by two werewolf brothers, he finds that he misses the real world. Ginta resolves to find a way to reach home while enjoying as much of M\u00c4R as he can along the way, with Jack journeying with him. However, it is not long before Ginta learns that the world of M\u00c4R Heaven is not as peaceful as it seems when he is attacked by thieves wishing to steal Babbo. Upon meeting a boy named Alviss, who summoned him to M\u00c4R Heaven using an \u00c4RM known as the Gate Keeper Clown, Ginta learns of the sinister Chess Pieces, an organization who tried to take over M\u00c4R Heaven six years earlier. Alviss reveals that he summoned Ginta in order to gain assistance from an \"other-worlder\" in the upcoming war, as was done previously, and that Babbo originally belonged to one of the knights of the Chess Pieces. Gaining both allies and enemies, the series follows Ginta as he opposes the Chess Pieces, lead by King Orb, Queen Diana and her servant Phantom."

Kai idolizes Ginta and dreams of having an \u00c4RM for himself, despite not having magic power. Kai, however, inherited a magic stone from his dead parents; a memento that suggests his family's relation to Caldia, the sorcerer kingdom, birthplace of all \u00c4RMs and magic users. At the time throughout M\u00c4R Heaven, a new type of \u00c4RM, known as \"Fake \u00c4RM\", which is activated without magic power, became highly used. On an errand, Kai is suddenly attacked by a remnant of the Chess Pieces. Kai jumps into a pond, where he meets Babbo. Using the \u00c4RM, Kai defeats the Chess Piece. Babbo wonders how Kai was able to use him, being a normal boy with no powers. Kai returns to his home alongside Babbo. Upon returning, Kai discovers that the Fake \u00c4RM users are possessed and want to take Babbo to bring him to a sinister mysterious figure who was watching them the whole time. Alviss comes to help and reveals that the Fake \u00c4RMs absorb the life energy from their users, allowing to control their minds in the process. Kai, alongside Babbo, Alviss and his friend Elise, go to Caldia to seek help. They are welcomed into the Grand Elder's palace by Dorothy and a young wizard, Inga. The Grand Elder tells them that over 300 years ago the Fake \u00c4RMs were created by a dark magician, Unwetter, who experimented with the human mind manipulation. Babbo, the Elder of Caldia at the time, defeated him, consigning him and his malicious creations into oblivion, just before dying, transferring his soul into the \u00c4RM and erasing every memory related to the incident. The Grand Elder does not know, however, why the supposedly sealed Fake \u00c4RMs were once again spread throughout M\u00c4R Heaven, how the supposedly dead Unwetter could have been revived or what his goals are. The Grand Elder decides to seal Babbo to avoid more trouble, to which Kai disagrees. The Grand Elder orders Kai to prove himself worthy of wielding Babbo. Kai eventually unleashes all his dormant magic power, which is so powerful that confirms his relation to the magic kingdom and a direct blood connection to Babbo, finding out that he is one of his descendants.

        "content": "Narrated by a young novelist, Vanya (Ivan Petrovich), who has just released his first novel which bears an obvious resemblance to Dostoevsky's own first novel, Poor Folk, it consists of two gradually converging plot lines. One deals with Vanya's close friend and former love object, Natasha, who has left her family to live with her new lover, Alyosha. Alyosha is the saintly but dim-witted son of Prince Valkovsky, who hopes to gain financially by marrying Alyosha off to an heiress, Katya. Valkovsky's cruel machinations to break up Alyosha and Natasha identify him as one of the most memorable \"predatory types\" that Dostoevsky created. The other plotline focuses on a thirteen-year-old orphan, Nellie, whom Vanya saves from an abusive household by taking her into his apartment, and whose deceased mother's story in some ways parallels that of Natasha. It's unusual to see a well-developed character as young as Nellie in a Dostoevsky novel, but Nellie may be one of his most moving creations, and she in particular shows the influence of Dickens (Dostoevsky is known to have read Dickens during the Siberian exile; this novel was conceived near the end of this exile)."

Prince Valkovsky tries to destroy Alyosha's plans to marry Natasha, and wants to make him marry the rich princess Katerina. Alyosha is a na\u00efve but lovable young man who is easily manipulated by his father. Following his father's plan, Alyosha falls in love with Katerina, but still loves Natasha. He is constantly torn between these two women, too indecisive and infatuated with both to make a decision. Eventually, Natasha sacrifices her own feelings and withdraws in order for Alyosha to choose Katerina. Meanwhile, Ivan rescues an orphan girl, Elena (known as Nellie), from the clutches of a procuress and learns that her mother ran away from her father's (Jeremy Smith's) home with her sweetheart, a man who abandoned her when Nellie's mother gave birth. It is later revealed that Prince Valkovsky is Nellie's father. Her parents were legally married, but Prince Valkovsky persuaded his young and innocent wife to rob her father, Jeremy. After moving to Petersburg, Nellie's mother asks her father for forgiveness, but he rejects them. Before dying, Nellie's mother makes Nellie promise to never go to her real father, whose name is on a document she leaves her daughter. In an attempt to make Nikolai (Natasha's father) reconcile with Natasha, Ivan persuades Nikolai and his wife to adopt Nellie. By telling them her life story, Nellie makes Nikolai's heart soften and he forgives Natasha and removes his curse, and they are reunited. Natasha's family plans to move from Petersburg, but just before they leave Nellie dies from a chronic heart condition; the little girl makes it clear to Ivan she does not forgive her father for his cruel treatment of her mother.

        "content": "Little Annie Fanny is a comics series by Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder. It appeared in 107 two- to seven-page episodes in Playboy magazine from October 1962 to September 1988. Little Annie Fanny is a humorous satire of contemporary American society and its sexual mores. Annie Fanny, the title character, is a statuesque, buxom young blonde woman who innocently finds herself nude in every episode. The series is notable for its painted, luminous color artwork and for being the first full-scale, multi-page comics feature in a major American publication. Harvey Kurtzman, a cartoonist, created the series at the culmination of his career. He had launched Mad magazine, worked briefly for Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and on a series of solo and collaborative projects, then returned to working for Hefner with Little Annie Fanny. Each episode of the comic strip was designed and written by Kurtzman and rendered in oil, tempera, and watercolor by Elder. Hefner edited each episode, often requiring detailed changes to ensure that the series remained true to the magazine's editorial style. Critical reaction was mixed, with most praising the elaborate, fully painted comic, but some dismissing it as falling short of Kurtzman's full potential. The complete series was collected into two volumes in 2000 and 2001 by Dark Horse Comics."

        "content": "Harvey Kurtzman founded the satirical Mad magazine in 1952; an early fan was onetime cartoonist Hugh Hefner, who founded the men's magazine Playboy in 1953. Hefner offered Kurtzman an opportunity to conceive a new humor magazine for his enterprise, which the cartoonist accepted when he left Mad in 1956 in an ownership dispute. Kurtzman took most of the Mad artists with him, including frequent collaborator Will Elder, to create the adult-oriented humor magazine Trump. Although it sold well, Hefner ran into financial problems in 1957 and halted Trump after two issues. He provided office space for the artists, from which they self-published the satirical magazine Humbug in 1957\u201358. It failed to gain a significant following, and a dejected Kurtzman began pitching feature proposals to Playboy, all of which were rejected. However, he received a note from Hefner: \"I bow to no one in my appreciation for H.\u00a0Kurtzman.\" Hefner's praise encouraged Kurtzman to meet with publisher Ian Ballantine and create Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book (1959). This introduced the innocent and idealistic Goodman Beaver, a male character who continued to appear\u2014with artwork by Elder\u2014in Kurtzman's Help! (1960). Kurtzman continued to correspond with Hefner and Playboy executive editor Ray Russell, who was interested in Kurtzman's idea of a comic strip suitable for the magazine's audience and suggested \"satire\u00a0... as an excuse or rationale for a slick magazine to be publishing a comic strip.\" Although single-panel cartoons were an established part of the magazine, a comic strip was unprecedented and had to be justified. Kurtzman submitted some Goodman Beaver strips and was surprised to receive a favorable response from Hefner, who liked the \"fresh and eager\" character. He especially enjoyed \"Goodman Goes Playboy\", which featured a boisterous romp in Hefner's mansion. Hefner nevertheless insisted that the material was not right for his magazine, but requested an explanation of the character with a suggestion: \"Maybe there is a way of launching a similar series\u00a0... that can somehow be related to Playboy\". Kurtzman replied that Goodman Beaver \"could be foolish and at the same time wise,\" and that he \"innocently partakes of the bad while espousing the good.\" He further stated that Beaver's innocent, restive, and charming nature allotted him especial creative freedom. A week later, Kurtzman wrote to Hefner, \"What would you think of a girl character\u00a0... whom I could apply to my kind of situations?\" Six weeks later Hefner replied, \"I think your notion of doing a Goodman Beaver strip of two, three, or four pages, but using a sexy girl\u00a0... is a bull's eye. We can run it every issue.\""

        "content": "Kurtzman recruited his long-time collaborator Will Elder to work on the strip's illustrations. He suggested to Elder an \"outlineless\", painted style, then thought the strip would be better suited by an India inked, outlined comic book style with flat color behind it. Hefner, whose opinion prevailed, preferred the more difficult, fully painted, outlineless look. Kurtzman's suggestions for the feature's name included The Perils of Zelda, The Perils of Irma, and Little Mary Mixup; he settled on Little Annie Fanny, its title and logo a parody of Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie. The cartoonist began submitting story ideas for the multi-page comic strip to Hefner for approval. Over the twenty-six years he wrote the character, he was allowed (with Playboy substantial budget) to travel for research, photography, and sketching. He followed this with a preliminary script for Hefner, who revised it. Kurtzman then worked out the story's composition, pacing, and action in thumbnail drawings and pencil roughs of each page of the comic, followed by larger, more-detailed layouts on translucent vellum specifying lighting, color, and speech balloon placement. These also required Hefner's approval\u2014a typical two- to seven-page episode would take as many as nine pages of layout. Kurtzman then discussed the layout with Elder, who drove from his home in New Jersey to Kurtzman's in New York. Kurtzman acted out every detail of the strip; according to Elder, \"He would change his voice and take on the characteristics of each role\u00a0... We'd crack each other up and fall down laughing.\" This gave Elder what he needed to create the penciling, including \"eye pops\" (background gags worked into blank areas of Kurtzman's layout; Hefner rejected many, so Elder created as many as possible) and the final rendering. Elder painted in oil, tempera, and watercolor, never using ink. Beginning with a white illustration board, Elder explained he would \"pile on\" his oil paint, light colors over dark, then apply tempera, then layer several watercolor washes to give Annie luminous tones. \"The colors were like gems to me,\" he said. \"I worked very hard to give them iridescence.\" The work was labor-intensive and deadlines were often difficult to meet, so other artists, including Russ Heath, Arnold Roth, Jack Davis, Al Jaffee, Frank Frazetta, and Paul Coker, were occasionally enlisted to help finish the art. Jaffee, a childhood friend of Elder, said about the experience: \"Little Annie Fannie was the most unique, lavishly produced cartoon cum illustration feature ever. Each panel was a miniature masterpiece that Willie glazed and re-glazed in brilliant watercolor until he reached the level of 3-D-like translucence that he wanted. I know from first-hand experience what went into this project.\" Letterers inked the dialog balloons before Kurtzman cleaned and submitted the finished work. Little Annie Fanny,  first comic strip, was the first multi-page comics feature in a major American magazine."

        "content": "Annie Fanny is the feature's lead character. Like other young women in Playboy pictorials, Annie is beautiful, buxom, and often unclothed. She is sexually innocent, oblivious to the worldliness around her. Like her forebear Goodman Beaver, Annie was conceived as a modern Candide, above the story's corruptions and temptations. Unlike Goodman, however, Annie is never shocked or offended; she remains blithe. The authors of Icons of the American Comic Book say Annie \"glides through a changing world with an untiring optimism\" with a \"good-natured lack of desire\". She is insulated from the carnal nature of those around her, who explain the new rules of society to her each episode. Ruthie, Annie's mother hen roommate, appears in the first episode and remains in the strip throughout its run. Wanda Homefree, Annie Fanny's wild and shapely best friend, first appears in an episode-10 beauty contest as Miss Greenwich Village and is often seen at Annie's side throughout the remainder of the series. Ralphie Towzer, Annie's nerdy-but-hip do-gooder boyfriend, has the look of Goodman Beaver (with playwright Arthur Miller's eyeglasses and pipe) and the temperament of a strait-laced, chastising prude. Solly Brass, Annie's huckster agent, is based on actor Phil Silvers. A number of other characters in Little Annie Fanny are derived from Gray's Little Orphan Annie. Sugardaddy Bigbucks, Annie's surrogate father and a powerful, manipulative capitalist, is based on Daddy Warbucks. His mysterious assistant, the Wasp, derives from Warbucks' assistant the Asp, and Punchjab, his bodyguard, comes from the character Punjab. Other supporting characters include ad man Benton Battbarton (whose name is taken from the advertising agencies Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn and Benton & Bowles), Battbarton's rival Huck Buxton (modeled on gap-toothed British actor Terry-Thomas), Duncan Fyfe Hepplewhite (an art plagiarist), and Freddie Flink (who resembles comic actor Fred Gwynne from Car 54, Where Are You?)."

        "content": "Little Annie Fanny takes the reader through the changing attitudes of American culture, satirizing contemporary trends and fads. In each of the 107 episodes, Annie experiences the latest popular movie, fashion statement, national politics, or society headline. During the strip's first decade, when it ran up to eleven times per year, Annie meets caricatures of the Beatles (who lust for Annie), Sean Connery (playing \"James Bomb\"), reclusive Catcher in the Rye author J.\u00a0D. Salinger (as \"Salinger Fiengold\"), NFL champions Green Bay Packers (as the \"Greenback Busters\"), and Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, and Sonny\u00a0& Cher on the \"Hoopadedoo Show\" (Hullabaloo show). During these early years, the strip pokes fun at miniskirts, LSD, free love, and bra burning. Background caricatures include Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, prissy-but-powerful J.\u00a0Edgar Hoover, unisex fashion designer Rudi Gernreich, and the \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\" ad campaign of Humble Oil. During the 1970s, when the strip ran three to five times per year, Annie sees violent films such as A Clockwork Orange and The French Connection and meets sex novelist Philip Roth, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, chess champion Bobby Fischer, and shock rocker Alice Cooper. She experiences disco, streaking, C.B.\u00a0radio, nudist resorts, and women's liberation. Background \"eye pops\" include Hollywood heavy Charles Bronson, Laugh-In Arte Johnson, the Avis TV commercial's O. J. Simpson, and Star Wars C-3PO. In the 1980s, when Little Annie Fanny appeared once or twice a year, Annie deals with personal computers, goes to Urban Cowboy Gilley's Club, cruises on The Love Boat, and encounters Indiana Jones, Ayatollah Khomeini, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, and Woody Allen. Elder's background gags include the Coneheads, Howard Cosell, Miss Piggy, E.T., and Billy Beer."

About its venue he said, \"Playboy magazine, whatever you may say about its content, always did a first-rate job of printing color pictures.\" According to comics commentators Randy Duncan and Matthew\u00a0J. Smith, the series \"reads today as an amusing look at the evolving mores of the sexual revolution\". Comics editor Monte Beauchamp said that Little Annie Fanny was \"the most elaborate comic strip ever created\" and cartoonist-critic R.\u00a0C. Harvey called it \"a masterpiece\u00a0... the most lavish color comic strip of all time\". Not all were as impressed. Noting that Kurtzman was financially strapped before making his living for twenty-six years from Playboy, historian Paul Buhle wrote: \"The strip had many brilliant early moments, but went downhill as the writer and artist bent to editor Hugh Hefner's demands for as much titillation as possible.\" Cartoonist Art Spiegelman said that Little Annie Fanny devolved from the more interesting Goodman Beaver. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, whose career Kurtzman helped launch, scorned Playboy and Annie. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of Help!, said that Little Annie Fanny was not as sharp as Kurtzman's earlier work: \"technically brilliant but\u00a0... slightly compromised.\" Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, who handles Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that \"most Kurtzman devotees would not consider Little Annie Fanny genius work\u00a0... [and] some would argue the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded\". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who \"was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different ideas about what was funny or satiric\" and insisted that each strip \"had to include Annie disrobing\". Beauchamp agreed: \"Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand.\" Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that \"humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously.\" However, they repeated their respect: \"The eternally innocent Annie performed admirably as a nonjudgmental witness to the changing tides of the sexual revolution.\""

Before the story's timeline, his roles included Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny Court Martial, Abe Lincoln in Abe Lincoln in Illinois, the young architect in The Moon is Blue, Henry the Eighth in Anne of the Thousand Days and Doc in Come Back Little Sheba. He's also known for his intense shyness when he's out of character or without a script in front of him. When approached with a new role, he asks \"Who am I this time?\". In the story, he plays Marlon Brando's role in A Streetcar Named Desire. It's in this context that he meets Helene, who plays his wife on stage. He ultimately marries Helene. Helene Shaw works for a phone company and travels the country teaching local girls how to take care of the company's new billing machine. The director notices her beauty and persuades her to audition for a part in A Streetcar Named Desire. Her initial audition falls flat as she seemingly has no passion to draw on. She confesses that she's never been in love but that she wants to be. It's not until she reads the script again, with Harry fully in character, that she's able to tap into the emotion necessary for the part. Over the course of the auditions, she falls in love with Harry's onstage persona. After the final performance, she gives him a copy of Romeo and Juliet which they read from and, together, they take on the characters' personas. She stays in North Crawford, marries Harry a week later and they seem to be happy, depending on which play they're reading from that week. The short story is written from the unnamed director's point of view."

The story drops the reader into Little Chandler's life when he is at work, where he cannot focus because he is preoccupied with the thought of a visit later that day. He anxiously awaits this visit with his old friend Ignatius Gallaher. Gallaher is now a \"brilliant figure\" in the London Press and Little Chandler has not seen him in eight years. As Little Chandler thinks about his old friend and the success that has come to him, he begins to reflect upon his own life. This reflection gives the reader insight to Little Chandler's character. The reader sees Little Chandler as a mere observer of life, a reluctant character.  He is timid, because he enjoys poetry yet is too \"shy\" to read it to his wife. Little Chandler likes to think that he himself could have been a writer if only he had put his mind to it. All of the \"different moods and impressions he wished to express in verse\" could still be achieved if he could just express himself. But as much as Little Chandler covers up his true feelings with these thoughts that seem to \"comfort\" him, the reader can see past this. These feelings are more clearly exposed to the reader in the bar where Little Chandler actually meets Gallaher. Here, Gallaher tells enchanting stories of his vast traveling. His life is the exact opposite of Little Chandler's and Little Chandler begins to feel that his wife is holding him back from success as a result of Gallaher's glorification of his travels and freedoms. Without his wife, without his little boy, he would be free to prosper. Deep envy sets into Little Chandler. It seems as though the more they drink, and the longer they talk, the more inferior Chandler feels. Still, he tries to hide his envy of Gallaher's life by saying how one day Gallaher will get married and start a family too. Joyce shifts the scene to Little Chandler's home. We find Little Chandler with his child in his arms. He is sitting at a table looking at a picture of his wife, Annie. He looks into her eyes searching for answers to his now confused state of mind. All he finds is coldness. He sees a pretty girl, but he can see no life in her, and he compares her unfavourably to the rich, exotic women Gallaher says are available to him. He wonders why he married Annie. He then opens a book of Byron's poetry and begins to read until the child begins to cry and Little Chandler finds he cannot comfort him. Little Chandler snaps at his son. The frightened baby cries harder and harder until Annie comes. Through her interaction with Little Chandler and the child, it becomes apparent that Little Chandler is not her main priority. Little Chandler feels trapped. All feelings of hope that existed at the beginning of the day are now gone. It is at this moment that Little Chandler reaches a deep moment of recognition.  He finally sees the truth that the reader has known all along. His own reluctance is the only thing responsible for his feelings of incompleteness, and he can now only blame himself.  Tears come to Little Chandler's eyes, and the story is cut off."

He pointed out there is a legitimate lack of action in many of the stories, certainly in \"A Little Cloud\", and this \"content of lack\" is mirrored by the language Joyce used. Mosher believes the talking about nothing, in the way that many Joyce characters do, is actually rather important, and argued that, in terms of the language, this style actually portrays an abundance of creativity and quality, rather than the lack of fresh thought that could be implied by the clich\u00e9 nature of the writing. Thematically, Moshed said this is important in an ironic way, because, though it shows creativity on the part of Joyce, it shows little on the part of Chandler: he thinks and speaks in this way because, as he says in the end to Annie, he \"couldn\u2019t... didn't do anything.\""

O'Grady believes this connection is logical, because it lends structural and thematic significance to the title. This story is Little Chandler's \"song of experience\" according to O'Grady because the \"infant hope\" carried by Chandler's child is overwhelmed with the sorrow and remorse he feels. Terence Brown, meanwhile, has suggested the title may be an allusion to the Biblical tale of Elijah and the prophets of Baal and, more particularly, to I Kings 18:44."

The story's narrator reminisces about Kong Yiji, a pedantic scholar who failed to pass the Xiucai (Chinese: \u79c0\u624d) examination and became the laughing-stock of the tavern where the narrator worked. In the end, Kong's legs were broken as punishment for stealing books. He is a ridiculous and pathetic character, a symbol for the indifference between people in the old days."

Kong Yiji was a self-styled scholar who failed to pass the Xiucai examination but filled his speech with literary jargon. He was the only customer who wore a scholar's long gown and drank his wine while standing. He had often been laughed at contemptuously by other customers, who gave him the nickname \"Kong Yiji\". Kong Yiji was poor and sometimes stole books, but he never defaulted on payment of the tavern. He was willing to teach the narrator about writing and shared fennel peas with children. Later, Kong Yiji had been caught stealing and was beaten until his legs broke. He dragged himself to the tavern and ordered some wine. After that, he was not seen again and presumably died as a result of his injuries."

The imperial examination system that had been in place since the Sui and Tang dynasties still prevailed. Scholars who passed the exams were awarded government office, but they were few in number. Many who failed the exams were left poor and destitute. Kong Yiji was a typical example of those who studied the classics for most of their lives but failed the exams. After the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, Yuan Shikai attempted to become emperor. The restoration forces were rampant, and the results of the revolution were stolen. During the late Qing reforms of 1905, the imperial examination system was abolished, but traditional culture and education were still deeply rooted. The October Revolution of 1917 showed the power of Marxism-Leninism to transform a large Asian empire into a strong nation. Chinese revolutionary intellectuals such as Li Dazhao initiated the New Culture Movement and mounted a fierce attack on Confucian culture and education. Lu Xun was a powerful voice in this movement to crush Confucian culture, and to \"depict a life or a life in society for readers to see\"."

Although the imperial examination system was abolished in 1906, the social foundation for cultivating people like Kong Yiji still existed. Confucius and Mencius were still the core elements of social education. To arouse the young generation, Lu Xun created a set of the Xianheng Tavern in Luzhen and artistically showed the lives of poor intellectuals in society more than 20 years ago. He aimed to inspire readers to think about the social situation and criticize the imperial examination system. One of the statements about the purpose of the story is that Lu Xun wrote this story to express the protest of the college students at that time. Other claims suggest that Lu Xun wrote the story to explain the problems with China's old society, where people could waste their entire lives trying to pass meaningless examinations and where people were selfish and indifferent to the plight of others. Lu Xun opposed the traditional Chinese system of education based on imperial examinations and the cruelty of Chinese society."

Kong Yiji just dipped his fingers in the wine and tended to write on the counter. When he saw how unenthusiastic I was, he sighed disappointedly. Kong Yiji believes that only a scholar could enter the upper class, so he enthusiastically teaches the story's narrator, a young fellow working in a tavern, to read and write, which reflects his kindness and sincerity. Kong Yiji's kindness was also reflected in giving fennel peas to children. A few times, the neighborhood children heard the laughter, also came and surrounded Kong Yiji. He then gave each kid a hui-xiang peas. The kids ate the peas but did not disperse, and their eyes were still looking at the dish. Kong Yiji was flustered and stretched out his five fingers to cover the plate, bent down, and said, \"There isn\u2019t much more.

It is based on the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur and is told from the perspective of Asterion, the Minotaur. One of Borges's shortest stories, it was written over a period of two days and received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics and authors. The story explores themes of death, redemption, and the nature of monstrosity. Its narrative style has been referred to as a \"literary puzzle\", with the narrator's identity not fully revealed until the end of the story. Literary critic Gene H.

He describes his house in detail: that it has no locked doors; that it has many corridors and rooms, pools, and courtyards. He explains his hermetic ways by recounting how once, when he left his house, the commoners were so agitated that he now does not go out, believing that as a child of a queen, his royal blood sets him apart. Asterion explains how he spends his days in solitude: running through the corridors; pretending to sleep; and sometimes pretending that \"the other Asterion\" has come to visit, and giving him a tour of the house. Asterion goes into detail about the infinitude of his house, comparing it to the universe. He also suggests that perhaps he created the world and has forgotten about it. Finally, he makes mention of other people: nine men who come every nine years \"so that I may deliver them from all evil\", and whose bodies he leaves in the empty rooms to distinguish one room from another. Asterion speculates about his own death, and eagerly awaits the coming of his \"redeemer\", who will take him away from his infinite house. The story ends with a line from Theseus\u2014\"Would you believe it, Ariadne?

        "content": "In the epilogue to his 1949 short-story collection The Aleph, Borges wrote that the inspiration for \"The House of Asterion\" and the \"character of its sad protagonist\" was The Minotaur, a painting completed in 1885 by English artist George Frederic Watts. The painting depicts the mythological Minotaur as a solitary and seemingly lonely creature, leaning on a parapet and staring longingly at the sea while gripping a crushed bird in his hand. Borges's composition of \"The House of Asterion\" and other short stories in The Aleph coincided with his turbulent relationship with Argentine writer Estela Canto. Borges first met Canto in 1944 and proposed to her only a year later; but their relationship ended in July 1946 after Canto came to resent Borges's mother, whom she found to be overly controlling of him. Edwin Williamson, one of Borges's biographers, wrote that Canto's desertion of Borges and his subsequent unhappiness influenced elements of  \"The House of Asterion\", including the title character's extreme loneliness and desire to be liberated from his monotonous existence. According to Norman Thomas di Giovanni, an editor and translator who frequently collaborated with Borges, \"The House of Asterion\" was written over a period of two days in 1947, after Borges discovered that he had two blank pages to fill in Los Anales de Buenos Aires, the literary magazine he edited. Modern analyses of Borges's original handwritten manuscript, which is kept at the University of Virginia, have revealed the revisions he made to earlier drafts of the work in order to more effectively disguise the narrator's identity in the story's beginning. For instance, Borges replaced the phrase \"los griegos\" (the Greeks) with \"los hombres\" (the men) in the third sentence, removing a potential intimation of Greek mythology. Analyses of Borges's revisions have also suggested that, while writing the story, he experimented with various framings of the reveal of Asterion's identity, deliberating on whether to explicitly name the Minotaur's labyrinth and to mention the nature of Theseus's weapon. The original Spanish-language version of \"The House of Asterion\" was published in print in the May\u2013June 1947 edition of Los Anales de Buenos Aires. It was accompanied by an illustration, by Austrian artist Marie Elisabeth Wrede, that depicted Asterion slumped on the ground with his head covered by a shroud, as Theseus stands over him, sword in hand. The story would later be included, alongside twelve other short stories by Borges, in The Aleph, first published by Editorial Losada in June 1949. It was translated into English by James Irby and Donald Yates in their 1962 collection Labyrinths, and by di Giovanni (in collaboration with Borges) in 1970."

The bulk of the story consists of Asterion's inner monologue, which limits the reader's vision to Asterion's view of the world. This narrative technique was frequently employed by Borges, including in the short stories \"Man on Pink Corner\" and \"The Form of the Sword\". The presentation of the well-known myth from Asterion's perspective also serves to humanize him, casting him as more of an eccentric, sympathetic character than a monstrous one. Literary critic Gene H. Bell-Villada wrote that \"prior to Borges's little fable, there is no instance of a major author so inverting the hero\u2013monster relationship\". Several analyses have noted the apparent presence of an unnamed third-person editor who briefly clarifies Asterion's language throughout the story. In a footnote, the editor admits to replacing Asterion's use of the numeral \"fourteen\" with the word \"infinite\" after inferring this to be Asterion's original intent. The filtering of Asterion's words through this anonymous editor, who is also privy to Theseus's comments to Ariadne after he kills Asterion, contributes to the story's tension."

Its structure is thus similar to a labyrinth\u2014the story's setting and an object of Borges's lifelong fascination\u2014that the reader must \"penetrate to the identity of the prisoner and thus to the meaning of the story\". The story's epigraph, directly quoted from Apollodorus's Bibliotheca, intimates the narrator's identity at the onset, but only for readers already acquainted with the Minotaur's lesser-known name. Further hints are provided in the descriptions of Asterion's labyrinth-like environment with no furnishings, the surrounding sea, and Asterion's declaration that he is the son of a queen (i.e., Pasipha\u00eb). As the story progresses, the reader is \"caught in the Cretan labyrinth along with the Minotaur and Theseus\". Literary critic Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda noted that Borges employed the technique of defamiliarization, first described by the Russian formalists, in adding an unexpected twist to a well-known myth. By first setting the reader up to empathize with the narrator, and ultimately revealing the narrator to be a monstrous creature, Borges adds \"a newly aesthetic, historicized twist\" to the Minotaur's mythology. By the end of the story, \"the reader feels sorry for the monster\"."

Yet Asterion is seemingly unaware of his monstrous nature, and the emotions that he describes\u2014loneliness, pride, hope\u2014are more human than monstrous, eliciting sympathy in readers rather than horror. The humanization of Asterion has the opposite effect on the reader's attitude toward Theseus; the mythological hero becomes the murderer of a pitiful creature who does not even resist him.

His longing for death, and freedom from his labyrinth, mirrors that of the immortal protagonist of another of Borges's short stories, \"The Immortal\", and is reflected in the painting by Watts that inspired \"The House of Asterion\". Asterion's suggestion that he is delivering his victims from evil indicates that he believes the world to be evil, and that, in killing the men, he is actually saving them. His apparent belief that life is evil, and death is liberation from that evil, foreshadows his eventual defenseless surrender to Theseus's sword. Asterion's allusion to the Lord's Prayer leads to his final thoughts, which regard his own anticipated savior and take on a distinctly biblical tone. His insistence that \"I know that my redeemer lives and he will finally rise above the dust\" parallels Job's exclamation in the Book of Job: \"For I know my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon earth\". Borges's deliberate quotation of Job indicates that Asterion considers his redeemer to be akin to a supreme God, who will take him to \"a place with fewer galleries and fewer doors\" (i.e., heaven)."

In a review for the literary magazine Sur, Argentine writer Estela Canto, who had recently ended her relationship with Borges, praised the story for its \"infinita riqueza\" (infinite richness) and use of symbolism. In an extensive 1960 analysis of the story, author and critic Enrique Anderson-Imbert wrote positively of Borges's complex metaphysical comparisons between Asterion's labyrinth and the universe, despite the story's brevity, but noted that he did not consider it to be among Borges's best works."

        "content": "The song, a country ballad, is titled from the character's name, which was originally \"Rocky Sassoon\", but McCartney changed it to \"Rocky Raccoon\" because he thought \"it sounded more like a cowboy\". Former 13th Floor Elevators drummer Danny Thomas claims the name \"Rocky\" was inspired by Roky Erickson, the American rock band's then vocalist and guitarist. According to Beatles historian Kenneth Womack, McCartney drew his inspiration for the song from Robert Service\u2019s poem \u201cThe Shooting of Dan McGrew.\u201d  The Old West-style honky-tonk piano was played by producer George Martin. \"Rocky Raccoon\" is also the last Beatles song to feature John Lennon's harmonica playing. The lyrics describe a conflict over a love triangle, in which Rocky's girlfriend Lil Magill (known to the public as Nancy) leaves him for a man named Dan, who punches Rocky in the eye. Rocky vows revenge and takes a room at the saloon in the town where Dan and Nancy are staying. He bursts into Dan's room, armed with a gun, but Dan out-draws and shoots him. A drunken doctor attends to Rocky, the latter insisting that the wound is only a minor one. Stumbling back to his room, Rocky finds a Gideon Bible and takes it as a sign from God. Starr's snare drum flam after the line \"He drew first and shot\" (mimicking the sound of a gun) is an example of prosody. During take 8 of the song (featured on Anthology 3), McCartney flubbed the line \"stinking of gin\", singing \"sminking\" instead (presumably confusing the words \"smelling\" and \"stinking\"). This caused him to laugh, exclaim \"Sminking?!\" and make up the remaining lines in the song. This take also has a noticeably different spoken-word introduction, with Rocky coming from \"a little town in Minnesota\", rather than the album version's \"somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota\", and McCartney's faux Western-American accent is more pronounced."

Although he had steadily produced work for over a decade (without commercial success), Sarrasine was among his earliest publications to appear without a pseudonym. During the period in which the novella was written, Balzac was involved in many salons, including that of Madame Recamier. Around the time in which Sarrasine was published, Balzac experienced great success with another work, La Peau de Chagrin (1831). As his career began to take off and his publications began to accumulate, Balzac developed increasingly lavish living habits and frequently made impulsive purchases (such as new furniture for his apartment and a hooded white cashmere gown designed to be worn by a monk, which he wore at night while writing), likely to distance himself from his family's prior debt, which had resulted from his business as an editor and printer's liquidation. In 1841, an ill Balzac reached an agreement with Furne & Co., Dubochet, Hetzel and Paulin to publish La Com\u00e9die humaine. In the 10 years that elapsed, Balzac had developed a political career, becoming heavily involved in high society, which influenced much of his writing. However, he continued to have financial difficulties despite his success, such as with La Cronique de Paris, a magazine he founded and abandoned, though he characteristically hid his worry in order to maintain appearances. The first volume of La Com\u00e9die humaine went on sale in July 1842. Sarrasine is part of its \"Scenes de la vie parisienne\"."

He overhears the conversations of passers-by regarding the origins of the wealth of the mansion's owner, Monsieur de Lanty. There is also the presence of an unknown old man around the house, to whom the family was oddly devoted, and who frightened and intrigued the partygoers. When the man sits next to the narrator's guest, Beatrix de Rochefide, she touches him, and the narrator rushes her out of the room. The narrator says he knows who the man is and says he will tell her his story the next evening. The next evening, the narrator tells Mme de Rochefide about Ernest-Jean Sarrasine, a passionate, artistic boy, who after having trouble in school became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the sculptor Bouchardon. After one of Sarrasine's sculptures wins a competition, he heads to Rome where he sees a theatre performance featuring Zambinella. He falls in love with her, going to all of her performances and creating a clay mold of her. After spending time together at a party, Sarrasine attempts to seduce Zambinella.  She is reticent, suggesting some hidden secret or danger of their partnership. Sarrasine becomes increasingly convinced that Zambinella is the ideal woman.  Sarrasine develops a plan to abduct her from a party at the French embassy. When Sarrasine arrives, Zambinella is dressed as a man. Sarrasine speaks to a cardinal, who is Zambinella's patron, and is told that Zambinella is a castrato. Sarrasine refuses to believe it and leaves the party, seizing Zambinella. Once they are at his studio, Zambinella confirms that she is a castrato. Sarrasine is about to kill him as a group of the cardinal's men barge in and stab Sarrasine. The narrator then reveals that the old man around the household is Zambinella, Marianina's maternal great uncle. The story ends with Mme de Rochefide's expressing her distress about the story she has just been told."

The story contemplates what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman, and the degree to which those stand in opposition.

Because women were not allowed on stage in most of the Papal States, castrati regularly played the parts of women.  The tradition of the castrati never extended to France, and when Sarrasine arrives in Italy and meets Zambinella, he does not know about it.  Because Zambinella has the voice of a woman Sarrasine assumes La Zambinella is a woman. La Zambinella suggests that her womanhood might be in question, but Sarrasine is too enthralled with Zambinella as the perfect woman to pay any attention. When Sarrasine finally learns Zambinella is a castrato, he first denies the possibility, then tries to kill Zambinella, upon which he is himself killed.  Critics point out that Sarrasine may fear a kind of contagion of castration, or may feel that manhood in general or the division between men and women is threatened by possibility of castration.  The novella ends with Mme de Rochefide and the narrator's condemning the castrato tradition as barbaric."

In Sarrasine, we meet Zambinella, a seemingly beautiful woman whom Sarrasine admires, but who turns out to be castrato. Sarrasine, who took Zambinella to be his ideal woman, is deeply distressed when he learns this and tries to kill Zambinella.  One possible explanation for Sarrasine's extreme reaction is that he fears that his love of La Zambinella is a mark of homosexuality.  Sarrasine's reaction, then, can be seen as an attempt to protect his heterosexuality. Zambinella does, in fact, have a partner: the cardinal. In Sarrasine, the cardinal is Zambinella's \"protector\", which means that Zambinella would be the complementary role of \"mignon\". Barthes refers to Zambinella as \"mignon\" as it is used in French court society, where it means the homosexual lover, or \"pet\", of a man in power, in this case the cardinal, the \"protector\"."

The body of the novella and the framed story that the narrator relates to Mme de Rochefide are about Ernest Jean Sarrasine and his unusual relationship with Zambinella. Balzac also employs nonlinear narration in Sarrasine: the framed story takes place many years earlier than it is related, and a few times the narrator jumps to the present and then returns to telling the framed story."

        "content": "Sarrasine gives us a closer look at the role of castrati in both common opera and in religious tradition. Catholicism in Italy dictated that there could be no female singers, and the high voice parts were usually played by either prepubescent boys or castrati. In order to become a castrato, a boy had to give up his \"manhood\", i.e., have his testes removed at a very early age. Because of the popularity of Italian opera throughout 18th-century Europe (except France), castrati such as Farinelli, Ferri, Pacchierotti, and Senesino became the first operatic superstars, earning enormous fees and hysterical public adulation.  However, many did not survive the surgery, or did not last very long after it. Castrati developed many health problems, as testosterone is needed for healthy growth in boys, and without the glands that supply the majority of testosterone during a critical period of development, the body does not grow correctly. Besides the only wanted side effect (the lack of lengthening the vocal cords), a castrato's arms and legs were often disproportionally long, they did not have much muscle mass, and other problems, such as osteoporosis and erectile dysfunction were common later in life. The story of Sarrasine is made much more believable by the fact that, due to their severe hormonal imbalance, castrati often developed real breast tissue, a condition called gynecomastia."

Among the most famous authors from this time period is Victor Hugo, who was known for works such as Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862), The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (1831), and The Toilers of the Sea. Hugo was also known for influencing Romanticism, a movement that spread to France in the 1820s and emphasized a sense of individuality and emotion. In his novel Les Mis\u00e9rables, Hugo represents Romanticism and individuality with the character of Marius Pontmercy, who by attempting to court the character Cosette by sending her letters that reveal his love for her, adheres to Romantic movement ideas and beliefs. Equally important is Gustave Flaubert, known for his use of realism influenced by Honor\u00e9 de Balzac. Realism appears perhaps most famously in Flaubert's first (and perhaps most famous) novel Madame Bovary (1856). This novel represents the \"real\" experiences and feelings of a French woman who is obsessed with, and eventually dispossessed of, her romantic ideal of love. In Salammb\u00f4 (1862), Flaubert abandons realism for historical fiction with an account of the Mercenary Revolt in Tunisia during the 3rd century BCE. Flaubert then returns to realism in L'\u00c9ducation Sentimentale (Sentimental Education, 1869) with a detailed account of lives during the revolution of 1848 in France. Other influential authors from this period, include Marie-Henri Beyle (better known by the pseudonym Stendhal) and Charles Baudelaire."

        "content": "Realism is an artistic movement originated in France in the 19th century by people who rejected both Idealism and Romanticism. The use of Romanticism in literature began to rise dramatically in the 18th century and was the predominant artistic movement in France until Realism. Realism was widely appreciated by people who opposed the inflated ideas of passion and drama that mark Romanticism. Those in the Realist movement wanted instead to portray the truth in every situation, avoiding exaggerating a scenario to emphasize only its good or bad qualities.  Realism also strove to represent life as it was experienced in its more mundane details by imperfect men and women rather than idealized characters in idealized situations.  Realism tends to describe middle or lower class milieux in order to paint a picture of the regular life of a majority of the population at the time the literature was written. From the people to the places, Realism strove to present everything in an undramatic and \"true\" manner. In Sarrasine, Realism is reflected in the ways that every situation is described in its positive and negative aspects. For example, as a member of the castrati Zambinella can be praised, adored, or treated as if he doesn't belong. The novella doesn't romanticize the relationship between Zambinella and Sarrasine, either. The author depicts real and imperfect emotions between the two characters, from love to vengeance. Though Realism in literature was usually used for portraying the activities of middle and lower-class people, it was sometimes used in situations like this, and indeed often focused on characters and situations that might otherwise be socially marginalized."

The most important allusions are to the figures of beauty in Greek culture: Adonis, Endymion and Pygmalion. The intertextuality between Sarrasine and the myth of Pygmalion is a vital one, as it establishes the tragedy of misconception: Sarrasine creates a statue of the \"female\" La Zambinella, only to discover later that his subject wasn't a real \"woman\" as Sarrasine\u2014that \"a real woman is born from the statue\". Furthermore, the replication of the statue into marble, and into two separate portraits (Adonis, and Girodet's Endymion) only perpetuates the symbolic notion that Sarrasine is always influenced by an intrinsic gender ambiguity."

        "content": "\"O Captain! My Captain!\" is an extended metaphor poem written by Walt Whitman in 1865 about the death of U.S. president Abraham Lincoln. Well received upon publication, the poem was Whitman's first to be anthologized and the most popular during his lifetime. Together with \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\", \"Hush'd Be the Camps To-day\", and \"This Dust was Once the Man\", it is one of four poems written by Whitman about the death of Lincoln. During the American Civil War, Whitman moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the government and volunteered at hospitals. Although he never met Lincoln, Whitman felt a connection to him and was greatly moved by Lincoln's assassination. \"My Captain\" was first published in The Saturday Press on November 4, 1865, and appeared in Sequel to Drum-Taps later that year. He later included it in the collection Leaves of Grass and recited the poem at several lectures on Lincoln's death. Stylistically, the poem is uncharacteristic of Whitman's poetry because of its rhyming, song-like flow, and simple \"ship of state\" metaphor. These elements likely contributed to the poem's initial positive reception and popularity, with many celebrating it as one of the greatest American works of poetry. Critical opinion has shifted since the mid-20th century, with some scholars deriding it as conventional and unoriginal. The poem has made several appearances in popular culture; as it never mentions Lincoln, it has been invoked upon the death of several other heads of state. It is famously featured in Dead Poets Society (1989) and is frequently associated with the star of that film, Robin Williams."

        "content": "Walt Whitman established his reputation as a poet in the late 1850s to early 1860s with the 1855 release of Leaves of Grass. Whitman intended to write a distinctly American epic and developed a free verse style inspired by the cadences of the King James Bible. The brief volume, first released in 1855, was considered controversial by some, with critics particularly objecting to Whitman's blunt depictions of sexuality and the poem's \"homoerotic overtones\". Whitman's work received significant attention following praise for Leaves of Grass by American transcendentalist lecturer and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson. At the start of the American Civil War, Whitman moved from New York to Washington, D.C., where he held a series of government jobs\u2014first with the Army Paymaster's Office and later with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He volunteered in the army hospitals as a nurse. Whitman's poetry was informed by his wartime experience, maturing into reflections on death and youth, the brutality of war, and patriotism. Whitman's brother, Union Army soldier George Washington Whitman, was taken prisoner in Virginia in September 1864, and held for five months in Libby Prison, a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp near Richmond. On February 24, 1865, George was granted a furlough to return home because of his poor health, and Whitman travelled to his mother's home in New York to visit his brother. While visiting Brooklyn, Whitman contracted to have his collection of Civil War poems, Drum-Taps, published. In June 1865, James Harlan, the Secretary of the Interior, found a copy of Leaves of Grass and, considering the collection vulgar, fired Whitman from the Bureau of Indian Affairs."

        "content": "Although they never met, Whitman saw Abraham Lincoln several times between 1861 and 1865, sometimes at close quarters. The first time was when Lincoln stopped in New York City in 1861 on his way to Washington. Whitman noticed the President-elect's \"striking appearance\" and \"unpretentious dignity,\" and trusted Lincoln's \"supernatural tact\" and \"idiomatic Western genius.\" He admired the President, writing in October 1863, \"I love the President personally.\" Whitman considered himself and Lincoln to be \"afloat in the same stream\" and \"rooted in the same ground.\" Whitman and Lincoln shared similar views on slavery and the Union, and similarities have been noted in their literary styles and inspirations. Whitman later declared that \"Lincoln gets almost nearer me than anybody else.\" There is an account of Lincoln's reading Whitman's Leaves of Grass poetry collection in his office, and another of the President's saying \"Well, he looks like a man,\" upon seeing Whitman in Washington, D.C. \"The truth of both these stories is hard to establish.\" Lincoln's death on April 15, 1865, greatly moved Whitman, who wrote several poems in tribute to the fallen President. \"O Captain! My Captain!\", \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\", \"Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day\", and \"This Dust Was Once the Man\" were all written on Lincoln's death. While these poems do not specifically mention Lincoln, they turn the assassination of the President into a sort of martyrdom."

        "content": "Literary critic Helen Vendler thinks it likely that Whitman wrote the poem before \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\", considering it a direct response to \"Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day\". An early draft of the poem is written in free verse. \"My Captain\" was first published in The Saturday Press on November 4, 1865. Around the same time, it was included in Whitman's book, Sequel to Drum-Tapspublication in The Saturday Press was considered a \"teaser\" for the book. Although Sequel to Drum-Taps was first published in early October 1865, the copies were not ready for distribution until December. The first publication of the poem had different punctuation than Whitman intended, and he corrected before its next publication. It was also included in the 1867 edition of Leaves of Grass. Whitman revised the poem several times during his life, including in his 1871 collection Passage to India. Its final republication by Whitman was in the 1881 edition of Leaves of Grass. Whitman's friend Horace Traubel wrote in his book With Walt Whitman in Camden that Whitman read a newspaper article that said \"If Walt Whitman had written a volume of My Captains instead of filling a scrapbasket with waste and calling it a book the world would be better off today and Walt Whitman would have some excuse for living.\" Whitman responded to the article on September 11, 1888, saying: \"Damn My Captain[...] I'm almost sorry I ever wrote the poem,\" though he admitted that it \"had certain emotional immediate reasons for being\". In the 1870s and 1880s, Whitman gave several lectures over eleven years on Lincoln's death. He usually began or ended the lectures by reciting \"My Captain\", despite his growing prominence meaning he could have read a different poem. In the late 1880s, Whitman earned money by selling autographed copies of \"My Captain\"\u2014purchasers included John Hay, Charles Aldrich, and S. Weir Mitchell."

        "content": "The poem rhymes using an AABBCDED rhyme scheme, and is designed for recitation. It is written in nine quatrains, organized in three stanzas. Each stanza has two quatrains of four seven-beat lines, followed by a four-line refrain, which changes slightly from stanza to stanza, in a tetrameter/trimeter ballad beat. Historian Daniel Mark Epstein wrote in 2004 that he considers the structure of the poem to be \"uncharacteristically mechanical, formulaic\". He goes on to describe the poem as a conventional ballad, comparable to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's writing in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and much of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's work, especially \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" Literary critic Jerome Loving wrote to the opposite effect in 1999, saying that the structure gave \"My Captain\" a \"sing-song\" quality, evocative of folk groups like the Hutchinson Family Singers and Cheney Family Singers. The scholar Ted Genoways argued that the poem retains distinctive features characteristic to Whitman, such as varying line length. Whitman very rarely wrote poems that rhymed; in a review contemporary to Whitman, The Atlantic suggested that Whitman was rising \"above himself\" by writing a poem unlike his others. The writer elaborated that, while his previous work had represented \"unchecked nature\", the rhymes of \"My Captain\" were a sincere expression of emotion. The author Frances Winwar argued in her 1941 book American Giant: Walt Whitman and His Times that \"in the simple ballad rhythm beat the heart of the folk\". Vendler concludes that Whitman's use of a simple style is him saying that \"soldiers and sailors have a right to verse written for them\". Using elements of popular poetry enabled Whitman to create a poem that he felt would be understood by the general public. In 2009, academic Amanda Gailey argued that Whitman\u2014who, writing the poem, had just been fired from his government job\u2014adopted a conventional style to attract a wider audience. She added that Whitman wrote to heal the nation, crafting a poem the country would find \"ideologically and aesthetically satisfactory\". William Pannapacker, a literature professor, similarly described the poem in 2004 as a \"calculated critical and commercial success\". In 2003, the author Daniel Aaron wrote that \"Death enshrined the Commoner [Lincoln], [and] Whitman placed himself and his work in the reflected limelight\". As an elegy to Lincoln, the English professor Faith Barrett wrote in 2005 that the style makes it \"timeless\", following in the tradition of elegies like \"Lycidas\" and \"Adonais\"."

        "title": "O Captain! My Captain!_Reception",
        "content": "The poem was Whitman's most popular during his lifetime, and the only one to be anthologized before his death. The historian Michael C. Cohen noted that \"My Captain\" was \"carried beyond the limited circulation of Leaves of Grass and into the popular heart\"; its popularity remade \"history in the form of a ballad\". Initial reception to the poem was very positive. In early 1866, a reviewer in the Boston Commonwealth wrote that the poem was the most moving dirge for Lincoln ever written, adding that Drum Taps \"will do much[...] to remove the prejudice against Mr. Whitman in many minds\". Similarly, after reading Sequel to Drum Taps, the author William Dean Howells became convinced that Whitman had cleaned the \"old channels of their filth\" and poured \"a stream of blameless purity\" through; he would become a prominent defender of Whitman. One of the earliest criticisms of the poem was authored by Edward P. Mitchell in 1881 who considered the rhymes \"crude\". \"My Captain\" is considered uncharacteristic of Whitman's poetry, and it was praised initially as a departure from his typical style. Author Julian Hawthorne wrote in 1891 that the poem was touching partially because it was such a stylistic departure. In 1892, The Atlantic wrote that \"My Captain\" was universally accepted as Whitman's \"one great contribution to the world's literature\", and George Rice Carpenter, a scholar and biographer of Whitman, said in 1903 that the poem was possibly the best work of Civil War poetry, praising its imagery as \"beautiful\". Reception remained positive into the early 20th century. Epstein considers it to have been one of the ten most popular English language poems of the 20th century. In his book Canons by Consensus, Joseph Csicsila reached a similar conclusion, noting that the poem was \"one of the two or three most highly praised of Whitman's poems during the 1920s and 1930s\"; he also wrote that the poem's verse form and emotional sincerity appealed to \"more conservative-minded critics\". In 1916, Henry B. Rankin, a biographer of Lincoln, wrote that \"My Captain\" became \"the nation'saye, the world'sfuneral dirge of our First American\". The Literary Digest in 1919 deemed it the \"most likely to live forever\" of Whitman's poems, and the 1936 book American Life in Literature went further, describing it as the best American poem. Author James O'Donnell Bennett echoed that, writing that the poem represented a perfect \"threnody\", or mourning poem. The poem was not unanimously praised during this period: one critic wrote that \"My Captain\" was \"more suitable for recitation before an enthusiastically uncritical audience than for its place in the Oxford Book of English Verse\". Beginning in the 1920s, Whitman became increasingly respected by critics, and by 1950 he was one of the most prominent American authors. Poetry anthologies began to include poetry that was considered more \"authentic\" to Whitman's poetic style, and, as a result, \"My Captain\" became less popular. In an analysis of poetry anthologies, Joseph Csicsila found that, although \"My Captain\" had been Whitman's most frequently published poem, shortly after the end of World War II it \"all but disappeared\" from American anthologies, and had \"virtually disappeared\" after 1966. William E. Barton wrote in Abraham Lincoln and Walt Whitman, published in 1965, that the poem was \"the least like Whitman of anything Whitman ever wrote; yet it is his highest literary monument\". Critical opinion of the poem began to shift in the middle of the 20th century. In 1980, Whitman's biographer Justin Kaplan called the poem \"thoroughly conventional\". The literary critic F. O. Matthiessen criticized the poem, writing in 1941 that its early popularity was an \"ample and ironic comment\" on how Whitman's more authentic poetry could not reach a wide audience. Michael C. Cohen, a literature professor, said Matthiessen's writing exemplified 20th-century opinion on the poem. In the 1997 book A Reader's Guide to Walt Whitman, scholar Gay Wilson Allen concluded that the poem's symbols were \"trite\", the rhythm \"artificial\", and the rhymes \"erratic\". Negative perspectives on the poem continued into the 21st century. In 2000, Helen Vendler wrote that because Whitman \"was bent on registering individual response as well as the collective wish expressed in 'Hush'd be the camps', he took on the voice of a single representative sailor silencing his own idiosyncratic voice\". Elsewhere, she states that two \"stylistic features\u2014its meter and its use of refrain\u2014mark 'O Captain' as a designedly democratic and populist poem\". Four years later, Epstein wrote that he struggled to believe that the same writer wrote both \"Lilacs\" and \"O Captain! My Captain!\". Poet Robert Pinsky told the New York Times News Service in 2009 that he considered the poem \"not very good\", and a year later another poet, C. K. Williams, concluded that the poem was a \"truly awful piece of near doggerel triteness\" that deserved derisive criticism. Meanwhile, the 2004 Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature entry on Whitman suggests that critiques about the poem's rhythm are unfair."

Vendler writes that the poem utilizes elements of war journalism, such as \"the bleeding drops of red\" and \"fallen cold and dead\". The poem has imagery relating to the sea throughout. Genoways considers the best \"turn of phrase\" in the poem to be line 12, where Whitman describes a \"swaying mass\", evocative of both a funeral and religious service. The poem's nautical references allude to Admiral Nelson's death at the Battle of Trafalgar."

        "title": "O Captain! My Captain!_\"Ship of state\" metaphor",
        "content": "The poem describes the United States as a ship, a metaphor that Whitman had previously used in \"Death in the School-Room\". This metaphor of a ship of state has been often used by authors. Whitman himself had written a letter on March 19, 1863, that compared the head of state to a ship's captain. Whitman had also likely read newspaper reports that Lincoln had dreamed of a ship under full sail the night before his assassination; the imagery was allegedly a recurring dream of Lincoln's before significant moments in his life. \"My Captain\" begins by describing Lincoln as the captain of the nation. By the end of the first stanza, Lincoln has become America's \"dear father\" as his death is revealed (\"fallen cold and dead\"). Vendler writes that the poem is told from the point of view of a young Union recruit, a \"sailor-boy\" who considers Lincoln like a \"dear father\". The American Civil War is almost over and \"the prize we sought is almost won;/the port is almost near\" with crowds awaiting the ship's arrival. Then, Lincoln is shot and dies. Vendler notes that in the first two stanzas the narrator is speaking to the dead captain, addressing him as \"you\". In the third stanza, he switches to reference Lincoln in the third person (\"My captain does not answer\"). Winwar describes the \"roused voice of the people, incredulous at first, then tragically convinced that their Captain lay fallen\". Even as the poem mourns Lincoln, there is a sense of triumph that the ship of state has completed its journey. Whitman encapsulates grief over Lincoln's death in one individual, the narrator of the poem. Cohen argues that the metaphor serves to \"mask the violence of the Civil War\" and project \"that concealment onto the exulting crowds\". He concluded that the poem \"abstracted the war into social affect and collective sentiment, converting public violence into a memory of shared loss by remaking history in the shape of a ballad\"."

The poem's speaker places its \"arm beneath [Lincoln's] head\" in the same way that \"Mary cradled Jesus\" after his crucifixion. With Lincoln's death, \"the sins of America are absolved into a religio-sentimental, national family\"."

        "content": "The poem, which never mentions Lincoln by name, has frequently been invoked following the deaths of a head of state. After Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945, actor Charles Laughton read \"O Captain! My Captain!\" during a memorial radio broadcast. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, \"O Captain! My Captain!\" was played on many radio stations, extending the 'ship of state' metaphor to Kennedy. Following the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the poem was translated into Hebrew and put to music by Naomi Shemer. The poem appears in the 1989 American film Dead Poets Society. John Keating (played by Robin Williams), an English teacher at the Welton Academy boarding school, introduces his students to the poem in their first class. Keating is later fired from the school. As Keating returns to collect his belongings, the students stand on their desks and address Keating as \"O Captain! My Captain!\" The use of \"My Captain\" in the film was considered \"ironic\" by Cohen because the students are taking a stand against \"repressive conformity\" but using a poem intentionally written to be conventional. After Robin Williams' suicide in 2014, the hashtag \"#ocaptainmycaptain\" began trending on Twitter and fans paid tribute to Williams by recreating the \"O Captain! My Captain!\" scene. Luke Buckmaster, a film critic, wrote in The Guardian that \"some people, maybe even most people, now associate Whitman's verse first and foremost with a movie rather than a poem\". The poem was set to music by Kurt Weill as one of \"Four Walt Whitman Songs\" he composed in the 1940s. The first two verses of the poem are used as part of the libertarian group \"The Friends\"' oath and the call to rebellion and protest in the 1993 mini-series Wild Palms."

        "content": "Federalist Paper 16 addresses the failures of the Articles of Confederation in order to adequately govern the United states and argues for a federal government.  Contrary to the Articles of Confederation, that stated, \"each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled,\" Hamilton believed that there should be one general government that should govern both the states and the people.  However, people feared a strong national government would gain too much power, and in turn, become a tyrannical power like that of the British Monarchy.  Hamilton argued that a federal government would be able to do things that the states could not, and that without a national government, the Confederacy would inevitably fall victim to war or a separation in the states. By addressing the failures of the Articles of Confederation, Hamilton promoted the ratification of the new Constitution (which later replaced the Articles of Confederation).  He illustrates that the new constitution will be the most beneficial for the majority of people.  He does this by explaining that the purpose of the government is to create laws and decisions that protect the safety and tranquility of the people and the Union.  With the new constitution and a strong federal government, Hamilton states that the confederacy will be able to achieve the best possible outcome."

Without a large, standing, national army, he feared there would be a war between the states, and argued that the strongest state would triumph in every disagreement between the states. In Federalist 16, Hamilton argued that unifying the separate states with one strong general government and army would solve these issues by setting up a federal form of government that would clearly enumerate the powers of the national government, reserve other powers to the states, check and balance the national government's power by dividing it into three branches, and provide representative government that was accountable to the people. In Federalist 16, Hamilton argued that only the federal government could provide laws that would affect the entire nation's citizenry uniformly, and that any state encroachments on federal powers would be obvious, writing, \"if the execution of the laws of the national government should not require the intervention of the State legislatures, if they were to pass into immediate operation upon the citizens themselves, the particular governments could not interrupt their progress without an open and violent exertion of an unconstitutional power. No omissions nor evasions would answer the end. They would be obliged to act, and in such a manner as would leave no doubt that they had encroached on the national rights.\""

        "content": "Before the constitution was ratified the country was vulnerable. There was a fear of a civil war, which would increase vulnerability. At that time the states were disconnected, which made it harder to establish government and a stable union. If there was no union, the ratification of the constitution would have been hard to make happen. In Federalist 16, it is also stressed that the states need some control in order for the constitution to be accepted. If they are not exposed to the thought of a new constitution that will benefit everyone, there is a possibility that one state will become excessively powerful and try to rule the country in their own way. Hamilton explains \"If the State was large it would have influence with others who would join the resistance.  If smaller, alliances would form prior to insurrection.  Eventually if Federal laws only compelled States to compliance and the only remedy to non-compliance was force, then \"the first war of this kind would probably terminate in a dissolution of the Union\".  A more natural death than this violent death would be what is being experienced with the Articles of Confederacy where States in total join in non-compliance giving various excuses of inability to comply thus precluding military action\". As said in Federalist 16, the new constitution will provide for the growing states as a whole. There was a hope for an army that can provide safety for all who are citizens of America and a need for strong individuals, both physically and mentally, who could provide the protection. Federalist 16 explains the states need a new national constitution to be put in motion but putting together a large and cohesive army that will stand behind our newfound country and new founding government. The constitution is supposed to bring great stability in government and give the country a unified rule so that there wouldn't be multiple small sections that would try to rule their own way, with many misunderstanding and no concise rule."

It was published in The Independent Journal on December 26, 1787, under the pseudonym Publius, the name under which all The Federalist Papers were published. This is the last of the three essays discussing the threat to the common good stemming from excessive restraint on legislative authority. It is titled \u201cThe Same Subject Continued: The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the Common Defense Considered.\u201d Hamilton began the essay with an emphasis on the necessity for a national government to use force in proportion to the extent of the mischief. He argued that rebellion is always a possibility with any government. In a Union, if the rebellion is small, the state government may deal with it, but if insurrection involves an entire state then the national government must respond. The author also favored the use of military force to quell seditions and insurrections within the states. The essay supported the theory posited in Federalist Number 10, stating that \"the obstacles to usurpation\" increase with the increased extent of the state. It held that a state government betrays the people and usurps power, the local governments will not have the power or capability to respond to it. However, the more the people understand their rights and want to defend those rights, the harder it will be for state governments to usurp power and betray the people. If state governments usurp too much power, the federal government will be more likely to step in to curb the abuse, because the federal government wants to protect its own power."

Their names have never been mentioned; one has sparse black hair, the other has a bulbous nose and large phiz of fair (possibly blond) hair. They are drawn as - and have the personalities of - a pair of classic clown archetypes, an odd couple: the curly haired but balding one being short and aggressive, the taller being doleful. In one episode, they were drawn as wearing suits that were for the curly-haired one much too small, and for the taller one much too big - another classic clown type. According to Roberta Smith, the characters are \"two middle-aged Bumstead-like alcoholics haplessly lurching from one disaster and one drink to the next as they attempt to run a bakery.\" Both bakers suffer from severe alcoholism, and every strip shows them drinking strong alcoholic beverages such as various liqueurs. Their idea of a Wednesday half-closing is to sit on a public seat in front of a local off-licence, enjoying the 'view'. The black-haired one has an estranged daughter as his wife left him on Christmas Eve.  Occasionally the curly haired one will remind him of this, usually due to the black haired one offending the curly haired one. They try their best to bake something every night, but because of their inebriation, the results are always hopeless. As critic Steve Lowe says, Their shop is run down, and has few customers; the pair sometimes look back to more prosperous, happier times, but are always brought back to their dismal present-day reality. If they even manage to bake something, it is often inedible, sometimes even toxic. For instance in one episode they baked cakes made with paraffin instead of milk - \"This milk is blue and it tastes funny\". The only exception to this is the 25th anniversary of the opening of the bakery, when the black-haired one decides to bake twin cakes in the form of the number 25. He succeeds, producing the number 25 in cake form, while his partner drinks mulled wine made in the kettle, which has held something nasty. In the final frame the inevitable happens - the fellow vomits up his stomach contents all over the anniversary cakes, and so their only success is utterly ruined. Customers sometimes arrive at the baker's shop, asking for various breads or pastries, at Christmas, a whole lot of Christmas cakes, and once even a five-tiered wedding cake. The bakers promise they'll bake it for them, but always fail to fulfil their promise. Recent strips have featured one of the protagonists being hospitalised with renal failure while the other drinks rum at his bedside. Their shop, which is almost perpetually empty of produce, especially the front window, has been vandalised many times, and has burnt down several times, generally due to them leaving the oven on and falling into a drunken stupor. The strip is fatalistic; the bakers will never reform, their customers will never get proper service, and nobody is doing a thing about it. Nevertheless, they carry on. As art critic Emily Mears remarks, \"somehow, with the remarkable fortitude of true career drunks and in a rather sweet depiction of brotherly love, they prop each other up and return, strip after strip, to bake again.\" Some storylines fail to resolve themselves and end indeterminately, reinforcing the character's cyclical and depressing existence. In one strip, one of the bakers is bitten by a stray dog he has befriended, but he doesn't notice. \"Your mouth is pissing blood\" remarks the other baker. Whereas most of the comics in Viz have traditional hand-lettered captions and dialogue, the Drunken Bakers strip instalments (and other, less regular strips by Farmer and Healey) have typeset speech balloons. This gives Farmer and Healey's work a significantly different appearance from other Viz material."

Leckey created a film using frames from the original strips to construct a narrative and added a soundtrack spoken by himself and his colleague Steve Claydon in Liverpudlian accents. According to Emily Mears, In Roberta Smith's words, Leckey constructs \"dreamy, druggy, disjointed variants on music videos...He has ingeniously filmed the comic strip with close-ups and jump-cuts, creating a kind of stop-action animation, and added a skillfully explicit soundtrack replete with convincing belches, slurps, breaking glass and vomiting.\" Smith says that Leckey's artwork is less an original work than an \"adaptation or an homage\" of the original cartoon. Lecky also created models of the bakers, exhibited as Drunken Bakers Dozen in 2007."

        "content": "A widowed queen sends her daughter to a faraway land to marry.  Accompanying the princess are her magical horse Falada, who can speak, and a waiting maid. The queen gives the princess a special charm that will protect her as long as she wears it. The princess and her servant travel for a time, and eventually the princess grows thirsty. She asks the maid to go and fetch her some water, but the maid simply says: \"If you want water, get it for yourself. I do not want to be your servant any longer.\" So the princess has to fetch herself water from the nearby stream. She wails softly: \"What will become of me?\" The charm answers: \"Alas, alas, if your mother knew, her loving heart would break in two.\" After a while, the princess gets thirsty again. So she asks her maid once more to get her some water. But again the evil servant says, \"I will not serve you any longer, no matter what you or your mother say.\" The servant leaves the poor princess to drink from the river by her dainty little hands. When she bends to the water her charm falls out of her bosom and floats away. The maid takes advantage of the princess's vulnerability. She orders the princess to change clothes with her and the horses as well. She threatens to kill the princess if she doesn't swear never to say a word about this reversal of roles to any living being. Sadly, the princess takes the oath. The maid servant then rides off on Falada, while the princess has to mount the maid's nag. At the palace, the maid poses as princess and the \"princess servant\" is ordered to guard the geese with a little boy called Conrad. The false bride orders Falada to be killed, as she fears he might talk. The real princess hears of this and begs the slaughterer to nail Falada's head above the doorway where she passes with her geese every morning. The next morning the goose girl addresses Falada's head over the doorway: \"Falada, Falada, thou art dead, and all the joy in my life has fled\", and Falada answers \" Alas, Alas, if your mother knew, her loving heart would break in two.\" On the goose meadow, Conrad watches the princess comb her beautiful hair and he becomes greedy to pluck one or two of her golden locks. But the goose girl sees this and says a charm: \"Blow wind, blow, I say, take Conrad's hat away. Do not let him come back today until my hair is combed today.\" And so the wind takes his hat away, and he cannot return before the goose girl has finished brushing and plaiting her hair. Conrad angrily goes to the king and declares he will not herd geese with this girl any longer because of the strange things that happen. The king tells him to do it one more time, and the next morning hides and watches. He finds everything as Conrad has told. That evening, he asks the princess to tell him her story. But she refuses to say anything because of her oath. The king suggests that she might tell everything to the iron stove. She agrees, climbs into the stove and tells her story while the king listens from outside. As the king is convinced she has told the truth, he has the goose girl clad in royal clothes. He then tricks the false princess into \"choosing her own punishment\". While each choice is different in each version of the story, in the classic version, she tells the king that a false servant should be dragged through town naked in a barrel with internal spikes. As a result, she is punished that way until she dies. After that, the prince and the true princess are married and reign over their kingdom for many years."

        "content": "Despite the story being viewed as obscure, there have been many film versions, from countries ranging from Germany to even America. Falada is often restored to life in film versions, or even spared entirely. While the Queen is implied to have died in the original story, many versions also have her survive to expose the false bride at the wedding. The false bride's motive for suggesting such a cruel punishment varies by retelling; in some, she is simply too ignorant to recognize herself, others have her play along to keep the charade, and others imply she has believed the king is talking about the true bride. Such film versions include: Harold MacGrath adapted the story into a novel, which was then developed into a 1915 American silent film starring Marguerite Clark. In this version, the princess is stolen at birth and raised as a goose-girl, by a courtier who places his own daughter in her stead. The king she was engaged to at birth falls in love with her without knowing who she is. The courtier's daughter, Hildegarde, is ignorant of the truth and portrayed sympathetically in the original novel, but the film version restores her role as a villainess, where she is raised by her father and is only presented as the princess when she has come of age. The film is believed to be lost. The plot was reworked into 2002's The Princess and the Pea, combining it with another fairy tale. The fairy tale was shown in the 1960s television show Jackanory during Season 1, Episode 38 and was read by Dilys Hamlett. In 1985, Tom Davenport adapted the story into a short film as one of his \"From the Brothers Grimm\" series. While visibly set in the American Appalachia, the narration refers to the characters as princesses, princes, and kings, implying that the story retained its European setting. This version is more faithful to Grimm, as Falada is not restored and the false bride is put to death. Titled \"The Goose Maiden\" in this version, the tale was loosely adapted into a 1999 German short animated episode with slight differences from the source material. This episode was a part of the series SimsalaGrimm. While Falada is still beheaded, this version has him restored to life. There is no prince, but the king himself is the betrothed. Another change is that the princess has been bewitched into forgetting who she is, rather than being forced into posing as the goose-girl."

Bloodleaf, the first of a young adult fantasy trilogy by Crystal Smith, is a gothic retelling of \"The Goose Girl.\" It was published by HMHTeen in 2019. \"The Goose Girl\" was one of the many folktales used in  Emma Donoghue's novel Kissing The Witch. The tale was titled \"The Tale of The Handkerchief\". Author Alethea Kontis adapted this tale together with The Wild Swans in the form of a novel titled Dearest. Adrienne Rich's 1974 poem \"The Fact of a Doorframe\" references the Goose Girl. The tale was retold into a short children's book by Eric A. Kimmel. In the sh\u014djo manga Ludwig Revolution (\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9\u30f4\u30a3\u30c3\u30d2\u9769\u547d R\u016bdovihhi Kakumei) the story tells about Prince Ludwig who is ordered by his father to find himself a wife more suitable than the women he often brings into the castle. Along with his servant Wilhelm, they travel across the land in search of fair maidens from classic stories in hopes of finding Ludwig a wife. It includes the tale of \"The Goose Girl\" among other tales from the Brothers Grimm. \"Falada: the Goose Girl's Horse\" is a short story adaption by author Nancy Farmer. This version tells the classic tale from Falada's point of view. The Canadian poet Jay Macpherson references the story of the Goose Girl in her poems \"Poor Child\" and \"What Falada Said,\" both reprinted in Poems Twice Told: The Boatman and Welcoming Disaster. The Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrison references the story in Doom Patrol issue 31, \"The Word Made Flesh,\" when Baphomet takes the form of Falada's head. Intisar Khanani, author of the Sunbolt Chronicles, wrote a fantasy retelling of the Goose Girl, titled \"Thorn\". The novel was independently published in 2012 and re-published by HarperCollins in 2020. \"Feathers of Snow: A Goose Girl Retelling\" by Alice Ivinya is a book based on the fairy tale. Though Eudora Welty's novella The Robber Bridegroom is named after and largely follows the plot of a different Brothers Grimm fairy tale, much of the action derives from \"The Goose Girl.\" \"Little Thieves\" by Margeret Owen is a YA fantasy novel retelling the story of the Goose Girl from the perspective of the princess' maid.

He is concerned that his career has stalled, and in desperation consults a numerologist for advice on restarting it.  The numerologist advises him to change the first letter of his name to \"S\":  Sebatinsky. A complicated series of events ensue in which Sebatinsky is investigated by the Security establishment, who feel that he must be trying to hide something. His Polish origins lead them to suspect that he is trying to distract attention from relatives in the Eastern Bloc. They discover that he does have a distant cousin who is also a physicist, which leads to the discovery that the Soviet Union is working on gamma ray-deflecting shielding as a nuclear defense. The Americans immediately start to develop their own counter-defense. They still have no real reason to suspect Sebatinsky, but just in case they look for a discreet way to get him out of the classified project in which he is engaged. Much to his surprise (and delight), Sebatinsky is appointed to a senior professorial post, which is exactly what he hoped for when he went to the numerologist. At the end of the story, it is revealed that the numerologist is actually an extraterrestrial and that he was involved in a bet as to whether he could avert a nuclear war on Earth with a minor stimulus (see butterfly effect). Though it is not explicitly specified, it is clear that the extraterrestrial in question is a brilliant school-boy (or the equivalent among creatures of pure energy who live in space) who made a bet with another pupil.  The story concludes with the same two beings making another bet to put everything back the way it was with another minuscule alteration, with the inevitable consequence that the world will end in nuclear holocaust. Asimov comments that the last section of the story was put in as an afterthought. Despite the original happy ending, Asimov was not satisfied, because the numerologist had not been accounted for. So he put in the last part to explain the numerologist, giving the story a sad ending after all."

The Hurrians adopted the policy of helping to rebuild the remains of these planetary societies after their nuclear wars, while genetically modifying the inhabitants into more peaceful races. They are not acting completely selflessly, either: as is discovered in the subsequent conversation with a captured human, each race \"helped\" in this fashion pays the Hurrians a \"modest\" contribution, choosing the product that this race is best at. In one case, an otherwise poor race pays in its own members, by forfeiting a set number of individuals into servitude each year. The Hurrians learned of Earth at the beginning of the Cold War but were surprised that an atomic war did not immediately develop. They establish a base on the Moon to wait for Earth's civilization to destroy itself.  However, despite their calculations, after fifteen years the war has not come. The Hurrians cannot simply leave either: their calculations indicate that if the people of Earth do not destroy their civilization, they will soon develop space travel and, presumably because of their violence, quickly set chaos among the Hurrians' civilization. In desperation, the Hurrians kidnap a human to try to discover why the nuclear war has not happened. The human taunts the Hurrians by calling them vultures, since the Hurrians never try to prevent the nuclear wars, but wait for them to occur and then assist the survivors. After conversing with the human and analyzing his conversation, the Hurrians reach an astounding conclusion. As the inspector, who came to supervise such an unusual case, tells to the resident director of the base, the war will not start by itself; it needs to be \"helped\". Refusing to understand the meaning of the word, the director fearfully asks for clarification, and is told that the Hurrians need to drop an atomic bomb themselves, in order to initiate the conflict which will then escalate on its own. Such a method, while computed to be the only way to start the war, and thus prevent the destruction of advanced space civilizations, is nevertheless completely unacceptable to the Hurrians, a race of absolute pacifists who cannot envision killing a sentient being. Even though such an act is needed, explains the director, it simply cannot be done, for no Hurrian will be able to drop the bomb himself, or even order someone else to do so. Unable to solve this dilemma, the Hurrians are forced to return home, plagued by the visions of humans conquering space."

Created by Mark Millar, it is set in the Judge Dredd universe, fifty years after the events detailed in the current Judge Dredd comics. The series debuted in Judge Dredd Megazine #1.08, in 1991. The stories focus on a Sov-Block (formerly East-Meg Two, formerly somewhere in Russia) Judge named Razors.  Judge Razors is the prototype for a new breed of Judge, a brainwashed ex-gang member, conditioned to follow the orders of his superiors without question.  His partner is a genetically enhanced horse named Comrade Ed."

The storyline can be thought of as a satirical comment on Russia's current integration of western elements with its own culture.  Subsequent entries were much more action-oriented, with little or no satire.  Cameos in the series have included Judge Dredd. In his last appearance, Razors threw off his brainwashing and went on a killing spree, which ended when he was shot and killed by Dredd. Also there are obvious references in the series to other series (TV especially.)  The main example is Comrade Ed, Razor's partner which is an obvious \"take off\" of Mister Ed, the talking horse."

        "content": "Charles Boone, in letters addressed to \"Bones\", describes the arrival of himself and his manservant, Calvin McCann, at Chapelwaite, the neglected ancestral home of Charles's estranged dead cousin. Calvin learns that many people in the nearby Maine town of Preacher's Corners think Charles and Calvin are mad for living in the mansion. The house is said to be \"a bad house\" with a history of sad events, disappearances, and mysterious noises which Charles attributes to \"rats in the walls\". Calvin finds a hidden compartment in the library containing an old map of a deserted village called Jerusalem's Lot, a mysterious area the townsfolk avoid. Their curiosity piqued, Charles and Calvin set out to explore the village. The two men find a decayed Puritan settlement. Nothing has set foot in the town since its abandonment, including animals. As the two explore a church, they discover an obscene parody of the Madonna and Child and an inverted cross. At the pulpit, they find a book filled with Latin and Druidic runes entitled De Vermis Mysteriis, or \"The Mysteries of the Worm\". When Charles touches the book, the church shakes and the two feel something gigantic moving in the ground beneath them. The evil of the place overcomes both men, and they flee the village. The Preacher's Corners' inhabitants begin fearing Charles. They chase him from one house with rocks and guns. Charles asks Mrs. Cloris, Chapelwaite's former maid, for information about Jerusalem's Lot. She reveals a rift in Charles' family caused by his grandfather, Robert Boone, trying to steal De Vermis Mysteriis from his brother, Philip (presumably to destroy it). Philip was a minister involved in the occult who, on October 31, 1789, vanished along with the population of Jerusalem's Lot. Charles dismisses it as superstition but cannot forget what he saw in the church. Calvin discovers a diary in the library, encrypted with a rail fence cipher. Before he can decipher it, Charles takes him into the cellar to check for rats. Hidden behind the walls they find the undead corpses of two of his relatives, Marcella and Randolph Boone. Charles recognizes them as \"nosferatu\". The two flee the cellar, and Calvin seals the trapdoor to prevent pursuit. As Charles recovers from the encounter, Calvin cracks the cipher. The diary, written by Robert Boone, details the history of Jerusalem's Lot and the events leading to the mass disappearance. The village was founded by one of Charles' distant ancestors, James Boon, who was the leader of an inbred witchcraft cult. Philip and Robert took up residence in Chapelwaite, Philip was taken in by Boon's cult, and acquired De Vermis Mysteriis at Boon's behest. Philip and Boon used the book to call forth a supernatural entity referred to as \"The Worm\". In his final entry, Robert curses the whip-poor-will birds that have descended upon Chapelwaite. Charles feels compelled to return to Jerusalem's Lot. Calvin tries to prevent it but finally relents, accompanying his master. They discover a butchered lamb on the church altar, lying on top of De Vermis Mysteriis. Charles moves the lamb and takes the book to destroy it, but a congregation of undead appears, including Philip and Boon. Charles becomes possessed and begins chanting, summoning forth the Worm. Calvin knocks down Charles, freeing him from possession. Charles sets fire to the book. The Worm lashes out from below, killing Calvin before disappearing. Before Charles can recover Calvin's body, Boon forces Charles to flee. In his final letter to \"Bones\", Charles announces his intention to commit suicide, ending the Boone family line. An \"editor's note\" attributes Charles's letters and the death of Calvin to insanity rather than supernatural occurrences in Jerusalem's Lot. The editor notes that Charles was not the last of his line: a bastard relative still exists\u2014the editor himself, James Robert Boone, who has moved to Chapelwaite to restore the family name. James notes that Charles was right about one thing: \"This place badly needs the services of an exterminator. There are some huge rats in the walls, by the sound.\" The note is dated October 2, the same date as Charles' first letter."

        "content": "\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" is a recurring opinion survey and music ranking of the finest albums in history, compiled by the American magazine Rolling Stone. It is based on weighted votes from selected musicians, critics, and industry figures. The first list was published in a special issue of the magazine in 2003 and a related book in 2005. Critics have accused the lists of lending disproportionate weight to artists of particular races and genders. In the original list, most of the selections were albums by white male rock musicians, with the top position held by the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). In 2012, Rolling Stone published a revised edition, drawing on the original and a later survey of albums released up until the early 2000s. Another updated edition of the list was published in 2020, with 154 new entries not in either of the two previous editions. It was based on a new survey and does not factor in the surveys that were conducted for the previous lists. This time, the list featured more black and female artists, topped by Marvin Gaye's What's Going On (1971). It received similar criticisms as the prior lists."

The accounting firm Ernst & Young devised a point system to weigh votes for 1,600 submitted titles. The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band topped the list, with Rolling Stones editors describing it as \"the most important rock 'n' roll album ever made\". The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (1966) was ranked second in recognition of its influence on Sgt. Pepper. The list also included compilations and \"greatest hits\" collections. An amended list was released as a book in 2005, with an introduction by guitarist Steven Van Zandt. Some compilation albums were removed, and Robert Johnson's The Complete Recordings was substituted for both of his King of the Delta Blues Singers volumes, making room for a total of eight new entries on the list. On May 31, 2012, Rolling Stone published a revised list, drawing on the original and a later survey of albums up until the early 2000s. It was made available in \"bookazine\" format on newsstands in the US from April 27 to July 25. The new list contained 38 albums not present in the previous one, 16 of them released after 2003. The top listings remained unchanged. Most of the albums on the initial lists were by white male rock musicians. Among the top 50 rankings, only 12 entries were by artists of non-white ethnicity, none of whom were female, and only three albums by white women figured in the top 50. On September 22, 2020, another revision of the list was published. It drew upon a new survey conducted with \"more than 300 artists, producers, critics, and music-industry figures\", including:"

        "content": "The original Rolling Stone 500 was criticized for being male-dominated, outmoded and almost entirely Anglo-American in focus. Writing in USA Today newspaper, Edna Gundersen described the list as predictable and \"weighted toward testosterone-fueled vintage rock\". Following the publicity surrounding the list, rock critic Jim DeRogatis, a former Rolling Stone editor, published Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics in 2004. The book featured a number of critics arguing against the high evaluation of various \"great\" albums, many of which had been included in the list. Jonny Sharp, a contributor to NMEs own 500 greatest albums list, described the 2012 Rolling Stone list as a \"soulless, canon-centric [list] of the same tired old titles,\" noting: \"looking at their 500, when the only album in their top 10 less than 40 years old is London Calling, I think I prefer the NMEs less critically-correct approach.\" Responding to the 2020 revision, Consequence of Sounds Alex Young wrote that the lesser representation of white male rock musicians was \"the biggest takeaway\". According to CNN's Leah Asmelash, \"The change represents a massive shift for the magazine, moving to recognize more contemporary albums and a wider range of tastes.\" InsideHooks Bonnie Stiernberg questioned whether the editors had made adjustments to the numbered rankings instead of presenting the true results, citing her own experience of helping to compile such lists. She reported that the list \"sparked plenty of debate, angering rockist Boomers and causing cynics to question whether certain albums made the cut because they\u2019re really that great or because they happen to be made by someone who isn\u2019t a white man\"."

        "content": "The story opens with an unnamed narrator being gripped with curiosity by a brief reference to the Black Stone in the book Nameless Cults, aka The Black Book, by Friedrich von Junzt.  He researches the artifact but finds little further information.  The ancient (though its age is debated) monolith stands near to the village of Stregoicavar (\"meaning something like Witch-Town\") in the mountains of Hungary.  There are many superstitions surrounding it, for instance anyone who sleeps nearby will suffer nightmares for the rest of their life and anyone who visits the stone on Midsummer Night will go insane and die. Though the Monolith is hated and disliked by all in the village, it is said by the Innskeeper that \"Any man who lay hammer or maul to it die evilly\", so the villagers simply shun the stone. The narrator decides to travel to Stregoicavar on vacation.   Along the way he hears of the local history and sees the site of an old battlefield, where Count Boris Vladinoff fought the invading Suleiman the Magnificent in 1526.  Local stories say that Vladinoff took shelter in a ruined castle and was brought a lacquered case that had been found near the body of Selim Bahadur, \"the famous Turkish scribe and historian\", who had died in a recent battle.  The unnamed contents scared the Count but at that moment Turkish artillery destroyed a part of the castle and he got buried in the rubble, where his bones still remain. Reaching the village, the narrator interviews some of the villagers.  The current inhabitants are not the original people of the village - they were all wiped out by the Turkish invasion in 1526.  They are said to have been of a different, unknown, race than the Hungarians with a reputation for raiding their villages and kidnapping women and children.  A school teacher reveals that according to legend, the original name for the village was Xuthltan and the stone was worshiped by pagans at one time (although they probably did not erect it themselves).  The black stone is \"octagonal in shape, some sixteen feet in height and about a foot and a half thick.\" A week after arriving the narrator realizes that it is Midsummer Night and makes his way to the stone.  He falls asleep an hour before midnight but wakes to find the chanting and dancing people around the stone. After much dancing, during which the narrator is unable to move or do anything but observe, a baby is killed in sacrifice.  Shortly a giant toad-like monster appears at the top of the stone and a second sacrifice, a young girl, is offered to it.  The narrator faints at this point and decides that it was a dream when he wakes again. But slowly, he realizes that it was no dream. He remembers that Selim Bahadur's case was still with the Count's bones which hadn't been disturbed. The narrator unearths the nobleman's remains and with them, the case belonging to the Turk. He translates the account written by the historian and is horrified by his account of what happened near the Black Stone, how the monstrous creature slaughtered at least ten men before being killed by steel weapons blessed by Muhammad. He realizes that he beheld the cultist worshipers' ghosts bowing before a ghost. He flings the contents of the case into a river."

Six months after his return from an expedition to Mongolia, he was found dead in a locked and bolted chamber with taloned finger marks on his throat. Robert M.

'He is said by Ebn Khallikan ... to have been seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses.' ...And 'what of the monstrous hand that strangled out his life?' In both cases, the coroner reports the cause of death as a phantom monster suspiciously like the one that rent Lovecraft himself limb-from-limb in Robert Bloch's 'The Shambler From The Stars'.\" At the time of his death, von Junzt was working on a second book, the contents of which are unknown since it was burnt to ashes by his friend, the Frenchman Alexis Ladeau. Having read the book before destroying it, Ladeau afterwards slit his own throat with a razor. Von Junzt was one of the few people to have read the Greek version of the Necronomicon."

        "content": "The story opens with the unnamed narrator preparing to commit suicide. Lamenting his fate, he reflects upon the events which led him to this moment. The narrator and his friend, St. John, are a pair of loners who both have a deranged interest in robbing graves. They constantly defile crypts and often keep souvenirs of their nocturnal expeditions. Since they reside in the same house, they have the opportunity to set up a sort of morbid museum in their basement. Using the objects collected from the various graves they have robbed, the two men organize a private exhibition. The collection consists of headstones, preserved bodies, skulls, and several heads in different phases of decomposition. It also includes statues, frightful paintings, and a locked portfolio bound in tanned human skin. One day, the two learn of a particular grave, which sparks a profound interest in them: an old grave in a Holland cemetery which holds a legendary tomb raider within, one who is said to have stolen, many years ago, a \"potent thing from a mighty sepulchre.\" They travel to the old cemetery where the man was buried. The thought of exhuming the final resting place of a former grave robber is irresistibly appealing to them. That, and the fact that the body had been buried several centuries before, drives them to travel such long distances to reach the site. Upon reaching the old cemetery, they notice the distant baying of a giant hound. They ignore it and begin their excavation. After some time, they hit a solid object in the ground. Clearing the last of the dirt from it, the two men unearth a strange and elaborately-made casket. Upon opening the casket, they see that several places on the skeletal remains appear torn and shattered, as if attacked by a wild animal, yet the whole of the skeleton is still completely distinguishable. At that moment, they notice a jade amulet hanging from the skeleton's neck. They examine it and, after some observation, they recognize the amulet as one mentioned in \"the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred.\" They immediately know they must have the amulet at all cost. They remove it from the skeleton and flee into the night. As they do, they notice once again the continuous sound of a baying hound in the distance. After they return home to England, strange events begin to occur. Odd sounds can be heard within and around their house, including the distant howling they heard in the cemetery. One night, St. John is violently attacked and killed by a mysterious creature, which the narrator claims the amulet had brought unto him. He destroys the macabre museum he and his friend made, before fleeing from the house and traveling to London. Still plagued by bizarre occurrences, he decides that he must return the amulet to its rightful owner. He travels to Holland, but the amulet is stolen from him before he can return it. The next day, he reads in the newspaper about a band of thieves savagely killed by an unknown creature. Slowly going insane, he returns to the churchyard and exhumes the coffin once more, only to find the skeleton within covered in caked blood and bits of flesh and hair, holding the lost amulet in its hand. Suddenly, the skeleton begins howling, the same howl that had tormented him since he first stole the amulet. The narrator flees the graveyard, succumbing to madness and despair. He states that he intends to kill himself with a revolver, believing death to be his only refuge from the crawling horror which grows within him."

Most notably, it marks the first appearance of one of Lovecraft's most famous literary creations\u2014the forbidden book known as the Necronomicon. Lovecraft had mentioned its author a year earlier, in \"The Nameless City\", but here for the first time named the book. Referring to an amulet found on a grave-robbing expedition, the narrator relates: Alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know, but we recognized it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; the ghastly soul-symbol of the corpse-eating cult of inaccessible Leng, in Central Asia. All too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old Arab daemonologist; lineaments, he wrote, drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the dead. The reference to \"Leng\" is one of the first mentions of Lovecraft's imaginary plateau, having only appeared before in 1920s \"Celephais\". Here placed in Central Asia, Leng is also associated in Lovecraft's writings with Antarctica and his imaginary Dreamlands. Lovecraftian scholar Will Murray, pointing to the \"semi-canine face\" on the amulet as well as the \"corpse-eating cult\" of Leng, suggests that the titular creature of \"The Hound\" \"probably represents an early form of the ghoul as Lovecraft would develop it.\""

        "content": "On September 16, 1922, Lovecraft toured the Flatbush Reformed Church in Brooklyn with his friend Rheinhart Kleiner, writing about the visit in a letter: Around the old pile is a hoary churchyard, with  dating from around 1730 to the middle of the nineteenth century.... From one of the crumbling gravestones--dated 1747--I chipped a small piece to carry away. It lies before me as I write--and ought to suggest some sort of horror-story. I must place it beneath my pillow as I sleep... who can say what thing might not come out of the centuried earth to exact vengeance for his desecrated tomb? And should it come, who can say what it might not resemble? Lovecraft wrote \"The Hound\" shortly afterwards, using as the name of one of the main characters his nickname for his companion Kleinhart, \"St. John\". The grave that is fatefully robbed in the story is in a \"terrible Holland churchyard\"\u2014perhaps a reference to Flatbush church being part of the Dutch Reformed Church (although the story is actually set in the Netherlands, as well as in England). Critic Steven J. Mariconda suggests that the story is a tribute to the Decadent literary movement in general and in particular Joris-Karl Huysmans' A rebours, an 1884 novel that Lovecraft greatly admired. (Huysmans is mentioned by name in the story, along with Baudelaire.) Like \"The Hound\"'s protagonists, victims of a \"devastating ennui\", the main character of A rebours suffers from an \"overpowering tedium\" that leads him to \"imagine and then indulge in unnatural love-affairs and perverse pleasures.\" Mariconda also points to the heavy debt the story owes to  Edgar Allan Poe, an influence acknowledged by several borrowed phrases: The \"oblong box\" exumed, the mysterious \"knock on my chamber door\", and the \"red death\" brought by the Hound all echo Poe's phraseology."

But the story has its defenders; Steven J. Mariconda says it is \"written in a zestful, almost baroque style which is very entertaining\", while Peter Cannon, saying that it must have been written \"with tongue at least partly in cheek\", credits it with a certain \"naive charm\". The plot of the Poppy Z. Brite short story \"His Mouth Will Taste of Wormwood\" bears a strong resemblance to this Lovecraft story, albeit transplanted to a modern Southern Gothic Louisiana setting."

However, when the flag's owner prepared to formally donate the flag, it was discovered that it was not the flag from Ground Zero. There was a size discrepancy: the yacht's flag measured , while the flag the city had measured . Dreifus started a website in an effort to get the flag back. A 2013 CNN documentary film, The Flag, directed by filmmakers Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein, investigated the mystery of this missing 9/11 icon and discovered video evidence that the flag went missing hours after it was first raised. The original flag has now been recovered. The recovery came as a result of a lead gathered following the airing of the History Channel's Brad Meltzer's Lost History in 2014.

The old man initially denies the allegation, but eventually acknowledges his true identity. Rather than turning Dussander over to the proper authorities, Todd asks to hear highly detailed stories about his crimes, having recently become interested in the Holocaust. However, Todd still threatens Dussander with exposure should he refuse his demands. Over the next several months, Todd visits Dussander daily under the pretext of reading to him, all the while badgering him into revealing more details of his atrocities. Todd soon gives Dussander a replica SS Oberleutnants uniform, forcing him to wear it and march on command. As his relationship with Dussander continues, Todd also begins to have nightmares and sees his grades slip. After being confronted by his father about his grades, he forges his report cards before giving them to his parents. Eventually, Todd becomes in danger of failing several courses. Ed French, Todd's guidance counselor, requests an appointment with the Bowdens. Todd and Dussander concoct a ruse, having Dussander go to French's appointment while posing as Todd's grandfather, Victor. Dussander falsely claims that Todd's grades are the result of problems at home, and promises to make sure his grades improve; French believes Dussander's story, but notices that Todd's \"grandfather\" does not mention him by name. Knowing that Todd has been doctoring his report cards and knowingly socialized with a war criminal, Dussander blackmails him into spending his visits studying. With great effort, Todd is able to sufficiently improve his schoolwork. Since he no longer has any use for Dussander, Todd resolves to kill him and make it look like an accident. Todd had earlier claimed to have given a letter about Dussander to a friend; if anything should happen to Todd, the letter will be sent to the authorities. However, before Todd can kill Dussander, the old man realizes Todd's intentions and claims to have written about Todd's involvement with him, and put his statement into a safe deposit box that will be found upon his death. However, it is revealed that Dussander, like Todd, is also bluffing. Over the next few months, Todd murders several homeless vagrants; he finds that committing murder somehow helps with his nightmares. As years pass, his visits to Dussander become less frequent. He loses his virginity, but finds sex unsatisfying compared to the thrill of committing murder. He rationalizes that his failure at sex is because his girlfriend is Jewish. When circumstances do not allow him to continue his serial killings, he picks a concealed spot overlooking the freeway and aims at people in passing cars with his hunting rifle. Dussander, suffering from his own nightmares, has also taken to killing the homeless for essentially the same reason as Todd, burying the bodies in his basement. Despite the link between them, Dussander and Todd are not immediately aware of each other's exploits. One night, when Dussander is digging a grave for his latest victim, he has a heart attack. He summons Todd, who buries the body and cleans up the crime scene before finally calling an ambulance. At the hospital, Dussander happens to share a room with Morris Heisel, an elderly Jewish man and Holocaust survivor who recognizes \"Mr. Denker\" but cannot place him. When Todd visits Dussander in the hospital, Dussander admits he was bluffing about his bank deposit box, as was Todd's threat about his letter. Dussander has read about the homeless men murdered by Todd and tells the boy not to get careless. Dussander declares that \"we are quits.\" A few days later, Heisel realizes that Denker is Dussander, the commandant of the camp (the fictional \"Patin\") where his wife and daughters were murdered in the gas chambers. An Israeli Nazi hunter named Weiskopf visits Dussander, telling him that he has been found out. After Weiskopf leaves, Dussander steals some drugs from the hospital dispensary and commits suicide. When Dussander's identity is revealed to the world, Todd convinces his parents that he didn't know about Dussander's past. Meanwhile, a police detective named Richler, accompanied by Weiskopf, interviews Todd and is not so easily convinced. A vagrant recognizes Todd as the last person seen with several of the homeless victims, and notifies the police. Meanwhile, French meets Todd's real grandfather. French brings up their previous conversation, but the real Victor Bowden obviously doesn't recall their meeting, and bears no physical resemblance to Dussander. French becomes suspicious and checks Todd's old report cards, finding that they have been tampered with. Later, he identifies Dussander as the man who met with him about Todd's grades. French confronts Todd, who responds by fatally shooting him. Todd's sanity finally breaks. He takes his rifle and ammunition to his hideout by the freeway and embarks on a shooting spree, resulting in his death at the hands of the authorities five hours later."

        "content": "\"Big Two-Hearted River\" is a two-part short story written by American author Ernest Hemingway, published in the 1925 Boni & Liveright edition of  In Our Time, the first American volume of Hemingway's short stories.  It features a single protagonist, Hemingway's recurrent autobiographical character Nick Adams, whose speaking voice is heard just three times. The story explores the destructive qualities of war which is countered by the healing and regenerative powers of nature. When it was published, critics praised Hemingway's sparse writing style and it became an important work in his canon. The story is one of Hemingway's earliest pieces to employ his Iceberg Theory of writing; a modernist approach to prose in which the underlying meaning is hinted at, rather than explicitly stated. \"Big Two-Hearted River\" is almost exclusively descriptive and intentionally devoid of plot. Hemingway was influenced by the visual innovations of C\u00e9zanne's paintings and adapted the painter's idea of presenting background minutiae in lower focus than the main image. In this story, the small details of a fishing trip are explored in great depth, while the landscape setting, and most obviously the swamp, are given cursory attention."

        "content": "In 1922, Hemingway moved with his wife Hadley to Paris, where he worked as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star.  He became friends with and was influenced by modernist writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. The year 1923 saw his first published work, a slim volume titled Three Stories and Ten Poems, followed the next year by another collection of short vignettes, in our time (without capitals).  Hoping to have in our time published in New York, in 1924 he began writing stories to add to the volume with \"Big Two-Hearted River\" planned as the final piece. He started writing the story in May of that year but did not finish until September as he spent the summer helping Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford launch the journal the transatlantic review. \"Big Two-Hearted River\" has strong autobiographical elements. During World War I, Hemingway signed on as a member of the Red Cross at age 19,  and was sent to the Italian Front at Fossalta as an ambulance driver. On his first day there, he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion, about which he later wrote in Death in the Afternoon: \"I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments\". A few days later, on July\u00a08, 1918, he was severely wounded when a mortar bomb exploded between his legs. He was sent to a hospital in Milan where he recuperated for six months; after his return home, he went on a week-long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near Seney in Michigan's Upper Peninsula\u2014a trip that became the inspiration for \"Big Two-Hearted River\". The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns, suggesting that in an early version more characters were included, but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed\u2014leaving Nick alone in the woods. When Hemingway asked her opinion of the draft in October 1925, Stein advised him to cut an 11-page section of stream-of-consciousness reminiscences written from Nick's point of view. Hemingway took her advice, reworked the ending, and wrote to his editor: \"I have discovered that the last eleven pages of the last story in the book are crap\". Biographer James Mellow writes that at this early stage in his career Hemingway had not developed his talent enough to fully and capably integrate self-reflections in his writing; Mellow also believes the deleted passage might have been a \"tour-de-force\" had it been written at a more mature period in Hemingway's development. In January 1925, while wintering in Schruns, Austria, waiting for a response from query letters written to friends and publishers in America, Hemingway submitted the story to be published in his friend Ernest Walsh's newly established literary magazine This Quarter. Walsh bought it for 1,000 French francs, the highest payment Hemingway had yet received for a piece of fiction. On October\u00a05, 1925, the expanded edition of In Our Time (with conventional capitalization in the title) was published by Boni & Liveright in New York. The last story in the volume was the two-part \"Big Two-Hearted River\". The piece was later included in Hemingway's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, The Nick Adams Stories (1972) and The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vig\u00eda Edition (1987). The fragment Hemingway cut was published posthumously as a separate short story titled \"On Writing\" in 1972 in The Nick Adams Stories."

After, he hikes up a hill and rests at a burned stump. While smoking a cigarette, he discovers an ash-blackened grasshopper crawling on his sock, and detaches it. His first spoken words in the story are \"Go on, hopper\u00a0.... Fly away somewhere.\" Later in the day he relaxes in a glade of tall pines and falls asleep. When he wakes, he hikes the last mile to the edge of the river where he sees the trout feeding in the evening light \"making circles all down the surface of the water as though it were starting to rain.\" He pitches his tent, unpacks his supplies, cooks his dinner, fills his water bucket, heats a pot of coffee, and kills a mosquito before falling asleep."

After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, he walks to the river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that \"was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color\" that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, \"as broad as a salmon\", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp."

        "title": "Big Two-Hearted River_War",
        "content": "Hemingway saw World War I as the \"central fact of our time\". \"Big Two-Hearted River\" hints at both widespread physical devastation and Nick's personal war and post-war experience, but neither of these central facts are directly mentioned. Hemingway scholar Joseph Flora makes the observation that Hemingway portrays Nick's character coping \"more meaningfully than he had ever done before, with the issues of life and death\". Biographer Phillip Young sees the story as basically concerned with a description of a young man \"trying desperately to keep from going out of his mind.\" Nick returns  wounded, and introduces a character type Hemingway used again in his later stories and novels. The theme of an unspecified wound is introduced, a device that was to culminate in Jake Barnes' character in The Sun Also Rises. Hemingway scholar William Adair suggests that Nick's war experience was different, and perhaps more traumatic than Hemingway's own, writing that Nick's unspecified wound should not be confused or automatically identified with Hemingway's wound. Although Hemingway's best fiction such as \"Big Two-Hearted River\"  perhaps originated from the \"dark thoughts\" about the wounding, Jackson Benson believes that autobiographical details are employed as framing devices to make observations on life in general and not just Nick's own experiences. He writes that Hemingway created \"what if\" scenarios from real situations in his early fiction, which he projected onto a fictional character\u2014\"What if I were wounded and made crazy?\" the character asks himself. Benson goes on to write that \"much of Hemingway's fiction is dream-like\u2014his early fiction, his best, has often been compared to a compulsive nightmare, as in the recurring imagery of In Our Time.\" Adair views the river setting as a fictional representation of the Piave River near Fossalta, the site of Hemingway's mortar wound. Hemingway may have taken the idea of the swamp from the terrain in the battle of Portogrande\u2014a battle that Hemingway wrote about in a 1922 newspaper story, saying of it: \"Austrians and Italians attacked and counter-attacked waist deep in swamp water\".  Furthermore, Adair suggests that Hemingway's own wounding is reflected in the scene where Nick loses a fish\u2014the \"biggest one I ever had\"\u2014with descriptive imagery such as shoes \"squelchy\" with water, suggestive of Hemingway's recollection of \"feeling as if his boots were filled with warm water (blood) after his wounding.\" Writing in A Moveable Feast, Hemingway remembered \"Big Two-Hearted River\", recalling when he \"sat in a corner with the afternoon light coming in over my shoulder and wrote in the notebook\u00a0.... When I stopped writing I did not want to leave the river where I could see the trout in the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven piles of the bridge. The story was about coming back from the war but there was no mention of the war in it.\""

        "title": "Big Two-Hearted River_Nature",
        "content": "Hemingway's stories typically position nature as a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence\u2014especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well for the first time since the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he has difficulty controlling himself. Hemingway's descriptions of the Michigan landscape, which would have been familiar to him as in his youth he summered at the family's Walloon Lake cottage in Northern Michigan, are presented in a vague and dreamlike manner. Ronald Berman sees Hemingway's treatment of landscape as like a painter's canvas on which he presents Nick's state of mind. The descriptions of the river's water have been compared to American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau's descriptions of the pond in Walden. Biographer Meyers sees the story as a blend of American primitivism and sophistication; Nick evidences a sense of loss which is \"not simply grace under pressure\u2014but under siege\". Nature is perceived as good and civilization as bad\u2014a pervasive theme in American literature, found in such American classics as Mark Twain's 19th-century Huckleberry Finn and in William Faulkner's 20th-century Go Down, Moses. According to Hemingway scholar Susan Beegel, Hemingway is fundamentally an American nature writer. She attributes it to his upbringing: his mother, Grace Hemingway, believed avidly in the early 20th-century \"back to nature\" movement, and his father was a physician who taught science to his son, taking him to Agassiz Movement meetings as a young boy. Hemingway's affinity with nature is reflected most strongly in \"Big Two-Hearted River\", in broad strokes whereby he has Nick traveling deep into the American back-country to find solace, and in small details such as his Agassiz \"object oriented\" descriptions of the grasshoppers."

        "title": "Big Two-Hearted River_Iceberg theory",
        "content": "Hemingway was inspired by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the principles of imagism to his own work. Pound's influence can be seen in the stripped-down, minimalist style  characteristic in Hemingway's early fiction. Betraying his admiration for the older writer, he admitted that Pound \"taught [me] more about how to write and how not to write than any son of a bitch alive\". He also learned from James Joyce, who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose. Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism; biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to \"get the most from the least, [to] prune language, [to] multiply intensities, [to] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth\". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. The iceberg theory has been termed the \"theory of omission\". Hemingway believed a writer could convey an object or concept while writing about something entirely different. In \"Big Two-Hearted River\" he elaborates on the mundane activities Nick carries out. The story is filled with seemingly trivial detail: Nick gathers grasshoppers, brews coffee, catches and loses a large trout. In this climactic event, however, the excitement and tension becomes so strong that Nick betrays his inner thoughts and he takes a break. While Hemingway painstakingly describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick's fishing trip, he avoids or barely hints at the driving force of the work: the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war. Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing \"'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war\u00a0.... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence. So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war is omitted.\" Flora believes that in \"Big Two-Hearted River\" the concept of the iceberg theory is more evident than in any other piece written by Hemingway. Paul Smith believes Hemingway was still only experimenting stylistically during In Our Time. He maintains that Hemingway's later minimalist style can be seen here, but not so much from tight editing as from Hemingway's first approach, his desire to emulate his influences. Hemingway's sentences \"began life as scrawny little things, and then grew to their proper size through a process of accretion.\" He avoided complicated syntax to reflect Nick's wish that the fishing trip be uncomplicated. An analysis of the text shows that about 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences\u2014a childlike syntax without subordination\u2014and that repetition is often substituted for subordinate thoughts. Furthermore, the repetition creates prose with a \"rhythmic, ritualistic effect\" that emphasizes important points. The lengths of the paragraphs vary with short paragraphs intensifying the action. Benson writes that in \"Indian Camp\" and \"Big Two-Hearted River\" Hemingway's prose was sharper and more abstract than in other stories, and that by employing simple sentences and diction\u2014techniques he learned writing for newspapers\u2014the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality."

        "content": "Hemingway greatly admired C\u00e9zanne and early in his career crafted his prose in a way that would resonate with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that \"C\u00e9zanne is my painter after the early painters\u00a0.... I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul C\u00e9zanne, I learned how\u00a0... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times.\" Hemingway wanted the structure of \"Big Two-Hearted River\" to resemble a C\u00e9zanne\u2014with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, \"I have finished two long stories\u00a0... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like C\u00e9zanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit. It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell. I made it all up\". His description of the river and the countryside betray the influence of the Post-Impressionist style. Hemingway was heavily influenced by the modernists. He often visited the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg, where he saw three C\u00e9zanne paintings, L'Estaque, Cour d'une ferme, and Les Peupliers.  A series of C\u00e9zanne watercolors were exhibited at Berheim-Jeune Gallery before he began writing the story. Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that he had been \"learning something from the painting of C\u00e9zanne that made writing simple true sentences far from enough to make the stories have the dimensions that I was trying to put in them.\" Comparing \"Big Two-Hearted River\" to C\u00e9zanne's paintings, Berman observes that Hemingway established a \"representation of form, space and light\", and that the dense descriptive passages give \"light and form\u00a0.... overwhelmingly visual, intensely concerned with spatiality\", while in the middle ground, \"We sense [the trees] through vertical forms and dark colors only\". Like C\u00e9zanne paintings, Hemingway's landscapes are vague and do not represent any specific place: Seney burned in 1891, not in 1919; the hill Nick climbs does not exist; and the east branch of the Fox River, where he camps, is not a day's hike from the town. Kenneth Johnston believes Hemingway's use of symbolism is a substitute for paint and brushstrokes. He views the description of the town after the fire, and the railroad tracks, as words \"slash[ed] across the landscape\", with a physicality similar to a C\u00e9zanne landscape. The minutely detailed passages of the campsite and Nick's mundane activities fill the story's foreground, while the forest and menacing swamp, relegated to the background, are described vaguely and only in passing. The river acts as a barrier between the foreground and background, and is present as deep in places, shallow in others, with currents that are either slow or fast. Berman says Nick is shown as a figure in a painting\u2014seen in the foreground at the campsite and at a distance from the murky background of the swamp."

        "title": "Big Two-Hearted River_Symbolism",
        "content": "Nick is incapable of self-reflection and unable to cope with pain. Hemingway conveys this through symbolism and a series of objective correlatives (tangible objects), which allow the reader insight to the character's motivations. For example, on his arrival in Seney he literally falls off the train, shocked at the sight of the burned town, but on a deeper level in shock from his war experience. Leaving behind the burnt landscape, Nick climbs a hill in the heat, and surveys the town's damage. The burning and heat symbolize his memory of war-torn Italy, but he hopes for regrowth: \"It could not all be burned. He knew that\". At the top of the hill, he takes a break, smokes a cigarette, and speaks for the first time. Flora suggests that speaking symbolizes his humanity, lost in the war, which he is beginning to regain. Beyond the town the bridge over the river still exists and the river symbolizes time and timelessness, healing and the natural cycle of life and death. Nick is on a journey, perhaps he sees it as a religious quest given the Christian symbolism of the fish. From the town, a road leads into pristine back-country. It crosses a bridge under which the trout hold steady against the current, just as Nick needs to hold steady. From the bridge he glimpses a kingfisher taking wing, a bird Johnston points out symbolizes \"halcyon days, peace and tranquility\". A large uprooted tree symbolizes the protagonist himself uprooted by war, and that his fragility is symbolized by the trout he releases carefully so as not to damage its protective slime coat. The campsite symbolizes safety, set deep in a pine grove and described in soothing greens; beyond three dead trees in the background looms the swamp where he will not venture. His tent is portrayed as a less dark place than the emptiness outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening."

        "content": "In Our Time was published as part of Pound's modernist series by Three Mountains Press, Paris in 1924. The work was well received by critics; Edmund Wilson described the writing as \"of the first distinction\", and in the 1940s he again wrote of \"Big Two-Hearted River\", \"along with the mottled trout\u00a0... the boy from the American Middle West fishes up a nice little masterpiece.\" When the story was published in the United States, critics asserted Hemingway had reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style.  In 1952, reviewing The Old Man and the Sea\u2014for which Hemingway would win the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature\u2014The New York Times said of \"Big Two-Hearted River\" that it was one of the \"best and happiest of his early short stories\". Carlos Baker views the stories of In Our Time as a remarkable achievement for a young writer. Joseph Flora described \"Big Two-Hearted River\" as \"unquestionably the most brilliant of the collection In Our Time\". The piece has become one of Hemingway's most anthologized stories, and one of a handful subject to serious literary criticism since its publication, and belongs in the canon of 20th-century American literature. Beegel writes that it is considered \"among the best\" American short stories, along with Stephen Crane's \"The Open Boat\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Young Goodman Brown\" and Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\". According to Benson, despite Pound and Joyce's influence, Hemingway \"carried the new form into the position of dominant influence\" for much of the 20th century. Unlike other modernist writers, who wrote of man cut off from the past, Hemingway placed his narratives in the present and hence became \"the true modernist\"."

The original publication by The Pennsylvania Gazette on May 9, 1754, is the earliest known pictorial representation of colonial union produced by an American colonist in Colonial America. It is a woodcut showing a snake cut into eighths, with each segment labeled with the initials of one of the American colonies or regions. New England was represented as one segment, rather than the four colonies it was at that time. Delaware was not listed separately as it was part of Pennsylvania. Georgia, however, was omitted completely. Thus, it has eight segments of a snake rather than the traditional 13 colonies. The poster focused solely on the colonies that claimed shared identities as Americans. The cartoon appeared along with Franklin's editorial about the \"disunited state\" of the colonies and helped make his point about the importance of colonial unity. It later became a symbol of colonial freedom during the American Revolutionary War."

Many American colonists wished to gain control over the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains and settle there (or make profits from speculating on new settlements). During the outbreak of the war, the American colonists were divided on whether or not to take the risk of actually fighting the French for control of the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains. The poster quickly became a symbol for the need of organized action against the threat posed by the French and their native allies during the conflict, as while many Americans were unwilling to participate in combat against the French, many more recognized that if the French colonies were not captured they would always pose a risk to the well-being and security of the Thirteen Colonies. Writer Philip Davidson stated that Franklin was a propagandist influential in seeing the potential in political cartoons to stir up public opinion in favor of a certain way of thinking. Franklin had proposed the Albany Plan and his cartoon suggested that such a union was necessary to avoid each colony being captured individually by the French. As Franklin wrote:"

        "content": "Franklin's political cartoon took on a different meaning during the lead up to the American Revolution, especially around 1765\u20131766, during the Stamp Act Congress. American colonists protesting against the rule of the Crown used the cartoon in the Constitutional Courant to help persuade their fellow colonists to rise up. However, the Patriots, who associated the image with eternity, vigilance, and prudence, were not the only ones who saw a new interpretation of the cartoon. The Loyalists saw the cartoon with more biblical traditions, such as those of guile, deceit, and treachery. Franklin himself opposed the use of his cartoon at this time, but instead advocated a moderate political policy; in 1766, he published a new cartoon MAGNA Britannia: her Colonies REDUCED, where he warned against the danger of Britain losing her American colonies by means of the image of a female figure (Britannia) with her limbs cut off. Because of Franklin's initial cartoon, however, the Courant was thought of in England as one of the most radical publications. The difference between the use of Join or Die in 1754 and 1765 is that Franklin had designed it to unite the colonies for 'management of Indian relations' and defense against France, but in 1765 American colonists used it to urge colonial unity in favor of resisting laws and edicts that were imposed upon them. Also during this time the phrase \"join, or die\" changed to \"unite, or die,\" in some states such as New York and Pennsylvania. Soon after the publication of the cartoon during the Stamp Act Congress, variations were printed in New York, Massachusetts, and a couple of months later it had spread to Virginia and South Carolina. In some states, such as New York and Pennsylvania, the cartoon continued to be published week after week for over a year. On July 7, 1774 Paul Revere altered the cartoon to fit the masthead of the Massachusetts Spy."

        "content": "The cartoon has been reprinted and redrawn widely throughout American history. Variants of the cartoon have different texts, and differently labeled segments, depending on the political bodies being appealed to. During the American Revolutionary War, the image became a potent symbol of the unity displayed by the American colonists and resistance to Parliament and the Crown. It returned to service, suitably redrawn, for both sides of the American Civil War, as both Union and Confederacy held differing views on the nature of the Federal government. The Latin translation of Join, or Die (Jungite aut Perite) is used as the official motto of the Philadelphia Union soccer team. A snake is also featured in their logo as an allusion to this cartoon. A flag featuring this cartoon was prominently displayed in the opening credits of the 2008 TV miniseries John Adams and was the title for the first part of the miniseries. The Late Late Show former host Craig Ferguson has this cartoon tattooed on the inside of his right forearm reaching his wrist, to commemorate becoming an American citizen. Ferguson also named his comedy-talk show on the History Channel, Join or Die with Craig Ferguson, after the cartoon. The show began airing in February 2016. An image of the Join, or Die snake was delivered as a threat to a victim in the 2010 NCIS episode \"Dead Air\". It was used as a symbol for a Military At Home terrorist group. \"Join Or Die\" is the name given to the special edition of the video game Assassin's Creed III, which is set during the American Revolutionary War. In the TNT show Falling Skies, when Pope and his gang of outlaws are cornered at gunpoint by Tom Mason, Pope asks Mason for options, to which Mason replies \"Join, or Die!\". Part of Mason's backstory included him being a Boston University history professor who taught the American Revolution as part of his curriculum. On the Fox show Sleepy Hollow in the episode \"Magnum Opus\" in Season 2 Episode 10, the original Join or Die cartoon is shown and described as being drawn by Benjamin Franklin to secretly indicate an actual river.  Looking at the actual map, the place where the mouth of the snake is located is where the main characters find an enchanted sword. The Philadelphia 76ers NBA team integrated the snake into its Liberty Bell logo to create a special edition 2018 playoffs logo, though it used the later alternate version, \"Unite or Die.\" Posters with the cartoon can be found in buildings throughout the video game Fallout 4. In the film, In the Shadow of the Moon (2019), a miniature flag printed with the snake is seen next to the flag of the militant terrorist group, in one of the final scenes."

He grabs his violin and the music echoes through the forest, soon a wolf comes through the thicket. The musician was not waiting for the wolf, but the wolf would like to learn to play the violin. The musician tells the wolf to do everything he says and he takes him to an old oak tree, which is hollow inside and split open in the middle. The wolf has to put his front paws in the slit, the musician grabs a stone and fixes the wolf's paws. The musician goes on and plays another tune, then a fox comes. The musician was not waiting for the fox either, but the fox also wants to learn to play the violin. The fox, too, must do everything the musician tells him to do, and they set off together. They come to a path with tall bushes on either side, where the musician bends down a hazel tree and puts his foot on the top. He does the same with a small tree on the other side of the path, and he ties the left front leg to the left trunk. The right front leg is tied to the right trunk, and then he releases the tree limbs. The fox flies into the air, where it remains floating, and the musician continues on the path. After a while, he plays his fiddle again, and then a hare comes. The musician was not waiting for the hare either, the hare also wants to learn how to play the violin. The musician also tells the hare to do everything he is told and they set off together like an apprentice with his master. At a clearing in the woods, the musician ties a long rope around the hare's neck and ties the other end to a tree. The hare must run around the tree twenty times, after which the hare is trapped. The wolf, meanwhile, has freed himself and runs furiously after the musician. The fox sees him and shouts that the musician has tricked him, whereupon the wolf pulls down the tree limbs and bites the ropes. Together they set out to take revenge, finding the tied hare and freeing him as well. Meanwhile, the musician made music again, and this time a woodsman came. Whether he wanted to or not, he had to stop his work and comes to the musician with his axe. The musician is happy to finally see a human being instead of a wild animal, and as he plays for the woodcutter, the three animals come running. The woodcutter stands in front of the musician with his axe and says that they will have to deal with him if they want to do anything to the musician. The animals get scared and run into the forest, after which the musician plays another tune for the woodcutter as thanks for his help."

        "content": "\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is a song written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel for Walt Disney Pictures' 36th animated feature film Mulan (1998). Appearing on the film's soundtrack Mulan: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by American singer Donny Osmond as the singing voice of Captain Li Shang in lieu of American actor BD Wong, who provides the character's speaking voice. The song also features contributions from Lea Salonga as the singing voice of Mulan, Eddie Murphy as Mushu, and Harvey Fierstein, Jerry Tondo and Wilder himself as Yao, Chien-Po and Ling, respectively. In addition, Mushu has a speaking line unlike the other characters in the song. \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written to replace the song \"We'll Make a Man of You\" after the film's original songwriter Stephen Schwartz departed from the project in favor of working on DreamWorks' The Prince of Egypt (1998). Wilder and Zippel were inspired to complete the song after conceiving its ironic title, and the initial draft of the track was immediately approved by Disney. Prior to Mulan, Osmond had auditioned for the role of Hercules in Disney's Hercules (1997), a role for which he was ultimately turned down by the directors because they felt that he sounded too old. Disney eventually cast Osmond as the singing voice of Shang because his singing voice is similar to Wong's speaking voice. An up-tempo military-style song that incorporates both Eastern and Western musical styles, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by Shang during a rigorous training montage in which his young, inexperienced soldiers attempt to justify their worth. The song's title is considered ironic because Mulan, who relies on intelligence, ultimately proves more competent than her male comrades, including Captain Li Shang, who takes a liking to her, while its lyrics explore hyper-masculinity contradicted with Mulan's gender. \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" has received mostly positive reviews from film and music critics, some of whom dubbed it the film's best song, while praising Osmond's performance. Critics have also drawn comparisons between the song and Disney's Hercules, while likening Mulan's role and transformation to actress Demi Moore's performance as Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil in the film G. I. Jane (1997). The song has since appeared on several \"best of\" Disney songs lists, including those of Total Film and the New York Post. Discussed by film critics, film historians, academic journalists and feminists, the song has gone on to be recorded and covered in several different languages\u2014namely Mandarin, Cantonese and Spanish\u2014by entertainers Jackie Chan and Cristian Castro, respectively."

        "content": "\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who were hired to write Mulan's songs because Disney was interested in recruiting songwriters \"that ... would give kind of a different sound to each of the songs.\" While Zippel, a Broadway lyricist, was recruited because the directors were impressed with his work on Disney's Hercules (1997), at the time Wilder, a pop singer, had been best known for his song \"Break My Stride\". Bancroft believes that, although the songwriters \"had two different sensibilities ... the blend [of their styles] worked well together, especially on ['I'll Make a Man Out of You']\".Songwriter Stephen Schwartz was originally slated to write lyrics for Mulan until he was replaced by Zippel \"at the last moment.\" Schwartz had written a song called \"We'll Make a Man of You\" for the scene in which Mulan is training to be a soldier. The song was ultimately replaced with Wilder and Zippel's \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" when Schwartz was forced to resign from Mulan by Disney executives Peter Schneider and Michael Eisner because the songwriter had also agreed to score rival studio DreamWorks' animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998). Wilder and Zippel first conceived the song's title, which then inspired them to write its lyrics and music. Zippel identified determining the song's ironic title as the moment \"he knew he'd hit on something great\" by \"contrasting Mulan's gender with the concept of what it means to be a man.\" The songwriters were hoping to create an original version of a training montage that was funny without being obvious, while remaining in character at all times. In an unlikely situation, the filmmakers universally enjoyed the song from its very first draft. Wilder described himself as using \"an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach\" to composing its music, explaining, \"I knew I wanted it to sound large and I knew what the tempo and the cadence of the piece was.\" Combining Eastern and Western styles, Wilder borrowed \"drum cadences from traditional Chinese drums and then marrying that with military snares\", upon which he continued building until \"it became this cacophonous effect of a Chinese marching American band\". Wilder and Zippel decided to incorporate drums into the track to demonstrate a sense of masculinity and musculature, identifying the song as very odd in structure but appropriate for its lyrics. Zippel's incorporation of \"naturalistic descriptions of masculinity\" into the song's lyrics \u2013 raging fire, coursing river, great typhoon \u2013 was used in an attempt to \"get inside Shang's head space\", elaborating, \"I was just trying to be in character for the captain and how an Asian captain would lead his group differently than how a Western captain would call his troops,\" identifying as an opportunity \"to put some specificity into it.\" Wilder recorded the song's demo himself, which was arranged into a composition featuring a 100-piece orchestra and male choir conducted by musician Paul Buckmaster. Before Mulan, American singer Donny Osmond had auditioned for the lead role in Hercules, a role for which he was ultimately not cast because the directors felt that his voice sounded \"too old\" and \"too deep\" for the character. Osmond later revealed in an interview with People that he was so embarrassed by his Hercules audition that he had nearly considered ending his singing career prematurely. A few months later, Disney contacted Osmond with interest in casting him as the singing voice of Shang after comparing his audition tapes to BD Wong and determining that both actors have \"very similar voices.\" In one scene, Osmond's character, Shang, is hit in the stomach while singing \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\". In order to sound as realistic as possible, Osmond punched himself in the stomach several times while recording the song."

        "content": "\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by Captain Li Shang during Mulans training montage, which has also been identified as the film's \"boot camp sequence.\" The scene explores Shang's attempt to train his newly recruited squadron of incompetent soldiers in the hopes of ultimately transforming them into a skilled army. Occupying a significant portion of the film's plot, Shang promises to turn his team of \"rag-tag recruits\" into men, implying that they are merely boys unless they learn to fight while entirely unaware that Mulan is a woman. The musical number is used to \"compress dramatic time or narrate\" in a more compelling way than had solely dialogue been used. The scene begins with Shang shooting an arrow into the top of a tall pole and challenging all of his soldiers to retrieve it, each of whom fail until Mulan eventually succeeds. According to the book Into the Closet: Cross-Dressing and the Gendered Body in Children's Literature and Film by Victoria Flanagan, Mulan is successful in retrieving the arrow because she uses \"an ingenuity that is based upon her ability to incorporate aspects of femininity into her masculine performance.\" By the end of the scene, all of the soldiers have improved dramatically and the results of their practice and training are finally revealed. In what Joshua and Judges author Athalya Brenner called \"a humorous reversal toward the end of the movie,\" Mulan and her male comrades disguise themselves as concubines in order to infiltrate the palace and rescue the emperor while \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" reprises in the background.Critics have observed ways in which the scene explores Mulan's growth and transformation as the character evolves from a clumsy, inexperienced recruit into one of the army's most skilled soldiers, in spite of her gender. According to the book Literacy, Play and Globalization: Converging Imaginaries in Children's Critical and Cultural Performances, the montage depicts Mulan's gender as \"an obstacle to overcome.\" Author Phyllis Frus wrote in her book Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works, \"The need for inexperienced young men to go through a rigorous training results in a sequence common to many films,\" and that the scene \"shows the challenges Ping/Mulan faces due to her\" inexperience. As observed by Juanita Kwok in the book Film Asia: New Perspectives on Film for English, the irony of the scene lies within the fact that \"Mulan proves herself more competent than any of the men.\" The author also observed that the scene's first refrain accompanies shots of Shang, while its second \"coincides with Mulan climbing to the top of the pole.\" Additionally, while the earlier, all-female musical number \"Honor to Us All\" \"functions as an account of the constructedness of female gender,\" \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" \"juxtaposes and makes explicit the contention that gender is a cultural product,\" according to Johnson Cheu, author of Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability. The Representation of Gender in Walt Disney's \"Mulan\" believes that the song emphasizes desirable masculine traits, namely \"discipline ... tranquility, celerity, strength and fearlessness,\" while Shang, according to Putting the Grail Back into Girl Power: How a Girl Saved Camelot, and why it Matters, \"views [femininity] as comparable to weakness.\" In her article Disney's \"Mulan\"\u2014the \"True\" Deconstructed Heroine?, Lisa Brocklebank argued the song explores themes such as othering, ostracism and abjection. Hannah Yasharoff, writing for USA Today, believes Mulan is used to counter the idea that masculinity is \"the only way to become strong enough to win the war\". Comparing the song to other training sequences such as Private Benjamin (1980), Wilder explained that the filmmakers \"were trying to marry the idea of that hyper-masculinity as if it were a Marine moment, but instead of it being Marines, it was the Chinese army.\" Critics have drawn similarities between the \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" sequence and Hercules' training montage in Disney's Hercules (1997), as well as actress Demi Moore's role as Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil in the film G. I. Jane (1997). In the book Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, author John Stephens wrote that although both Mulan and Hercules depict \"the active male body as spectacle,\" Mulans is less \"straight-forward\" due to the character's gender. Michael Dequina of The Movie Report observed that \"Mulan's transformation is highly reminiscent of Demi Moore's in last year's Disney drama G.I. Jane, but Mulan oneups that film's hour-long toughening process by efficiently covering the same ground during a single, rousing musical number.\""

Wilder himself has identified \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" as \"a very odd pop song\". The Disney Song Encyclopedia described the song as a \"rhythmic military song.\" Beginning with \"a military-style drum\" introduction, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\", which is immediately preceded by the emotional ballad \"Reflection\" on the film's soundtrack album, \"breaks up the slower pace of the songs,\" according to Filmtracks.com. Similar to the song \"A Girl Worth Fighting For\", the \"ironically titled\" \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" \"play[s] off Mulan's secret\" because Shang is unaware that she is actually a girl, as observed by Jeffrey Gantz of The Phoenix. Johnson Cheu, author of Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability, received the song as a counterpart to the all-female musical number \"Honor to Us All\". Going into the last verse, the song's key shifts up to F minor and later towards the end, \"the backing track falls into silence and [Osmond's] vocals come to the fore.\" Osmond's vocal range spans one octave, from D3 To G#4 Beginning with two verses, followed by a bridge, a refrain, a final verse and repeated choruses, the song is a total of three minutes and twenty-one seconds in length. Entertainment Weekly identified the number as the film's \"rambunctious peak.\" According to Victoria Flanagan, author of Into the Closet: Gender and Cross-dressing in Children's Fiction: Cross-Dressing and the Gendered Body in Children's Literature and Film, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is \"a playful parody of conventional masculinity.\" USA Today's Hannah Yasharoff described the song as \"a tongue-in-cheek comment on sexism\". Lyrically, Zippel described the track as a song about \"hyper-masculinity\" that is disturbed by \"the whole idea of Mulan\", identifying the song as an opportunity \"to have those two issues head-to-head.\" The lyric \"I'll make a man out of you\" is constantly repeated and reinforced by Shang. According to author John Stephens of Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, the song's lyrics \"initially define masculinity in opposition to femininity,\" with its first verse beginning, Let's get down to business To defeat the Huns /Did they send me daughters / When l asked for sons ?\" Its chorus reads, Be a man You must be swift as the coursing  river  / Be a man With all the force  of a great typhoon /Be a man With all the strength of a raging fire /Mysterious as the dark side of the moon \" which, according to Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, \"essentializes masculinity by asserting that it embodies the speed, strength and power of the natural world, and yet contains this within an aura of tranquility and mystery.\" According to Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works, these lyrics \"add a hint of darkness as they celebrate male prowess\" by suggesting that one who has \"acquired fiery strength\" is also \"untamed as the moon's dark side.\" The song has been noted by the New York Post for its \"slew of one-liners from supporting characters\" that reads \"I'm never gonna catch my breath. Say goodbye to those who knew me. Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym.\" According to The Phoenix, Osmond performs the song's lyrics with \"grit.\" Meanwhile, the singer is backed up by a macho-sounding choir repeatedly chanting \"Be a man!\", a call and response preceded by three chords intertwined with lyrics such as \"you must be swift as the coursing river\" and \"with all the force of a great typhoon.\" Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker identified the \"Be a man\" chorus as the song's most iconic moment."

In 2012, Entertainment Weekly readers voted the song 18th on their list of 20 all-time greatest Disney songs. Osmond himself acknowledged the accomplishment in a Facebook post, writing, \"In my grandkids' eyes, this is easily my greatest accomplishment yet.\" Comedy Central Josh Pappenheim called \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" \"one of the most iconic Disney songs of all time\". Hannah Yasharoff, writing for USA Today, dubbed the track \"an iconic moment in pop culture.\" On Empires list of the twenty \"Most Awesome Training Montages In Cinema History\", \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was ranked 14th. The author identified it as \"a solid training montage in which Mulan and her friends go from hapless duffers to fearless warriors in just over two minutes.\" Similarly, Men's Fitness also ranked \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" among the greatest training montages in film history. Stephen Fiorentine of Sneaker Report wrote that \"Training montages aren't limited to just live-action movies. With movies like Mulan and Hercules, Disney mastered the art of the montage in their animated films.\" In 2018, Entertainment Weekly contributor Maureen Lee Lenker wrote that the song has successfully \"endured since the film's release\" and remained \"a perennial favorite\" despite being more upbeat than typical Disney songs. Actress Daisy Ridley said that she listens to the song to prepare for action sequences in film roles, particularly for her performance in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). Ridley explained that the song \"makes me feel empowered\" and revive her energy, comparing her character Rey finding her strength to Mulan. Media publications have lamented the fact that the 2020 live-action adaptation of the film might not include any songs, particularly \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\", with Yasharoff writing, \"Any excuse to make that song relevant again is more than welcome,\" and ranking the song second on their reasons \"Why the live-action version should replicate the animated musical\". While the song itself was not sung in the live-action film, lines from it were repeated during Mulan's training at the camp as a rallying call for the recruits."

        "content": "7 Seeds (stylized as 7SEEDS) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yumi Tamura. It is set in a post-apocalyptic future, long enough after a meteorite hits Earth that new species have evolved, and follows the struggles of five groups of young adults to survive after they are revived from cryonic preservation. The title comes from five groups of individuals in cryogenic chambers along with supplies, called \"seeds\", laid down by the Japanese government. The manga was originally serialized in Shogakukan's Bessatsu Sh\u014djo Comic magazine, premiering in the November 2001 issue; it transferred to Flowers magazine in April 2002, where it ran until its conclusion in May 2017. Shogakukan collected the individual chapters into 35 bound volumes. The series won the 52nd Shogakukan Manga Award for Best Sh\u014djo Manga in 2007. Including digital sales, it has sold more than 6 million copies in Japan. An original net animation (ONA) anime adaptation, produced by Gonzo and directed by Yukio Takahashi, was announced in November 2018. The first season was released worldwide on Netflix in June 2019. A second season produced by Studio Kai premiered on 26 March 2020."

        "content": "When astronomers predict that the Earth will be hit by a meteorite, the world leaders meet to develop a plan for human survival called the Seven Seeds project. Each country agrees to preserve numbers of healthy young people through cryogenics, which will allow them to survive the devastation of the impact. After a computer determines that Earth is once again safe for human life, it will revive each group. The Japanese government creates five groups of survivors named Winter, Spring, Summer A, Summer B, and Fall. Each group consists of seven members, who are not told about what will happen before they are placed in cryonic preservation, and one adult guide who is trained in wilderness survival. These groups are scattered across Japan: the Summer groups in southern and northern Ky\u016bsh\u016b, Fall in western Honsh\u016b, Spring in central Honsh\u016b near Tokyo, and Winter in Hokkaid\u014d. Awoken from the cryogenic sleep many years later, the young men and women find themselves amidst a hostile environment bare of any human life. Their former home country Japan has greatly changed. Completely alone, they must depend only on themselves to survive in the new world."

        "content": "7 Seeds takes place an unknown number of years after the collision of a large meteorite with Earth. As a result of the impact, the climate of Japan has greatly changed from what the characters knew from the present day. In the Kansai region there are only two seasons, a dry season and a longer, heavier rainy season. Takahiro of Winter group describes the winters in the northern island of Hokkaid\u014d as being as mild as in Kanagawa Prefecture where he grew up. In addition, sea levels have risen greatly: downtown Yokohama is completely underwater, only the top hand of the statue in Nagasaki Peace Park is above the surface of the ocean. The geography of Japan has changed as well: after an eruption of Mount Aso, Ky\u016bsh\u016b has been split into two islands, and the Kansai region is separated from central Honsh\u016b by a wide strait. The series depicts a Japan in which, as a result of the new environment and mass extinctions, ecosystems have changed and several new species of animals and plants have evolved. For example, on the island where Summer group B first lands, off the coast of Nagasaki Prefecture, Botan notes how few of the ecological niches are filled, including no birds or flying insects, and that the limited number of species are still radiating to fill empty niches. In particular, a local rodent resembling a rabbit is in the process of speciation into herbivorous and ravenously carnivorous versions, which are still visually similar. Other dangers new to the characters include swarms of carnivorous white cockroaches and gigantic Venus flytraps, sundews, and nepenthes. Species that are unchanged but were previously unknown in Japan include banana trees and crocodiles. Semimaru notes that neither on the island nor on the Ky\u016bsh\u016b mainland do they see any ants, bees, or similar insects. In the Kansai region, Fall group domesticates flightless birds about the size of a chicken and sheep that have grown to resemble llamas, which can be ridden, milked and shorn for wool. Izayoi tells Natsu that a local wasp is deadly, killing with a single sting, and another species has a sting that sickens the victim for a day. According to Akio, corn is the only crop from their seed cache that grows in the area's soils, but Fall group also cultivates a variety of tobacco with a narcotic effect when smoked. In the southern part of central Honsh\u016b, Natsu, Arashi, and Semimaru of Summer group B cross a desert with cactus scrub. Throughout the region they find remains of large reptiles that revive from estivation during the rainy season, which remind Natsu of velociraptors from Jurassic Park. These \"dinosaurs\", as the characters call them, have grassland and woodland varieties, and during the rainy season are the dominant predator from the south coast to at least as far north as Tokyo. On the island where the Spring group first lands, off the coast of the Kant\u014d region, Hana notes that there are no vertebrates on land or in the sea, and Momotaro describes the ecology as similar to that of the Carboniferous Era. On land, there are giant insects the characters call \"boat beetles\" and swarms of bees with stings that are painful but not deadly, which force the group to live on rafts off-shore. In the island's swamps, there are giant praying mantis and giant dragonflies. While at the island, the group lives off shellfish and shallow-water nautiluses, but see no bony fish. The characters find the climate changed as well, as it is too overcast to see the stars for the first two weeks after they are awake, even though it is spring, a season that in the present day is noted for clear weather. On the mainland of the Kant\u014d region, Spring group meets large aquatic lizards living among the submerged ruins of Yokohama, which hunt in groups. Nearby, in the ruins of central Tokyo, the party from Summer group B is attacked by a giant predatory fish, which Takahiro of Winter group identifies as descended from a deep-sea fish, the only kind of bony fishes to have survived. They also meet a fungus-like growth Takahiro calls \"blue mucus\", which infects Hana's skin when she touches it. This growth goes dormant in the dry season, and Takahiro realizes it is intolerant to salt and uses it to cure her. In northern Honsh\u016b near Sendai, Natsu, Arashi and Semimaru of Summer group B find the first flowers they have seen during their journey over most of the length of Japan. In southern Hokkaid\u014d, Winter group encounters grasslands populated by many mammals they do not know, including small-eared rodents, herds of unknown ruminants, and tigers with saber-teeth. They also meet wolves with the ability to project illusions normally used to help hunt. The project organizers also prepared sealed caches containing seeds and instructional books near the \"seven Fuji\". These seven Fuji are not related to the famous Mount Fuji, but are regional landmarks also named Fuji: Bungo Fuji in \u014cita Prefecture is Mt. Yufudake, where the cache is marked by a statue of the Buddha Vairocana. Ogino Fuji in Kanagawa Prefecture is Mt. Kyogatake, where the cache is marked by a statue of Monjubosatsu, the bodhisattva Manjusri. Kobe Fuji in Hyogo Prefecture is Mount Futatabi of the Rokk\u014d Mountains, marked by a statue of Acala (Fud\u014d my\u014d-\u014d). Natori Fuji in Miyagi Prefecture is Mt. Taihaku, near Sendai, where the cache is marked by a statue of Kok\u016bz\u014d Bosatsu (\u0100k\u0101\u015bagarbha). Akan Fuji in Hokkaid\u014d is Mt. Meakandake, where the cache is marked by a statue of Avalokite\u015bvara, the goddess of mercy. Tosa Fuji in Kumamoto Prefecture is Mount Takamori, marked by a statue of Mah\u0101sth\u0101mapr\u0101pta. Noto Fuji in Ishikawa Prefecture is Mount Takatsume-ya, where the cache is marked by a statue of goddess Kukurihime. Fuji is a ghost ship with similar capabilities to the RP FLIP. The ghost ship is adrift at sea in a vast ship graveyard. It is marked by a painting of the buddha Samantabhadra riding on a white elephant's back. This Fuji was the only one kept hidden and used as a humans' shelter at the same time."

        "content": "A 1995 article by Joseph L. Graves & Amanda Johnson was highly critical of the scientific basis on which Mainstream Science on Intelligence rested. The article stated that the statements in Mainstream Science in Intelligence In a posthumous article in 1996, Donald T. Campbell, a former president of the American Psychological Association, included his own analysis of the Wall Street Journal statement, previously drafted as a letter to that newspaper. Campbell first remarked that: He remarked that the rhetorical organization of points in the statement, inadvertently or deliberately, seemed to him to build up to the conclusion that the black-white racial gap had a genetic cause. He pointed out that already at point 5, no provision had been allowed for differences in educational opportunity. Later on in point 14, he judged that the statements  on heritability had been made without mentioning that it was based on twin studies, where environmental opportunities had been excluded as possible factors. In point 23, he pointed out that it was not possible to compare children of  black and white parents that were \"equally\" educated, because in these circumstances the opportunities in the quality of education, both before and at college, would differ. On point 25, Campbell remarked that Jensen had himself published policy recommendations concerning rote learning. As  reports in his discussion of the editorial, there is no general agreement about what is meant by intelligence. The editorial gave the following general definition of intelligence: describes intelligence in her own article in the same volume less broadly as \"the ability to deal with complexity.\"  However, the article by , one of the signatories of the statement, reviewed the numerous attempts in the academic literature to define what was meant by intelligence and found that there was no agreement. He cites experts as describing intelligence as \"the total intellectual repertoire of behavioral responses,\" \"some general property or quality ... of the brain,\" \"reaction-time and physiological measures,\" \"many different information-processing abilities\" and \"the rate with which learning occurs or the time required for learning.\"  in the same volume describe intelligence as what is measured by intelligence tests: \"What we mean by intelligence is general cognitive functioning (g) as assessed in the psychometric tradition of a general factor derived from a battery of diverse cognitive ability tests.\" gives a point-by-point analysis of the conclusions of the letter. He points out that the validity of tests is claimed as a property of the tests, rather than how or where they are used. He questioned the letter's claims about there being no cultural bias in IQ tests; and that intelligence was a key factor determining fitness in human evolution, something that he argued was inconsistent with the claims of heritability, if the geneticist's version of evolution was being used. Harrington argued that heritability is phylogenetic, not ontogenetic as the letter suggested. He pointed out that the use of the term \"race\" differed from the way geneticists classify population groups. Regarding the assertion that IQ research does not preclude or dictate any particular social policy, Harrington commented that the views of Charles Murray on social policy have been used by US Congressmen to argue for policy changes. The validity of the \"mainstream science\" described in the editorial was also questioned by , who argued that the signatories of the were attempting to revive the \"pseudo-scientific inquiry\" of biological determinism. In a 2001 article in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Ian J. Deary noted that The Wall Street Journal \"... is an odd place for such a document, and readers might view the signatories as one-sided, largely committed to the psychometrics-based intelligence research they were endorsing.\" analysed the editorial as one of five responses to The Bell Curve, a book which he viewed as \"an attempt to influence both psychological knowledge and U.S. politics\". He concluded that some of the responses, including the editorial, \"fell far short of providing a critical analysis of the book's racially biased argument and did little to reduce the misleading picture of race and IQ that the book promulgated.\" More specifically, Alderfer criticized the failure of the psychologists to recognize the effect of such a book on race relations in the US; as well as their failure to discuss the third and last part of the book on the implications for social policy.  He wrote that, \"Some psychologists said they wanted to keep themselves out of the emotional turmoil that had been generated by publication of the Bell Curve ... They might also have wanted to preserve the neutrality of psychology as a science. When examined in the contemporary racial context, however, their action was neither scientifically nor politically neutral. Essentially, they took a stand by not taking a stand. Their stand was not to become involved in how their expertise might be used to affect people's lives ...they missed an opportunity to caution their readers about regressive forces affecting U.S. race relations and to locate the book within that context. They did not fully use the authority based on their expertise to prevent harm.\" argued: With a few exceptions, the list of cosigners reads like a Who's Who of those theorists (e.g., Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr., John B. Carroll, Raymond B. Cattell, Hans Eysenck, Linda S. Gottfredson, Seymour W. Itzkoff, Arthur R. Jensen, Robert Plomin, J. Philippe Rushton and Vincent Sarich) who have continued Spearman's tradition of factor analyzing intelligence test scores to generate a theory of general intelligence \u2014 g \u2014 and some of whom (e.g., Thomas J. Bouchard, Robert Plomin) believe that behavior genetic research supports the conclusion that g is highly heritable, and others of whom (e.g., Arthur Jensen, J. Philippe Rushton, Seymour Itzkoff) have written highly emotionally charged articles arguing that the research supports the conclusion that group differences on intelligence tests reflect genetic differences. argued that the statement's claim that IQ tests were unbiased is not accepted by some prominent researchers in psychometrics who have pointed out the problems with using tests on population groups with a substantively different cultural background from those for whom the test was originally designed. Anthropologist Robert Wald Sussman criticized the statement in his 2014 book The Myth of Race, writing, \"In this letter, the members of the new bigot brigade claimed that since as many as fifty-two scientists signed this letter, the contents of the book [i.e. the Bell Curve] and of the letter must be true. Using this logic, since the vast majority of anthropologists and other social scientists and of geneticists do not agree with the conclusions of this volume, does that mean it must be false? Obviously not. However, it is the actual science that began with Boas and his colleagues and that has continued to this date that makes these authors\u2019 beliefs and approach untenable at any level.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center states that some of the editorial's signatories \"...had no relevant qualifications at all. Garrett Hardin, for example, was an ecologist and anti-immigration activist, while Vincent Sarich was an anthropologist who gained notoriety for making racist and homophobic claims in his undergraduate courses (he later admitted to The New York Times that these assertions were not based on established scientific facts).\" After citing Campbell's estimate that only 10 signatories were experts on the measurement of intelligence, the Center noted that \"...at least 20 [signatories] were recipients of money from the Pioneer Fund, including one director of the Fund, R. Travis Osborne, and two future presidents, J. Philippe Rushton and Richard Lynn.\" In a 2015 interview, behavior geneticist Robert Plomin was asked whether he regretted signing the statement.  He reiterated his support for the factual assertions in the letter, but rejected interpretations of that data in The Bell Curve:"

When it was founded in 1599 Shakespeare's own theatre, The Globe, may have used the motto  (All the world plays the actor), the Latin text of which is derived from a 12th-century treatise. Ultimately the words derive from  (because almost the whole world are actors) attributed to Petronius, a phrase which had wide circulation in England at the time. In his own earlier work, The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare also had one of his main characters, Antonio, comparing the world to a stage: In his work The Praise of Folly, first printed in 1511, Renaissance humanist Erasmus asks, \"For what else is the life of man but a kind of play in which men in various costumes perform until the director motions them off the stage.\""

The number of ages varied: three and four being the most common among ancient writers such as Aristotle. The concept of seven ages derives from medieval philosophy, which constructed groups of seven, as in the seven deadly sins, for theological reasons. The seven ages model dates from the 12th century. King Henry V had a tapestry illustrating the seven ages of man. According to T. W. Baldwin, Shakespeare's version of the concept of the ages of man is based primarily upon Pier Angelo Manzolli's  book Zodiacus Vitae, a school text he might have studied at the Stratford Grammar School, which also enumerates stages of human life. He also takes elements from Ovid and other sources known to him."

He wanted a science fiction mystery set in 2076, and Asimov agreed to write one.  Asimov's original title for the story was \"Death at the Tercentenary\", but when the story appeared he decided he liked Dannay's title better. The concept of a robot taking political office in the guise of a human was also the theme of Asimov's 1946 story, \"Evidence\".

        "content": "This story begins on 4 July 2076. The United States itself is no longer a sovereign country, but part of a Global Federation. The beginning of the story details the Tercentenary speech by the 57th president, Hugo Allen Winkler, who is described by Secret Service agent Lawrence Edwards as a \"vote-grabber, a promiser\" who has failed to get anything done during his first term in office. While moving through a crowd near the Washington Monument, the President suddenly disappears in a \"glitter of dust\". He reappears very shortly afterwards on a guarded stage and gives a stirring speech which is quite different from the kind he usually makes. Edwards is reminded of rumors of a robot double of the President existing as a security measure, and concludes that the double was assassinated. Two years after that occurrence, the now retired Edwards contacts the Presidents personal secretary, a man named Janek, convinced that it was not the robot double who had died at the Tercentenary, but the President himself, with the robot having then taken office. Edwards points to rumors of an experimental weapon, a disintegrator, and suggests this is the weapon used to assassinate Winkler, as not only does its effect mirror that seen at the Tercentenary, but also made examination of the corpse impossible. He goes on to argue that the robot duplicate, posing as the President, retrieved the disintegrator and arranged the assassination. Following the incident, the President has become much more effective, but as Edwards points out, he has also become more reclusive, even towards his own children. The robot, Edward claims, must have concluded that Winkler was too ineffectual to serve as President, and the death of one man was acceptable to save three billion, and this is what allowed it to circumvent the First Law of Robotics. Edwards implores Janek, as the Presidents closest confidante, to confirm his suspicions and convince the robot to resign, worrying about the precedent set by having a robot ruler. Following the meeting, Janek decides to have Edwards eliminated to keep him from going public with his findings, and the story ends with the revelation that Janek was the man behind the assassination of the President."

Edo Japan's samurai fight to defend Earth, but the sh\u014dgun cowardly surrenders when he realizes the aliens' power. He agrees to an unequal contract with the aliens, placing a ban on carrying swords in public and allowing the invaders to enter the country. The samurai's swords are confiscated and the Tokugawa bakufu (shogunate) becomes a puppet government. The series focuses on an eccentric samurai, Gintoki Sakata who works as an odd-jobs freelancer. He helps a teenager named Shinpachi Shimura save his sister Tae from an alien group that wants to send her to a brothel. Impressed by Gintoki, Shinpachi becomes his freelance apprentice to pay the bills and learn more about the enigmatic samurai. When the pair rescues a teenage alien girl with super-strength, Kagura, from a Yakuza group, they accept her into their freelancing business and the three become known as . While working, they regularly encounter the Shinsengumi police force, who often ally with Gintoki when work involves dangerous criminals. The trio also meets Gintoki's former comrades from the Amanto invasion, including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura who is friendly toward them despite his terrorist activities against the alien-controlled government. Although the story is mostly episodic, a few story arcs and recurring antagonists develop. For example, Gintoki's former comrade Shinsuke Takasugi is a major antagonist who regards Gintoki and his other former comrades as enemies and seeks to destroy the shogunate. Over time, Takasugi gains allies, including Kagura's brother Kamui, and the elite fighting unit Mimawarigumi to prepare for his large-scale coup d'\u00e9tat.

Various jokes from the manga are comments regarding clich\u00e9s from other sh\u014dnen series. For example, in the first chapter, after Gintoki fights a group of aliens to protect Shinpachi and Tae, Shinpachi complains that he only fought for \"one page\" and Gintoki replies, \"Shut up! One page is a long time for a manga artist!\" Gintoki's exaggerated desire to read the Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump (which causes him to fight other readers to get it) also makes fun of sh\u014dnen, since during those parts characters  quote them. Other types of comedic situations are more general so that the reader must know about Japanese culture  to understand them. The humor is described by publications as being \"bizarre\" and \"weird\". It is also described as being divided between two categories: \"sci-fi comedy\" and a \"samurai comedy\" with the former referring to the aliens. It  tends to point out \"an irritating foible about modern society\" including celebration days or famous mythical figures. Additionally, there are references to several historical figures with a few characters from the story being based on them. Besides the series' comedy, the aliens' invasion of Japan brings several social issues between them and the humans with the most recurring one being the lack of social equality. As a result, one of the main themes involves society trying to preserve their way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other sh\u014dnen series."

        "content": "In 2003, Hideaki Sorachi was an up-and-coming manga artist who had already created two one-shots for the Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump magazine. Although he was preparing to write his first serialized series, his editor suggested he create a manga series based on the Shinsengumi, mostly inspired by an upcoming TV drama about the 1860s troupe as depicted by idol actors. Sorachi attempted to create this series since he admitted to liking the Shinsengumi but ultimately failed to get anything off the ground. Instead of abandoning the idea completely, he remained focused on the historical Japanese era but began to create his own story, adding in elements of science fiction and fictionalizing many of the figures from the era to create a story more to his liking. The original title of the series was meant to be , but it did not have any impact on Sorachi. After a great debate, he decided to go with the name Gin Tama after discussing it with his family, deciding on a name that sounded close to the edge without being completely off it. Although Sorachi considered the one-shot \"Samuraider\" to be very poor, the setting of one-shot served as the base for Gin Tama such as the addition of alien characters. Sorachi liked the Bakumatsu and Sengoku periods due to how both were eras of change and thus presented the positive and negative points of humanity. The series was then set in an alternate Bakumatsu to give a bigger significance to the characters' bushido as in that time samurais were at the low point of their lives. Sorachi also cited the manga series Rurouni Kenshin (1994\u20131999), set during the Bakumatsu and Meiji periods, as a major source of inspiration. The main character of the series was originally meant to be Toshiro Hijikata as Sorachi was a fan of the Shinsengumi, most notably from Hijikata Toshiz\u014d (the Shinsengumi who was the base for the one of Gin Tama) after he saw the film Burn! Sword!. When Sorachi could not \"shake off\" Hijikata's initial design, he decided not to use him as the lead character but added him along with the Shinsengumi to the story. The pilot chapter from the series had a different plot to the one from the serialization: Shinpachi already met Gintoki in the story and there were more Shinsengumi to the story such as one based on Harada Sanosuke. As all these new Shinsengumi were older than most of the recurring characters  from the series, Sorachi removed them thinking they were not entertaining. When asked by a fan, Sorachi mentioned that most characters from the series are based on real-life Edo citizens while Gintoki's character is roughly based on the folk hero Sakata no Kintoki. When starting serialization the manga was unpopular and was close to being canceled. Although Sorachi was pleased with the first tank\u014dbon selling all of its copies, he later learned Shueisha was afraid of poor sales which resulted in the minimum printed. To increase its popularity, the author introduced new characters, the Shinsengumi, who felt memorable to his assistants.  Sorachi had little hope on the manga's popularity, as he noted that people used to tell him the manga would not surpass the number of two tank\u014dbon volumes. However, once the third volume was released, Sorachi found that he did not have \"any fresh material to use.\" During the first year of the series, Sorachi believed that the source of the popularity of Gin Tama was partially connected to the Shinsengumi drama. While the drama ran during the first year of the series, when the manga was mostly shorter stories that established the characters and the world, he felt uncomfortable making things related to the drama. By the second year and beyond, he became more daring in his stories and concepts, creating longer storylines that included more drama while keeping his sense of humor and satirization of modern Japan by way of his fictionalized past. Gin Tama's serialization ended on June 20, 2019. When working on a chapter of Gintama, Sorachi sometimes had problems finishing the manuscript, leaving his supervisor to take it before he can revise it. He figured out what to write by staying in his room or going for a walk. Although he commented that some of his ideas are \"random,\" he focused on the fact that they are all related to the manga, and when he had problems coming up with ideas, Sorachi was often helped by his editor. Thinking of Gin Tama as a \"non-sense manga,\" before writing a chapter, Sorachi decided whether it should be a comedy or a drama. Sorachi defined Gin Tama as a \"science fiction human drama pseudo-historical comedy.\" When Sorachi illustrated Gin Tama, he usually used a felt-tip pen, a fountain pen, a brush-tip pen, and a multiliner, but for the major characters, he only used a felt-tip pen and a fountain pen and did their outlines with a multiliner-0.8."

In a poll from Zassosha's Puff Japanese manga magazine, Gin Tama was second in the category \"Best Long Stories\".

Critical response to the Gin Tama manga has generally been positive when it comes to gags. Carlo Santos from Anime News Network found the manga to be a \"one-of-a-kind comedy\" praising the characters' personalities and gags. On the other hand, the artwork was criticized for being \"hard to follow\" when there are fast scenes. Jokes regarding clich\u00e9s from other sh\u014dnen series were also positively received by About.com writer Deb Aoki, who, like Santos, found the artwork to be \"the only thing that distracts from the otherwise considerable pleasures of this loveable, goofy manga\". However, characters' designs were praised for their variations including the ones from the aliens appearing in the series by Katherine Dacey from Pop Culture Shock who remarked that \"These characters add visual interest and life to every panel, keeping the reader invested when the stories stall.\" Other negative comments regarding the manga have the few numbers of aliens appearing in the series as well as how some chapters are focused on fights such as Hijikata's fight against Gintoki. Michael Aronson from Manga Life concluded his review of the manga by saying that \"The potential is there, but the execution is struggling\" as still, he liked the comedy from the story. Comics Village's Alex Hoffman mentioned that Gin Tama \"can't truly be compared to those comics because of one thing: the jokes.\" He found the context from the series hilarious and like how there are new jokes in every chapter. Like other reviewers, Hoffman also disliked Sorachi's artwork, but still found the manga to be \"a great comedy, or a great read.\" Comic Book Bin writer Leroy Douresseaux found that the large number of characters with different appearances in the series allows the reader to remain entertained with the series as \"at least every few pages or so present some unusual and interesting visual.\" Anime News Network criticized its constant amount of penis jokes as well as the narrative's style which might bother readers. The ending of the series was criticized as for its messy storytelling where multiple plots are explained but not all are solved as the title instead focuses on telling multiple jokes from different point of views. Anime News Network praised the ending's gags but lamented how several of the subplot of the series were not properly closed as a result of using several characters. IGN was more positive, comparing the narrative to two other popular shonen manga series Naruto and Jujutsu Kaisen for how Gintoki and his friends deal with the Shoyo and Utsuro in their final fights \"distilling a major conflict into a massive good-versus-evil showdown helps it to become interesting even for those who aren't as up to date on the saga as others\"- Crunchyroll felt the animation felt more a Dragon Ball film rather than Gintama as a result of Toei working on it but still praised for retaining a humor and style reminiscent of the comedy Konosuba. Yahoo panned the movie for being too difficult to follow unless the audience has knowledge about previous Gintama events and found some jokes did not feel appealing. Nevertheless, he praised fight scenes which would appeal to the fans of samurai series Rurouni Kenshin and Afro Samurai. The anime adaptation of Gin Tama has received positive and mixed responses. The humor was noted to be improved after the series' introduction although some jokes were hard to understand because some of them are references to Japanese culture and other series. The notes on the DVD releases were criticized for lacking an explanation of cultural jokes. Additionally, the humor's quality was found to be inconsistent within the first episodes due to the depth some bring, to the point that some viewers may abandon the series. The quality of the series was found to improve as the series continues as people would not be intimidated by its large number of episodes. The characters' actions were praised due to their knowledge that their tendencies to \"break the fourth wall\", while the female characters were found appealing based on their unusual qualities. The series has been noted for its ability to shift between comedy and drama without a loss of quality.

They are soon joined by a young American naval cadet, who boasts about the reliability of his cigarette lighter. Carlos offers to bet his Cadillac against the American's left little finger that the American cannot ignite the lighter ten times in a row. The American accepts, with the narrator agreeing to act as referee and hold the car key, and they adjourn to Carlos' room. After Carlos has a maid bring in the necessary supplies, he ties the American's left wrist to the table and the challenge begins. After the eighth successful strike, a woman bursts into the room and forces Carlos to drop the knife he has held ready to sever the American's finger. She explains that Carlos is mentally disturbed, having played this game so often in their home country that they had to flee in order to keep the authorities from committing him to a psychiatric hospital. He has taken 47 fingers and lost 11 cars, but no longer has anything of his own to bet with; she won it all from him long ago, including the car he claimed to own. As the narrator offers the key to her, she reaches out to take it with a hand that has only its thumb and one finger still attached."

        "content": "This short story was filmed as a 1960 episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents titled \"Man from the South\", with a teleplay by William Fay and directed by Norman Lloyd.  The episode stars Steve McQueen as the reluctant young gambler, Peter Lorre as Carlos, the man who bets his car, and Neile Adams (McQueen's real-life wife) as a ravishing young woman McQueen's character meets. The story takes place in Las Vegas, Nevada. The car itself is merely described as a convertible. Although the mysterious woman who abruptly storms in is wearing gloves, her index, middle, and ring fingers are missing. In this adaptation, as part of the dramatic denouement after the woman appears and effectively aborts the bet, the gambler (McQueen) tries to relieve the stress of the young woman (Adams) by lighting her cigarette.  The lighter fails to start when flicked for this, a sly indicator of how narrowly the gambler avoided losing the bet."

In 1949, the Dahl story was adapted by June Thomson for an episode of Radio City Playhouse. The adaptation, titled \"Collector's Item\", split the 30 minute run time with an adaptation of a Ray Bradbury story, titled \"The Lake\". Shortly after meeting in the bar, Carlos offers the gambler his green 1948 Cadillac parked outside. Due to the tastes of the time, some of the more grisly details were omitted from the presentation. The independent observer (the \"referee\") character realizes the female is a victim of the gambler, but we do not learn the exact details of the gambler's previous bets. The scene is also parodied in an episode of American Dad!, \"Stan's Night Out\". Stan Smith wagers his life and the lives of three men against starting a lawn mower ten times, believing he would be able to do it as he had seen a television show which instructed him how to start a lawn mower \"the first time, every time\".

The music video is about two lovers, played by Colton Haynes and Cassandra Church, in a strange abstract world, and the video seems to tell the story of how their love quickly withers away until one leaves the other alone. Towards the end of the video, one of the band's amplifiers explodes along with two of the guitars. On March 7, 2007, the band exclusively premiered the video on their YouTube channel, and on their Myspace. The video is in a black and white format, most likely to simulate more contrast between the two lovers. There were also reports by one observers of Gerard wearing a wedding band (as can be seen in the video), which Gerard was asked about in an interview with 97X, where he mentioned that he had 'found someone very special'. The video appeared on Kerrang! TV in the UK on March 9, 2007, and on Channel 4 in the UK on March 8, 2007.

Over the centuries, the creature lives amongst humans and mentally influences certain of them to advance the development of civilization. In particular, it works on scientists and eventually it causes the development of space travel.  As the first spaceship to attempt to reach the moon is being built, the creature, now known as Kane, causes the creation of a small space in the ship, which he enters, unknown to the builders. The ship leaves Earth and at the appropriate point, Kane departs from the ship and, now fully developed, travels unaided to its home planet. The author draws an analogy between Kane and a bee that visits and thereby pollinates flowers at random, with no real knowledge of what it has done."

After realizing Kane is always around when he has these moments of insight, Hammer confronts Kane and learns of Kane's 8,000 year history of \"assisting\" scientists and inventors to make historic breakthroughs \u2013 all apparently to advance humanity's effort into exploring space. Unexpectedly, Kane himself does not have any understanding of how or why he has been doing this, nor familiarity with the scientific breakthroughs he's inspired. Kane feels compelled to enter the special man-sized room Dr. Hammer had inadvertently designed in the rocket just before launch, and once arriving in open space, transforms into his adult alien form."

Jupiter V is discovered to be a spherical metal vehicle with a diameter of 30 kilometers.  It contains an art gallery with millions of exhibits.  One of the art objects is a depiction of a member of Culture X, which Forster dubs \"The Ambassador\". It becomes clear that \"The Ambassador\" was intended explicitly for Mankind. Culture X predicted that intelligent life would develop on Earth and eventually achieve space flight; the statue is a message of greeting and goodwill spanning the gulf of time between its creators' ancient extinction and the arrival of the space travelers from Earth. A science writer, Randolph Mays, arrives with his pilot and his secretary. Forster takes advantage of a loophole in space law and claims salvage rights to Jupiter V in the name of the World Science Organization.

The first version of the poem not in draft form was included as the third part of a poem collection called \u201cWhispers of Heavenly Death,\u201d published in The Broadway. A London Magazine in 1868. This first publication did not specify \u201cA Noiseless Patient Spider\u201d as an independent poem. Its second appearance, in Whitman\u2019s Passage to India (1871), makes this distinction, evidenced by the use of \"lower-case capitals\" in printing the first word (of more than one letter), which was a publishing convention used in the 19th century to designate the beginning of a poem. The only other changes made between the first two publications are several line indentations, the numbering of the stanzas, and the removal of a comma after \u201cnoiseless.\u201d In 1891, the poem was published again in Leaves of Grass, with new indentation, eleven dropped commas, and the substitution of all dashes and semicolons for commas.

Whitman's poem in turn inspired other poets. The work of Iranian poet Parvin E'tesami suggests such an influence. Her poem \"God's Weaver\" features a spider protagonist and deals with the theme of isolation, which is prevalent in Whitman's \"A Noiseless Patient Spider.\" \"A Noiseless Patient Spider\" has influenced musical compositions. Ingolf Dahl, a German-American composer, developed a three part women's chorus with piano accompaniment, using the poem \"A Noiseless Patient Spider\" as lyrics. Composer and conductor Kenneth Fuchs composed \"Whispers of Heavenly Death: String Quartet No. 3 After Poems by Walt Whitman.\" This instrumental interpretation was performed by the American String Quartet in Ann Arbor, Michigan on February 7, 1999."

As her body shrinks, she gets to know the few people that hover around the island (Vermillion Key is mostly devoid of tourists). The only person Emily visits is Deke Hollis, an old friend of her father who runs the drawbridge on the island. During a chance meeting, Hollis tells Emily that Jim Pickering, a man who own an estate on the island, is back. He has brought along a \"niece\"\u2014Hollis's polite name for the young women who Pickering lures to his home. Emily prepares to continue, but Hollis warns her that Pickering is \"not a very nice man.\" As Emily continues her daily run, she notices a shiny red car outside a house along the beach that she deduces belongs to Pickering. When Emily approaches the car and discovers a woman whose throat has been slashed, she is knocked unconscious. She wakes up to find herself inside Pickering's house and bound to a kitchen chair with duct tape. Emily realizes that Pickering is insane, and hints that she let someone know where she was going. When Pickering presses her for details, Emily blurts out Hollis's name; Pickering leaves, presumably to murder the old man. Emily knows that she does not have much time, and hears her father's voice in her head, giving her advice. She uses her strong legs to splinter the duct tape and free her lower body. She looks for a knife to release her arms, but settles on the corner of the island in the middle of the kitchen. Now freed, Emily attacks Pickering when he returns. After temporarily knocking him out, Emily escapes from his house and makes it to the beach. She hears Pickering behind her and realizes, in a rather odd coincidence, that she has been \"training\" for this moment. Though exhausted from her imprisonment, Emily's months of running serve her well. She keeps well ahead of Pickering, who has armed himself with a pair of scissors. Emily encounters a young Latino man on the beach and begs for help, but he doesn't understand her cries. Pickering appears and tries to use Spanish to convince the man that Emily is with him, but Emily's fearful expression convinces the young man otherwise. Enraged, Pickering brutally slaughters the man with his scissors. Emily, tiring quickly, runs into the ocean. Pickering follows her, but begins to flounder. Emily gasps as she figures out what is happening\u2014Pickering cannot swim. Emily manages to escape him, and sits on the shoreline to watch as Pickering drowns. When he finally goes under, Emily tells herself that a shark or some other creature attacked him. She wonders why, and guesses that it is a part of the human condition. Her long ordeal over, Emily stands and shouts at the birds flying about, and prepares to go home."

        "content": "Tsukune Aono is an average teenager who is unable to get into any local high schools due to his poor grades. As a last-ditch effort to secure his education, his parents enroll him in a private school called Yokai Academy, which he discovers is a boarding school for monsters. The school teaches monsters how to coexist with humans, including disguising them as them, but any real humans found on campus are to be killed. Although he fears for his life, Tsukune befriends a beautiful vampire girl named Moka Akashiya, who enjoys his company and especially the taste of his blood. During a fight with a school bully, Tsukune accidentally removes the rosario around Moka's neck and discovers that she transforms into a powerful vampire with a completely different personality. Because of Moka, Tsukune decides to stay at Yokai. He befriends formerly antagonistic students, including a succubus Kurumu Kurono and a child prodigy witch Yukari Sendo. They join the school's Newspaper Club and wind up fighting a variety of students and teachers, who use their monstrous powers to bully or to control one or more of the members for their own selfish or destructive ends. On a club trip to the human world, they meet a witch, Ruby Tojo, who defends a field of sunflowers from being torn down by developers. They meet Mizore Shirayuki, a snow fairy student who becomes Tsukune's \"stalker\". A group of \"Monstrels\" harass the club. Ruby, having recovered from injuries, joins the school's staff as the Headmaster's assistant. An evil group called the Anti-Schoolers threaten to break down the barrier between the human and monster worlds. When Tsukune's cousin manages to sneak onto the school grounds, the club has a hard time keeping the monster school a secret. When the school is temporarily closed because of damage, Tsukune returns home to the human world only to have Moka, Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore follow him and hide in his room. In Rosario+Vampire: Season II, Moka's younger half-sister Koko Shuzen enrolls. She, Ruby, and Mizore join the Newspaper Club. On an excursion to Mizore's homeland, they learn of a dangerous organization called Fairy Tale, which seeks to destroy the human world. The Newspaper Club visits the human world where they meet San Otonashi, a former club member, and run into trouble with adversaries from Fairy Tale's 7th Branch office. Chinese transfer student Fangfang Huang tries to recruit Tsukune to join his mafia family. When Moka spends a school day as her inner personality, she is unable to return to the seal, so the Newspaper Club heads to China to get her Rosario fixed. In Hong Kong, Tsukune and the gang learn the truth about Moka's identity: she was infused with First Ancestor blood by her mother Akasha Bloodriver, who sacrificed herself to protect them from Alucard, the original First Ancestor vampire. Moka's eldest half-sister Aqua infiltrates the Huang manor and captures Moka to bring to Fairy Tale, which suspects that Moka is the key to reviving Alucard. While his friends train their powers, Tsukune has his body altered by Tohofuhai to handle the upcoming challenges. Tsukune and the gang infiltrate the Hanging Garden: a sky fortress that serves as Fairy Tale's headquarters. They face opposition from their leader and matriarch of the Shuzen family Gyokuro Shuzen, who sends the leaders of the Fairy Tale Branches after them for a series of fights. The group eventually reaches Moka, but must face her half-sisters Aqua and Kalua. Gyokuro snatches Moka's rosario in order to control Alucard. A character called the Masked King reveals himself to be a clone of Alucard's original vampire form. He reveals that he has manipulated both Fairy Tale and its opposition to determine whether the rosario could control him, and then merges with his monster self, who goes on a rampage in Tokyo. Moka is mortally wounded, but Tsukune revives her by removing all his holy locks and transforming himself into a First Ancestor vampire. They beat down Alucard, but he revives and reveals that he has hatched eggs in Japan's major cities. Tsukune's friends and allies, along with the two other Dark Lords, band together to fight Alucard and his clones. Tsukune puts Moka's rosario on Alucard, which awakens Akasha inside his monster body. Akasha tells Alucard to give up the fight, and they cast a self-disintegration spell. Now that the existence of monsters is known in the human world, coexistence is now even harder to achieve; however, Tsukune is confident that he and his friends can do it."

Season II Volume 8 reached number 5 on BookScan and was the top manga in April 2012 Season II Volume 11 ranked number 10, and Season II Volume 12 reached number 3. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network gave the first volume of Season II a C rating and the second volume a B\u2212 rating. When he gave volume 1 a C, he stated that \"you could do a lot worse\". He felt that Season II has all the things that made the series good, but the attempt to reboot the series for the new semester caused it to lack intense feeling, reintroducing all the characters and going against weak enemies once again. For the second volume, Santos was more pleased with the introduction of a major villain and the fanservice artwork in the lighter story, but lamented the lack of any visually threatening monster. Matthew Warner of Mania.com gave volumes 1 through 3 of Season II ratings between B+ and A\u2212. In his review for volume 1, he felt the first part was a bit weak with \"predictable and bland stories,\" but remarked positively on the volume's cover art and artwork in general, especially the character artwork. For the second volume, he said it was better focusing on two stories and while noting the second story with Kokoa was weaker, it still delivers \"quite a few solid laughs\" and helps develop her character. In his review for volume 3, he stated while it starts out slow, he really enjoyed the story with Mizore, specifically the character development and seeing the characters put aside their disagreements for a common goal: to save Mizore. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin gave volumes of Season II an A\u2212 rating.  He opined the emphases on sexual innuendo, comparing it to Strawberry 100%, and that the series is like The Addams Family mixed with X-Men: \"cool, creepy folks at a secret school where they can live and learn in a place free of the prejudice against them.\" In volume 11, he changed his overall view and deemed it solidly a battle manga.

Wehling Jr. is faced with the situation that his wife is about to give birth to triplets, but he has found only one person, his maternal grandfather, who will volunteer to die. A painter on a stepladder is redecorating the room with a mural depicting employees who work at the Hospital, including Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital's Chief Obstetrician. Leora Duncan, from the Service Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, arrives to pose for the mural. It is a picture of a garden that is well taken care of, and a metaphor for the United States at the time. Later, Dr. Hitz enters the scene and converses with everyone but the painter of the mural. It becomes apparent to all that Wehling is in a state of despair since he does not want to send his grandfather and two of his children to death.

        "content": "\"Borges and I\" (originally in Spanish \"Borges y Yo\") is a short story by the Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges. It is one of the stories in the short story collection, The Maker (originally in Spanish El Hacedor), first published in 1960. The story \"Borges and I\" is about how Borges does not see himself as a writer. It shows the difference between persona and self. Borges persona is that he is the writer of multiple stories, but he hardly sees himself in the story. He is well known for his famous works in literature, but that is not who he is. He claims in the story that Borges wrote those stories, not him. He credits Borges for putting in the work to write the short story. He tries to fight these claims but he always loses to Borges. Everything he tries to do apart from Borges ends up being tied to Borges."

The family traveled widely in Europe, including stays in Spain. On his return to Argentina in 1921, Borges began publishing his poems and essays in surrealist literary journals. He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer. In 1955 he was appointed director of the National Public Library (Biblioteca Nacional) and professor of Literature at the University of Buenos Aires."

        "content": "Borges' story raises many philosophical questions of Self and epistemology. Viewed through the analytic lens of Russell's knowledge by description, the story explores the interesting concept of knowledge of Self by description (as opposed to the more expected knowledge by acquaintance). This is emphasized by the mention of receiving Borges' mail and reading about Borges in a book. Also, the distinction between persona and Self can be interpreted as a distinction between author and writer. The author would be analogous to the persona and Borges. The writer would be the Self and \"I\". Theoretically, the writer could be anyone, it just happens to be Borges. With this interpretation Borges is seen to be commenting on the cognitive differences between processing third person information and first person information."

        "content": "In 1968, while Shueisha was getting prepared to launch its first manga publication, Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, in order to compete with other magazines from rival companies (like Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine from Kodansha and Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday from Shogakukan), Nagai was invited to be one of the first manga artists publishing in the new magazine. He contemplated this, since he had to design a long-running series instead of the autoconclusive short stories that he had been developing until that point. He accepted, and the series became Nagai's first big success when Sh\u014dnen Jump sold more than one million copies. With Harenchi Gakuen, Nagai became the originator of ecchi manga, opened the door for a series of taboo-shattering gag comics, and also became the symbol of an entire generation. This work has influenced the world of manga, effecting both social mores and what was considered appropriate for manga. Harenchi Gakuen started with the idea of making a manga around a school. Nagai liked the word \"Harenchi\" (scandal), which was used commonly to advertise adult movies. For him, scandal and school were like oil and water, and he thought that mixing them would be funny. At first, Nagai did not have an idea of what stories to develop, but his assistant at the time was boasting about how he had peeped on the girls during their physical examinations from a hole in the roof of his school; this idea was developed into the plot of the manga. Originally, open erotic references did not appear in Harenchi Gakuen. The first physical examination scenes only showed from the shoulders up, but there were a lot of girls drawn, and their images became popular. The editor asked Nagai to go further, which Nagai was eager to do. The inspiration for Harenchi Gakuen came from the West. Nagai liked foreign movies and used to read Playboy magazine and other erotic magazines when he was a child. For the depiction of breasts, he took particular inspiration from the Venus de Milo. According to Nagai, what he in fact drew was not about eroticism per se, but about Japan's culture of shame. He wanted embarrassment to be the eroticism of the stories."

        "content": "Harenchi Gakuen was criticized as vulgar because it introduced overt eroticism to children. Male students and teachers were depicted as being preoccupied with catching glimpses of girls' panties or naked bodies. Many parents, women's associations, and PTAs protested. In particular, the PTA protests over Harenchi Gakuen were notorious. Nagai was bombarded with interview requests from newspapers, magazines and TV. Whenever he flew outside of Tokyo, TV cameras were waiting for him. He was branded a \"nuisance\" and even an \"enemy of society\". He, however, had a clear sense of what things he could or could not do with the manga. At first, Nagai did not think that the opposition was against him, since he was aware of the standards that applied with movies and similar things for an audience below 18 years old. At that time, he never drew sex scenes, avoided pictures of genitals and made nudes cute rather than sexy, though the manga regularly showed male genitals throughout its run, including a castration scene. His fans supported him throughout the PTA protests. They sent him letters where they expressed how they were aware that the adults cracking down on them were reading raunchier stuff than what Nagai was producing. The PTA managed to prevent the distribution of the magazine in some parts of Japan. As a result of the protests, when the series was about to be cancelled because of the PTA, Nagai changed the theme in Harenchi Gakuen into a more mature and serious matter, from nonsense gags with sexy touches, to a full-scale war where murder was depicted in the bloody way for which many know him. This led to the famous ending of Harenchi Gakuen, symbol of freedom and of rejection of the hypocrisy, where all students and teachers, while defending their freedom of expression, are killed by the PTA and other parental forces. This was the ironic answer that Nagai gave to the PTA. (In the end, this was not the actual ending of Harenchi Gakuen, as the title would subsequently return to publication for several years.) The protests were not only against the manga, but also against the TV series, which was also extremely popular and remains one of TV Tokyo's highest-rated programs ever with ratings as high as 32% at its peak."

The series was adapted into a 35-episode anime television series by Toei Animation that aired on Fuji Television from May 1983 to January 1984. The story focuses on K\u014dsaku Sakamoto, a high school student who goes to live with yakuza boss Ibari \u014czora and his four children\u2014Tsugumi, Tsubame, Hibari and Suzume\u2014after the death of his mother. K\u014dsaku is shocked to learn that Hibari, who looks and behaves as a girl, was assigned male at birth. Eguchi wanted to create a romantic comedy manga where the main female character is a cross-dressing boy so as to poke fun at the genre. He took more time to draw the chapters compared to his earlier manga, and as the serialization continued, he found it increasingly difficult to keep up a weekly pace for the chapters. He eventually abandoned the series after the editor-in-chief of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump refused his request to release the chapters every other week. From July 2009 to February 2010, Shogakukan published a three-volume Stop!! Hibari-kun! Complete Edition omnibus collection, which features various revisions to the originally published chapters in addition to newly drawn cover art. Stop!! Hibari-kun! has been described as achieving a dizzying reality with Hibari by contrasting a girlish exterior with a male interior. The series has been praised for its overall light and pop literary style, and the delicate touch in how Hibari is drawn has been described as so attractive that it makes the reader forget that it is a gag manga. However, the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters have been criticized as extreme and no longer humorous in modern times. The series has also been described as having had a hand in paving the way for the J-pop phenomenon."

K\u014dsaku is attracted to Hibari from the start, but he is shocked to learn that Hibari, who looks and behaves as a girl, was assigned male at birth\u2014something only known within the \u014czora Group and Hibari's family. A group of four girls led by Kaori Hanazono begin to suspect that Hibari may be transgender, but Tsubame takes Hibari's place during a health checkup, effectively quelling any suspicions. Hibari begins to show an immediate interest in K\u014dsaku, so in an effort to distance himself from Hibari, K\u014dsaku joins the Wakaba Academy boxing club. Also in the club is Makoto Shiina, who is attracted to Hibari, and Rie Kawai, the club manager who K\u014dsaku likes. Hibari soon joins the club as its second manager shortly before they go on a training camp in Kuj\u016bkuri at the end of the year. At the start of the new school year, Hibari is scouted to join the girls' volleyball team after the captain, Jun \u014ctori, witnesses Hibari's athletic prowess. Although Hibari refuses, Jun continues to pursue Hibari until Jun is overwhelmed by Hibari's superhuman ability to spike the ball. After Kaori and her friends try to embarrass Hibari during swim class, they once again suspect that Hibari may be a guy, but Hibari prevents them from getting any proof during the school sponsored summer camp. After Hibari refuses several advances from a popular guy at school named Takuto Honda, Hibari starts openly flirting with K\u014dsaku at school. Shiina becomes enraged at K\u014dsaku for earning Hibari's affection, but Shiina and K\u014dsaku grow closer as friends after they fight it out and K\u014dsaku reassures him that there is nothing going on between him and Hibari. When K\u014dsaku is out jogging one day, he helps out a girl named Sayuri K\u014denji who was being harassed by three guys from the Kokury\u016b High School boxing club, although Hibari deals with them before K\u014dsaku can do anything. Despite this, Sayuri is instantly enamored by K\u014dsaku and hires a detective to find out more about him, leading her to discover Hibari's secret. Hibari has another run-in with the Kokury\u016b boxing club members after they harass Tsubame at a festival. The Kokury\u016b boxing club challenges the Wakaba boxing club to some inter-school matches, but this turns out to be a ruse to get a chance to gang up on Hibari. However, the \u014czora Group intercedes, allowing Hibari to knock out the Kokury\u016b boxing club's leader. Sayuri transfers into K\u014dsaku's class, and she blackmails him into going on a date with her in exchange for not revealing Hibari's secret. During the school festival, K\u014dsaku's class acts out a Sleeping Beauty play with K\u014dsaku as the prince and Hibari as the princess, culminating in Hibari giving K\u014dsaku a French kiss on stage. Ibari agrees to look after Gekijir\u014d Taiga, the son of one of his close friends, who K\u014dsaku is surprised to learn is a trans man."

        "content": "Stop!! Hibari-kun! is written and illustrated by Hisashi Eguchi. Following the conclusion of his manga  in 1981, Eguchi wanted to go against the notion at the time that there was currently a golden age of romantic comedy manga in sh\u014dnen manga magazines. In response, Eguchi thought of creating a romantic comedy manga where the main female character is a cross-dressing boy, and in doing so, poke fun at the genre by developing it as the antithesis of a romantic comedy. Eguchi drew up the storyboard for the first chapter in about 30 minutes in a cafe, and came up with the title Stop!! Hibari-kun! as a reference to Hisashi Sekiya's manga . In wanting to highlight the comedy of having a character like Hibari, Eguchi realized that the cuter he could draw Hibari, the more effective the jokes would be, so he tried to draw Hibari as cute as he could. Eguchi had often rushed when drawing his earlier manga , but starting with Stop!! Hibari-kun!, he raised the standards he held for his art and began taking more time to draw the chapters. In addition, Eguchi was very particular about the appearance of his manuscripts, so he never used white-out to correct any drawing errors because he disliked how it looked. As the serialization continued, Eguchi found it increasingly difficult to keep up a weekly pace for the chapters, leading him to take frequent hiatuses and later say that \"drawing weekly isn't something humans can do.\" Furthermore, the editor-in-chief of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump at the time, Shigeo Nishimura, refused his request to release the chapters every other week. When it came time to draw what would end up being the last serialized chapter, Eguchi completed the chapter's storyboard, but ultimately submitted only about two-thirds of the chapter, leaving out the last five pages. After he submitted the chapter's manuscript, Eguchi fled to a hotel and secluded himself for a day, only coming out after Nishimura called him to say that he could not deal with him anymore on a weekly basis. As a result, Eguchi abandoned the serialization and the editorial department decided to discontinue the series. Stop!! Hibari-kun! was serialized in the manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from the October 19, 1981 issue to the November 28, 1983 issue. The individual chapters were collected and published in four tank\u014dbon volumes by Shueisha from November 1982 to January 1984. Inspired by Katsuhiro Otomo, Eguchi fought against the established design format for the volumes that at the time was \"set in stone\" for series serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump. Futabasha later published it in three volumes in July 1991, and again in two volumes in February 1995. Shueisha republished it in four volumes from May to June 2001. Home-sha published it in two volumes in January 2004. In an interview in 2007, Eguchi expressed a desire to continue some of his older series, but stated that a continuation of Stop!! Hibari-kun! would be difficult. Starting in 2009, Eguchi began working with Shogakukan on releasing a Stop!! Hibari-kun! Complete Edition omnibus collection, which features various revisions to the originally published chapters in addition to newly drawn cover art. Not wanting to end the Complete Edition with an abrupt conclusion like he had done before, Eguchi found the storyboard for the final chapter and used it as a basis to newly draw the last five pages he had omitted 27 years earlier. Shogakukan published the Complete Edition in three volumes from July 2009 to February 2010; Shogakukan later republished the series in another three volumes from May to July 2012. In 2010, Eguchi did not rule out the possibility of someday drawing a continuation of the series, but he said it probably would not be a story under the title Stop!! Hibari-kun!."

        "content": "Psychologist Tamaki Sait\u014d described Stop!! Hibari-kun! as achieving a \"dizzying reality\" with Hibari \"by contrasting a girlish exterior with a male interior\", and went on to say that the series could be seen as a \"continuation of the sartorial perversion lineage\" of cross-dressing characters. Manga critic Haruyuki Nakano has called Stop!! Hibari-kun! a unique and outstanding gag manga for its juxtaposition of Hibari being a boy and the heir to a yakuza organization. Nakano largely attributes this successful combination to Eguchi's ability to draw girls that are not only cute, but also have good taste and sex appeal. The delicate touch in how Hibari is drawn has been described as so attractive that it makes the reader forget that it is a gag manga. In writing for the magazine Cyzo, manga critic Jyamao wrote that because of its overall light and pop literary style, none of the indecency or immorality cross-dressing may engender comes through, which he surmises is why the anime was able to air during prime time. Jyamao notes the more extreme nature of the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters in comparison to the jokes involving cross-dressing, and that some jokes such as those involving drugs would not be humorous today. Manga commentator Nobunaga Minami lauded Eguchi for being a pioneer in drawing characters with a high fashion sense in Stop!! Hibari-kun!, which he says effectively changed fashion in sh\u014dnen manga from being seen as a \"symbol\" to now being treated as an \"accessory\". Eguchi's attention to detail is also praised, such as drawing K\u014dsaku wearing Chuck Taylor All-Stars in one chapter. The series has been described as \"effervescent,\" and as helping pave the way for the J-pop phenomenon. When Tegami Bachi author Hiroyuki Asada read Stop!! Hibari-kun! in junior high school, he admired its novel sensibility, and Eguchi's art also influenced him. According to Eguchi, some people who read Stop!! Hibari-kun! were influenced to start cross-dressing."

        "content": "Article 8 clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches, but the Court has given the protection for \"private and family life\" that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article 8 sometimes comprises positive obligations: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a State from interfering with rights, and thus not to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the State to become active, and to do something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced father to his child). Golder v. United Kingdom (1975) 1 EHRR 524 \u2013 A prisoner requested a lawyer because he said he wanted to sue a guard for defamation. Access was denied.

Mosley v News Group Newspapers [2008] EWHC 1777 (QB) \u2014 Per Eady J, equitable breach of confidence is extended to protect Art. 8 rights.

Zakharov v.

The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's Application [2015] NIQB 96 \u2013 Northern Ireland's criminalization of abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, rape or incest declared incompatible with Article 8 Aycaguer v. France (2017) -- ECHR found France's use of biological sampling for criminal DNA databases to be a violation of Article 8 in the case of Jean-Michel Aycaguer, a french national convicted of non-violent crime. Importantly, the court did not find the entire practice to be in violation, but claimed that the seriousness of Aycaguer's crimes did not constitute a situation wherein public interest outweighed his right to privacy in his private life. The notion of private life in the Article 8 is also interpreted as including some duty of environmental protection."

They take an interest in a number of crimes, especially the series of London society robberies. Raffles and Bunny are invited to join them dinner at the house of club president Lord Thornaby, ostensibly to discuss the potential of crime in sport (such as gambling and throwing matches), as Raffles is a well-known cricketer. However, on the night of the dinner, Bunny overhears the whispers of two members, and discovers that the club in fact suspect Raffles to be a gentleman thief. In the house, Raffles is too occupied in conversation for Bunny to warn him. At dinner, Raffles and the four men, including a Wild West novelist and a barrister who has sentenced criminals to death, amiably discuss convicted murderers and burglars. Eventually, Lord Thornaby mentions their belief that the same thief committed the burglary on Bond Street and the robbery of Lady Melrose's necklace. Raffles glibly replies that he has connections to the victims of both, and is impressed by the unknown criminal. The group jokes that the criminal might be in the house, and Lord Thornaby, anxious, sends his butler to check the house. The butler returns, and stutters that the bedroom door and dressing-room door are, disturbingly, locked from inside. All the men rush upstairs to investigate. The doors are jammed with wedges screwed with gimlets. Lord Thornaby asks his butler to fetch an emergency rope-ladder, and the novelist bravely climbs down and opens the dressing-room door. The room has been picked and ransacked. Lord Thornaby's parliamentary robes are gone. The men leave the scene to the police, and go to the house's library. The police find a broken clock, which signals that the time of the robbery was during dinner. Raffles is cleanly absolved of all suspicion. Afterwards, Bunny takes Raffles to his rooms to tell him the truth of the Criminologists' suspicions, only to learn that Raffles had known about them along. In fact, it was Raffles who had committed the burglary of Lord Thornaby's house, the previous night, using a rope-ladder and telescope walking-stick. He had also sneaked in quickly a second time, before dinner, to fake disorder and the broken clock. He had been visiting Bunny's rooms often to use them to spy on the house and prepare his plan. Later, Raffles returns the parliamentary robes to Lord Thornaby anonymously."

In the drama, the robbery of Bunny's bank is also ascribed by the criminologists to the infamous society burglar, in addition to the incidents on Bond Street and at Milchester. In the drama, Raffles pretends to get drunk, while actually tossing his champagne into a potted plant. In the original story, Raffles merely limits his intake of champagne.

        "content": "\"Mulga Bill's Bicycle\" is a poem written in 1896 by Banjo Paterson. It was originally published on the 25th of July 1896 edition of the Sydney Mail, and later appeared in the poet's second poetry collection Rio Grande's Last Race and Other Verses. The poem is a ballad. Each line is a fourteener, having fourteen syllables and seven iambic feet. It tells the tragic tale of Mulga Bill, a man whose pride in his riding skill causes him to purchase, ride and crash a bicycle. Although Mulga Bill claims expertise in riding all things his ineptitude and subsequent accident suggest that he may only know how to ride a horse. The poem was first published in The Sydney Mail on 25 July 1896 and was illustrated by Norman Hardy. It is amongst Paterson's most popular works.  A 1973 reprinting of the poem illustrated by Kilmeny & Deborah Niland has been continuously in print since publication and won the 1973 ABPA Book Design Award and the 1974 Visual Arts Board Award. The novel by H. G. Wells on cycling, The Wheels of Chance: A Bicycling Idyll was published in the same year as this poem. The poem actually featured the Safety bicycle.  However, the poem has been inaccurately illustrated by various illustrators with a depiction of the visually more interesting Penny-farthing which had been superseded at the time the poem was written. The introduction of safety cycles gave rise to a bicycling boom with millions being manufactured in the decade 1890\u20131900.  They were very popular in the Australian outback, widely used by shearers and itinerant workers at the time that Paterson wrote this poem. The model for the character of Mulga Bill was William Henry Lewis (1880-1968), who knew Paterson in the vicinity of Bourke, New South Wales. Lewis had bought his bicycle as a result of a drought when there was no feed for horses. Eaglehawk, Victoria\u2014once a rural mining town, now part of greater Bendigo\u2014was given as Mulga Bill's hometown (Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk\u00a0...). This has been recognised with the development of the Mulga Bill Bicycle Trail, a scenic ride taking in many of the mining attractions, historic sites and modern-day amenities of Eaglehawk. Mulga is a very common species of Acacia that predominates the interior regions of the Australian bush, and colloquially, it is an alternative term for the Bush itself or wilderness regions,  for example \u2018up the mulga\u2019. This poem is extremely important to Australian culture because it includes the start of the cycling craze.  In the time this poem was written, everyone was buying bicycles because it was (and still partly is) popular in Australia. The poem has been set to music and the poem title was the name of a prominent Australian folk music group (also known as a bush band) in the 1970s."

In addition to Holst's version, there is a harmonised choral arrangement by Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott in the New Oxford Book of Carols, an arrangement by Antony Pitts in the Naxos Book of Carols and two arrangements by John Rutter; one for choir and full orchestra which emulates percussive medieval instrumentation, and another in his anthology Dancing Day for female or boys voices with harp or piano accompaniment. The Retrover Ensemble's performance for Naxos Records pairs the piece with Gaudete, another carol from . Several recorded versions are arranged in a more folk-oriented style: for example, a performance by Maddy Prior and The Carnival Band on their 1987 album A Tapestry of Carols, which utilises period instruments. The female a cappella quartet Anonymous 4 have also recorded the song with its original \"\" text on their CD Legends of St. Nicholas. The contemporary English cross-disciplinary music ensemble North Sea Radio Orchestra have recorded a small-ensemble instrumental version of the piece arranged for two violins, cello, clarinet, bassoon, oboe, piano, vibraphone, chamber organ and guitar. This appears on their 2008 album Birds. Jazz musician Wayne Shorter recorded his arrangement of melody under the name 12th Century Carol on his 2003 album Alegria. Robert Cummings, writing in the Allmusic guide, states that the \"melody is glorious and ebullient in its lively, triumphant manner. It largely consists of bright, resolute three-note phrases whose overall structure gradually rises, then descends.\" Bass guitarist/composer Chris Squire recorded his arrangement on the 2007 album Chris Squire's Swiss Choir accompanied by guitarist Steve Hackett and the English Baroque Choir."

Sawamura plans to go with his friends to a local high school and play baseball to the best of their abilities. However, one scout from the prestigious Seido High School approaches him and offers him a scholarship and a chance to make it to the nationals. Sawamura decides to pay a visit to the school, and it changes his entire outlook on the future. Seido and their main rivals attempt to help the upperclassmen make it to nationals during the summer tournament. Once the summer tournament ends, the upperclassmen will be forced to retire, but Sawamura will help them to success, despite his lack of control. Some time later, Sawamura and his teammates, Furuya Satoru, Kominato Haruichi and Miyuki Kazuya, lead a new team, along with a few returning faces, through the fall tournament. Their overly ambitious goal is to go to nationals during the fall tournament and convince coach Kataoka that he does not have to resign. Ace of Diamond Act II continues to follow Sawamura and the team as they prepare to compete for the summer tournament. With a new year, new faces appear and join the Seido baseball club. Sawamura and Furuya compete with national level teams, being able to identify their own strengths and weaknesses and further mature their pitching style, all the while they are competing with each other to earn the coveted ace title. Simultaneously, the Seido batters are improving themselves to become as fearsome as the batting talent of their previous year's first-string team. With all of these preparations, Seido is aiming to win the summer tournament before the upperclassman have to graduate."

        "content": "\"Puss in Boots\" () is an Italian fairy tale, later spread throughout the rest of Europe, about an  anthropomorphic cat who uses trickery and deceit to gain power, wealth, and the hand of a princess in marriage for his penniless and low-born master. The oldest written telling is by Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola, who included it in his The Facetious Nights of Straparola (c. 1550\u20131553) in XIV\u2013XV. Another version was published in 1634 by Giambattista Basile with the title Cagliuso, and a tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century by Charles Perrault (1628\u20131703), a retired civil servant and member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. There is a version written by Girolamo Morlini, from whom Straparola used various tales in The Facetious Nights of Straparola. The tale appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript two years before its 1697 publication by Barbin in a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault called Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9. The book was an instant success and remains popular. Perrault's Histoires has had considerable impact on world culture. The original Italian title of the first edition was Costantino Fortunato, but was later known as Il gatto con gli stivali (lit. The cat with the boots); the French title was \"Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9, avec des moralit\u00e9s\" with the subtitle \"Les Contes de ma m\u00e8re l'Oye\" (\"Stories or Fairy Tales from Past Times with Morals\", subtitled \"Mother Goose Tales\"). The frontispiece to the earliest English editions depicts an old woman telling tales to a group of children beneath a placard inscribed \"MOTHER GOOSE'S TALES\" and is credited with launching the Mother Goose legend in the English-speaking world. \"Puss in Boots\" has provided inspiration for composers, choreographers, and other artists over the centuries. The cat appears in the third act pas de caract\u00e8re of Tchaikovsky's ballet The Sleeping Beauty, appears in the sequels and self-titled spin-off to the animated film Shrek and is signified in the logo of Japanese anime studio Toei Animation. Puss in Boots is also a popular pantomime in the UK."

        "content": "The tale opens with the third and youngest son of a miller receiving his inheritance - a cat. At first, the youngest son laments, as the eldest brother gains the mill, and the middle brother gets the mule. However, the feline is no ordinary cat, but one who requests and receives a pair of boots. Determined to make his master's fortune, the cat bags a rabbit in the forest and presents it to the king as a gift from his master, the fictional Marquis of Carabas. The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months, for which he is rewarded. One day, the king decides to take a drive with his daughter. The cat persuades his master to remove his clothes and enter the river which their carriage passes. The cat disposes of his master's clothing beneath a rock. As the royal coach nears, the cat begins calling for help in great distress. When the king stops to investigate, the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing. The king has the young man brought from the river, dressed in a splendid suit of clothes, and seated in the coach with his daughter, who falls in love with him at once. The cat hurries ahead of the coach, ordering the country folk along the road to tell the king that the land belongs to the \"Marquis of Carabas\", saying that if they do not he will cut them into mincemeat. The cat then happens upon a castle inhabited by an ogre who is capable of transforming himself into a number of creatures. The ogre displays his ability by changing into a lion, frightening the cat, who then tricks the ogre into changing into a mouse. The cat then pounces upon the mouse and devours it. The king arrives at the castle that formerly belonged to the ogre, and impressed with the bogus Marquis and his estate, gives the lad the princess in marriage. Thereafter; the cat enjoys life as a great lord who runs after mice only for his own amusement. The tale is followed immediately by two morals; \"one stresses the importance of possessing industrie and savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess\". The Italian translation by Carlo Collodi notes that the tale gives useful advice if you happen to be a cat or a Marquis of Carabas. This is the theme in France, but other versions of this theme exist in Asia, Africa, and South America."

        "title": "Puss in Boots_Background",
        "content": "Perrault's the \"Master Cat or Puss in Boots\" is the most renowned tale in all of Western folklore of the animal as helper. However, the trickster cat was not Perrault's invention. Centuries before the publication of Perrault's tale, Somadeva, a Kashmir Brahmin, assembled a vast collection of Indian folk tales called Kath\u0101 Sarit S\u0101gara (lit. \"The ocean of the streams of stories\") that featured stock fairy tale characters and trappings such as invincible swords, vessels that replenish their contents, and helpful animals. In the Panchatantra (lit. \"Five Principles\"), a collection of Hindu tales from the 2nd century BC., a tale follows a cat who fares much less well than Perrault's Puss as he attempts to make his fortune in a king's palace. In 1553, \"Costantino Fortunato\", a tale similar to \"Le Ma\u00eetre Chat\", was published in Venice in Giovanni Francesco Straparola's Le Piacevoli Notti (lit. The Facetious Nights), the first European storybook to include fairy tales. In Straparola's tale however, the poor young man is the son of a Bohemian woman, the cat is a fairy in disguise, the princess is named Elisetta, and the castle belongs not to an ogre but to a lord who conveniently perishes in an accident. The poor young man eventually becomes King of Bohemia. An edition of Straparola was published in France in 1560. The abundance of oral versions after Straparola's tale may indicate an oral source to the tale; it also is possible Straparola invented the story. In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was published in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile's version, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved in a manner similar to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats. It is likely that Perrault was aware of the Straparola tale, since 'Facetious Nights' was translated into French in the sixteenth century and subsequently passed into the oral tradition."

The story was published under the French title Le Ma\u00eetre Chat, ou le Chat Bott\u00e9 ('Master Cat, or the Booted Cat') by Barbin in Paris in January 1697 in a collection of tales called Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9.

A frontispiece similar to that of the first French edition appeared in the English edition launching the Mother Goose legend in the English-speaking world. Samber's translation has been described as \"faithful and straightforward, conveying attractively the concision, liveliness and gently ironic tone of Perrault's prose, which itself emulated the direct approach of oral narrative in its elegant simplicity.\" Since that publication, the tale has been translated into various languages and published around the world."

Darmancour\". Perrault senior, however, was known for some time to have been interested in contes de veille or contes de ma m\u00e8re l'oye, and in 1693 published a versification of \"Les Souhaits Ridicules\" and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called \"Peau d'Ane\". Further, a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales (including Le Maistre Chat ou le Chat Bott\u00e9) existed two years before the tale's 1697 Paris publication. Pierre Darmancour was sixteen or seventeen years old at the time the manuscript was prepared and, as scholars Iona and Peter Opie note, quite unlikely to have been interested in recording fairy tales. Darmancour, who became a soldier, showed no literary inclinations, and, when he died in 1700, his obituary made no mention of any connection with the tales. However, when Perrault senior died in 1703, the newspaper alluded to his being responsible for \"La Belle au bois dormant\", which the paper had published in 1696."

Folklorists Joseph Jacobs and Stith Thompson point that the Perrault's tale is the possible source of the Cat Helper story in later European folkloric traditions. The tale has also spread to the Americas, and is known in Asia (India, Indonesia and Philippines). Variations of the feline helper across cultures replace the cat with a jackal or fox. For instance, in the Philippines, the helpful animal is a monkey \"in all Philippine variants\", according to Damiana Eugenio. Greek scholar Marianthi Kaplanoglou states that the tale type ATU 545B, \"Puss in Boots\" (or, locally, \"The Helpful Fox\"), is an \"example\" of \"widely known stories (...) in the repertoires of Greek refugees from Asia Minor\"."

        "content": "Perrault's tale has been adapted to various media over the centuries. Ludwig Tieck published a dramatic satire based on the tale, called Der gestiefelte Kater, and, in 1812, the Brothers Grimm inserted a version of the tale into their Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen. In ballet, Puss appears in the third act of Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty in a pas de caract\u00e8re with The White Cat. The phrase \"enough to make a cat laugh\" dates from the mid-1800s and is associated with the tale of Puss in Boots. The Biblioth\u00e8que de Carabas book series was published by David Nutt in London in the late 19th century, in which the front cover of each volume depicts Puss in Boots reading a book. In film and television, Walt Disney produced an animated black and white silent short based on the tale in 1922. It was also adapted by Toei as anime feature film in 1969, It followed by two sequels. Hayao Miyazaki made manga series as a promotional tie-in for the film. The title character, Pero, named after Perrault, has since then become the mascot of Toei Animation, with his face appearing in the studio's logo. In the mid-1980s, Puss in Boots was televised as an episode of Faerie Tale Theatre with Ben Vereen and Gregory Hines in the cast. 1987's anime Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics features Puss in Boots, This version of Puss cheats his good-natured master out of money to buy his boots and his hat, hunts the king's favorite thrush for introduced his master to the king. Another version from the Cannon Movie Tales series features Christopher Walken as Puss, who in this adaptation is a cat who turns into a human when wearing the boots. The TV show Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child features the story in a Hawaiian setting. The episode stars the voices of David Hyde Pierce as Puss in Boots, Dean Cain as Kuhio, Pat Morita as King Makahata, and Ming-Na Wen as Lani. In addition, the shapeshifting ogre is replaced with a shapeshifting giant (voiced by Keone Young). Another adaptation of the character with little relation to the story was in the Pok\u00e9mon anime episode \"Like a Meowth to a Flame,\" where a Meowth owned by the character Tyson wore boots, a hat, and a neckerchief. DreamWorks Animation released the animated feature Puss in Boots, with Antonio Banderas reprising his voice-over role of Puss in Boots from the Shrek films, on November 4, 2011. This new film's story bears no similarities to the book. It led to the Netflix/DreamWorks series The Adventures of Puss in Boots where Puss was voiced by Eric Bauza."

        "content": "Jacques Barchilon and Henry Pettit note in their introduction to The Authentic Mother Goose: Fairy Tales and Nursery Rhymes that the main motif of \"Puss in Boots\" is the animal as helper and that the tale \"carries atavistic memories of the familiar totem animal as the father protector of the tribe found everywhere by missionaries and anthropologists.\" They also note that the title is original with Perrault as are the boots; no tale prior to Perrault's features a cat wearing boots. Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie observe that \"the tale is unusual in that the hero little deserves his good fortune, that is if his poverty, his being a third child, and his unquestioning acceptance of the cat's sinful instructions, are not nowadays looked upon as virtues.\" The cat should be acclaimed the prince of 'con' artists, they declare, as few swindlers have been so successful before or since. The success of Histoires is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons. While the literary skill employed in the telling of the tales has been recognized universally, it appears the tales were set down in great part as the author heard them told. The evidence for that assessment lies first in the simplicity of the tales, then in the use of words that were, in Perrault's era, considered populaire and du bas peuple, and finally, in the appearance of vestigial passages that now are superfluous to the plot, do not illuminate the narrative, and thus, are passages the Opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in the process of creating a work of art. One such vestigial passage is Puss's boots; his insistence upon the footwear is explained nowhere in the tale, it is not developed, nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside. According to the Opies, Perrault's great achievement was accepting fairy tales at \"their own level.\" He recounted them with neither impatience nor mockery, and without feeling that they needed any aggrandisement such as a frame story\u2014although he must have felt it useful to end with a rhyming moralit\u00e9. Perrault would be revered today as the father of folklore if he had taken the time to record where he obtained his tales, when, and under what circumstances. Bruno Bettelheim remarks that \"the more simple and straightforward a good character in a fairy tale, the easier it is for a child to identify with it and to reject the bad other.\" The child identifies with a good hero because the hero's condition makes a positive appeal to him. If the character is a very good person, then the child is likely to want to be good too. Amoral tales, however, show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as \"Puss in Boots\" build character, not by offering choices between good and bad, but by giving the child hope that even the meekest can survive. Morality is of little concern in these tales, but rather, an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life. Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts. Fairy stories, however, give great dignity to the smallest achievements (such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal, as in \"Puss in Boots\") and that such ordinary events may lead to great things. Fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small, real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment. In Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion Jack Zipes notes that Perrault \"sought to portray ideal types to reinforce the standards of the civilizing process set by upper-class French society\". A composite portrait of Perrault's heroines, for example, reveals the author's idealized female of upper-class society is graceful, beautiful, polite, industrious, well groomed, reserved, patient, and even somewhat stupid because for Perrault, intelligence in womankind would be threatening. Therefore, Perrault's composite heroine passively waits for \"the right man\" to come along, recognize her virtues, and make her his wife. He acts, she waits. If his seventeenth century heroines demonstrate any characteristics, it is submissiveness. A composite of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates the opposite of his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility to work their way up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century. According to fairy and folk tale researcher and commentator Jack Zipes, Puss is \"the epitome of the educated bourgeois secretary who serves his master with complete devotion and diligence.\" The cat has enough wit and manners to impress the king, the intelligence to defeat the ogre, and the skill to arrange a royal marriage for his low-born master. Puss's career is capped by his elevation to grand seigneur and the tale is followed by a double moral: \"one stresses the importance of possessing industrie et savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess.\" The renowned illustrator of Dickens' novels and stories, George Cruikshank, was shocked that parents would allow their children to read \"Puss in Boots\" and declared: \"As it stood the tale was a succession of successful falsehoods\u2014a clever lesson in lying!\u2014a system of imposture rewarded with the greatest worldly advantages.\" Another critic, Maria Tatar, notes that there is little to admire in Puss\u2014he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a \"linguistic virtuoso\", a creature who has mastered the arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth. \"Puss in Boots\" has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, \"it has something to do with inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters.\" Briggs does assert that cats were a form of fairy in their own right having something akin to a fairy court and their own set of magical powers. Still, it is rare in Europe's fairy tales for a cat to be so closely involved with human affairs. According to Jacob Grimm, Puss shares many of the features that a household fairy or deity would have including a desire for boots which could represent seven-league boots. This may mean that the story of \"Puss and Boots\" originally represented the tale of a family deity aiding an impoverished family member. Stefan Zweig, in his 1939 novel, Ungeduld des Herzens, references Puss in Boots' procession through a rich and varied countryside with his master and drives home his metaphor with a mention of Seven League Boots."

It is sung at the beginning of the film by the clown-like gypsy, Clopin. It is set mainly in the key of D minor. (However, the movie is edited up a semitone, therefore playing this piece in E-flat minor.)

The notion that \"Frollo is encouraged by the Archdeacon of Notre Dame to raise Quasimodo as his own, to atone for killing the baby's gypsy mother\" on the stairs of the church had to be explained in the opening scene of the musical, and that was the catalyst for the song's creation. Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary explains that \"the opening sequence of [the film] was originally all narration and the result was deemed too lifeless so ['The Bells of Notre Dame'] was written\".

During the song, Clopin tells a group of young children about the mysterious bell-ringer of Notre Dame Cathedral, described as \"a tale of a man, and a monster.\" Twenty years earlier, a group of gypsies attempted to ferry their way into Paris and travel to the Court of Miracles (where the gypsies live), but were ambushed by Frollo and several soldiers. When the only woman amongst the gypsies is seen carrying a bundle, one of Frollo's guards attempts to confiscate it, prompting her to flee. Frollo pursues her on his horse, thinking her bundle contains stolen goods, in an intense chase through the streets that comes to a head on the steps of Notre Dame. Frollo grabs the bundle from her, but in doing so strikes a blow to her head with his boot, causing her to fall down onto the stone steps, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. Frollo discovers that the bundle is actually a deformed baby boy. He sees a well nearby and attempts to drown the baby as he thinks it is a demon from Hell, but is stopped by the Archdeacon, who admonishes Frollo for killing an innocent woman on holy ground. As Frollo tries to defend his actions, the Archdeacon says that if Frollo wishes for the salvation of his immortal soul, he must raise the child as his own. Frollo reluctantly agrees on the condition that the baby remains hidden in the bell tower of Notre Dame, and gives him a cruel name; Quasimodo, which, according to Clopin, means \"half-formed\". Clopin ends the song with a riddle: \"Who is the monster and who is the man?\" The scene then shifts to 20-year-old Quasimodo ringing the bells."

        "content": "The film itself, like most Disney Renaissance films, contains valuable moral information and so, in a way, can be called a \"teaching story\", besides being entertainment. This is one function of stories that are told to children: to give them, at least, the basic understanding of attitudes and behaviors encountered in the real world. Through the story of the song, Clopin tells the children that it is a tale of \"a man and a monster\". Towards the end he gives them a riddle for them to guess whilst being told the rest of the story, that being: \"Who is the monster and who is the man?\", thus introducing the major theme of the film. What is meant by these words is to get behind what often are merely appearances, and by doing so we get to the actual truth. This aspect of the story can be related to real life because people often make the error of mistaking appearances (that also may be false) for the real thing or for something else entirely. In this case, while in the beginning \"the picture explicitly compares the queerness of Quasimodo to the righteousness of Frollo\", by the end it would seem that Quasimodo is the monster due to his deformities while his master Frollo is the man due to his sleeker looks. It is implied by the end of the film, however, that it is now indeed a paradox and reversal of the statement attributed to the two personalities, not by their appearances. Singing the reprise of the song, Clopin gives a girl a new riddle: \"What makes a monster and what makes a man?\", stating that Quasimodo is the man because of his humble kindness and selfless bravery, while Frollo is deemed to be the monster because of his selfishness, cruelty, and intolerance. The work Mouse Morality: The Rhetoric of Disney Animated Film by Annalee R. Ward argues that the use of a play-within-a-play technique used in this opening number \"enables the filmmakers to condense some of the story, telling us the setting instead of showing it\". It adds that symbolically, Clopin's puppet show is a metaphor for what Disney has done to the original source material, having \"reduced it to manipulated entertainment, ala 'tragedy lite'\"."

One is washed about in it, hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he turns over the page and reads, \"Let the pupil make careful note of the following exceptions.\" He runs his eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it. The inflections within the language are used to represent both syntax and semantics, and function is assigned in hard to grasp ways, which combine with Twain's claim about exceptions being rather common in the German language. Part of this stems from the language's word order, along with gender, number, and other linguistic aspects, being connected to the morphology of individual words."

        "content": "One of the key emphases within the work is on German linguistic gender. Twain plays with the differences in natural or sexual gender and linguistic or grammatical gender by pointing out that the German for \"girl\" is grammatically neuter, unlike many sexless items such as turnips: Every noun has a gender, and there is no sense or system in distribution; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by heart. There is no other way. To do this one has to have a memory like a memorandum-book. In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has. Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip, and what callous disrespect for the girl. The problem with the linguistic gender is that it appears to make sense in theory, but it operates in an illogical manner. The actual relationship between gender and noun is unclear, and it is difficult for a learner of German to psychologically connect their understanding of the words with the gender rules. To Twain, there was no reason for concepts such as a fish's scale having a feminine gender but a fishwife, an actual female, lacking any. When Twain translates the \"Tale of the Fishwife and its Sad Fate\", he expresses feelings of anger that result from his attempt to learn the language: It is a bleak Day. Hear the Rain, how he pours, and the Hail, how he rattles; and see the Snow, how he drifts along, and oh the Mud, how deep he is! Ah the poor Fishwife, it is stuck fast in the Mire; it has dropped its Basket of Fishes; and its Hands have been cut by the Scales as it seized some of the falling Creatures; and one Scale has even got into its Eye. And it cannot get her out. It opens its Mouth to cry for Help; but if any Sound comes out of him, alas he is drowned by the raging of the Storm. German is not special in this manner, but, as the linguist Guy Deutscher observes, it was simply the language that Twain was learning at the time of the work. Many other languages contain some or all of the idiosyncrasies that Twain pokes fun at, including French, Russian, and Latin."

Set in contemporary Paris, it describes the rise and fall of a brilliant political strategist abandoned by the politicians he helps into power. Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France. Balzac was inspired to write the story after spotting the name \"Z. Marcas\" on a sign for a tailor's shop in Paris. It was published in July 1840, in the Revue Parisienne, a magazine he had founded that year. One year later, it appeared in a collection from various authors under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux (\"The Death of an Ambitious Man\"). Balzac later placed it in the Sc\u00e8nes de la vie politique section of his vast novel sequence La Com\u00e9die humaine. Although Z. Marcas features characters from other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism\u00a0\u2013 both hallmarks of Balzac's style\u00a0\u2013 it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership had led to mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were in danger of being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come. The story also explores Balzac's conviction that a person's name is a powerful indicator of his or her destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power."

After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost large sums of borrowed money in the publishing trade, attempting to capitalize on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 he owed his mother 50,000 francs. Although his views on politics were always changing, Balzac was primarily a legitimist who supported the House of Bourbon and believed that the July Revolution of 1830 had left France without strong leadership. In 1832 he declared his intent to run for the Chamber of Deputies in the French Parliament. A variety of problems prevented his actual candidacy, but he mounted a serious campaign which was met mostly with ridicule by the press. Referring to Balzac's breakthrough 1831 novel La Peau de chagrin (\"The Wild Ass's Skin\"), the newspaper Le Figaro mused: \"This is the first time anyone has been seen caressing the voters with an ass's skin.\" Although he later showed renewed interest in public office, he mostly expressed his political views through writing. In July 1840 he attempted to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the Revue Parisienne, funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned all there was to know about the trade. \"[T]hat gigantic machine known as journalism\", he wrote, \"is as simple as a roasting spit turned by a poodle.\" Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the Revue Parisienne, in part to challenge the popularity of the roman-feuilleton serial format. Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end."

They finally came upon a tailor's sign that enraptured Balzac, bearing the name Z. Marcas. He believed that the name suggested  (\"some mysterious fatality\"), and chose it for his story's protagonist. He wrote the 30-page story soon afterwards. Balzac published Z.

When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career. Recognizing at an early age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his associate had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay. Eventually his politician friend seeks his help for a third time.

As usual in his later work, Balzac describes Marcas by relating him to an animal: \"L'animal de Marcas \u00e9tait le lion. Ses cheveux ressemblaient \u00e0 une crini\u00e8re, son nez \u00e9tait court, \u00e9cras\u00e9, large et fendu au bout comme celui d'un lion, il avait le front partag\u00e9 comme celui d'un lion par un sillon puissant, divis\u00e9 en deux lobes vigoureux.\" (\"The animal for Marcas was the lion. His hair was like a mane, his nose was short and flat; broad and dented at the tip like a lion's; his brow, like a lion's, was strongly marked with a deep median furrow, dividing two powerful bosses.\") Marcas appears to be destined for greatness; he is described as having tremendous spirit, sound but speedy judgment, and comprehensive knowledge of public manners. His gaze has  (\"a power\"), which he tries not to use, since it has brought him nothing but misery in the past. Despite these innate proficiencies, however, the political genius living in the students' midst requires their aid to dress himself when official company comes to call. The character of Z. Marcas nonetheless represents a fiery drive to succeed in the world of politics, an acute mind seeking to do good in the public sphere. One critic calls him \"ambition in its pure state\". Like other persons of genius in La Com\u00e9die humaine, Marcas is seen as a reflection of Balzac's own ego and desire. Like Marcas, the author dreamed of fame and positive influence; as Balzac believed himself to be, the character is dismissed and manipulated by mediocre minds. Even their work habits\u00a0\u2013 toiling at their desks throughout the night\u00a0\u2013 are similar."

Marcas, the narrator\u00a0\u2013 Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed at the end of the story\u00a0\u2013 is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme sup\u00e9rieure. The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme sup\u00e9rieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure. Charles Rabourdin's interactions with Marcas echo the difficulties he saw in his father's government career. As critic Herbert J. Hunt notes, Marcas \"represents in the political sphere what Rabourdin represents in the administrative sphere\". Allan H. Pasco echoes this point: \"Charles has had the lesson of futility from two tutors: his father and Marcas. Outstanding men have no future in politics, in the administration, or in business\u00a0\u2013 at least not in France.\" Balzac's use of recurring characters provides unparalleled depth and characterization for his readers. \"This technique\", insists critic Mary Susan McCarthy, \"not only furnished him with a unifying principle but also offers the reader a network of relationships through which to unite the many separate stories and novels in which the characters appear, forming the fictional universe that is La Com\u00e9die humaine.\" Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he \"did not know where to begin\". Z. Marcas himself appears in one other Balzac story, Un prince de la boh\u00e8me, which the author revised twice before it appeared in its final form. In the 1846 edition, the character of Marcel has been changed to Marcas; but this may have been a printer's error. As Anthony Pugh explains: \"This detail is inexplicable; the principal character of Z. Marcas, who does not otherwise appear outside his own story, seems a very unlikely candidate for the role. Could it be a misprint?\""

        "content": "Balzac was known for his use of realism, including exquisite detail when describing people and locations. His fanaticism about the name Z. Marcas is cited as an example of the author's \"zeal\" for \"close local color\". Balzac's belief in the connection between one's name and one's destiny is brought to the fore; the pattern demonstrated in Z. Marcas reflects many in the larger collection of Balzac's work. As critic Charles Affron puts it: \"The creator of a universe so tied up with inner rhythms and resounding with so many echoes does not hesitate to imply that the germs of a character's failure can be found in the physical qualities of his name.\" This idea came to Balzac from Laurence Sterne, as he acknowledged in his 1841 story Ursule Mirou\u00ebt:  (\"Should we not agree with Sterne in recognizing the occult power in names, which sometimes mock and sometimes define the characters of their possessors?\") Z. Marcas includes many other examples of realist detail as well. The students live in shabby environs, furnished by  (\"only a scrap of thin carpet\"). They share  (\"a tawny twig of Turkish tobacco\") with their neighbor, and the three discuss political personalities drawn directly from recent history, including William Pitt the Elder and the Voltigeurs. Still, realist detail is not commonly in the foreground of commentary about Z. Marcas. As Hunt explains, it is mostly remembered \"as a vehicle for a characteristic Balzacian whimsy\"."

        "content": "Z. Marcas is best known for its reflection of Balzac's political views, specifically the neglect of talent and ability in a sea of republican mediocrity; and the abandonment of young people by older generations. Pasco suggests: \"'Z. Marcas' has then become, not the story of one particular, political failure, not the story of a young man of potential who abandons France for Malaysia, but the story of France herself, wasting away and thus losing her greatest resource\u00a0\u2013 her youth.\" Balzac believed that the July Monarchy had brought a wave of poor leadership, and that people of quality and integrity were scorned in the name of cronyism. Marcas, a prime example of such a man, is doomed to fail in the government of Louis-Philippe. Those in power were blind to the valuable minds being lost in their midst, as the students discover early in the story:  (\"we were amazed at the brutal indifference of the authorities to everything connected with intellect, thought, and poetry\"). Marcas' personal woes\u00a0\u2013 and his tales of life within the corridors of power\u00a0\u2013 strongly reinforce this view. Through Marcas, Balzac claimed that young people in France were being ignored by government officials, and predicted an uprising: As Graham Robb indicates in his 1994 biography, Balzac's words were an accurate prediction of the 1848 Revolution. Public opposition to the monarchy exploded in February of that year, Louis-Philippe was forced to abdicate, and the Second Republic was founded."

From the opening passages, it could easily unfold as a classic noir tale: A rainy night outside a gambling club, Kaddus and Cruizell confront the reluctant but indebted Wrobik with a dead-end deal.  In a couple of days a starship carrying the planet\u2019s Admiral will be returning, and Wrobik is to shoot it down, over the city, using a small pistol which they give him to use.  It is only when the gun is placed in his hands, does it become clear that this is another reality: it \"comes to life,\" lights blinking, small screen flickering.  The pistol will function only for those biologically of the Culture, and is the only weapon able to penetrate the starship\u2019s defenses, making the alien Wrobik the perfect candidate for the job. Eight years ago Wrobik left the high-minded and highly advanced Culture for the unabashedly corrupt world of the VEC.  He describes the Culture as a sterile, self-assured communist-bloc Utopia, a powerful society with an agenda of hypocritical moral imperialism, backed by Special Circumstances -- \"Dirty Tricks in other words.\" Almost in the background, the xenophobic VEC is waging \"distant wars against aliens, outworlders, subhumans;\"  civilian deaths going unnoted in the news reports.  There have been demonstrations, one of which continues to give Wrobik nightmares\u00a0\u2014 visions of the human military-machine charging forward.  There is also the \u2018radical\u2019 organization, considered \u2018terrorists\u2019 by most, called \"Bright Path,\" which apparently supplied the gangsters with the rare gun.  Wrobik would be living in the besieged Outworlder\u2019s Quarters himself, but nobody besides Maust, he thought, knew of his alien identity. While still in the Culture, Wrobik, then Bahlln-Euchersa (etc.), went through a process of \"regendering,\" changing sex (physically), from female to male.   Despite her hopes, her (mental) gender and sexual orientation did not morph along with her body.  Though still a woman in his own mind, since living in the VEC, Wrobik has accepted the identity that society has bestowed upon him: that of a homosexual male, and has found happiness with Maust.  \"I would not be a woman in this society,\" he states, implying that, despite the homophobic society which is shown, this perhaps is the better option. Wrobik attempts to flee the VEC, in order to avoid his task, which would turn him into not only the murderer of a high official, but possibly hundreds of civilians.   Overheard news that an ambassador from the Culture is to be on the targeted starship as well further dissuades him, and also brings up questions about the true purpose of the attack.  Before Wrobik can skip town (or planet), though, Kaddus and Cruizell get hold of Maust and use him as leverage.  Wrobik is forced to stay and carry out his assignment in order to assure his safety. The story ends with Wrobik completing his mission, the ship fallen and the distant city ablaze with the fire from the explosions.  He never wanted to hurt anyone, but maybe now he is the terrorist.  We do not know his fate; he pockets the gun, and \"[races] down to join all the other poor folk on the run.\""

        "content": "\"The Imperialism of Free Trade\" is an academic article by John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson first published in The Economic History Review in 1953. The article was influential in the debate concerning the causes of British imperial expansion in the 19th-century which, since John A. Hobson's Imperialism: A Study (1902), had focused on economic motivation. Instead, Gallagher and Robinson claimed that the New Imperialism\u00a0\u2013 \"the new spate of imperial expansion that gathered momentum from the 1880s\"\u00a0\u2013 could be best characterised as a continuation of a longer-term policy begun in the 1850s in which informal empire, based on the principles of free trade, was favoured over formal imperial control unless circumstances made such rule impossible. As well as reigniting scholarly interest in theorizing New Imperialism, the article helped launch the Cambridge School of historiography. The arguments proposed in the article were later developed in a full-length book, Africa and the Victorians (1961), in conjunction with Alice Denny. The book put forward a subtly different explanation for European expansion in Africa, built around geopolitics and a strategy of protecting British India from encroachment by other European powers. The strategic model and its relevance to East Africa was criticised for its limited documentary basis and sequential inconsistencies by John Darwin in 1997, a refutation that was further consolidated and contextualised by Jonas Gjers\u00f8 in 2015. Reviewing the debate from the end of the 20th century, historian  Martin Lynn argues that Gallagher and Robinson exaggerated its impact. He says that Britain achieved its goal of increasing its economic interests in many areas, \"but the broader goal of 'regenerating' societies and thereby creating regions tied as 'tributaries' to British economic interests was not attained.\" The reasons were: The idea that free-trade imperial states use informal controls to secure their expanding economic influence has attracted Marxists trying to avoid the problems of earlier Marxist interpretations of capitalism. The approach is most often applied to American policies."

The title \"Bread of Life\" (, artos t\u0113s z\u014d\u0113s) given to Jesus is based on this Biblical passage which is set in the Gospel of John shortly after the feeding the multitude episode (in which Jesus feeds a crowd of 5,000 people with five loaves of bread and two fish), after which He walks on the water to the western side of Sea of Galilee and the crowd follow by boat in search of Him."

        "content": "The Liturgy of the Eucharist, from the earliest days, was performed behind closed doors out of fear of persecution. One of the earliest explanations of the Eucharist on behalf of a Christian to the larger contemporary community is given by Justin Martyr in his First Apology to \"We call this food Eucharist, and no one else is permitted to partake of it, except one who believes our teaching to be true and who has been washed in the washing which is for the remission of sins and for regeneration [i.e., has received baptism] and is thereby living as Christ enjoined. For not as common bread nor common drink do we receive these; but since Jesus Christ our Savior was made incarnate by the word of God and had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so too, as we have been taught, the food which has been made into the Eucharist by the Eucharistic prayer set down by him, and by the change of which our blood and flesh is nurtured, is both the flesh and the blood of that incarnated Jesus\" \u2014(First Apology 66 [A.D. 151]).Ignatius of Antioch, disciple of John the Apostle (the author of the gospel of John), first-century Christian writer and Patriarch of Antioch, explains the common understanding of the Eucharist as truly the body and blood of Jesus Christ in a letter written c. 110 AD: This orthodox understanding is further affirmed by Irenaeus of Lyon in his famous work \"Against Heresies\" where he asks rhetorically \"If the Lord were from other than the Father, how could he rightly take bread, which is of the same creation as our own, and confess it to be his body and affirm that the mixture in the cup is his blood?\" (Against Heresies 4:32-33). Cyril of Jerusalem, a fourth-century Christian writer and bishop of Jerusalem during the Arian controversy, explains that \"the bread and the wine of the Eucharist before the holy invocation of the adorable Trinity were simple bread and wine, but the invocation having been made, the bread becomes the body of Christ and the wine the blood of Christ\" (Catechetical Lectures 19:7). Augustine of Hippo in his Tractate on John 6 teaches that Jesus was speaking mystically and not carnally (that is, not solely physical): by eating his flesh and drinking his blood the Church not merely be consuming Jesus' body and blood, but would be ritually united with Christ. Augustine elsewhere teaches that the bread and wine is the same body that Jesus gave up and the same blood that he shed on the cross. John Chrysostom in Homily 47 on the Gospel of John teaches that Jesus' words are not an enigma or a parable, but to be taken literally."

        "content": "John's Gospel does not include an account of the blessing of the bread during the Last Supper as in the synoptic gospels e.g. . Nonetheless, this discourse has often been interpreted as communicating teachings regarding the Eucharist that have been very influential in the Christian tradition. Meredith J. C. Warren and Jan Heilmann have challenged the Eucharistic interpretation of this passage. Warren argues that it reflects ancient Mediterranean traditions of sacrificial meals that identify a hero with a divinity. Heilmann argues that the imagery of eating the flesh of Jesus and drinking his blood is to be understood against the background of the conceptual metaphor. In the Christological context, the use of the Bread of Life title is similar to the Light of the World title in John 8:12 where Jesus states: \"I am the light of the world: he who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" These assertions build on the Christological theme of John 5:26 where Jesus claims to possess life just as the Father does and provides it to those who follow him. In John 6:33 the alternative wording, \"bread of God\" appears."

        "content": "While in New Orleans, Kirby Buckner is confronted by an elderly Creole woman who whispers a bizarre warning: \"Trouble on Tularoosa Creek!\". Soon, the woman disappears into a nearby crowd. Buckner immediately realizes that his backwoods homeland is in peril and instantly departs for the Canaan region of his birth.  He arrives after midnight and sets out on horseback through the bayous to the town of Grimesville.  En route he encounters a mysterious \"quadroon girl\"  who mocks him.  Buckner is disturbed to find himself aroused by her provocative beauty.  The woman calls forth several large black men from hiding to kill Buckner, but he shoots one and kills another with a bowie knife.  As a third flees, he notices that the girl has vanished. Buckner joins his fellow white men but finds himself strangely reluctant to speak of the black woman. He learns that the local blacks are now being led by a strange \"conjure man\" named Saul Stark, who has vowed to kill all the whites in Grimesville and set up a black empire in America.  All are apprehensive concerning the imminent \"uprising.\"  The scion of an important family, Buckner is looked to for leadership in the time of crisis. The men of Grimesville had captured a frightened black man, Tope Sorely, and were about to interrogate him when Buckner arrived.  One of the men offers a whip to use as coercion but Buckner, loath to beat the truth from Tope, attempts to calm him instead. Tope is afraid of Stark's wrath should he betray his own master.  He fears Stark will use his magical powers to \"put me in de swamp!\"  Promises of protection persuade Tope to tell them of Stark's ambitions.  Buckner decides to confront Stark.  Traveling to Stark's cabin, Buckner finds that Stark is gone but instinctively realizes that he has left some sort of supernatural entity within the cabin to guard it and does not enter.  As he returns to his fellows, Buckner once again meets the quadroon girl.  \"I have made a charm you cannot resist!\" she gloats, and deep down the white man knows it is true.  She tells him that that very night she will summon him to her, that he will witness the Dance of the Skull, and that he will be powerless to resist. The witch woman melts mysteriously into the swamp and Buckner rides away.  Along the trail, Buckner meets Jim Braxton, a friend who has come searching for him.  Buckner admonishes Braxton to return to Grimesville and let him find and face Stark alone, but Braxton refuses to allow his friend to face the danger on his own.  As the sun sets Buckner feels himself drawn to the black settlement of Goshen, unable to resist or even speak of the witch's spell to Braxton.  He attempts to warn his friend away several times, but to no avail.  Arriving at Goshen, the two men encounter the witch-woman.  Buckner is paralyzed by the spell, but Braxton acts and shoots at her.  Once more she vanishes, and they find no body.  Suddenly they are attacked by something in the swamp that they cannot see clearly, and Jim Braxton is killed.  Buckner, totally helpless in the grip of the voodoo spell, finds himself watching the rites of Damballah from a copse of trees.  The orgiastic rites will climax with Buckner meeting a hideous fate at the hands of Saul Stark.  Suddenly, amid a circle of Stark's followers, the witch appears, her body swaying rhythmically in the Dance of the Skull.  Buckner realizes that she is the source of Stark's power, and at the end of the ceremony the conjure-man will consolidate his power over the black people of the region. However, as the witch finishes her dance she collapses, dead, for Braxton's bullet had struck home, hitting her in the heart.  Only her supernatural power had kept her alive this long.  As she expires, Buckner feels the spell laid upon him lift.  The black people flee in panic, the uprising is broken, and Buckner stalks out of the swamp and kills Stark.  Afterwards, Buckner learns what was meant by Tope Sorley's cryptic words, \"He'd put me in de swamp!\"  He discovers that Stark magically altered the bodies of his enemies, transforming them into mindless amphibian horrors.  The burden of this terrible knowledge is a secret Buckner does not share with his fellow whites, creating an unspoken bond between himself and the black people of Canaan."

        "title": "Black Canaan_Background: Kelly the Conjure-man",
        "content": "\"Black Canaan\" was inspired by the legend of Kelly the Conjure-man.  In late 1930, Howard wrote a long letter to H. P. Lovecraft concerning the history and lore of the South and Southwest.  He mentions the Scotch-Irish settlement of Holly Springs, Arkansas, where his grandfather William Benjamin Howard settled in 1858. After recounting some of the local history, Howard goes on to write: In Howard's following letter to Lovecraft, he responds to the latter's suggestion that he make use of Kelly in his fiction; \"Kelly the conjure-man was quite a character, but I fear I could not do justice to such a theme as you describe.\"  However, despite Howard's reticence, Kelly did begin to find a way into his writing. In the letter in which he first mentions Kelly, Howard thanks Lovecraft for putting him in touch with William B. Talman.  Talman was an employee of Texaco, and wrote to Howard concerning contributions to his company periodical, The Texaco Star.  Howard's article \"The Ghost of Camp Colorado\" appeared in The Texaco Star a few months later in April 1931. It was also in 1931 that Howard submitted a follow-up article to The Texaco Star entitled \"Kelly the Conjure-Man.\"  The article begins: From there Howard expands on the story of Kelly as recounted to Lovecraft. \"Kelly the Conjure-Man\" was rejected by The Texaco Star and only saw publication decades after Howard's death.  However, a seed had been planted in Howard's imagination to germinate for several years.  Eventually Howard recast Kelly as Saul Stark in \"Black Canaan.\""

        "content": "Howard wrote the earliest version of \"Black Canaan\" in mid-1933.  In September, Howard forwarded the story to his agent, Otis Adelbert Kline, for submission to markets other than his mainstay Weird Tales.  After failing to place the story, Kline returned it to Howard.  Kline subsequently received a revised version of the tale in November 1934. \"Black Canaan\" was finally accepted by Weird Tales in October 1935.  It would be the last horror story Howard sold to Weird Tales. Howard himself was dissatisfied with the final version of the story.  In early May 1936 he wrote to August Derleth, \"Ignore my forthcoming 'Black Canaan.'  It started out as a good yarn, laid in the real Canaan, which lies between Tulip Creek and the Ouachita River in southwestern Arkansas, the homeland of the Howards, but I cut so much of the guts out of it, in response to editorial requirements, that in its published form it won't resemble the original theme, woven about the mysterious form of Kelly the Conjureman...\"  Others have been more charitable, generally citing the story as one of Howard's more effective supernatural tales.  In his obituary of Howard, H. P. Lovecraft singled it out for praise; \"Other powerful fantasies lay outside the connected series -- these including...a few distinctive tales with a modern setting, such as the recent 'Black Canaan' with its genuine regional background and its clutchingly compelling picture of the horror that stalks through the moss-hung, shadow-cursed, serpent-ridden swamps of the American far South.\" In the story, Howard proves adept at suggesting the presence of dark supernatural forces hovering in the shadows.  This quality is evident in the scene in which Kirby Buckner approaches Saul Stark's cabin: In \"Black Canaan\" the brooding sense of supernatural menace is augmented by undercurrents of both sexual and racial tension.  The name of the witch in the story is never revealed, but she is referred to several times as a \"Bride of Damballah.\"  When he first encounters her, Kirby Buckner is moved to remark: Thus the spell that the witch later casts on Buckner can be seen as a symbolic extension of the narrator's discomforting libidinous urges.  It has been suggested that Howard himself was attracted to black women, as evidenced by his portrayal of the Bride of Damballah, Nakari in the Solomon Kane story \"The Moon of Skulls\", and poems such as \"A Negro Girl\" and \"Strange Passion.\" At the core of \"Black Canaan\" is the element of racial strife.  When it appears that Saul Stark is fomenting an \"uprising\", Kirby Buckner reveals: Racial and sexual tension are pervasive in \"Black Canaan.\"  It remains a matter of conjecture what the story was like before Howard felt compelled to \"cut...the guts out of it.\""

        "title": "Black Canaan_Controversy",
        "content": "The most striking thing about \"Black Canaan\" is its racial element, presented in unabashed frankness. \"Nigger\" is used throughout the story frequently.  (The narrator Kirby Buckner describes the use of the term by others, and uses it himself when conversing with peers, but uses \"black\" or \"negro\" when addressing the reader directly.) The racial elements in \"Black Canaan,\" in other piney woods horror stories, and elsewhere by Howard have led to charges of racism against the author.  Howard was a white Southerner who died in 1936, well before the civil rights movement of later decades.  He was to some extent subject to the prevailing prejudices of his place and time.  Additionally, ethnic stereotypes were familiar standbys of pulp fiction and the Vaudeville stage.  Howard did make occasional use of stereotypes in his fiction for the sake of expediency, but more often endeavored to present fully realized characters.  He did make sincere efforts to portray certain black characters, such as boxer Ace Jessel and Solomon Kane's mentor N'Longa, in a sympathetic light. In \"Black Canaan,\" Saul Stark and the Bride of Damballah are portrayed as compelling, interesting figures while most of the white characters are presented as ignorant rednecks.  (In other piney woods stories Howard characterizes aristocratic whites, such as the Blassenvilles in \"Pigeons from Hell,\" as cruel oppressors.)  Kirby Buckner seems more enlightened than his peers, owing perhaps to the broadening influence of having left Canaan to live in the outside world.  At one point he muses that blacks are privy to certain knowledge that whites lack: \"Man and the natural animals are not the only sentient beings that haunt this planet.  There are invisible Things-- black spirits of the deep swamps and the slimes of the river beds-- the negroes know of them....\"  Later he glimpses a magically projected image of the witch beckoning him to his doom, and observes, \"A 'sending,' the people of the Orient, who are wiser than we, call such a thing.\" Unlike characters such as Kirby Buckner, Howard's own first-hand knowledge of black people was limited.  He lived most of his life in a part of Texas where African-Americans were very rare.  As Rusty Burke observed, \"His ideas about blacks came from memories of the tales he'd heard when young, from the stereotypes of fiction, and from the attitudes expressed by his Central West Texas neighbors and friends.  Given these sources, it is amazing that Howard shows as much sympathy as he does towards blacks.\" Howard's sympathy for certain black characters may owe something to the author's identification with outsiders and underdogs, evident in much of his fiction.  In \"Kelly the Conjure-Man\" Howard was moved to write, \"In every community of whites and blacks, at least in the South, a deep, dark current flows forever, out of sight of the whites who but dimly suspect its existence.  A dark current of colored folks' thoughts, deeds, ambitions and aspirations, like a river flowing unseen through the jungle.\"  In his study of Howard's piney woods stories, Rusty Burke concludes, \"[G]uilt over the oppression of blacks, over deliberately depriving other human beings of the very freedom the white Southerner claims so fiercely as his birthright, over systematically depriving an entire race of their very human dignity, plays an important role in the psychic makeup of the white Southerner.  When Howard portrays the inhabitants of the old plantation house as autocrats and oppressors, when he names the black settlements \"Goshen\" and \"Egypt,\" the Biblical land of oppression and slavery (and calls the white town \"Grimesville\"), when he shows whites fearful of a black uprising, and blacks falling prey to unscrupulous characters who promise liberation, I think he is trying to deal with that guilt.\""

The goal of his expedition is the ancient city of Nebthu, site of a massive sphinx depicting the hyena god of chaos and rumored haunt of Thoth-Amon's Order of the Black Ring. After discovering an entryway inside the sphinx, Conan descends into the depths, reaching a vast chamber where he confronts the massed assembly of wizards. Thoth-Amon and his fellow sorcerers initially prove themselves to be too powerful for Conan. But Conan had taken the precaution of bringing along a magical jewel known as the Heart of Ahriman (which helped Conan regain his throne in The Hour of the Dragon) With the jewel in his hand, Conan's Pictish ally is more than a match for the Stygians. Many of the wizards are killed or driven mad by the Heart's powers, but Thoth-Amon manages to unleash the monstrous hyena of chaos against Conan's accomplice. Unfortunately for him, the hell-hound is incapable of fine discrimination. The first army it encounters, and therefore destroys, is that of Stygia. His sanctum in ruins and now persona non grata in his own country, Thoth-Amon is forced to flee, seeking refuge with his last remaining ally - the King of Zembabwei. Rather than rest content and return to Aquilonia, Conan is determined to settle accounts once and for all and take his army in pursuit to the heart of what would now be called Africa."

        "content": "The topics covered include such matters as blackout, evacuation, rationing and the need for the public to take personal responsibility rather than wait for the government to guide them. The subjects range from very practical and detailed advice ranging from such issues as how pedestrians can avoid being hit by cars in the blackout to quite Utopian and far-reaching schemes for the post-war reconstruction of Britain. The letters also expressed Sayers's displeasure with the appeasement policies of Neville Chamberlain in the previous years, and her doubts about his fitness to lead Britain in war (at the time of writing, it was not yet known that Chamberlain would soon be replaced by Winston Churchill). The papers also attributed to Harriet Vane a reluctance to go on writing murder mysteries at the time when European dictators were committing mass murders openly and with impunity. This seems to have been Sayers's own feeling, as she in  fact abandoned during World War II the writing of murder mysteries and never took it up again. There is a repeated unfavorable opinion of the Soviet Union, in the aftermath of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and the Soviet attack on Finland. The opinion that there was little to choose between communism and fascism, and that the two kinds of dictatorship are equally reprehensible, is given special prominence by being attributed to Lord Peter Wimsey himself. Other characters are shown as expressing the opinion that, even had Britain managed to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union in 1939, the Soviets would have proven an unreliable ally of little military worth, given their army's weak performance in Finland. On this point Sayers' opinion, like that of most other Britons, did not change in 1941. Getting the Soviets on Britain's side was highly welcome, but the lamentable performance and mass surrenders of the Red Army seemed to bear out the negative assessment. It was only in 1942, when the Germans lost an Army at Stalingrad and American supplies started flowing in, that the resiliency and true strength of Russia became apparent. The papers do provide some significant new details about Wimsey's character, in particular the ironic epitaph he writes for himself when setting out for a dangerous mission behind enemy lines: Here lies an anachronism in the vague expectation of eternity. They also show that in addition to his thorough knowledge of the classics of English literature, Wimsey is familiar \u2013 though in fundamental disagreement \u2013 with the works of Karl Marx, and well able to debate with Marxists on their home ground."

        "content": "Tess is a cozy mystery writer who has a speaking engagement at a library in Chicopee, Massachusetts. After the event, the librarian who had invited her, Ramona Norville, tells Tess to avoid Interstate 84. She gives Tess the directions to Stagg Road, a presumably safer shortcut to Tess' home in Connecticut. However, on the shortcut, Tess' Prius rolls over nail-studded pieces of wood which lie across the road, giving her a flat tire. The incident happens by an abandoned Esso gas station. Shortly afterwards, a big man (Tess guesses he's 6' 6\") in a pickup offers to assist Tess and change her tire. At first, the trucker seems to be eager to help, but he soon darkens. Tess realizes that the driver had set out the road hazard as a trap. He knocks Tess out and proceeds to beat her and brutally rape her several times, before finally choking her to unconsciousness. She later wakes up, but feigns death as he stashes her body in a culvert and drives away. After the man has left, Tess escapes, but not before discovering three other murdered women, all victims of the same culprit, dead and in various states of decomposition in the outlet pipe. Tess escapes to try to find some help, but as she walks, she worries that the attack will create a scandal. She realizes that people will say that she was \"asking for it\" and her career or name as an author would be dragged through the mud. She decides that she cannot mentally endure even more trauma, and instead makes her way home without telling anyone about the assault. The next day, while recovering her vehicle at a bar called the Stagger Inn, a place near the abandoned Esso station, Tess speaks with Betsy, who works at the bar. Tess fabricates a story about her injuries and tells Betsy a man helped her. Tess describes the man who helped her but in reality is inquiring about her rapist. Betsy asks \"Was he big, or REAL big?\"  Betsy then tells Tess that a man called \"Big Driver\" matches Tess' description. Tess decides to use the detective skills she acquired while writing her novels to find her rapist, 'Big Driver'. Tess discovers that Big Driver's mother is the librarian Ramona Norville, who had initially given her the directions to Stagg Road, and deduces that Ramona intentionally directed her to the trap laid down by Big Driver. Tess goes to Norville's home and, after confirming that Norville was indeed guilty of intentionally directing Tess into the trap, kills Norville. Tess then finds Big Driver's address and goes to his house. She lies in wait and shoots Big Driver after he arrives home.  It is only after he is dead that Tess determines that the man she just killed, Big Driver, was not the man who raped her. Big Driver was the even larger (6' 9\") older brother of the man who raped her, \"Little Driver\".  Stunned, Tess nevertheless drives to Little Driver's house and kills him too. Unsure of Big Driver's involvement in her rape, and overcome with guilt over possibly having murdered an innocent man, she writes out a confession and prepares to kill herself. At the last moment, however, she decides to go back to Big Driver's house to look for evidence. And, in fact, she finds the purse taken from her the night of the rape, confirming Big Driver's complicity in her rape. Tess comes to terms with her sins and goes home, finally beginning to feel peace."

Politicians, commentators, and activists widely cited the paper in political debates over the effectiveness of austerity in fiscal policy for debt-burdened economies. The paper argues that when \"gross external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP\", a country's annual growth declined by two percent, and \"for levels of external debt in excess of 90 percent\" GDP growth was \"roughly cut in half.\" Appearing in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the evidence for the 90%-debt threshold hypothesis provided support for pro-austerity policies. In 2013, academic critics accused Reinhart and Rogoff of employing methodology that suffered from 3 major errors; they asserted that the underlying data did not support the authors' conclusions. These critics held that the Reinhart\u2013Rogoff paper had led to unjustified adoption of austerity policies for countries with various levels of public debt."

Representative Ryan's \"Path to Prosperity\" reports (Ryan 2013 p. 78): A well-known study completed by economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart confirms this common-sense conclusion. The study found conclusive empirical evidence that gross debt (meaning all debt that a government owes, including debt held in government trust funds) exceeding 90 percent of the economy has a significant negative effect on economic growth. RR have clearly exerted a major influence in recent years on public policy debates over the management of government debt and fiscal policy more broadly. Their findings have provided significant support for the austerity agenda that has been ascendant in Europe and the United States since 2010. Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs, in his address to the International Labour Organization on April 9, 2013, used the Reinhart\u2013Rogoff paper to argue that \"public debt in Europe is expected to stabilise only by 2014 and to do so at above 90% of GDP. Serious empirical research has shown that at such high levels, public debt acts as a permanent drag on growth.\" British Member of Parliament George Osborne (who became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 2010) relied on the paper to portray excess debt as the universal cause of financial crises: \"As Rogoff and Reinhart demonstrate convincingly, all financial crises ultimately have their origins in one thing.\""

        "content": "The paper was published in an annual \"Papers and Proceedings\" edition of The American Economic Review that was not subject to the same peer-review standards that other editions use before publication. Reinhart and Rogoff (RR) did not publish the data sample upon which they based their conclusions, but they made it available upon request to Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin (HAP), who then closely examined the data used in the study. In April 2013, HAP released a critique of the RR data analysis in the working paper \"Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff\", later published in the Cambridge Journal of Economics. They contend that the statistical analyses performed on the data in the original RR Excel spreadsheet (which were used to support the conclusions of the paper) were flawed: \"While using RR's working spreadsheet, we identified coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" Using RR's working spreadsheet, but correcting for the claimed errors, HAP found:When properly calculated, the average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not \u22120.1 percent as published in Reinhart and Rogoff. That is, contrary to RR, average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/GDP ratios are lower. HAP also argued that the sample was biased, claiming that RR selectively omitted data for Australia, Canada, and New Zealand for the early post-World War II period, which showed high growth despite large public debts, while including data for the United States for the same period that showed negative GDP growth, which Herndon attributed to demobilization of U.S. military personnel. Also, by using only one year's data for New Zealand, a negative 7.6% GDP growth in 1951, a year in which New Zealand's trade suffered from a major strike, the average central tendency of the available 5 years (1946\u20131949 and 1951) shifted from 2.6% to \u22127.6%. HAP concluded that the \"combination of the collapse of the empirical result that high public debt is inevitably associated with greatly reduced GDP growth and the weakness of the theoretical mechanism under current conditions... render the Reinhart and Rogoff point close to irrelevant for current public policy debate.\" RR published a lengthy, detailed response to HAP in The New York Times: Herndon, Ash and Pollin accurately point out the coding error that omits several countries from the averages in figure 2. Full stop. HAP are on point.... HAP go on to note some other missing debt data points [New Zealand], which they describe as \"selective omissions.\" This charge, which permeates through their paper, is one we object to in the strongest terms.... Data for New Zealand for the years around WWII had just been incorporated and we had not vetted the comparability and quality data with data for the more recent period.... They argue that we use an \"unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" In particular, for each bucket, we take average growth rates for each country and then take an average of the result. This seems perfectly natural to us, and hardly unconventional. Economics professor L. Randall Wray criticized Reinhart and Rogoff for combining data \"across centuries, exchange rate regimes, public and private debt, and debt denominated in foreign currency as well as domestic currency,\" in addition to \"statistical errors,\" and for lacking a \"theory of sovereign currency\". Other critiques point out that any correspondence between debt levels and insufficient economic growth could just as easily be reversed: it is the weak economic growth that leads to the high debt levels. Others have argued that the relationship between debt and growth varies significantly between countries, meaning that an average \"rule\", such as that suggested by Reinhart and Rogoff, has little meaning or policy relevance. Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote in 2013: What the Reinhart-Rogoff affair shows is the extent to which austerity has been sold on false pretenses. For three years, the turn to austerity has been presented not as a choice but as a necessity. Economic research, austerity advocates insisted, showed that terrible things happen once debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P. But \"economic research\" showed no such thing; a couple of economists made that assertion, while many others disagreed. Policy makers abandoned the unemployed and turned to austerity because they wanted to, not because they had to."

Some arrive more or less by accident, some are forced upon him by Smith, or force themselves in, and it does not take long for him to find himself in a hectic environment where he struggles to live in harmony with his new housemates while dealing with both their constant advances and the dramas of helping them get along in the human world. The situation takes on a new twist after he is told that because of expected changes in the law dealing with human-liminal relationships, he is expected, as a test case, to marry one of the girls, thus increasing their competition for his attention. However, as time passes, other  liminal girls are attracted to him and begin to vie for his attention, much to Kimihito's embarrassment and the annoyance of his housemates."

A song with six or more spins in its first week is awarded an \"airplay add\".

The third reviewer, Jacob Hope Chapman, heavily criticized the show's cheap production for its workmanlike animation clashing with the shoddy CG backgrounds and felt the humor was undone by poor direction and writing. He concluded that there's similar anime with better writing and aesthetics compared to this, saying that, \"There's just not anything unique or intriguing about this one.\" Fellow ANN editor Paul Jensen reviewed the complete anime series in 2016. He commended the spiritual humor, the different interactions both Narumi and Hibiki have with the ghosts and the moments of sweetness and melancholia throughout the various episodic storylines but was critical of the series overall not pushing forward its brand of comedy and drama beyond mildly entertaining and lacked the \"sense of wonder or magic\" humans have when interacting with spirits in their world compared to similar otherworldly series like Mushi-Shi and Flying Witch, concluding that \"On the whole Re-Kan! is an enjoyable show that's worth a look if you've got a taste for lighthearted comedy or the slice of life genre in general.\""

He noticed that by leveling up, he could increase his stats and improve his body and mind, among other things.  The day after noticing that he can also increase his stats through training (he studied to increase his Intelligence), he accidentally slipped into a combat area for those who have a link to the Abyss, the hidden world of their own.  He witnessed a battle between Kwon Si-Yeon and Hwan Seong-Gon, getting involved in it as well.  He was approached by Kwon Si-Yeon, who questioned him on his identity. Han Ji-Han began to realize that he needed to train to be sure that he'll be safe in case he gets caught up in a fight again, so he trains his fighting capability with blunt objects (he uses a baseball bat).  On his way home, he accidentally slips into another combat area, having to fight his way through zombies which he later finds out were amassed souls that Hwan Seong-Gon was collecting.  He then realizes that he needs to talk to his friend, Shin Seon-Il.  Ji-Han assumes that Seon-Il was part of this world due to his level being much higher than everyone else around him, and his assumption proves correct when Seon-Il threatens him, due to him not knowing that Ji-Han has become part of this world. The story goes on, with Han Ji-Han deciding to stay in the world of the abyss, putting him in many dangerous situations as he grows stronger to protect himself and those around him."

On 24 January 1934 the work premiered to great success, lauded by critics and government officials. Lady Macbeth quickly spread to opera houses worldwide, cementing Shostakovich's status as an international celebrity. In the Soviet Union it received instant praise. The newspaper Sovetskoe iskusstvo honored Lady Macbeth as \"a triumph of musical theatre\", while Sovetskaya muzyka called it \"the best Soviet work, the chef-d'oeuvre of Soviet creativity.\" Party officials were likewise pleased, extolling the opera and terming Shostakovich \"a Soviet composer brought up in the best tradition of Soviet culture.\" In 1934 and 1935 the opera was performed several hundred times nationwide."

Nine days prior Stalin had attended another opera, Ivan Dzerzhinsky's The Quiet Don, and had praised it as a model of socialist realism for its lyrical clarity and emotional directness. Lady Macbeth did not make the same impression on the Soviet leader. Shostakovich later wrote to his friend Ivan Sollertinsky that he witnessed Stalin cringing at loud parts of the score and laughing at sexual moments. Displeased, Stalin left after the end of the third act. A frightened Shostakovich was reportedly \"white as a sheet\" when he bowed for the audience.

Leaving no room for doubt about the depth of its deprecation, the editorial regrets that: \"The power of good music to infect the masses has been sacrificed to a petty-bourgeois, 'formalist' attempt to create originality through cheap clowning.

        "content": "The article immediately cast Shostakovich into disgrace. Performances of Lady Macbeth dwindled rapidly until the opera was completely banned. Those who had praised it before were compelled to retract their opinions. The composer lost most of his income and commissions. Many of his colleagues in the arts community sought to dissociate themselves from him, although some, such as Isaac Babel, Abram Lezhnev and Vsevolod Meyerhold spoke out in support of Shostakovich (all three would be shot in the purges). Shostakovich, half-finished with his Fourth Symphony, was in Archangelsk on a concert tour when he read the article in Pravda. Ten days later another scathing editorial appeared in the newspaper, this time about his ballet The Limpid Stream. Named \"Ballet Falsehood\", the piece unleashed more castigation, calling the composer a musical charlatan and a peddler of \"aesthetic formalism\". The ballet's librettist, Adrian Piotrovsky, was arrested and shot the next year. Though shaken by the attacks, Shostakovich continued writing his Fourth Symphony and completed it in April 1936. He booked a premiere for December and distributed the score to the Leningrad Philharmonic for rehearsals, which began in autumn. His friends expressed fear that the authorities would be angered by the work, which is influenced by Gustav Mahler (disliked by the Party) and is structurally unconventional. Late in the year Shostakovich was summoned for a meeting with a representative of the Union of Soviet Composers, who advised him to withdraw the symphony on threat of \"administrative measures\" for noncompliance. The composer submitted to the demands and cancelled the premiere. Shostakovich was formally rehabilitated with the premiere of his Fifth Symphony in November 1937. Encouraged by \"Muddle Instead of Music\" and other slander, he simplified his music to suit the prescriptions of socialist realism. The Fifth was an official success; Party members who had attacked him before acknowledged that he had \"seen his errors\" and improved."

        "content": "It is unknown who wrote \"Muddle Instead of Music\", as it was common for articles detailing an official Party stance to be published anonymously. Scholars have speculated about the piece's authorship. Likely candidates include Zhdanov, at the time Leningrad's Communist Party manager and later Stalin's unofficial culture minister; David Zaslavsky, one of Pravdas senior writers; Boris Reznikov, another Pravda employee; and Platon Kerzhentsev, a party official, playwright and journalist. Rumors spread that Stalin himself had written the article, although this is now thought to be unlikely. However, given Stalin's presence at the January 1936 performance and eyewitness accounts of his dissatisfaction, it is reasonable to assume that he approved of, if not sanctioned, the article."

He is able to talk to the dead people in his graveyard, which often freaks out visitors, especially when the corpses talk or react back. Pierre functions as a spokesperson, servant, aid and trustworthy guard on benefit of the people who are buried there. Many black comedy jokes are about the various ways his customers died or how they spent their daily lives at the graveyard. A running gag is Pierre's rivalry with the proprietor of a crematory and a captain who favors burial at sea. The Grim Reaper is also a recurring character."

Several variants of Cr\u00fcger's melody for the hymn were published in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1666 Johann Georg Ebeling published the hymn with a new melody, Zahn\u00a06456a, under the variant title \"Warum sollt ich mich doch gr\u00e4men\", in Pauli Gerhardi Geistliche Andachten. Also this hymn tune was published in several variants in the 18th and 19th centuries. Other tunes for the hymn, sometimes partly based on Ebeling's setting, were published from the 17th to the 19th century (Zahn 6457\u20136462). Zahn\u00a06462 is the variant Johann Sebastian Bach used in Part III of his Christmas Oratorio, with the 15th stanza of Gerhardt's hymn \"Fr\u00f6hlich soll mein Herze springen\" (\"Ich will dich mit Flei\u00df bewahren\") as text. This version of the melody, a simplification of the Zahn\u00a06461 melody, was first published in 1769 as No.\u00a0143 in the second volume of Bach's four-part chorales published by Birnstiel, and is thus attributed to Bach. \"Warum sollt ich mich denn gr\u00e4men\", BWV\u00a0422, is another four-part chorale harmonisation by Bach of the same tune. Max Reger composed a chorale prelude as No. 43 of his 52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67 in 1902."

It describes a near-future world in which the recently dead can be \"rekindled\" to a new life, but one in which their personalities and attitudes are radically changed; although they possess their memories from their previous lives, their former concerns no longer appear important to them. The story parallels that of Eurydice and Orpheus in the underworld. Originally published in 1974 in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, \"Born with the Dead\" won both the 1975 Nebula Award for Best Novella and the 1975 Locus Award for Best Novella. The story has subsequently been republished many times in collections. Silverberg described writing it as one of his most difficult challenges. With Silverberg's permission, Damien Broderick wrote a 30,000 word sequel, \"Quicken,\" which was published with the original as a composite novel, Beyond the Doors of Death and included by editor Gardner Dozois in his The Year's Best Science Fiction: Thirty-First Annual Collection, 2014."

Korolenko stopped editing the text only after the book's sixth edition came out in 1898. Arguably his most acclaimed and best-known work, The Blind Musician caused controversy in its time and was subjected to severe criticism from the Moscow University's private docent A.M. Shcherbina, who had lost sight at the age of two and considered Korolenko's theories regarding blind people's 'intrinsic longing for light' totally groundless. \"...To create a creditable treatise on blind man's psychology has never been my objective. The idea was, rather, to bring to closer examination man's longing for all things unattainable, for this ever missing fullness of life,\" Korolenko explained in a 10 January 1917 letter to Arkady Gornfeld."

        "content": "Scheffler's poem is in eight stanzas of six lines each, with rhyme scheme ABABCC. The shorter final line accents its content. It is part of a 1657 collection of pastoral religious poetry, Heilige Seelen-Lust Oder geistliche Hirten-Lieder Der in ihren JESUM verliebten Psyche (Holy bliss of the soul, or: spiritual shepherd songs of Psyche who is in love with her Jesus), in which the first person (ich) is the shepherdess and Jesus the shepherd. The original header confirm this: \"Sie verspricht sich jhn bi\u00df in Tod zu lieben\" (She promises herself to love him until her death). The poetry is in the tradition to interpret the Song of Songs as referring to Jesus. The first two stanzas are a confession of love, with seven of its twelve lines beginning \"Ich will dich lieben\". The religious dimension is revealed at the end of the second stanza, referring to \"Gottes Lamm\" (Lamb of God). The first line relates already to Psalm 18:2. The third and fourth stanza refer to the themes of searching for the missed loved one from the Song of Songs. Love is described as \"sp\u00e4t\" (late), following Augustine's Confessiones 10, 27 and 34. It may relate to Scheffler's \"late\" (1653) conversion to the Catholic Church. The fifth to seventh stanzas express thanks for \"Himmelswonne\" (Heavenly bliss), including erotic imagery in the seventh stanza, which is therefore sometimes omitted in hymnals. The final stanza repeats the promise of the first, adding the motif of love for love's sake, without reward."

With this tune, the hymn has been included in several hymnals, such as Christian Friedrich Witt's Neues Cantional and the Evangelisches Gesangbuch, where it is numbered EG\u00a083. Gerhardt's hymn was however also sung to the tune of \"Herr Gott, erh\u00f6re die Gerechtigkeit\", Zahn No.\u00a07669, and several other melodies were composed for the text: Johannes Zahn lists three 17th-century melodies composed for \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" (Nos.\u00a07681\u20137683), three from the 18th century (Nos.\u00a07684\u20137686, the first of which was composed for a reworked version of the text), and two from the 19th century (Nos.\u00a07687\u20137688). The third part of a Passion setting presented in Rudolstadt in 1688 opens with Gerhardt's \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" in the format of an aria, using the \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" melody. Reinhard Keiser was the first composer who used Gerhardt's hymn in a Passion oratorio in Hamburg: his 1711 setting of Johann Ulrich K\u00f6nig's Thr\u00e4nen unter dem Creutze Jesus libretto opens with it. The second part of Johann Friedrich Fasch's setting of the Brockes Passion libretto, composed around 1717\u20131719, opens with a chorale adaptation of \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\". A Passion oratorio performed in Gotha in 1719 contained an aria based on an excerpt of Gerhardt's hymn. In 1720, Gottfried Heinrich St\u00f6lzel composed a meditation of the stations of the Cross as a Passion oratorio which he titled Die leidende und am Creutz sterbende Liebe Jesu (The love of Jesus which suffered and died on the Cross), which is also known by its incipit, Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld. Composed for Gotha, this oratorio knew many repeat performances, some of these in slightly modified versions: the oratorio was for instance performed in Leipzig in 1734 and, in 1736, in Rudolstadt and in N\u00fcrnberg. Three Passions by Georg Philipp Telemann are also known by their incipit Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld: a St\u00a0Mark Passion of 1723, TWV\u00a05:8, a St\u00a0John Passion of 1745, TWV\u00a05:30, and a St\u00a0Matthew Passion of 1766, TWV\u00a05:51. Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld, GWV 1119/24, is a church cantata for the last Sunday before Lent (Estomihi) composed by Christoph Graupner in 1724. Johann Gottfried Walther set \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" for organ. BWV\u00a0267 is Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale harmonisation of Dachstein's hymn tune. Carl Heinrich Graun composed a Passion named after the hymn, Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld, GraunWV B:VII:4, for soloists, choir and orchestra, which has been called Kleine Passion (Little Passion), in comparison to his better-known Der Tod Jesu. Gottfried August Homilius, a Kreuzkantor in Dresden, composed a Passion cantata for soloists, choir and orchestra, HoWV\u00a0I.2, printed by Breitkopf in 1775. Like his St\u00a0Matthew Passion, HoWV\u00a01.3, it starts with the words \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\". Chorale preludes on \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" were composed by Johann Christian Kittel, Gustav Fl\u00fcgel,  and Philipp Wolfrum. Hugo Distler's Der Jahrkreis, Op.\u00a05, contains a SSA setting of \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\"."

However, Raffles is selected to play for the English in the Second Test Match, the first day of which will be the day of the wedding, when her gifts will be vulnerable. Bunny insists on taking the burglary job himself, so that Raffles can be free to serve his country. Raffles is anxious, but Bunny is eager to prove himself. The night of the wedding, Bunny sneaks to the house's garden. He stops to light a cigarette, merely to demonstrate his nerves. As Bunny finishes, a window opens overhead, and a wheezing voice accosts him. Bunny, relying on a story rehearsed with Raffles, pretends that he is from the insurance company. The young man at the window, who is the bride-to-be's asthmatic brother Mr. Medlicott, believes Bunny, and lets him into the house. Bunny follows Medlicott, who struggles to return to a library upstairs. Though Medlicott is ailing, he is kind, and he and Bunny discuss cricket. Bunny begins reluctantly to sympathize with Medlicott, and helps to keep the man's asthma pacified. Suddenly Bunny hears a noise, and looks out the window to see there is a new light from downstairs. When Bunny decides to go downstairs and investigate, Medlicott is impressed and offers his concealed revolver to Bunny, but Bunny prefers to use the life preserver he has brought. Downstairs, Bunny finds and quickly knocks out the burglar, only to realize afterward in anguish and bitterness that it is Raffles in disguise. Medlicott joins Bunny, and Bunny sends Medlicott to fetch the policeman on his beat outside. Raffles rises, and expresses his irritation. Together they escape the house. Raffles changes their clothes using garments he has hidden in some bushes, and they catch a train. Bunny only learns later that Medlicott had been unable to reach the policeman, and eventually had to struggle home. Bunny regrets having wronged both Raffles and Medlicott. Raffles, however, apologizes himself, and explains:  rain had cut the day's cricket short, and he had been so anxious about Bunny that he had come to keep an eye on Bunny. He had followed Bunny the entire time, and had admired Bunny's performance throughout. Moreover, Raffles was able to take some jewellery from the collection of wedding presents."

The episode follows the plot of the original story, with some changes: In the drama, Raffles goes after this house as an act of revenge against young Medlicott's prosperous father, for the sake of the man's orphaned and financially ruined nephew, Spadger, who killed himself after his appeal for help from his rich uncle fell on deaf ears. In the drama, rather than explain all to Bunny in the train afterwards, Raffles sleeps nearly all the way back to the cricket match in Trafford, thereby recovering well enough from Bunny's blow to play well against the Australians the next day.

Bunny visits old friends in order to take photographs of the place and show them to Raffles. Bunny suggests they try for Guillemard's bedroom on the night when Guillemard will celebrate a horse race by hosting a dinner-party. Raffles prepares  himself and his tools for the job, but on the understanding that Bunny will lead. On the night of the dinner-party, Raffles and Bunny meet near the house. They sneak through the garden, and observe that all the house's inhabitants are in the dining room. They use Raffles's rope-ladder to ascend to the balcony of Bunny's old room, and proceed to the main bedroom. Raffles jams the door with wedge and gimlet, and Bunny draws the bolt on the connected dressing-room's outer door. Bunny lowers the rope-ladder from the bedroom window, to prepare a way of escape. Raffles rifles the bedroom, but finds nothing of value. In the dressing-room, Raffles is encouraged by the presence of the door's bolt. While he jimmies open a chest, Bunny wanders back to the bedroom, in time to see the rope-ladder be removed from below. Alarmed, Bunny retreats and tells Raffles. They pocket some jewel cases, and Raffles follows Bunny out the bedroom door. They are spotted by Guillemard and other men climbing the stairs. Raffles and Bunny hurry through the hallway and upstairs, into a room underneath the house's tower. They climb the stepladder and shut the trapdoor, hitting Guillemard. They stand on the trapdoor until Raffles screws it closed with gimlets. Through the tower's one window with a view of the house's roof, they see a man climbing through a skylight. Raffles fires his revolver to scare the man off. With no other course, Raffles shimmies down the perilously thin wire of a lightning rod, and Bunny follows. They descend safely to ground and take shelter in a small boathouse on a tiny lake in the backyard, hoping the place will be overlooked by their pursuers. Soon, however, they realize that their pursuers have inexplicably given up the chase. Wordlessly, Raffles creeps away, but doesn't return. Bunny waits anxiously for hours, until Raffles returns with stolen riding-clothes. They leave, taking a train and several cabs home. At the Albany, after Raffles says that the jewel cases he took were unfortunately empty, Bunny admits that his own were full, but that he left them in the tower out of guilt for robbing his childhood home. Yet Raffles declares that he had seen the house's inhabitants gloating merrily over Bunny's forfeited plunder. Raffles shows the jewelry to Bunny. He promises to relay to Bunny the full story of his second break-in at a Turkish bath."

The Heavenly Realm is home to many powerful gods of various mythologies and legends like the Jade Emperor, Michael the Archangel, and Hercules. At the dawn of time, humans, demons and gods lived together on Earth. The gods allowed the weak humans to borrow their powers, creating the \"Borrowed Power\" system (or \"Charyeok\" in Korean) so they could defend themselves from the demons who wanted to rule over them. Shortly after the demon defeat, the gods split up the humans, demons and gods among the three Realms. Humans are since able to use Borrowed Power freely but are not allowed to attack gods with it."

These two would befriend Mori after their fights with him, and will become teamed together as the Korean Team after the preliminary rounds.

After an exchange at the concession stand, he asks for her number, and they carry on extensive conversations through texts. Margot finds Robert witty and funny through text, and their conversations grow frequent, but he is more awkward and inscrutable when she tries to see him in person. When Margot returns from visiting home for winter break, she and Robert go on a real date: they see a movie, go to a bar (during which Robert learns her age), and then return to Robert's home. Despite being disappointed and uncomfortable during the date, Margot consents to sex with Robert rather than navigate turning him down. After the encounter, which largely disgusts her, Margot learns that Robert is thirty-four years old and reflects that their conversations have been impersonal. Margot resolves to tell Robert she isn't interested in continuing to see him, but ignores his messages while she is unsure of how to do it politely but firmly. She eventually does so abruptly through text at the urging of her roommate. A month later, she sees Robert while out at a bar with her friends; she is unsettled by the idea that he is looking for her and avoids him. That night, he texts her repeatedly, his messages at first complimentary and insecure but becoming more needy and belligerent as Margot does not reply, ending with calling her a \"Whore\"."

The Atlantic notes that \"The depiction of uncomfortable romance in 'Cat Person' seems to resonate with countless women\", and describes it as a \"literary adjunct to the latest #MeToo moment\". Personal reactions have been largely, but not entirely, along gender lines (drawing comparisons to Jane Austen), and for many readers, it captures what it is like to be a woman in her twenties in 2017, including \"the desperate need to be considered polite and nice at all costs\". Following the story's success, Roupenian secured a seven-figure deal with Scout Press for her debut book, and was the subject of a bidding war in the American market, with offers exceeding $1 million. She received a $1.2 million advance for her 2019 book You Know You Want This, an anthology series which includes \"Cat Person\"."

Social media users reacted strongly to Nowicki's allegations. In the words of Elisabeth de Mariaffi, in Maclean's, \"Twitter went wild, with readers struggling to understand how a writer could justify using such real-life details, and writers rallying to defend themselves.\" The Guardian writer Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett described the potential for readers to feel that \"using someone else's story in this way was unethical.\" In a 2021 email reply to Nowicki, Roupenian said she had an \"encounter\" with Charles and that she later found out about Nowicki through social media. Roupenian acknowledged that information she learned from Nowicki's social media served as a \"jumping-off point\" for \"a story that was primarily a work of the imagination, but which also drew on my own personal experiences, both past and present.\" She apologized for not changing particulars such as Nowicki's hometown, stating \"I can absolutely see why the inclusion of those details in the story would cause you significant pain and confusion.\" Nowicki's essay points out salient differences between \"Cat Person\" and her relationship. Elisabeth de Mariaffi notes that \"the entire weight of Cat Person, what made it resonate, was exactly the part that Nowicki says bears no resemblance to the truth.\""

The idea was denied by his editor-in-charge. A year after, after the end of Karma of Purgatory, he discussed with his editor-in-charge what to serialize next.

When later the idea of quadruplets and sextuplets was raised, it was rejected very quickly, around 30 seconds. Haruba said it might be a reference to Super Sentai when he came up with this idea. Similar to Super Sentai, Ichika (yellow), Nino (black), Miku (blue), Yotsuba (green), and Itsuki (red) are all represented by a color. The design of the quintuplets started from his favorite existing female characters from \"some slice-of-life works only with girls\", around 15 to 20 of them. The idea of adding numbers in their names was after the design was almost confirmed. The hair color of the Nakano quintuplets is different when being colored, which was suggested by Haruba himself, such that they are more distinguishable from each other. The hair color of the bride in the flashforward is, therefore, a color-in-between."

It was also decided that all quintuplets would have negative feelings towards Futaro from the beginning, because Haruba wanted to write how their relationships improved from hate to love in the story, except Yotsuba, who acts as Futaro's guide for the development of the story. While it is often the norm for harem romantic comedy manga to have sexualized depictions of characters, Haruba has said that he tried to avoid this to some extent after Vol. 1.  In his opinion, showing panties which are being worn, i.e. panchira, makes characters less mysterious and then less interesting to the readers. To keep the characters interesting, the sexy scenes were intended by him to be ambiguous but not straightforward, leading to readers' imagination. The swimsuit appearance of the Nakanos was finally revealed in Ep. 92 as Haruba thought an episode of swimsuits should exist before finishing the story."

There's nothing revolutionary about it, but it does a lot of basic things well without showing any major flaws, and that's enough to make this premiere good clean (well, clean-ish) fun.\" Patrick Frye of Monsters And Critics noted that there was \"little to no ecchi shenanigans or degrading fan service and the girls move beyond the initial stereotypes and become fleshed-out characters that create a fun dynamic with the main character, Futaro Uesugi. Audiences are tired of watching a lucky everyman stumble his way through unlikely scenarios.

Her father was a wholesaler of chemical products and machine oils. Shortly after the death of her father in 1905, she met painter, puppet-maker and caricaturist Albert Schlopsnies. The son of a Protestant landowner from East Prussia, he studied at the Munich Art Academy with Gabriel von Hackl from 1903. On 15 September 1910 in Frankfurt Franziska married Albert, who was by then employed as a freelancer at Margarete Steiff GmbH, for which he designed catalogs and numerous dolls and stuffed animals. In 1913, Franziska and Albert moved to Munich and settled in the Schwabing district. In May 1915 their daughter Irmgard Erika was born. After World War I, Franziska Schlopsnies began designing posters for fashion shows, department stores and exhibitions. One of her earliest surviving designs was made in 1920 for the Tietz department store. After the couple's divorce on 18 December 1922 she often signed her designs with the name \"Slopsnies\". From the mid-1920s, she preferred to draw figurines and costumes. Along with Doris Buscher, Liliane and Margaret von Suttner she was considered among the most important fashion illustrators. Her Art Deco-inspired fashion drawings and caricatures were regularly published in magazines, such as Jugend, Simplicissimus, Eleganten Welt, Berliner Illustrirten Zeitung, Sport im Bild and the monthly Velhagen & Klasings Monatshefte. For the satirical periodicals Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter and Meggendorfer-Bl\u00e4tter, she designed numerous covers in the second half of the 1920s. After Adolf Hitler's rise to power, she produced no known published drawings. To secure her livelihood and that of her daughter, she rented some rooms in her apartment to students. Both her sisters and her mother succeeded in emigrating, while Franziska could have been at first spared deportation because she was the mother of a daughter who, by the definition of the National Socialists, was a \"Mischling [person of Jewish mixed race] of the first degree\". Regarding the date of her deportation, the record is contradictory. She was deported in 1943 or January 1944 with an unknown destination. On 30 December 1944 Franziska Schlopsnies died in the concentration camp Auschwitz. Her daughter Erika survived World War II and emigrated to the United States in 1946. Today at international auctions Franziska Schlopsnies' graphics and prints reach prices of up to several thousand Euros."

All new hymnals change in the first line \"f\u00fcrchten\" to \"ehren\" to comply with the scheme. The repeated line \"Lobet den Herren\" has the same function as the biblical Hallelujah: both a call to praise, and the praise. Gerhardt uses it for a morning prayer, beginning the day with praise, motivated in stanzas 2 to 5 by thanks for protection from dangers of the night. They may have been inspired by dangers experienced in the Thirty Years' War. Stanzas 6 to 9 are a prayer for further for guidance on a way following divine sommandments, expecting the second coming of Christ (\"deiner Zukunft\"). The last stanza envisions, in an eschatological outlook, the ultimate praise in community with the angels."

Written and produced by Madonna and longtime collaborator Mirwais, the song contains a sample from The Nutcracker (1892) by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and was inspired by the historical figure Joan of Arc. It is an experimental pop and electro-gospel piano ballad, with the use of vocoder on her vocals and lyrics about rebelling against the patriarchy. \"Dark Ballet\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who deemed it a highlight from Madame X, as well as one of Madonna's strangest and most experimental songs. In the United Kingdom, \"Dark Ballet\" peaked at number 83 on the official downloads chart. A music video, directed by director Emmanuel Adjei, was released on June 7, 2019. It features rapper Mykki Blanco playing Joan of Arc.

        "content": "In 2017, Madonna relocated to Lisbon, Portugal seeking a top football academy for her son David, who wanted to become a professional association football player. While living in the city, she began meeting artists, painters and musicians, who would invite her to \"living room sessions\". In these sessions,  they would bring food, sit around the table and musicians would start playing instruments, singing fado and samba music. Finding herself \"connected through music\", the singer decided to create an album; \"I found my tribe [in Lisbon] and a magical world of incredible musicians that reinforced my belief that music across the world is truly all connected and is the soul of the universe\". On April 15, 2019, Madonna revealed Madame X as the album's title. For the album, she worked with longtime collaborator Mirwais, who had previously worked on her albums Music (2000), American Life (2003) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), as well as Mike Dean, who was a producer on Rebel Heart (2015), and Diplo. \"Dark Ballet\" was written and produced by Madonna and Mirwais, and samples Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker (1892). It has been described as an experimental pop and electro-gospel piano ballad, with the vocals making use of a vocoder, and lyrics that address the singer's faith and \"lifelong crusade against the patriarchal forces of religion, gender, and celebrity\". In the opening verse, Madonna sings with \"forceful confidence\" the phrase \"I can dress like a boy/I can dress like a girl\" and, in an ironic tone, how \"our world is obsessed with fame\". Following a piano interlude, it morphs into a \"sinister\" and \"mangled, glitching\" fragment from The Nutcrackers Dance of the Reed Pipes, in which Madonna sings in a heavily edited robotic voice \"I will not denounce the things that I have said/I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord\". This last part, according to AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, evokes Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange. Madonna then utters the phrase \"The storm isn't in the air/it's inside of us\". The song ends with Madonna's daughters Stella and Estere blowing air through their lips, simulating wind. Madonna said the main inspiration of the song was Joan of Arc. During an interview with Rolling Stone, she explained that even after Joan of Arc won the fight against the English, the French were not pleased and \"judged her\". They affirmed she was a man, a lesbian, a witch, and \"burned her at the stake\", despite her being fearless. Madonna concluded, \"I admire that\". \"Dark Ballet\" was released the final promotional single from Madame X on June 7, 2019."

El Hunt from NME said it was \"as villainous and foreboding as Ray of Lights darkest moments\", and compared it to the singer's 2002 single \"Die Another Day\". Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called its lyrical theme \"Kafkaesque\". Also from Slant Magazine, Alexa Camp praised the track for being \"ambitious\", as well as \"a reminder of the wacky magic Madonna and Mirwais are capable of cooking up together\". Varietys Jeremy Helligar deemed it, alongside \"God Control\", as one of the moments in Madame X where \"true weirdness sets in\", and \"the closest Madonna may ever come to her own 'Bohemian Rhapsody'\". Robbie Barnett from the Washington Blade, wrote that it was one of the album's \"standout\" tracks, as well as \"a bold statement of extreme artistic expression\". Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass called it \"a little heavy-handed, but nonetheless mesmerizing\". In a further review, Wass said it was the singer's \"most experimental\" single.  Gay Times Daniel Megarry deemed it \"arguably the most bizarre\" song on Madonna's catalogue, as well as the fifth best song on Madame X. For Nicolas Hautman, from Us Weekly, it's a \"dark, glitchy number\".  The HuffPosts Daniel Welsh said \"Dark Ballet\" was the strangest song on the album, where the singer \"takes the opportunity to let her detractors know that no matter what is thrown at her, she won\u2019t be backing down\". Louise Bruton from The Irish Times, stated that the song is \"an experimental stand against authoritarianism\". Johnny Coleman, from The Hollywood Reporter, noted that Madonna \"does a decent Wendy Carlos impression\" on \"Dark Ballet\". Sean Maunier, from Metro Weekly, called it an \"infectiously weird track\". Jaime Tabberer, from Gay Star News, compared it to Madonna's previous singles \"Human Nature\" (1995) and \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" (2001), as all three songs exude \"the same ferocious attitude\" and touch on the themes of discrimination and sexism. Michael Arceneaux of NBC News called it one of the album's \"oddities\". On a negative review, Rich Juzwiak from Pitchfork said that \"the 808 gloom of 'Dark Ballet' [...] is horrendous\". The Chicago Sun-Times Mark Kennedy wrote that the song \"starts promising enough but drifts into a computer-altered pile of jumbled, pointless slogans\". In the United Kingdom, \"Dark Ballet\" peaked at number 83 on the official downloads chart the week of June 14."

        "content": "The music video for \"Dark Ballet\" was released on June 7, 2019 and was directed by Dutch-Ghanaian director Emmanuel Adjei. It starred American rapper Mykki Blanco playing the role of a transgender Joan of Arc who gets burned at the stake. Madonna met Blanco through producer Mike Dean and became interested in working with her. After contacting her, Blanco flew to London and met her at her home. She had her listen to a finished version of the album and asked her to portray Joan of Arc in the video. Blanco is openly gay and HIV-positive, and Madonna felt she could relate to Joan's struggles; \"if you had existed as you in her time \u2014 you would have been burned at the stake as well\", she told her. According to Blanco, Madonna served as co-director and even worked on choreography, cinematography and costume design, but remained uncredited. On June 5, she shared two previews of the video on her Instagram account: one showed her wearing a veil, intercut with religious iconography, while the other depicted Blanco being burned. The video opens with a quote by Joan of Arc: \"One life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it. But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying\". Told in a nonlinear narrative, it begins with Blanco held captive in a stone cell, she's wearing a dirty white robe with her wrists bound. She's then led by \"stone faced\" clergymen to her execution as she sings along to the lyrics. Blanco is then seen dancing, first in a cathedral wearing a gold corset, similar to the one Madonna wore on her Blond Ambition World Tour (1990), pleading with the men to spare her, and then at an altar. The final shot is of a naked Blanco, her head shaved off, being burned at the stake while a bunch of veiled nuns, one of them Madonna, look from below. The video ends with an \"inspiring\" quote from Blanco: \"I have walked this earth, Black, Queer and HIV positive, but no transgression against me has been as powerful as the hope I hold within\". It received positive reviews from critics. Althea Legaspi from Rolling Stone, called it \"cinematic\". Alexa Camp noted a \"blink-and-you'll-miss-it\" shot from Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1928 film The Passion of Joan of Arc at the very beginning. She also saw similarities to Madonna's 1989 video for \"Like a Prayer\", specifically in the use of religious imagery and the story revolving around a persecuted black person. Camp concluded that by casting a person of color and not herself as \"the oppressed\", Madonna was highlighting \"the disproportionate impact of the patriarchy on minorities\". For Papers Justin Moran \"[Mykki Blanco's] take on Joan of Arc mirrors how his own everyday relishes the in-between\", also pointing out the singer's absence in the video. Mike Wass hailed the video as a \"gothic nightmare\" and \"eerie\". According to CNN's Chloe Melas, the video was \"fresh proof that Madonna has never been afraid to push the limits\". In June 2019, it was named by Billboard as one of \"The 20 Best Music Videos of 2019 (So Far)\"."

It was serialized in Avadh Akhbar between 1878 and 1883 before it was published in four large volumes by the Nawal Kishore Press. The story follows a wandering character named Azad and his companion, Khoji, from the streets of late-nineteenth-century Lucknow to the battlefields of the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878) in Constantinople and Russia. The work's status as a novel has been debated, but it is thought by most scholars to be one of the first novels (or a proto-novel) in Urdu. Sarshar conceived of writing Fasana-e-Azad after the success of the articles he contributed to Avadh Akhbar under the title \"Zarafat\" (\"Wit and Humour\"). Perennially popular, Fasana-e-Azad has been a subject of study by literary critics as the first Urdu novel and for its influence on the literary form's later development. It is noted for its colourful descriptions of Lucknow, its people, and its culture."

        "content": "Sarshar, a teacher in Kheri District of Uttar Pradesh, joined the Nawal Kishore Press (founded by Munshi Nawal Kishore) in Lucknow as an editor of Avadh Akhbar. He wrote a column for the magazine about Lucknow's feudal culture, which inspired him to write Fasana-e-Azad. On 8 August 1878, Sarshar was appointed editor of Avadh Akhbar. His first entry in a series called \"Zarafat\" was published in the 13 August 1878 issue, and the column appeared regularly thereafter. These columns, which eventually made up the first 500 pages of the book, satirize urban life, usually centering on a wandering figure such as Azad or a minor character. This was in keeping with the influence of Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers and Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote on Sarshar. The popularity of Zarafat led Sarsharr to continue the stories and develop them into a narrative called Fasana-e-Azad. In one piece, published on 23 September, Sarshar explained his reasons for writing the series. He said that their intention was to use humour to allow Avadh Akhbar readers to familiarize themselves with a social culture, characterized by proper conversational style and idiomatic fluency suited to a variety of social occasions, which could be used in a variety of social gatherings. Sarshar believed that such an education would improve the country and its people; pleasure in reading humorous articles would encourage refinement and higher thought."

Its theme follows the pattern of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, with Azad modeled on Don Quixote. Azad's faithful friend, Khoji, echoes Sancho Panza. Azad, with no family history, wanders around the city; he encounters all kinds of people and observes Lucknow's changing urban milieu. He has a keen eye for female beauty. Azad meets two sisters and falls in love with Husna Ara, the older sister. Although she loves him too, she sets a condition for their marriage: Azad must go to Turkey and fight with the Turks in their war with the Russians. Azad leaves for Turkey with Khoji, his sidekick, a dwarf with a fondness for opium and delusions about his handsomeness and martial prowess. They have a number of adventures in Turkey and Russia; several noblewomen fall love with Azad, who remains more-or-less true to Husn Ara. Azad, Khoji, and two female European admirers return to India in triumph. Azad marries Husna Ara, and the two European women become social workers. He becomes the father of twins and is well-known and respected, devoting a great deal of time to the propagation of new ideas, education, commerce and industry. When war breaks out against Afghanistan, Azad is asked by the government to aid the war effort. He goes to war, again proving himself a valiant soldier. Azad then returns home and lives a happy, useful life devoted to the advancement of his country. Fasana-e-Azad has a number of sub-plots, including the story of Husna Ara's sister, Sipahr Ara; her lover, prince Humayun Far; and the Shahsawar, his mysterious rival."

        "content": "Study of Fasana-e-Azad began after Sarshar's death with the publication of articles by Brij Narayan Chakbast and Bishan Narayan Dar, two of his contemporaries. Much scholarship has focused on its relationship to the history of the novel. Asaduddin describes the general consensus that \"Critics and writers call Fasana-e Azad a novel but with some reservations.\" Sarshar himself was the first to call Fasana-e-Azad a novel, in 1879. Ralph Russell calls it \"a work which brought permanently into Urdu literature some of the major elements of the modern novel.\" Vaq\u0101r \u02bfAz\u0324\u012bm's textbook on Urdu prose describes it as important in the history of the novel, saying it has had \"a profound impact on our novels\u2019 development, for which all future novelists owe Sarshar a debt of gratitude.\" Dubrow argues that inconsistencies the work's plot and characterization are actually common features of serialized works, which Sarshar intentionally improved to be more novelistic when he revised his columns for book publication. Mohammad Asaduddin highlights the way that Sarshar depicts ordinary life with unembellished language as an important novelistic trait. He also highlights the lack of supernatural elements which would have aligned Fasana-e-Azad more strongly with the genre of d\u0101st\u0101n or romance. Ultimately, however, Asaduddin concludes that Fasana-e-Azad is not a \"novel proper\" because its plot is too unfocused and its characters too unrealistic. Plot and characters, and especially their failure to conform to Victorian standards of literary realism, are common grounds for the assessment that Fasana-e-Azad is not quite a novel. Muhammad Ahsan Farooqi attributed the many uncohesive subplots to Sarshar's \"carelessness\": \"Sarshar had no plan and stuffed in any story wherever he wanted and ended it whenever the mood struck.\" According to Farooqi, the love between Azad and Husn Ara is the only thread running through the work from beginning to end. Bishan Narayan Dar wrote, \"Fasana-e-Azad is not a proper novel, since its plot was not conceived according to any plan. It has neither beginning, nor middle, nor end; rather, it is a collection of unconnected snapshots of the society and culture in which Sarshar lived.\" Chakbast questioned how Azad's character (which he described as a \"uncontrollable, carefree, itinerant, and sometimes even sinful man\") could abruptly become \"so chaste and refined,\" finding the character's development \"against the law of nature.\" Author Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah also called the characters' development inconsistent."

After drinking and eating all of it, the man recounts to his wife a time he and his friend \"robbed\" a bakery ten years ago. The two intended to take all the bread they could from a bakery by force. The man who ran the bakery offers a counterproposal before the two men can act: since he is a Richard Wagner fanatic, if they listen to Tannh\u00e4user and The Flying Dutchman with him in the bakery, he will give them all the bread they can carry. They agree, and the bread is enough to feed the two men for a few days. After hearing of that story, the woman suggests that they do the same thing, despite it being 2:30 A.M. They drive around Tokyo looking for a bakery but all of them are closed; they \"compromise\" to \"rob\" a McDonald's instead. With ski-masks and a Remington automatic shotgun, they enter the restaurant and demand thirty Big Macs. The three employees working there fulfill the peculiar request. The couple then leave the restaurant and drive until they find an empty parking lot; they then eat four to six Big Macs each until they are full. The man feels calm after this experience."

The hymn was first published in Hamburg in 1826 in the collection Christliche, liebliche Lieder by Louise Reichardt, Raumer's sister-in-law, and assigned to the Entry into Jerusalem, which at the time had the same prescribed readings as the first Sunday of Advent.

She finds a fairy-tale she had heard long ago as a child painted across the village. With the help of her friend, she ends up renting a house, filled messily with art and artefacts. She learns that it belongs to an artist named Maara (Madhavan) who is responsible for the paintings across the village. Maara is a free spirit and traveller who is often away visiting various places and returning as he pleases. When she starts cleaning up the place, she finds Maara\u2019s photo and a sketchbook. The sketches depict the previous New Year's Eve when a small-time thief (Alexander Babu) tried to rob Maara. In a turn-of-events, Maara joins the thief, and they both go on the rooftop of a home with a plan to rob the place. There, they see a woman about to shoot herself. The sketchbook ends there, and the story is left unfinished, which piques Paaru\u2019s curiosity about the rest of the story, and Maara as a person. Intrigued, Paaru starts finding the people in Maara\u2019s sketches. Backtracking his steps, she meets an antique dealer, Usman bhai, a \u201cpirate\u201d, Chokku and learns about Selvi (Abhirami), a physically abused woman that Maara had known. Maara and Chokku had taken Selvi out to sea for her birthday where after having an evening that alleviated her sorrows, Selvi committed suicide. Maara then ensures that her daughter, Rani is enrolled into a school. When Paaru gets news that Rani has gone missing from her school, she traces her back to her father\u2019s lodge. Meanwhile Maara, who has returned to the village, tracks Rani down to the lodge and rescues her from her abuser. Paaru gets a glimpse of Maara but just misses an encounter with him. One day, she meets the thief depicted in the sketches and enquires about that day's events. He informs her that Maara stopped the woman from shooting herself, and followed her when she started to run away from him. They find the house and finally identify the woman as Doctor Kani (Sshivada). Paaru then tracks her to a mountain village and enquires about her story. Kani explains that when she performed her first independent operation as a paediatrician, a surgical error led to the death of a 10-year-old girl. Further slandered by the media, she was desperate and about to commit suicide on New Years\u2019 Eve when she was by chance, stopped by Maara. Maara then brings her to his mountain village, maintained by Vellaiya (Moulee), his foster father, and she has since been living there. Vellaiya, a retired postmaster and a hopeless romantic, has been searching for his teenage love Meenakshi for nearly fifty years. Vellaiya constantly tells the story of acting out a play to convey his love to Meenakshi, and eventually losing her when a storm flooded his home village. When Vellaiya shows Paaru a photo of Meenakshi, she notices that she has on the same pendant of a conch as her aunt, Mary, who is a nurse at a convent. She brings her Aunt Mary to the village on Vellaiya\u2019s birthday, realising that the plot of his play is the fairy-tale she had heard as a child from Aunt Mary - a story of an immortal soldier who spends years looking for his beloved mystical fish. An emotional Velliya, who has spent all his adult life travelling from place to place in search of Meenakshi, thanks Paaru for fulfilling Velliya's wish. Paaru, who has chased one story after another in an attempt to find Maara, finally meets him in person. They introduce themselves and hold hands as they watch the sun set."

Selected by the bored god Loki as a target for a magical prank, Mizuki wakes up one morning with breasts and a vagina; the transformation becomes a catalyst for self-discovery and for an exploration of Mizuki's sexuality. While adapting to the change, Mizuki is supported by Takeru Ichimonji, a childhood friend, and Yumeko Fujiwara, a classmate Mizuki has a crush on. The series was well received for its comedy and romance, its art and character design, and its use of transgender themes.

Shueisha has since collected the series in eleven tank\u014dbon volumes, published under the Young Jump Comics imprint. The volumes were also published digitally through Shueisha's mobile app Yanjan. In addition to the original manga, Boku Girl merchandise has been released: A dakimakura pillow featuring Mizuki was produced in 2015, and a Mizuki bish\u014djo figurine in 2016. A light novel spin-off written by Tama and illustrated by Sugito, Boku Girl: Boku no Arbeit, was published by Shueisha on September 18, 2015. A Chinese edition of the manga is published by the Chingwin Publishing Group. The cover artworks for the tank\u014dbon volumes were designed and illustrated by Sugito in collaboration with the Weekly Young Jump editorial department, and use pop design along with illustrations of Mizuki. After going through many design iterations and color variations, the series' cover and logo design were changed starting with volume 6."

        "content": "Boku Girl was well received by critics. Honey's Anime liked the series, calling it amusing and saying that its \"spicy\" scenarios made it \"almost impossible to get bored\" with it. They described it as similar in rhythm and plot development to Akane Ogura's Kanojo ni Naru Hi (2013) and Kanojo ni Naru Hi: Another (2013), recommending fans of either to try the other. They similarly compared it to Tetsuya Hayashi's Mida Love (2016), calling both enjoyable stories about gender not mattering to love. Reviewing Boku Girl up until volume 3, Kono Manga ga Sugoi! praised it for its transgender themes and were excited about it contributing to a wave of transgender manga after series themed around that had long had a hard time finding mainstream success, and hoped that it would become a long-running series. IT Media recommended the series for people who want to try transgender manga, calling it full of charm, with cute portrayals of the protagonist considering the difference between living as a man and as a woman. They praised the series' artwork as cute and appealing, and found both its comedic and romantic elements strong. Boku Girl also performed well commercially, with three volumes debuting on the weekly Japanese top ten manga sales charts. In 2014, Japanese book retailer H\u014drind\u014d Takadanobaba called it one of the more popular manga at the time, with volume 1 selling out on release day; they attributed this in part to the art, story, and cute character design, but also to its theme of feminization, which they described as very popular, with feminization works such as Aya Higuchi's Hatsujo Loop (2014) selling very well. The series was popular among readers regardless of gender, and many tank\u014dbon copies were bought by women. In a feature on the topic, Kono Manga ga Sugoi! noted that Boku Girl seemed to also be part of a trend of manga with gay or gay-adjacent themes being popular."

        "title": "Electoral Count Act_Summary",
        "content": "The Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA) (, later codified at Title 3, Chapter 1) is a United States federal law adding to procedures set out in the Constitution of the United States for the counting of electoral votes following a presidential election. The Act was enacted by Congress in 1887, ten years after the disputed 1876 presidential election, in which several states submitted competing slates of electors and a divided Congress was unable to resolve the deadlock for weeks. Close elections in 1880 and 1884 followed, and again raised the possibility that with no formally established counting procedure in place partisans in Congress might use the counting process to force a desired result. The Act aims to minimize congressional involvement in election disputes, instead placing the primary responsibility to resolve disputes upon the states. The Act sets out procedures and deadlines for the states to follow in resolving disputes, certifying results, and sending the results to Congress. If a state follows these \"safe harbor\" standards and the state's governor properly submits one set of electoral votes, the Act states that that \"final\" determination \"shall govern.\" However, making or use of \"any false writing or document\" in the implementation of this procedure is a felony punishable by 5 years imprisonment by 18 U.S. Code 1001 under Chapter 47 Fraud and False Statements. The Act thus relegates Congress to resolving only a narrow class of disputes, such as if a governor has certified two different slates of electors or if a state fails to certify its results under the Act's procedures. Congress may also reject votes under the Act for other specific defects, such as ministerial error, if an elector or candidate are ineligible for office, or if the electoral college votes were not \"regularly given.\" The central provisions of the law have not been seriously tested in a disputed election. Since the bill was enacted, some have doubted whether the Act can bind a future Congress. Since the Constitution gives Congress the power to set its own procedural rules, it is possible that simple majorities of the House and Senate could set new rules for the joint session. In the contentious 2000 presidential election, the law's timing provisions did play a role in court decisions, such as Bush v. Gore. The law has been criticized since it was enacted, with an early commenter describing it as \"very confused, almost unintelligible.\" Modern commenters have stated that the law \"invites misinterpretation,\" observing that it is \"turgid and repetitious\" and that \"[i]ts central provisions seem contradictory.\" Under the Twelfth Amendment, the Vice President (as President of the Senate) opens the electoral certificates. The Act clarifies the Vice President's limited role in the count. Both houses can overrule the Vice President's decision to include or exclude votes and, under the Act, even if the chambers disagree, the governor's certification, not the Vice President, breaks the tie. On many occasions, the Vice President has had the duty of finalizing his party's defeat, and his own on some of those occasions. Richard Nixon, Walter Mondale, Dan Quayle, Al Gore, Dick Cheney, Joe Biden, and Mike Pence all notably presided over counts that handed them, or their party, a loss. Nixon in 1961 made a ruling allowing late-filed votes against him. In 1969, Hubert Humphrey recused himself from the count. Gore in 2001, Biden in 2017, and Pence in 2021 all rejected many challenges to certifying the results of elections that their party lost."

The electors are \"appointed\" at the national election held on Election Day, which occurs \"on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November.\" After Election Day, the electors chosen in each state must then \"meet and give their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December,\" with meetings of electors typically held in each state capital. The Twelfth Amendment ratified in 1804 requires the electors to \"make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.\" It also specifies, as did the clause in Article II, that \"the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.\" In discussions of the law, the term \"state\" includes the District of Columbia, and the term \"governor\" includes the mayor of the District of Columbia.

The Republican Senate passed four versions of the act, in 1878, 1882, 1884, and 1886, before its enactment. The earlier versions all failed in the House of Representatives which was mainly controlled by Democrats, who had a greater sensitivity toward states' rights. States' rights was a focal point of discussion on the legislation, as there was significant debate over the powers of Congress to determine the validity of electoral votes and set rules for the states. The drafting of the act involved large amounts of passionate debate over many of its provisions. The primary questions debated were the \"relative balance of power between federal and state authority concerning the counting of electoral votes\" and the \"distribution of congressional oversight across... the two chambers... and within the federal judiciary.\" In 1886, the Democratic House passed a version of the act similar to the ones passed by the Senate previously, which was then enacted by a Republican Senate and Democratic House with minor concessions to the Democratic position as \"a compromise measure in an atmosphere relatively free of partisan pressures\" on February 4, 1887. Under the law, while Congress \"claimed full power to validate votes, its role was limited to cases in which a state had failed to settle its own disputes and to questions beyond state competence.\" The act was stewarded through the Senate by George Frisbie Hoar throughout its many versions."

Section 5 (now ) states that \"the President of the Senate shall have power to preserve order; and no debate shall be allowed and no question shall be put by the presiding officer except to either House on a motion to withdraw.\"  Section 6 (now ) states that whenever the two Houses have separated \"to decide upon an objection ... or other question arising in the matter,\" each Senator and Representative may \"speak to such objection or question\" for five minutes, and not more than once.  After the debate has lasted two hours, the presiding officer of each House must \"put the main question without further debate.\" Once the two houses have both voted, \"they shall immediately again meet, and the presiding officer shall then announce the decision of the questions submitted.\" Section 7 (now ) states that the joint session cannot be dissolved \"until the count of electoral votes shall be completed and the result declared.\" No recess can be taken \"unless a question shall have arisen in regard to counting any such votes, or otherwise under [Title 3, Chapter 1],\" in which case either House, acting separately, can recess itself until 10:00 am the next day (Sunday excepted). But if the counting of the electoral votes and the declaration of the result have not been completed before the fifth calendar day after the joint session began, \"no further or other recess shall be taken by either House.\""

However, the sitting vice president is sometimes a candidate for president in the election, is often a candidate for re-election to the vice presidency, and is almost always a partisan with a keen interest in the outcome. Recognizing this, one key purpose of the Electoral Count Act's procedural provisions is \"to drain away as much power as possible from the Senate president, whom the [law] appoints to preside at the joint session when Congress counts the votes.\" As the custodian for papers, the Senate president is required by the Constitution to \"open all the certificates,\" which the Act further describes as \"all the certificates and papers purporting to be certificates.\" In doing so, the goal of the Act \"was to reduce the Senate President's discretionary power as gatekeeper to the absolute minimum....\"  Indeed, in one case from 1889, papers sent as a \"practical joke\" were presented to the joint session. Whether the Senate president can be required to present or not present any particular paper is an open question, but one commentator argues that concurrent action by both houses would settle the matter while disagreement between the houses would see the Senate president's decision upheld. The Electoral Count Act's provisions governing debate and procedure, prescribed to be followed by the Senate president as the presiding officer during the joint session, are unusually specific (see above), with one early commentator describing them as \"exhaustive\" and as good \"as human wit can divine.\"  These provisions \"seem designed to drain as much power as possible away from the Chair and give it to the two houses.\" After the 2000 election, Vice President Al Gore ruled that a number of procedural motions were out of order by extending the Act's formal requirements for substantive objections \u2013 that is, to be presented in writing and signed by both a Representative and a Senator \u2013 to procedural questions.  This suggests that if procedural motions and appeals were made in that manner, they would be allowed and the two houses would have to separate to consider them."

It must be signed by at least one Senator and one member of the House of Representatives before the objection can be received. Once all objections to any vote or paper from a state have been received and read, the Senate withdraws and the two houses consider the objections separately. However, when considering such objections, Section 4 requires that \u2013 assuming \"but one return [from the state] has been received\" \u2013 no electoral votes from electors whose appointment has been \"lawfully certified\" under the ascertainment process (see above) can be rejected. The two houses may only reject a vote or votes if both houses agree that such vote(s) have not been \"regularly given\" by an individual elector or electors. Under the law, Congress may still reject a state's electors if both houses decide to do so, but only when they determine either that the appointment of electors was not \"lawfully certified\" by the governor under the ascertainment process, or that the votes themselves were not \"regularly given\" by the electors. The phrase \"regularly given\" is generally understood as referring to issues regarding an elector's actual vote, rather than whether the elector has been properly appointed. It could include, for example, situations where an elector cast a particular vote because of bribery or corruption, or mistake or fraud. It may also include situations where the elector did not vote in accordance with applicable constitutional and statutory requirements. Notably, this portion of Section 4 applies to all cases where a single return is received, regardless of whether the safe harbor under Section 2 () applies or not.  Since safe harbor determinations are supposed to be \"conclusive,\" there is some tension between the provisions since Section 4 still allows for Congress to reject a state's votes.  One commentator finds the conflict \"more apparent than real,\" arguing that Section 4 only allows for rejection of safe-harbor electoral votes in cases involving \"the electors' post-ascertainment conduct\" and to \"constitutional infirmities in their status as electors or in the votes they cast.\""

If more than one return, or paper purporting to be a return, from a state is received by the president of the Senate, then the only votes to be counted are those that have been \"regularly given\" by those electors (or their validly-appointed successors) who are shown by the \"determination\" mentioned in  (\"safe harbor\") to have been appointed, assuming the determination has been made. If two or more returns from a state can claim the safe harbor, then neither will be counted unless both houses agree to count one of them as the true return supported by state law.  In case the question arises \"which of two or more ... State authorities determining what electors have been appointed, as mentioned in [3 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a05], is the lawful tribunal of such State,\" then votes \"regularly given\" will only be counted from electors that the two houses, acting separately, concurrently decide is supported by \"the decision of such State so authorized by its law.\" This appears to be Congress' response to the problem of dueling state governments that arose during the election of 1876. If there are multiple returns yet none can claim the safe harbor, one return can be counted if both houses agree it complies with state law, and were \"regularly given\" by the electors.  If there has been \"no such determination of the question in the State aforesaid,\" votes will only be counted that the two houses concurrently decide were cast by \"lawful electors appointed in accordance with the laws of the State,\" unless the two Houses, acting separately, concurrently decide \"such votes not to be the lawful votes of the legally appointed electors of such State.\" Read in isolation, it would mean that one return can be counted as the true return if both houses agree it complies with state law, unless both houses further agree the votes themselves were not \"regularly given\" by the electors. However, this critical sentence then follows: \"But if the two Houses shall disagree in respect of the counting of such votes, then ... the votes of the electors whose appointment has been certified by the executive of the State, under the seal thereof, shall be counted.\""

        "content": "Commentators have differed over the interplay between the governor's \"tiebreaker\" sentence and the lengthy 275-word sentence that precedes it. There is broad agreement that the tiebreaker must modify the third scenario of multiple returns where none can claim the safe harbor. However, a possible ambiguity involves the second scenario in which multiple returns do claim the safe harbor: L. Kinvin Wroth, writing in 1960, stated that the tiebreaker only applies to the third scenario, in which there has been no safe harbor determination by state authorities. Thus, in the second scenario where two returns claiming the safe harbor are received, \"[i]f the Houses cannot agree ... no vote from the state in question is counted. This result follows regardless of the governor's action.\" In 2001, a Congressional Research Service report authored by Jack Maskell \"embraced Wroth's view of the statute, citing and quoting Wroth's article extensively.\" Maskell's CRS report also added more arguments based on the legislative history of the Electoral Count Act. For example, Senator George Hoar, who introduced the tiebreaker as a floor amendment, mentions it only in the context of the third scenario where there is no safe harbor determination. Senator Hoar stated that \"if the amendment which I have proposed shall be adopted no case can arise under this bill of rejecting the vote of any State except in the single case of dual State governments,\" seemingly referring to the second scenario above. Hoar said the bill tells a State: \"Appoint your own judicature in your own fashion to determine this question; if you do not do it, we shall assume that you desire that the certificate of your governor shall determine it.\" In contrast, Stephen A. Siegel argues textually that based on punctuation, the tiebreaker provision should be read \"as relating to the entire preceding sentence, not just to the clause after the final semicolon.\" Siegel viewed the main purpose of amendments that led to the tiebreaker being added as being to \"respond to congressmen concerned about the power of one house of Congress to disenfranchise a state when there were multiple returns.\" He reads the legislative history differently, and notes that the conference report states as follows: Siegel also argues that if the two Houses disagree about whether a return claiming the safe harbor has actually satisfied the safe harbor requirements, the Wroth-Maskell reading would prevent them from counting any other return. That is, \"a return that claims (safe harbor) status may not trump all, but it does forestall all,\" which Siegel argues is not what Congress could have intended."

        "content": "These provisions were a reaction to the problem of multiple returns encountered in the 1876 United States presidential election, before the Electoral Count Act was passed. From four states \u2013 Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oregon \u2013 two sets of returns were transmitted to Washington, D.C. Hawaii became a state in 1959. In its first presidential election in 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon won the popular vote by a narrow 141 vote margin: Governor William Quinn certified the Republican electors, and they cast Hawaii's three electoral votes for  Nixon. When the election was challenged in court, the Democratic electors cast three electoral votes for President-elect John F. Kennedy, but cast them later than the safe harbor deadline. A certification for the Democratic votes was issued when a recount resulted in Kennedy being declared winner by 115 votes. When both Democrat and Republican electoral votes from Hawaii were presented for counting, Vice President Nixon graciously, and saying \"without the intent of establishing a precedent\", permitted the Democratic votes for Kennedy to be counted. In 2020, several Republican groups, including some groups of electors slated by the Republican Party and defeated in popular voting, cited the Hawaii precedent and held events naming alternative electors who will be voting for Donald Trump. None of these electors was appointed as an elector by any organ of state government, or certified as electors by their state governors. Moreover, all states except Wisconsin had certified their results by the \"safe harbor\" deadline, which under the Act is \"conclusive.\" None of those certifications have included these alternative electors. Observers, including the conservative National Review, have described these electors as \"extralegal,\" \"bizzaro,\" and \"hav[ing] no actual significance.\""

        "content": "To be elected by the electoral college, the Constitution requires that a candidate receive \"a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed.\" One early virtue of this wording was that if certain states decided not to participate in the election by failing to appoint any electors, a president could still be elected by a majority of those who were appointed. However, when Congress rejects a state's electoral vote, or chooses not to count any of multiple competing returns, \"the effect that decision has on the denominator that determines whether a candidate has more than fifty percent of the electoral vote is an entirely open issue.\". For example, if there are currently 538 total votes, and all votes from a state that appointed 20 electors are rejected, a majority could be either remain as 270 votes out of 538, or be reduced to 260 votes out of 518. Historical precedent is split, and in those previous cases where a state's electors were rejected or considered for rejection (for example, in 1872), it has never determined whether the winning candidate had achieved a majority. \"Perhaps because the diversity of strongly held views might imperil the delicate web of compromises supporting the [Electoral Count Act], Congress avoided addressing the issue in the [Electoral Count Act].\" A future joint session \"might be called upon to address the effect of this situation\" without clear precedents.  While Congress would likely be able to decide the issue by a vote of both houses during a future session, if one house finds that a candidate has achieved a majority and the other house disagrees, the Electoral Count Act provides no default rule nor any path forward. Nor can the Senate president play any role in deciding the matter, since his or her role in delivering results is strictly limited by the Act to receiving the tellers' lists and \"announc[ing] the state of the vote.\". The Senate president does not announce \"the names of persons elected,\" since Congress specifically rejected that option as explained above. If no candidate is determined to have a majority, then the contingent election procedure described in the Twelfth Amendment would be used. The House, voting by states, would elect the president as happened in 1824, and the Senate would elect the vice president as happened in 1836."

The most unlikely events have become the most likely, from highly improbable dice throws to serious infrastructure failure. Some effects are deemed good: massive lottery wins, sports successes, and cancer remissions. Others are not. Multiracial Adele uses prayers for a Christian god as well as African orishas, a selection of herbs, a Saint Christopher medal, and a collection of lucky objects as part of her daily ritual. As she walks to work, she encounters a shuttle train that has jumped the tracks because of a wrench left there (an event with a million to one odds), causing horrible carnage, and stops to help. The news claims New York is a den of iniquity, causing this semi-apocalypse, but Adele is skeptical. Large quantities of missionaries have swarmed the city, and one corners Adele to give her a flyer for a mass prayer throughout the city on August 8 - a lucky day for the Chinese. Princeton has proved that the power of positive thought now has real effect over reality. In a chain of unlikely events, Adele is almost pushed into oncoming traffic on her walk home, but is saved by finding a four-leaf clover, which she plants in her fire escape garden. On her way to the famers' market to barter her vegetables for fruit and news about the mass prayer, Adele gives her neighbor an eggplant. She teaches him how to cook it, and they discuss the prayer event. He is uninterested in prayer, and more noncommittal about the changed state of things. They have sex with protection - crossing fingers while putting the condom on and touching a rabbit's foot. As the multi-denominational prayer event approaches, Adele debates going and considers the significance of belief and accepting change. She takes another flyer, folds it into a paper airplane, puts her Saint Christopher medal in it, and lets it fly until it's out of sight."

In many respects, New York has returned to a more connected, locally-driven time in this story, although the narrative does not moralize it, using a character study approach of Adele to contemplate - somewhat ambivalently - the drawbacks and benefits of the altered world versus normalcy."

Heran Mamo of Billboard wrote that \"the slinky, sensual jam will definitely be a summer playlist staple with its groovy bass line\". Writing for Nylon, Steffanee Wang described the song as \"a mid-tempo pop number with guitar and sticky melodies\". Writing for Teen Vogue, Claire Dodson described the song as \"excellent\" and \"a shimmering ode to kissing [...] with a somewhat melancholy underlying melody that contrasts well with that signature soft-disco Doja beat.\" Anders Hare of Rated R&B wrote that the \"sunkissed, bouncy tune [...] features both musical prowesses sensually crooning about embracing the now with their significant others.\" Doja Cat and SZA's vocals were described as \"smooth\", \"sultry\" and \"evocative\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard praised the duo's delivery and noted that they \"keep their rhymes tight and chorus vocals breathy, but don't mince words\". Both the song and its accompanying music video received all-round praise for its dreaminess and sensuality. Complex ranked \"Kiss Me More\" seventh on its mid-year list of the best songs of 2021 and named it one of the most \"infectious\" songs of the year. Describing it as \"light and uptempo\" and deeming it \"a masterclass in disco-adjacent pop music\", they praised Doja Cat's \"terrific job balancing singing and rapping over a catchy riff\" with her \"snappy flow\" and \"tongue-in-cheek punchlines\". Insider crowned \"Kiss Me More\" the best song on Planet Her and hailed it as \"easily one of the best songs released [in 2021]\" since \"every moment of this song is disarming and brilliant.\" Brandon Yu of Mic deemed it \"the most refined showcase of her many talents thus far\". In an album review for Consequence, Carys Anderson agreed that the song \"sums up every layer of Doja Cat\u2019s complex celebrity\" with its infectious guitar line and chanted refrain, ultimately making it \"a summery summation\" of the \"hyper-feminine, hyper-sexual, hyper-futuristic aesthetic\" of Planet Her."

Emlyn Travis of MTV praised the music video, describing Planet Her as \"a mysterious, flourishing world filled with glittering oases, calming zen gardens, pastel sunset skies, and blossoming cherry trees that is ruled by two larger-than-life queens\". Meaghan Garvey of Billboard noted that the video is \"bathed in pastel hues and high-femme futurism, and while it's over-the-top sexy, it still ends with Doja and SZA cracking each other up while playing a video game in a galaxy far, far away. \" Erica Gonzales of Harper's Bazaar described the video as a \"fantastical\" one that \"only their creative minds could pull off.\" Jem Aswad of Variety deemed it \"trippy\", while Jackson Langford of NME described it as \"sensual sci-fi\".

        "content": "The story involves the voyage of the Flashaway on its journey to start a colony on the planet Robinello, which is estimated to require hundreds of years to complete. In order to ensure that the crew remains on-mission, historian Professor Grimstone is placed in hibernation and periodically revived to provide them with important historical information. During his periodic revivals, Grimstone is dismayed to watch the aging crew and eventually, their descendants, slowly forget not only the mission, but everything about America, Earth, and even Robinello. Grimstone's periodic interventions, which sometimes force him to resort to violence to keep the crew in line, manages to keep the ship on-course for nearly 600 years. The Flashaway arrives at Robinello to find it has already been settled by other colonists who arrived in faster ships."

        "content": "The underlying concept of a generation ship predates \"The Voyage\" by some time. Most notably, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky mentions the idea in his 1928 essay, \"The Future of Earth and Mankind\". \"The Voyage\", however, is widely regarded as the first use of the concept in fiction. It was published only shortly before Robert A. Heinlein's much more famous May 1941 \"Universe\". Both stories are broadly similar, involving a generation ship on which the passengers forget their past and come to see the ship as their original home. Brian Ash suggested that the first fictional treatment of the concept predates Wilcox's story, nothing the appearance of similar concept - but not central to the plot - in Laurence Manning's The Living Galaxy (1934). The story was also the inspiration for A. E. van Vogt's \"Far Centaurus\", via John W. Campbell, which is based on the idea of arriving at a now-populated planet. In this case, the story revolves around four men on a sleeper ship, not a generational ship, who learn that their 500-year trip now only takes three hours."

Board of Election Commissioners of Chicago, 394 U.S. 802 (1969), was a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that an Illinois law that denied absentee ballots to inmates awaiting trial did not violate their constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court declined to apply strict scrutiny, and found that the distinctions drawn by the law were rational. The Court particularly noted that the inmates had not shown they could not vote, but rather only that they could not receive absentee ballots."

        "content": "The plaintiffs in this case, Sam L. McDonald and Andrew Byrd, were inmates awaiting trial in Cook County, Illinois. Illinois law did not allow convicts to vote, but these inmates had not yet been convicted, so in March 1967 they attempted to obtain absentee ballots. Illinois law (specifically Ill.Rev.Stat., c. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 19\u20131 to 19\u20133) allowed four reasons for people to receive absentee ballots: 1) being absent from one's home county \"for any reason whatever\", 2) physical incapacity, with a doctor's affidavit, 3) religious observance on election day, or 4) serving as a poll watcher in another county. The inmates argued that \"physical incapacity\" included their situation, and they even got an affidavit from the warden of the jail to that effect. The Board of Election Commissioners of Chicago denied their applications, saying that the category only included \"medical incapacity\", not \"judicial\" incapacity."

        "content": "McDonald and Byrd sued in federal court in Chicago, arguing that their right to vote under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated. They sought an injunction to force the Board to give them absentee ballots, and the Board sought to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that giving them the ballots would be a crime under Illinois law. According to the plaintiffs' argument, there was no good reason for Illinois to discriminate between those it already gave absentee ballots to - including people who might be in jails in counties other than their home county - while not giving ballots to them. Although a state could choose who it gave absentee ballots to, it could not \"unreasonably and arbitrarily discriminate\". On March 30, the District Court granted a temporary order for the inmates to be given ballots, but after a hearing, they granted summary judgment for the Board on December 11. First, it agreed with the Board's interpretation of the state, restricting \"physical incapacity\" to mean incapacity for medical reasons. Then, considering the constitutional question, it compared the Illinois law to three other cases where state laws about absentee ballot had been upheld. In the 1916 case Straughan v. Meyers, a Missouri law was upheld that granted absentee ballots to people traveling for work (e.g. railroad employees, traveling salesmen), but not others. In the 1936 case Lemons v. Noller, a Kansas law was upheld that granted absentee ballots to those who would be outside the state, even though physically disabled person inside the state could not get one. And in the 1963 case Hallahan v. Mittlebeeler, a Kentucky law was upheld that granted absentee ballots to those absent from their county who were \"in the United States services, or bona fide, full time student[s],\" but not others absent from their county. Finding Illinois's rules to be no more unreasonable than these other examples, the Court ruled in favor of the Board. McDonald and Byrd appealed directly to the Supreme Court."

        "title": "McDonald v. Board of Election Commissioners of Chicago_Majority opinion",
        "content": "A unanimous Supreme Court upheld the decision of the District Court. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Warren first observed that the plaintiffs had two basic challenges to how Illinois had classified voters: first, that the distinction between medical incapacitated persons and the \"judicially\" incapacitated \"bears no reasonable relationship to any legitimate state objective\"; and second, that neither was there any good reason to distinguish between those in pretrial detention in their home county, and those detained elsewhere. Before dealing with these, the Court addressed the implicit argument that, because the right to vote was involved, some level of strict scrutiny was required: Instead, the Court applied the general rule for the constitutionality of a statute, that there must be \"a rational relationship to a legitimate state end.\" From that point of view, Illinois absentee ballot laws were unobjectionable. It was rational, after all, to afford some voting conveniences to those with some medical problems, without granting the same to the whole population; and it was also rational to not want inmates voting for local officials from inside prison walls, where the same officials might have undue influence. The majority noted that the plaintiffs had not attempted to vote by any other means than by absentee ballot, saying that Illinois might well permit them to vote in some other manner."

        "content": "Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights states that \"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\" Unlike the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is no general right to equal treatment, only in the areas covered by the Convention. However, the article covers an open-ended list of prohibited grounds for discrimination and has been expanded over time to include such grounds as sexual orientation. In the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, the interpretation of the article has expanded over time to include indirect discrimination. Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights expands on Article 14 to include a freestanding prohibition of discrimination in \"any right set forth by law\". Introduced in 2000, it has been ratified by 20 of 47 Council of Europe states . In early cases before the European Court of Human Rights the court assumed that for Article 14 to be relevant, a breach of one of the substantive Convention rights had to have occurred. If the court did find a substantive breach, it would not find it necessary to consider Article 14. In the Belgian Linguistic case in 1968, the Belgian government argued that Article 14 was not relevant unless there was a substantive breach. For the first time, the court rejected this argument. Following this case, the court considers that for Article 14 to be considered \"it suffices that the facts of a case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols\". The court focuses on substantive equality rather than formal equality, and therefore it considers affirmative action acceptable in certain circumstances. According to the court's case law, any difference in treatment based on fixed status must be proportional to the justified aims pursued and the margin of appreciation has especially narrowed with regard to different treatment based exclusively on ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. For example, in the 2013 case Vallianatos and Others v. Greece a registered partnership scheme that only recognized different-sex couples was ruled to be a violation of Article 14 because it discriminated against same-sex couples."
